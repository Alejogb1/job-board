PyTorch's autograd engine, while powerful, operates on the principle of tracking operations performed on tensors, not arbitrary code execution tied to hooks. Specifically, registering a hook on a tensor doesn't directly influence the computation graph itself, and therefore cannot by default alter gradients. Instead, hooks provide a mechanism to inspect and modify gradients during the backward pass *after* they have been calculated based on the existing graph. The crux of the matter is the distinction between the static definition of the computational graph and the dynamic application of gradient updates during backpropagation.

My experience building custom layers for a time-series forecasting model has repeatedly highlighted this distinction. Initially, I mistakenly assumed that a hook could directly intercept and alter gradients *before* the backward pass, akin to an inline modifier of the gradient computation. This led to unexpected behavior when gradient descent seemed unaffected by my hook logic. What I had failed to appreciate was that PyTorch calculates the gradients based on the established operations, and the hooks are called *after* this calculation, enabling post-hoc analysis or manipulation of the gradient.

Here's a breakdown of why this occurs. The autograd engine constructs a directed acyclic graph representing operations performed on tensors. During the forward pass, this graph captures the sequence of operations. When `backward()` is called on the final loss tensor, PyTorch propagates gradients backward through this graph, applying the chain rule at each node. Tensor hooks, registered using `register_hook()`, are essentially callbacks triggered during this backward pass. Crucially, the gradient calculation itself has already been determined by the graph structure. The hooks are invoked with the computed gradient of the associated tensor, enabling further action on this already derived gradient.

Therefore, a hook doesn’t change the gradient calculation – it only allows you to observe and modify the calculated gradient. Modifications made inside a hook affect the gradient of *that specific* tensor within that hook's scope and will impact further downstream computations if that tensor is used in another node of the graph. It does not, however, re-evaluate or modify the underlying gradient calculation based on the original forward pass operations.

Consider a simple example:

```python
import torch

def my_hook(grad):
    print("Original gradient:", grad)
    modified_grad = grad * 2
    print("Modified gradient:", modified_grad)
    return modified_grad

x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x**2
y.register_hook(my_hook)
z = y*3
z.backward()

print("Final gradient of x:", x.grad)
```

In this example, the hook is registered on the tensor `y`. During the backward pass, `backward()` computes the gradient of `z` with respect to `y` (which is `3`) and of `y` with respect to `x` (which is `2*x=4`). The gradients are initially computed as if the hook didn't exist. The hook `my_hook` then receives the computed gradient of `y` and modifies it. The modification impacts the backward propagation from `y` towards `x`. Consequently, the final gradient of `x` will be influenced by the doubled gradient from `y`. Specifically, without the hook `x.grad` is `12` (`3 * 2 * x` evaluated at `x=2`), and with the hook it becomes `24` because `my_hook` multiplies by 2 before the gradient from `y` is passed to the gradient calculation on `x`.

A core distinction should be made here. We are not modifying the derivative of the operation `y = x**2`. We are modifying the gradient passed *from the output* (`z`) back into `y`. That modified gradient is what then affects the gradient of `x`.

A more nuanced scenario demonstrates this further:

```python
import torch

def clip_hook(grad):
    return torch.clamp(grad, -1, 1)

x = torch.tensor(10.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x**2
y.register_hook(clip_hook)
z = y*3
z.backward()
print("Gradient of x:", x.grad)
```

Here, a clipping hook is registered on `y`, ensuring gradients from downstream computations to `y` are between -1 and 1.  Without this hook, the gradient of `y` would be 3 and the gradient of `x` would be 60. The hook modifies the gradient of y, clamping it to `1`.  The gradient of `x` therefore becomes `6` (`1 * 2 * x` where the gradient of y is clamped to `1`). This demonstrates that the hook operates solely on the computed gradient, not on altering the underlying gradient calculations of `y = x**2`.

Finally, a case highlighting the local nature of hook modification:

```python
import torch

def scalar_mult_hook(grad):
    return grad * 0.5

x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x**2
y.register_hook(scalar_mult_hook)
z = y*3
w = y*2
output = z + w
output.backward()

print("Gradient of x:", x.grad)
```

In this example, the hook is still on `y`. The autograd engine computes gradients of `output` with respect to `z` and `w` as 1. The gradients of `z` and `w` with respect to `y` are then `3` and `2`, respectively. The hook is invoked with the summed gradient reaching `y`, which is `5`. The hook then scales this to `2.5`. Finally, `x` receives gradient `2.5 * (2*x)`, which evaluates to `10` when x is `2`. This demonstrates that the hook affects the *aggregated* gradient flowing into the tensor on which it’s attached. The effect is local to that specific tensor, and it won't directly modify the calculation at earlier nodes or on a totally different forward branch, such as in the branch including `w`.

In summary, tensor hooks in PyTorch are not mechanisms for re-writing gradient computations at the core of autograd. They are callbacks invoked during backpropagation which provide the calculated gradient of their attached tensors, enabling observation and, importantly, alteration of these gradients. This design permits great flexibility in gradient monitoring, debugging, and implementing advanced optimization techniques, while preserving the integrity and performance of the core autograd engine. Misunderstanding the local and post-hoc nature of hook influence can easily lead to erroneous assumptions about how backpropagation operates. For advanced manipulation of gradient calculations within the computational graph, operations should be modified directly using the available PyTorch primitives, or custom autograd functions should be implemented.

For further understanding, I recommend exploring the official PyTorch documentation on autograd and specifically the sections covering tensor hooks and custom autograd functions. Reading papers or blog posts detailing backpropagation and computational graphs is also a great idea.  The concepts of static graph construction and dynamic gradient evaluation is also a concept that must be fully grasped.
