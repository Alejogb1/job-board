The core challenge in manually sorting a PyTorch MNIST dataset with a batch size of 1 lies not in the sorting algorithm itself, but in the efficient management of data loading and the interaction between the dataset's inherent structure and the desired sorting criteria.  Direct manipulation of the underlying data tensors is inefficient and bypasses PyTorch's optimized data loading mechanisms.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects has highlighted the importance of leveraging PyTorch's DataLoader for this task.  Instead of directly sorting tensors, we should leverage the `sampler` argument of the DataLoader.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The MNIST dataset, provided by PyTorch, is a class inheriting from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.  It provides a method `__getitem__(index)` which retrieves a single data point (image and label).  To sort this dataset, we do not alter the dataset itself, but rather control the order in which data is accessed during training or evaluation. This is achieved by creating a custom sampler that defines the order of indices to be passed to the `__getitem__` method.  This approach maintains the integrity of the original dataset and allows for efficient data loading through PyTorch's optimized DataLoader.  Standard sorting algorithms can be readily implemented within a custom sampler class.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Sorting by Label**

This example demonstrates sorting the MNIST dataset by the label of each image. We create a sampler that orders indices based on the labels provided by the dataset.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, Sampler

class MNIST(Dataset): #Simplified MNIST for brevity
    def __init__(self, data, targets):
        self.data = data
        self.targets = targets

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx], self.targets[idx]

class LabelSampler(Sampler):
    def __init__(self, data_source):
        self.data_source = data_source
        self.sorted_indices = sorted(range(len(self.data_source)), key=lambda i: self.data_source[i][1])

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.sorted_indices)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data_source)

#Dummy data for demonstration
data = torch.randn(1000, 784)
targets = torch.randint(0, 10, (1000,))
mnist_dataset = MNIST(data, targets)

sampler = LabelSampler(mnist_dataset)
dataloader = DataLoader(mnist_dataset, batch_size=1, sampler=sampler)

for data, target in dataloader:
    #Process data in sorted order
    pass
```

This code first defines a simplified MNIST dataset for clarity.  The `LabelSampler` class then sorts the indices based on the labels using the `sorted` function and a `lambda` function as the key.  The `DataLoader` is then initialized with this custom sampler ensuring data is fetched in the sorted order.


**Example 2: Sorting by Pixel Intensity (Average)**

This example illustrates sorting based on a calculated feature: the average pixel intensity of each image.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, Sampler

class AverageIntensitySampler(Sampler):
    def __init__(self, data_source):
        self.data_source = data_source
        self.sorted_indices = sorted(range(len(self.data_source)), key=lambda i: self.data_source[i][0].mean().item())

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.sorted_indices)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data_source)

#Using the same dummy MNIST dataset from Example 1
sampler = AverageIntensitySampler(mnist_dataset)
dataloader = DataLoader(mnist_dataset, batch_size=1, sampler=sampler)

for data, target in dataloader:
    #Process data sorted by average pixel intensity
    pass

```

Here, the `AverageIntensitySampler` calculates the average pixel intensity for each image using `.mean().item()` and sorts the indices accordingly.  This demonstrates sorting by a derived feature rather than a directly available attribute.


**Example 3:  Sorting using a Pre-computed Array**

For scenarios where the sorting criteria are computationally expensive, it's beneficial to pre-compute the sorting keys.  This avoids redundant calculations during sampling.

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, Sampler

# ... (MNIST class from Example 1) ...

# Pre-compute sorting keys (e.g., results of a complex feature extraction)
keys = np.array([complex_feature_extraction(image) for image, label in mnist_dataset])

class PrecomputedSampler(Sampler):
    def __init__(self, data_source, keys):
        self.data_source = data_source
        self.sorted_indices = np.argsort(keys) #numpy's argsort for efficiency

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.sorted_indices)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data_source)

# Placeholder for complex feature extraction
def complex_feature_extraction(image):
    return image.sum().item()  #Replace with your actual feature extraction

sampler = PrecomputedSampler(mnist_dataset, keys)
dataloader = DataLoader(mnist_dataset, batch_size=1, sampler=sampler)

for data, target in dataloader:
    #Process data sorted by pre-computed keys
    pass

```

This approach demonstrates efficiency by pre-computing the sorting keys, `keys`, using a function `complex_feature_extraction`. The `PrecomputedSampler` utilizes `np.argsort` for efficient index sorting.  This is crucial for large datasets where repeatedly computing the sorting keys in the sampler would be computationally expensive.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch's data loading mechanisms, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation on `Dataset`, `DataLoader`, and `Sampler`.  Thorough familiarity with Python's sorting algorithms and NumPy's array manipulation capabilities is essential.  Exploring advanced sampling techniques like weighted random sampling and stratified sampling will further enhance your skills in managing large datasets.  Finally, studying examples of custom samplers in publicly available PyTorch projects can provide valuable insights and practical implementation strategies.
