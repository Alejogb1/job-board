Race conditions in TensorFlow gradient computations, particularly those influenced by control dependencies and occurring at updated points, are a subtle but critical issue stemming from the inherent concurrency of graph execution. In my experience working on a large-scale distributed training system, these conditions manifested as non-deterministic training behavior and subtle, hard-to-diagnose performance anomalies. The core problem arises because control dependencies, while ensuring the correct *order* of operations, don't inherently guarantee atomic execution *within* those operations, or across updates to shared variables, potentially resulting in gradients being calculated based on inconsistent variable states.

Letâ€™s first define our terms. A control dependency in TensorFlow dictates that a specific operation must complete before another one can start. This is achieved through the `tf.control_dependencies` context manager, effectively creating an ordering constraint in the computation graph. Updates to variables in machine learning often occur incrementally during optimization, meaning a variable's state is modified multiple times throughout training. A race condition then arises when multiple operations (in this case, gradient computations or parts of them) attempt to access or modify shared resources (namely, updated variables) concurrently, with the final result depending on which operation wins a race condition to complete its write access. This situation becomes problematic when gradients are calculated based on intermediate variable states, leading to incorrect updates.

The challenge lies specifically at the point of variable *updates*. The variable update itself, often performed by an optimizer, is an atomic operation in the sense that it ensures a consistent write to the variable's memory location. However, the gradient *computation* that *precedes* this update may use variable values that are partially updated. Consider a scenario where multiple gradient calculations are performed in parallel, dependent on an updating variable `x`, and controlled via control dependencies that ensures they run before the optimizer updates variable `x`. If, during the process of the first gradient calculation, `x` is partially updated by another thread or process involved in the gradient accumulation, the gradient computed might be incorrect. The remaining operations can also compute gradients based on this inconsistent state, ultimately jeopardizing the overall learning process.

This problem is not trivially diagnosed, because TensorFlow's graph execution model often hides the underlying concurrency details. We specify the graph, and TensorFlow schedules it for execution across available devices, potentially running parts of it in parallel. Control dependencies ensure the high level ordering but not the individual access control to shared mutable resources such as the variables which are fundamental to gradient computation.

To illustrate this more concretely, consider a simple example using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_race_condition_graph():
  x = tf.Variable(1.0, dtype=tf.float32)
  y = tf.Variable(2.0, dtype=tf.float32)

  # Operation that updates x
  x_update_op = x.assign_add(0.5)

  # Gradient computation with control dependency on x update
  with tf.control_dependencies([x_update_op]):
      loss_grad_wrt_x = tf.gradients(tf.square(x) + tf.square(y), x)[0]


  # Additional gradient computation using a different computation pathway but also dependent on x's updated value
  with tf.control_dependencies([x_update_op]):
      other_grad_wrt_x= tf.gradients(tf.math.multiply(x,y),x)[0]
  
  # Optimizer application (not shown for clarity, we are only interested in the inconsistent gradients)
  
  return x, y, loss_grad_wrt_x,other_grad_wrt_x

# Simulate multiple iterations
for i in range(5):
    x_var,y_var, grad_loss, grad_other = create_race_condition_graph()
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
      grad1,grad2 = sess.run([grad_loss,grad_other])
      print(f"Iteration {i}: Loss Grad={grad1}, Other Grad={grad2}")
```
In this snippet, `x` is updated using `x.assign_add(0.5)`. Both gradient computations, `loss_grad_wrt_x` and `other_grad_wrt_x`, are under control dependency on `x_update_op`. In a concurrent execution context, the gradient calculations might run in parallel after the start of x update operation. The observed gradient value will differ depending on how the variable gets updated and whether the value has been fully written yet or not by `x_update_op`. This shows that the control dependency only dictates the start of these operations with respect to variable updates, not the atomicity of reading the variable in order to perform the gradients operation.

Let's expand on this with another example, this time involving explicit parallel execution with `tf.group` to emphasize the potential for interleaved operations:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_parallel_race_graph():
  x = tf.Variable(1.0, dtype=tf.float32)

  # Update operation
  x_update_op = x.assign_add(0.5)

  # Gradient computations
  with tf.control_dependencies([x_update_op]):
    grad_1 = tf.gradients(tf.square(x), x)[0]

  with tf.control_dependencies([x_update_op]):
    grad_2 = tf.gradients(tf.square(x), x)[0]

  # Parallelize with tf.group (note that this doesn't *guarantee* parallel execution but highly likely)
  parallel_group = tf.group(grad_1, grad_2)
  return x,parallel_group

# Execute the parallel operations several times:
for i in range(5):
    x_var, group_op = create_parallel_race_graph()

    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
      grad_results= sess.run(group_op)

    x_value = sess.run(x_var)
    print(f"Iteration {i}:  Updated x: {x_value}, Gradients = {grad_results}" )

```
Here, two gradients are computed with control dependencies on x update. These two gradients, although computed on the same function, can each read different states of the variable if it gets interleaved during execution. By explicitly grouping the gradient calculation steps, we are forcing them to potentially execute concurrently, making the race conditions even more visible.  Because the variables are not read atomically with respect to all the gradient operation, and the values are in fact dependent on partial or full variable updates, we can observe the inconsistent results.

The problem extends to more complex scenarios, such as distributed training where multiple worker nodes might update the same parameter independently. Consider our final example with asynchronous operations:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import threading

def create_async_graph():
  x = tf.Variable(1.0, dtype=tf.float32)
  y = tf.Variable(2.0, dtype=tf.float32)


  # Update operation
  x_update_op = x.assign_add(0.5)


  # gradient computation 1

  with tf.control_dependencies([x_update_op]):
    grad1 = tf.gradients(tf.square(x) + tf.square(y), x)[0]


  # gradient computation 2

  with tf.control_dependencies([x_update_op]):
        grad2 = tf.gradients(tf.math.multiply(x,y),x)[0]


  return x, y, grad1, grad2

def execute_op_async(sess, x_val, y_val,grad1,grad2, results):
   grad_result1,grad_result2 = sess.run([grad1,grad2])
   results.append((grad_result1,grad_result2))

def simulate_async_gradient():
  x_var,y_var, grad_1, grad_2 = create_async_graph()
  results = []
  threads = []


  with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    for _ in range(5):
       thread = threading.Thread(target=execute_op_async, args=(sess, x_var, y_var,grad_1,grad_2,results))
       threads.append(thread)
       thread.start()

    for thread in threads:
       thread.join()


  for grads in results:
      print (f"Gradient Results = {grads}")


simulate_async_gradient()

```
In this code, we introduce explicit threading to emulate the asynchronous operations of multiple workers updating a shared variable concurrently and calculating gradients based on that variable. Despite the control dependencies, the inconsistent read values can impact the gradient calculations. The actual gradients that are computed will vary depending on when a particular thread calculates its gradient, relative to other threads.

Mitigation of these race conditions typically requires employing techniques beyond simple control dependencies. Options include: (1) *variable locking*: Ensuring exclusive access to a variable during both updates and dependent gradient computations. Tensorflow does not provide a built-in explicit locking mechanism so one would have to implement it. (2) *gradient accumulation*: Collecting gradients locally before performing updates, thus reducing the frequency of variable access contention. (3) *synchronous distributed training*: Aggregating all gradient computations on a single machine before applying variable updates, which while slowing down training, would prevent issues stemming from asynchronous access. (4) *data sharding*: if the variable can be sharded across multiple machines, and gradients can also be computed across those machines with no shared access, then the problem goes away.

For further reading, I suggest researching the following topics: distributed training strategies, techniques for synchronous and asynchronous training, and specific methods for handling variable updates in TensorFlow. Specifically, understanding the nuances of `tf.distribute` strategies is crucial when operating in a distributed environment and `tf.while_loop` when running sequential computation on a TensorFlow graph which can have surprising parallel execution behavior. Exploring papers on distributed training optimization techniques and strategies to achieve scalability can also give a deeper understanding of practical mitigations. In addition to specific frameworks, a good understanding of fundamental concurrency concepts such as atomicity, locking, and critical sections is also helpful.
