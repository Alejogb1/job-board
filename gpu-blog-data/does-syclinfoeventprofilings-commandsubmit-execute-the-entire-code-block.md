The crucial aspect regarding `sycl::info::event_profiling::command_submit`'s behavior with respect to parallel constructs like `sycl::parallel_for` lies in its inherent functionality as a profiling tool, not a code execution controller.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications using SYCL has repeatedly highlighted this distinction.  `command_submit` records the start and end times of a specific command queue submission, encompassing everything within that submission, not selectively choosing portions of the code.  It does *not* delineate between a parallel loop and sequential code preceding or following it within the same submission.

Let me elaborate. The `sycl::queue::submit` function (which implicitly underlies `command_submit` profiling) takes a command group as an argument. This command group represents a collection of operations to be executed on the device.  If you include a `sycl::parallel_for` within a command group submitted via `submit`,  `command_submit` will measure the *entire* duration from the submission of the command group until its completion, including the time spent on the parallel loop and any sequential operations executed as part of that same submission.  Any sequential code before or after the `parallel_for` within the same `submit` call is also included in the measured timeframe.  The profiler only sees the command group as a single unit of work.

This observation frequently misled junior developers on my team.  They initially assumed that `command_submit`'s profiling would isolate the execution time of the `parallel_for` alone.  Correctly utilizing SYCL for performance analysis necessitates understanding this integral detail.  To isolate the `parallel_for`'s execution time accurately, one must employ different techniques, often involving multiple `submit` calls and careful event management.

Here are three code examples illustrating the behavior and methods to isolate specific performance metrics:


**Example 1:  Profiling an entire command group containing a parallel_for loop.**

```cpp
#include <CL/sycl.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  sycl::queue q;

  std::vector<int> data(1024);
  sycl::buffer<int, 1> buf(data.data(), sycl::range<1>(data.size()));

  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  q.submit([&](sycl::handler& h){
    h.parallel_for(sycl::range<1>(1024), [=](sycl::id<1> i){
      //Some computation
      buf[i] = i;
    });
    //Sequential code after parallel for
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) sum += i;
  });
  q.wait();
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

  auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start);
  std::cout << "Total execution time: " << duration.count() << " microseconds" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, `command_submit` (implicitly used through the timing mechanism) will measure the combined time for both the `parallel_for` and the subsequent sequential loop. This is the inherent behaviour;  no part of the `parallel_for` execution is isolated from the sequential code within this single submission.


**Example 2: Using events to isolate parallel_for execution time.**

```cpp
#include <CL/sycl.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  sycl::queue q;
  std::vector<int> data(1024);
  sycl::buffer<int, 1> buf(data.data(), sycl::range<1>(data.size()));

  sycl::event e;
  q.submit([&](sycl::handler& h){
    e = h.parallel_for(sycl::range<1>(1024), [=](sycl::id<1> i){
      buf[i] = i;
    });
  });
  q.wait_and_throw();

  auto start = e.get_profiling_info<sycl::info::event_profiling::command_start>();
  auto end = e.get_profiling_info<sycl::info::event_profiling::command_end>();
  auto duration = end - start;
  std::cout << "Parallel for execution time: " << duration << " nanoseconds" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a more sophisticated approach. By capturing the event `e` associated with the `parallel_for`, we can directly access its start and end times using `get_profiling_info`. This isolates the `parallel_for`'s execution time, independent of any other code within the same or subsequent submissions.


**Example 3: Separating sequential and parallel tasks for clearer profiling.**

```cpp
#include <CL/sycl.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  sycl::queue q;
  std::vector<int> data(1024);
  sycl::buffer<int, 1> buf(data.data(), sycl::range<1>(data.size()));

  sycl::event e1;
  q.submit([&](sycl::handler& h){
    //Sequential code
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) sum += i;
  });
  q.submit([&](sycl::handler& h){
    e1 = h.parallel_for(sycl::range<1>(1024), [=](sycl::id<1> i){
      buf[i] = i;
    });
  });
  q.wait_and_throw();
  auto start = e1.get_profiling_info<sycl::info::event_profiling::command_start>();
  auto end = e1.get_profiling_info<sycl::info::event_profiling::command_end>();
  auto duration = end - start;
  std::cout << "Parallel for execution time: " << duration << " nanoseconds" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Here, the sequential and parallel parts are submitted as separate command groups.  This allows for independent profiling of each, clearly demonstrating that `command_submit` profiles the entire command group, not just specific code blocks within it.


In summary, while `sycl::info::event_profiling::command_submit` reports the total execution time of the entire command group,  precise timing of specific code blocks, including `parallel_for` loops, requires a more nuanced approach using SYCL events and potentially separating code into multiple submission calls, as exemplified in Examples 2 and 3.  Misinterpreting its scope frequently leads to inaccurate performance analysis.
