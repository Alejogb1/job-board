The core issue with shuffling within `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` or its higher-level wrappers like `make_tf_dataset` stems from the interaction between the dataset's internal buffer size and the global random seed.  Inconsistent or unpredictable shuffling arises from insufficient buffering and the lack of deterministic seed management across multiple epochs or parallel processing.  I've encountered this extensively during my work on large-scale image classification projects, leading to irreproducible results and difficulties in debugging.  Properly controlling the shuffling behavior requires careful attention to these two factors.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`make_tf_dataset` (or similar functions creating `tf.data.Dataset` objects) inherently relies on randomization for shuffling.  The default behavior is to shuffle the data in-memory using a buffer of a specified size.  If this buffer is smaller than the dataset, shuffling will be partial and non-deterministic across epochs, leading to the observed "shuffling" discrepancies. Furthermore, if multiple processes or threads access the dataset concurrently without proper synchronization of the random seed, each will independently shuffle the data, resulting in completely different orderings.

To prevent or synchronize shuffling, we must address these two aspects: buffer size and random seed management.  A sufficiently large buffer ensures that a complete shuffle occurs within each epoch.  Managing the random seed guarantees consistent shuffling across multiple epochs and parallel executions.  This involves explicitly setting a seed for both the dataset shuffling and any other random operations within your training or evaluation pipeline.  This guarantees reproducibility and facilitates debugging, crucial for reliable machine learning development.  Without explicit control, the random number generator defaults to a system-dependent seed, leading to the non-deterministic behavior.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Deterministic Shuffling with a Large Buffer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_dataset(data, labels, batch_size, seed=42):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
    dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=len(data), seed=seed, reshuffle_each_iteration=False) # Crucial:  Large buffer, seed, and reshuffle control
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    return dataset

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
labels = tf.constant([0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1])

dataset = create_dataset(data, labels, batch_size=2, seed=42)

for epoch in range(2):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}:")
    for batch in dataset:
        print(batch)
```

This example demonstrates deterministic shuffling by using a buffer size equal to the dataset size.  The `seed` parameter ensures reproducibility across multiple runs.  `reshuffle_each_iteration=False` prevents reshuffling for each epoch; set to `True` for reshuffling in each epoch.  This is crucial for consistent evaluation metrics across epochs.


**Example 2:  Parallel Processing with Seed Synchronization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_parallel_dataset(data, labels, batch_size, num_parallel_calls, seed=42):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
    dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=len(data), seed=seed, reshuffle_each_iteration=False)
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    dataset = dataset.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
    dataset = dataset.interleave(lambda x: tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(x), cycle_length=num_parallel_calls, num_parallel_calls=num_parallel_calls, deterministic=True) # Crucial: deterministic interleave
    return dataset

# Sample data
data = np.random.rand(100, 32, 32, 3) # Example image data
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100) # Example labels

dataset = create_parallel_dataset(data, labels, batch_size=10, num_parallel_calls=4, seed=42)

for epoch in range(2):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}:")
    for batch in dataset:
        print(batch[0].shape) # Verify batch shape
```

This example demonstrates how to handle parallel processing.  The `seed` is consistently used across all parallel calls, guaranteeing the same shuffled order regardless of the number of parallel processes.   The `deterministic=True` flag ensures that the `interleave` operation doesn't introduce further non-determinism.


**Example 3:  Handling datasets larger than memory:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_large_dataset(filepath, batch_size, seed=42):
    dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(filepath) # Assuming TFRecord files
    dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: tf.io.parse_single_example(x, features={'data': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string), 'label': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64)}), num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
    dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: (tf.io.decode_raw(x['data'], tf.float32), x['label']), num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE) # Example data decoding
    dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10000, seed=seed, reshuffle_each_iteration=False) # Large buffer, but still a fraction of a large dataset
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    dataset = dataset.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
    return dataset

# Replace with your actual file path
filepath = "path/to/your/tfrecord/files/*.tfrecord"

dataset = create_large_dataset(filepath, batch_size=32, seed=42)

for epoch in range(2):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}:")
    for batch in dataset:
        print(batch[0].shape) # Verify batch shape

```

This example showcases how to handle datasets that exceed available memory.  While a buffer size matching the entire dataset is impractical, a large buffer (10000 in this example) provides a reasonable approximation of a full shuffle.  The `num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE` setting optimizes the map operation, and  `prefetch` improves performance.  Itâ€™s essential to adjust the buffer size based on available resources and the dataset's size.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data`, specifically the sections detailing `Dataset.shuffle`, `Dataset.interleave`, and `Dataset.prefetch`.  Advanced tutorials on creating efficient data pipelines in TensorFlow.  The official TensorFlow website provides comprehensive guides.  Exploring research papers on large-scale data processing and distributed training will offer further insights.  Understanding random number generation in Python and its interaction with TensorFlow is also beneficial.
