The optimal choice between TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite for mobile app machine learning pipelines hinges primarily on the deployment context and performance requirements.  My experience optimizing numerous mobile applications across diverse platforms – from resource-constrained embedded systems to high-end smartphones – has consistently highlighted this crucial distinction.  TensorFlow provides the breadth and depth for model development and experimentation, while TensorFlow Lite focuses specifically on optimized inference on mobile and embedded devices.  Therefore, the "better" choice is inherently conditional.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow serves as a comprehensive machine learning framework, offering extensive tools for model building, training, and evaluation.  Its flexibility encompasses a wide range of model architectures and training strategies, supporting both eager execution (immediate execution of operations) and graph execution (building a computation graph before execution).  However, its comprehensive nature comes at the cost of increased resource consumption.  The resulting models, while functional on desktops and servers, are often too large and computationally expensive for efficient deployment on mobile devices with limited processing power, memory, and battery life.

TensorFlow Lite, conversely, is designed explicitly for on-device inference.  It's a lightweight runtime optimized for mobile and embedded systems.  It achieves efficiency through model optimization techniques such as quantization (reducing the precision of model weights and activations), pruning (removing less important connections in the network), and model architecture optimization.  These techniques significantly reduce model size and computational demands, resulting in faster inference times and lower power consumption.  However, this focus on optimization necessitates some trade-offs.  The development workflow within TensorFlow Lite is more constrained than with TensorFlow, offering fewer advanced features and customization options during model inference.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: TensorFlow Model Training (Python):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load and pre-process training data (MNIST example)
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.reshape(10000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy:', accuracy)

# Save the model
model.save('mnist_model.h5')
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a basic TensorFlow model training process using Keras.  The model is saved in the HDF5 format, suitable for later conversion to TensorFlow Lite.  This stage happens on a desktop or server with sufficient computational resources.


**Example 2: TensorFlow Lite Model Conversion (Python):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

# Load the TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('mnist_model.h5')

# Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Save the TensorFlow Lite model
with open('mnist_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(tflite_model)

```

*Commentary:* This code snippet utilizes the `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter` to transform the previously trained TensorFlow model into a TensorFlow Lite compatible format.  The `convert()` method performs the necessary optimizations, resulting in a smaller and more efficient model for mobile deployment.  Further optimization flags can be added to the converter for enhanced performance.  This process generally requires a desktop environment.


**Example 3: TensorFlow Lite Model Inference (Java):**

```java
// ... (Import necessary TensorFlow Lite libraries) ...

// Load the TensorFlow Lite model
Interpreter tflite = new Interpreter(loadModelFile("mnist_model.tflite"));

// Allocate tensors
tflite.allocateTensors();

// Get input and output tensor indices
int inputIndex = tflite.getInputIndex();
int outputIndex = tflite.getOutputIndex();

// Prepare input data (example: image data preprocessed to match training data)
float[] inputData = preprocessImageData(image);

// Run inference
tflite.run(inputData, outputData);

// Process output data
float[] probabilities = outputData;
// ... (Extract prediction from probabilities) ...
```

*Commentary:* This Java code illustrates the inference process using the TensorFlow Lite Interpreter. The model (`mnist_model.tflite`) is loaded, tensors are allocated, and inference is executed using the `run` method.  The preprocessed image data is fed as input, and the output probabilities are then analyzed to determine the model's prediction.  This code would reside within the Android application itself.  Note that error handling and resource management have been omitted for brevity.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite, I recommend consulting the official documentation provided by Google.  Exploring TensorFlow's tutorials on model building and the TensorFlow Lite documentation on model conversion and mobile integration will provide a strong foundation.  Additionally, studying advanced optimization techniques specific to TensorFlow Lite, including quantization and pruning, will be highly beneficial for achieving optimal performance on mobile devices.  Finally, investigating example projects and code repositories showcasing best practices in TensorFlow Lite integration within mobile applications will enhance practical knowledge and assist in troubleshooting deployment issues.
