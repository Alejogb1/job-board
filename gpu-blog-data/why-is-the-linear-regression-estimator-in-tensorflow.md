The issue of unexpectedly high or low loss values in TensorFlow's linear regression implementation often stems from data scaling discrepancies, particularly when features exhibit vastly different magnitudes.  Over many years of working with TensorFlow for predictive modeling, I've encountered this problem repeatedly.  Incorrect loss values rarely indicate a fundamental flaw in the TensorFlow implementation itself; rather, they point towards preprocessing or architectural choices within the model.  Understanding this is key to effective debugging.


1. **Clear Explanation:**

Linear regression aims to minimize the sum of squared errors between predicted and actual values.  The loss function, typically Mean Squared Error (MSE), quantifies this error.  However, if your features have dramatically different scales (e.g., one feature ranges from 0 to 1, while another ranges from 0 to 1000), the gradient descent optimization algorithm used by TensorFlow will struggle to converge efficiently.  Features with larger magnitudes will disproportionately influence the loss calculation and gradient updates, leading to slow convergence and potentially incorrect loss values appearing significantly higher or lower than anticipated.  The algorithm might get stuck in a local minimum, or simply fail to find the global minimum due to the skewed gradients.  Furthermore, the learning rate hyperparameter plays a crucial role; an improperly chosen learning rate can exacerbate this problem, causing oscillations and preventing convergence to a reasonable loss value.


2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Unscaled Data Leading to High Loss**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Unscaled data: Notice the vast difference in scales between x1 and x2
x1 = np.random.rand(100)
x2 = np.random.rand(100) * 1000
y = 2*x1 + 3*x2 + np.random.normal(0, 10, 100)

X = np.stack((x1, x2), axis=1)
y = np.array(y)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(2,))
])

model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=1000, verbose=0)

print(model.evaluate(X, y, verbose=0))
```

This example demonstrates a scenario where the significant difference in scales between `x1` and `x2` hinders the optimization process.  The large values in `x2` dominate the loss calculation, slowing down learning and potentially resulting in a higher-than-expected MSE.  The `sgd` (Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizer, while simple, is particularly susceptible to scaling issues.

**Example 2: Data Scaling with Standardization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Data as before
x1 = np.random.rand(100)
x2 = np.random.rand(100) * 1000
y = 2*x1 + 3*x2 + np.random.normal(0, 10, 100)

X = np.stack((x1, x2), axis=1)
y = np.array(y)

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(2,))
])

model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_scaled, y, epochs=1000, verbose=0)

print(model.evaluate(X_scaled, y, verbose=0))
```

Here, `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn standardizes the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature. This ensures all features have a similar scale, significantly improving the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm and leading to a more accurate loss value.

**Example 3:  Impact of Learning Rate**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Data as before, already scaled
x1 = np.random.rand(100)
x2 = np.random.rand(100) * 1000
y = 2*x1 + 3*x2 + np.random.normal(0, 10, 100)
X = np.stack((x1, x2), axis=1)
y = np.array(y)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(2,))
])

# Experiment with different learning rates
learning_rates = [0.01, 0.1, 1.0]
for lr in learning_rates:
    model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=lr), loss='mse')
    model.fit(X_scaled, y, epochs=1000, verbose=0)
    print(f"Loss with learning rate {lr}: {model.evaluate(X_scaled, y, verbose=0)}")

```
This example highlights the sensitivity of gradient descent to the learning rate.  A learning rate that is too high can lead to oscillations and prevent convergence, resulting in seemingly incorrect loss values.  Conversely, a learning rate that is too low can cause the training to be excessively slow.  Experimentation with different learning rates is crucial, especially when dealing with potentially complex loss landscapes.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest reviewing the TensorFlow documentation thoroughly, paying close attention to the sections on model building, optimization algorithms, and hyperparameter tuning.  Explore the literature on data preprocessing techniques, specifically focusing on feature scaling methods like standardization and normalization.  A comprehensive textbook on machine learning fundamentals would also be highly beneficial, covering topics such as gradient descent and loss functions in detail.  Finally, dedicated resources on debugging machine learning models, which frequently touch upon common pitfalls like the scaling issue addressed here, should prove invaluable.
