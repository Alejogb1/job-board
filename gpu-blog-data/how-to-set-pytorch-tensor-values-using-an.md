In my experience building custom neural network layers, I've frequently encountered the need to manipulate PyTorch tensors using index tensors. This operation, crucial for tasks like selective updates or gathering specific elements, often involves directly modifying tensor values based on the indices provided in another tensor. Incorrect implementation, however, can easily lead to unexpected results due to the nuances of how PyTorch manages memory and indexing. The correct approach centers around understanding advanced indexing, and specifically how PyTorch interprets index tensors when assigning values.

A tensor can be modified at specific locations using another tensor containing integer indices. This index tensor’s shape must be compatible with the target tensor's dimensions. The compatibility requirement dictates that for assignment to work, either the index tensor's shape must be broadcastable to the target tensor, or have the same shape as the target's desired modification area. When both these are not the case, PyTorch raises an error. In essence, the index tensor acts as a map that points to the specific tensor locations being targeted for modification. The assignment will replace the original tensor's values at these indicated locations with the values specified on the right hand side of the assignment.

Let’s dissect this process with some concrete examples:

**Example 1: Basic Index Assignment**

Consider a scenario where I am preparing data for a sequence model. I've already padded my sequences, but need to set an "end of sequence" token in each sequence according to their actual lengths. Here's how I achieve it:

```python
import torch

# Simulating padded sequences, 3 sequences of max length 5
padded_sequences = torch.zeros(3, 5, dtype=torch.int64)  # Initialized with zeros
sequence_lengths = torch.tensor([3, 4, 2], dtype=torch.int64) # Length of each sequence
end_of_sequence_token = torch.tensor(99, dtype=torch.int64)  # Token indicating end of sequence

# Create row indices
row_indices = torch.arange(0, padded_sequences.size(0), dtype=torch.int64)

# Create column indices based on sequence length
col_indices = sequence_lengths - 1

# Combine row and column indices to create the index tensor
index_tensor = torch.stack([row_indices, col_indices], dim=0)

# Use the index tensor to set end-of-sequence tokens
padded_sequences[index_tensor[0], index_tensor[1]] = end_of_sequence_token


print("Padded Sequences with EOS token:\n", padded_sequences)

```

In this example, `padded_sequences` is a 2D tensor representing multiple sequences. `sequence_lengths` stores the actual length of each sequence.  I initialize `row_indices` which are simply the row numbers of `padded_sequences`, and calculate the index of the last valid element using the sequence length stored in `col_indices`. The critical step is creating the `index_tensor` using `torch.stack`. This tensor has shape (2, 3), with rows representing the row and column indices respectively.  `padded_sequences[index_tensor[0], index_tensor[1]] = end_of_sequence_token` leverages advanced indexing where `index_tensor[0]` acts as the row indices, and `index_tensor[1]` as the column indices, accessing the location at row x, and column y. The end-of-sequence token is then assigned at the specific indices. This avoids loops, leading to performance improvements, especially with large batch sizes.

**Example 2: Modifying a Tensor with Multi-Dimensional Indices**

During a reinforcement learning project, I found myself working with a 3D tensor, representing different agent states across various environments and a time dimension.  The task required selective modification of a tensor based on a set of indices that were not contiguous.  This process could not be handled by slicing alone:

```python
import torch

# Example 3D tensor: environments x agents x time
data_tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)

# Example index tensor
indices = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 0], # environment index
                        [1, 2, 0], # agent index
                        [3, 1, 2]]) # time index

# Value to assign
new_values = torch.tensor([10.0, 20.0, 30.0])

data_tensor[indices[0], indices[1], indices[2]] = new_values

print("Modified data tensor:\n", data_tensor)
```

Here, `data_tensor` represents the environment, agent, and time dimensions. The `indices` tensor indicates the specific locations in `data_tensor` that we want to modify. Each column of `indices` specifies a coordinate in the `data_tensor`. For instance, the first column (0, 1, 3) targets the element at `data_tensor[0, 1, 3]`.  By using `data_tensor[indices[0], indices[1], indices[2]]`, I access the desired locations in the tensor using the indices and assign them with the corresponding values in `new_values`. This method generalizes to n-dimensional tensors.

**Example 3: Modifying an Entire Dimension**

In a project involving image segmentation, I needed to mask certain regions of the output based on segmentation masks computed by a different module. Rather than applying the mask by element-wise multiplication, I need to replace the values with zeros in the masked regions:

```python
import torch

# Example batch of feature maps (batch x channels x height x width)
feature_maps = torch.randn(4, 3, 64, 64)

# Example binary mask (batch x height x width)
mask = torch.randint(0, 2, (4, 64, 64), dtype=torch.bool)  # 1 represents areas to mask

# Create channel index tensor
channel_indices = torch.arange(0, feature_maps.size(1), dtype=torch.int64) # Index all channels

# Get the positions where the mask is true
indices = torch.nonzero(mask, as_tuple=True)

#Expand the positions into 4D coordinates to index all channels,
batch_indices = indices[0]
height_indices = indices[1]
width_indices = indices[2]


num_masks = batch_indices.size(0)

channel_indices = channel_indices.repeat(num_masks,1)
batch_indices = batch_indices.repeat(feature_maps.size(1), 1).transpose(0,1).flatten()
height_indices = height_indices.repeat(feature_maps.size(1), 1).transpose(0,1).flatten()
width_indices = width_indices.repeat(feature_maps.size(1), 1).transpose(0,1).flatten()
channel_indices = channel_indices.flatten()


# Create the final index tensor
index_tensor = torch.stack([batch_indices, channel_indices, height_indices, width_indices], dim=0)

# Set masked areas to zero
feature_maps[index_tensor[0], index_tensor[1], index_tensor[2], index_tensor[3]] = 0

print("Modified feature map:\n", feature_maps)
```

In this example, `feature_maps` holds the output from one module, and `mask` contains a segmentation mask. The operation requires selecting all the `feature_maps` elements,  corresponding to a '1' in the mask, and setting them to `0`. Using `torch.nonzero(mask, as_tuple=True)`, I retrieve the indices where the mask is true. These indices must be expanded to index the entire channel dimension. Thus the indices for the batch, height, and width dimension are broadcast to each channel. The operation `feature_maps[index_tensor[0], index_tensor[1], index_tensor[2], index_tensor[3]]` then zeroes out the selected regions. This is far more efficient compared to looping through each mask and element.

**Key Considerations**

*   **Data Types:** Ensure that the index tensors are of integer type (`torch.int64` or `torch.int32`). Otherwise, PyTorch will raise a type error.
*   **In-place Operations:** Direct assignment operations are performed in-place, modifying the original tensor. If the original tensor needs to be preserved, use `tensor.clone()` prior to indexing.
*   **Performance:** Avoid using loops. Leveraging index tensors is much more efficient, especially when working with large tensors. Advanced indexing operations are highly optimized by PyTorch.
*   **Broadcasting:** PyTorch will attempt to broadcast the shapes. For instance, if you have a 2D index tensor indexing a 3D tensor, the non indexed dimensions of the 3D tensor need to be broadcastable to the value being assigned.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a more comprehensive understanding, I would suggest consulting PyTorch's official documentation on indexing, which provides a complete explanation of how indexing works along with detailed examples. Furthermore, exploring community tutorials, specifically those related to advanced indexing and tensor manipulation, can provide additional practical insights. Finally, reading research papers that implement similar techniques, can demonstrate these concepts in practical applications.
