PyTorch's `ModuleList` does not directly expose the parameters of its contained modules unless those modules are individually accessed.  This stems from its design as a sequential container, prioritizing order and management over direct parameter access at the container level.  My experience optimizing large-scale generative models has repeatedly highlighted this distinction, leading to debugging sessions where I've had to explicitly iterate through the list to access individual module parameters.

1. **Explanation:**

The `ModuleList` in PyTorch serves as an ordered list of `nn.Module` instances.  Unlike `nn.Sequential`, which implicitly connects modules in a feed-forward fashion, `ModuleList` provides no inherent functional connections between its components.  Consequently, parameter access is not provided at the list level.  The `ModuleList` itself is not a `nn.Module`, and therefore doesn't have parameters in the same way that a convolutional layer or a recurrent cell does.  Instead, it only manages the contained modules.  Therefore, accessing parameters requires retrieving the individual modules from the list and then accessing their parameters using standard PyTorch methods.  Attempting to directly access parameters via the `ModuleList` will raise an `AttributeError`.

The core issue arises from PyTorch's object-oriented design.  Each `nn.Module` maintains its own parameters, registered internally.  `ModuleList` acts solely as a container; it doesn't aggregate or inherit these parameters. This decoupling ensures modularity and flexibility but necessitates explicit access for parameter manipulation.  This differs from other containers, such as dictionaries, where accessing elements grants access to their internal attributes.  The fundamental principle here is that the container's purpose is organization, not parameter aggregation.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Parameter Access:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(10, 5), nn.Linear(5, 2)])

    def forward(self, x):
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x)
        return x

model = MyModel()
for i, layer in enumerate(model.layers):
    print(f"Layer {i+1} parameters: {layer.parameters()}")
    for param in layer.parameters():
        print(param.shape)
```

This example demonstrates the proper way to access parameters.  The code iterates through the `ModuleList` (`model.layers`), retrieving each `nn.Linear` module individually. The `parameters()` method then yields the parameters of each layer, which are iterated over to print the shape of each tensor.  This approach is crucial for tasks such as weight initialization, gradient manipulation, or parameter saving/loading.

**Example 2: Incorrect Parameter Access Attempt:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(10, 5), nn.Linear(5, 2)])

model = MyModel()
try:
    print(model.layers.parameters())
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This example showcases the error that occurs when attempting to access parameters directly through the `ModuleList`.  The `AttributeError` clearly indicates that `ModuleList` does not possess a `parameters()` attribute, as it's not a `nn.Module` itself.  This is the fundamental limitation that necessitates the approach shown in Example 1.

**Example 3: Parameter Access for Optimization:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(10, 5), nn.Linear(5, 2)])

model = MyModel()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) #this works correctly because model.parameters() aggregates all submodule parameters

# Access and modify individual layer parameters
for layer in model.layers:
    with torch.no_grad():
        layer.weight.fill_(0.1) # Fill weights of specific layers

optimizer.step() # Optimizer acts on all parameters, including the modified ones

```

This example demonstrates how to access and modify parameters within the modules held by the `ModuleList` in the context of optimization.  Crucially, `model.parameters()` within the optimizer correctly gathers all parameters from the sub-modules.  This illustrates a practical application. The direct modification of weights before the optimizer step allows targeted manipulation of individual layers' parameters during training or post-training analysis.

3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on `nn.Module`, `nn.ModuleList`, and the `parameters()` method.  Additionally, a comprehensive textbook on deep learning, focusing on PyTorch implementation details, would prove valuable.  A well-structured tutorial specifically on PyTorch's model organization and parameter management would greatly benefit understanding this topic.  Finally, referring to relevant research papers focusing on the optimization of deep learning models, specifically those employing complex architectural designs, is highly advisable. This will provide deeper insights into best practices related to parameter management in complex networks, expanding beyond simple examples.
