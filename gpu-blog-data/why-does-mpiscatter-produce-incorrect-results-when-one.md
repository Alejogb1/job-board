The root cause of incorrect results when using `MPI_Scatter` to distribute an array index, rather than data, across MPI processes stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the function's intended purpose.  `MPI_Scatter` is designed for distributing contiguous blocks of data from a single root process to all other processes.  Attempting to use it for broadcasting a single scalar value, such as an array index, leads to data corruption and inconsistent results due to the underlying mechanism of data transfer.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale simulations, specifically involving particle distribution across distributed memory systems, has highlighted this critical point.

**1.  Explanation**

`MPI_Scatter` operates by partitioning a contiguous data buffer on the root process into equal-sized chunks and sending each chunk to a corresponding process. The receiving processes receive their designated chunk into a pre-allocated buffer.  The crucial element often overlooked is that the *send buffer* on the root process must be a contiguous block of memory of size `count * datatype * number_of_processes`. This is where the problem arises when attempting to send a single array index.  While a single integer can be considered a contiguous block of memory, the size interpretation within `MPI_Scatter` expects the total size to be consistent with a distribution of data blocks, not a single element replicated across processes.

When you provide a single array index as the send buffer, `MPI_Scatter` attempts to partition this single value according to the specified `count` and `datatype`. The result is not a meaningful distribution of the index. Each process receives a portion of the memory location representing the index, potentially leading to garbage values or a seemingly random subset of bits from the original index. This is compounded by the `root` process not receiving any meaningful data either, given the distribution logic. The `recvcount` on each rank should match, but the type of data might not, resulting in a misinterpretation of the received message.

Therefore, using `MPI_Scatter` in this context is inherently flawed.  The correct approach requires a different MPI collective communication function tailored for broadcasting a single value to all processes.  `MPI_Bcast` is the most suitable alternative in such a scenario.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate the problem and its solution with MPI code examples using C.


**Example 1: Incorrect Use of `MPI_Scatter`**

```c
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int rank, size;
    int index = 10; // Array index to be distributed
    int received_index;

    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

    if (rank == 0) {
        // Incorrect: Attempting to scatter a single index using MPI_Scatter
        MPI_Scatter(&index, 1, MPI_INT, &received_index, 1, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
        printf("Rank 0: index = %d, received_index = %d\n", index, received_index);
    } else {
        MPI_Scatter(&index, 1, MPI_INT, &received_index, 1, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
        printf("Rank %d: received_index = %d\n", rank, received_index);
    }

    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the incorrect usage. The `MPI_Scatter` call is misused; even though it might compile and run, the received values on non-root processes will almost certainly be incorrect or inconsistent.  Root process's `received_index` will not be 10 either, unless size is 1.

**Example 2: Correct Use of `MPI_Bcast`**

```c
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int rank, size;
    int index = 10; // Array index to be distributed
    int received_index;

    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

    // Correct: Using MPI_Bcast to broadcast the index
    MPI_Bcast(&index, 1, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
    received_index = index;
    printf("Rank %d: received_index = %d\n", rank, received_index);

    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

This code showcases the proper way to distribute a single index using `MPI_Bcast`. `MPI_Bcast` efficiently broadcasts the index from the root process (rank 0) to all other processes, ensuring that all processes have the same, correct index value.

**Example 3:  Handling Data Distribution After Broadcasting the Index**

This example demonstrates how to combine `MPI_Bcast` for index distribution and `MPI_Scatter` for actual data distribution.  This is typical in scenarios where an index determines the starting point within a larger array.

```c
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int rank, size;
    int index = 10; // Starting index in a larger array
    int received_index;
    int *data, *local_data;
    int array_size = 100; // Size of the larger array
    int local_size;

    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

    local_size = array_size / size;

    // Allocate local data buffer
    local_data = (int *)malloc(local_size * sizeof(int));

    // Allocate global data only on root process
    if (rank == 0) {
        data = (int *)malloc(array_size * sizeof(int));
        for(int i = 0; i < array_size; i++) data[i] = i;
    }

    // Broadcast the starting index
    MPI_Bcast(&index, 1, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

    // Scatter the data
    if(rank == 0){
      MPI_Scatter(data + index, local_size, MPI_INT, local_data, local_size, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
    } else {
      MPI_Scatter(NULL, local_size, MPI_INT, local_data, local_size, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
    }

    printf("Rank %d: received index = %d, local data: ", rank, index);
    for(int i = 0; i < local_size; i++) printf("%d ", local_data[i]);
    printf("\n");

    // Free allocated memory
    free(local_data);
    if (rank == 0) free(data);

    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

This improved example correctly uses `MPI_Bcast` for the index and then uses `MPI_Scatter` appropriately for the actual data.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

The MPI standard itself is the primary resource, focusing on its specification.  A well-written introduction to MPI programming, covering collective communication functions, is invaluable.  Finally, a comprehensive guide on parallel programming concepts will enhance understanding of the underlying principles.  Consult these resources to solidify your understanding of MPI and parallel programming best practices.
