TensorFlow version discrepancies between the installed environment and what's reported within a Jupyter Notebook are often rooted in Python's virtual environment management and the notebook kernel configuration.  I’ve encountered this specific situation numerous times while deploying machine learning models across different platforms, and it usually boils down to the notebook using a kernel that's connected to a different Python environment than the one where the intended TensorFlow version is installed. This disconnect arises because Jupyter Notebook kernels are not implicitly linked to the currently active environment in your shell; instead, they connect to specific Python environments that are registered with Jupyter.

The core issue stems from the concept of isolating Python project dependencies. Python environments, created through tools like `venv` or `conda`, allow projects to maintain their own versions of libraries, preventing conflicts when different projects require different versions of the same package, such as TensorFlow.  When you install TensorFlow 2.8 using pip or conda in one particular environment, it does *not* automatically become available in all other Python environments on your system or to Jupyter kernels. You might be activating a specific environment where TensorFlow 2.8 is correctly installed through your shell’s environment activation mechanism and then launching a Jupyter Notebook. However, when you launch your notebook, the assigned kernel is most probably linked to a different, older Python installation that only has access to TensorFlow 2.3.

Jupyter Notebooks, by default, use the system’s default Python installation as their kernel if no specific kernel is chosen or registered. This default Python installation might contain an older version of TensorFlow or perhaps none at all. Furthermore, when creating or activating environments, especially those created through conda, a separate kernel specification is required to reflect the use of these unique environments. This lack of synchronization between the current shell session and the notebook kernel's context is the primary source of version confusion. Essentially, while you’re *running* commands in the activated environment with TensorFlow 2.8, your notebook kernel is *executing* code in a separate Python environment altogether, which explains why the notebook reports a different, earlier, version.

Here are three code examples illustrating the discrepancy, potential fixes, and how to check your Jupyter kernel’s associated Python environment:

**Example 1: Demonstrating the Version Discrepancy**

This first example demonstrates the version discrepancy. It assumes that you have TensorFlow 2.8 installed in the activated environment in your terminal but, that the notebook, by default, connects to a different environment.

```python
# Code cell within the Jupyter Notebook
import tensorflow as tf

print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
# Output in the Jupyter Notebook: TensorFlow version: 2.3.x (or similar earlier version)

# In your terminal, after activating the correct environment with TensorFlow 2.8
# Run: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
# Output: 2.8.x
```
Here, we see the version discrepancy between the terminal where the correct environment with TensorFlow 2.8 is active, and the output within the notebook that states an earlier version (2.3 in this case).  This highlights the disconnect between the shell session and the notebook environment, meaning the notebook kernel was not using the intended environment.

**Example 2: Correcting the Kernel Using `ipykernel`**

This example shows how to create a new kernel associated with the active environment, which will resolve the discrepancy.  We will assume the environment is named ‘myenv’. This method allows explicit registration of new kernels with their own Python paths.

```bash
# First, ensure the correct environment is active in the terminal:
# Example with conda:
conda activate myenv

# Example with venv:
source myenv/bin/activate

# Then install ipykernel in the active environment:
pip install ipykernel

# Create a new kernel using the active environment
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name="Python (myenv)"

# Now, from within the notebook, select the new kernel “Python (myenv)”.
# Check TensorFlow version within the notebook:
# In a new cell:
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)

# Output: 2.8.x (or version matching the active environment)
```

This demonstrates the use of `ipykernel` to create a Jupyter kernel, `myenv`, tied to the Python path of our activated environment.  By selecting the newly created kernel from the Jupyter notebook's interface, the notebook starts using the correct environment and accesses the intended TensorFlow version.  This is a more robust approach than relying on the default Python installation for Jupyter kernels.

**Example 3: Checking Current Kernel and Environment**

It's crucial to verify the Python environment that your Jupyter kernel is currently using. This example provides a simple way to reveal the Python path and its related information within the notebook.

```python
# Code cell within the Jupyter Notebook
import sys
import os

print(f"Python executable: {sys.executable}")
print(f"Python path: {sys.path}")
print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")

# The output will reveal the Python path used by the active kernel
# and should match the intended python path of your environment with
# TensorFlow 2.8

# if it displays a python path that is not intended, use the method in Example 2 to correct
```

Here, the output from the `sys.executable` reveals the actual Python interpreter that the kernel is linked to, and the `sys.path` lists directories that Python searches for modules, which would include the site-packages directory of the correct virtual environment that contains TensorFlow 2.8. Inspecting these helps directly diagnose which python environment is running inside the notebook.  The current working directory can also be helpful when tracking package locations. If the path output does not reflect the environment you expect to be using, then it confirms the problem in the initial scenario.

For further understanding and troubleshooting related to Python environment management and Jupyter kernels, I recommend the following resources. Consult the official documentation for the specific package manager you use (`pip`, `conda`, etc.) to grasp their nuanced environment creation and activation methodologies. The Jupyter documentation provides comprehensive information regarding kernel management and configurations. Also, the documentation for `ipykernel`, specifically its installation guide and usage patterns, is also beneficial. These resources offer an in-depth look at the mechanisms behind environment management, package dependencies, and the relationship between Jupyter kernels and Python environments.  Understanding these concepts is crucial for avoiding version discrepancies and maintaining robust machine learning project setups.
