Determining TensorFlow/Keras GPU compatibility hinges primarily on CUDA toolkit version compatibility, not solely the GPU model itself.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous projects, including a large-scale image recognition system and a real-time object detection pipeline, highlights this crucial distinction.  While a newer GPU *might* offer better performance,  the absence of a compatible CUDA version will render even the most powerful hardware unusable with older TensorFlow/Keras installations.

**1. Clear Explanation of Compatibility Factors:**

TensorFlow and Keras, particularly older versions, rely on CUDA for GPU acceleration.  CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model.  Each TensorFlow/Keras version is compiled against a specific CUDA toolkit version. This means that if your TensorFlow installation targets CUDA 10.0, your system *must* have CUDA 10.0 (or a compatible, potentially earlier, version, but not a later one) installed and correctly configured.  Attempting to use a TensorFlow version compiled for CUDA 10.0 with a system containing only CUDA 11.x will result in errors, often cryptic ones related to library mismatches or driver issues.

Furthermore, the NVIDIA driver version plays a supporting, though crucial, role. The driver acts as an interface between the operating system and the GPU.  An outdated or incompatible driver, even with a correctly installed CUDA toolkit, can prevent TensorFlow from utilizing the GPU effectively or at all.  Finally, the GPU architecture itself (e.g., Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal, Ampere) influences compatibility indirectly. Older architectures may lack support for features utilized by more recent TensorFlow versions.  However, the CUDA toolkit version remains the primary determinant.

Therefore, verifying the CUDA toolkit version associated with your specific TensorFlow/Keras installation is paramount.  Determining this can be done by inspecting the TensorFlow/Keras installation directory for CUDA-related libraries (usually found in subdirectories related to the installation path). Alternatively, running a short Python script (as demonstrated below) can provide this information indirectly.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Checking CUDA Availability and Version (Indirect Method):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

if tf.test.is_built_with_cuda():
    print("TensorFlow is built with CUDA support.")
    print("CUDA is available:", tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))
    try:
        # This is an indirect method.  Details may vary slightly depending on TensorFlow version.
        cuda_version_string = tf.__version__.split('+')[1].split('-')[0].split('.')[0]
        print(f"TensorFlow likely built against CUDA version {cuda_version_string}") #Approximation, not guaranteed
    except IndexError:
      print("Could not automatically determine CUDA version from TensorFlow version string. Check installation details manually")
else:
    print("TensorFlow is not built with CUDA support.")

```

This script first checks if TensorFlow was built with CUDA support. If so, it lists available GPUs and attempts to extract the CUDA version from the TensorFlow version string (this is an indirect approach and might not work for all TensorFlow versions; manual inspection of the installation directory is a more reliable method).  The `try-except` block handles cases where the version string doesn't adhere to the expected format.  The output informs the user about CUDA availability and provides an (approximate) version number.

**Example 2: Manual CUDA Version Check (Linux):**

This approach requires access to the command line and assumes you're running on a Linux-based system.  Adaptations are necessary for other operating systems.

```bash
nvcc --version
```

This simple command line invocation displays the version of the NVIDIA CUDA compiler, `nvcc`.  This directly indicates the CUDA toolkit version installed on your system.

**Example 3:  Verifying Driver Version (Linux):**

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

The `nvidia-smi` command provides information about your NVIDIA driver and GPU.  The output shows the driver version, which must be compatible with your CUDA toolkit version.  Inconsistencies between the driver and CUDA toolkit versions can lead to compatibility issues.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

1.  Consult the official NVIDIA CUDA documentation. This resource contains comprehensive information on CUDA toolkit versions, compatibility, and installation instructions.

2.  Refer to the release notes for your specific TensorFlow/Keras version. This documentation often explicitly states the CUDA toolkit version requirements.

3.  Review the TensorFlow installation guide.  This guide details the prerequisites for GPU acceleration, including CUDA and driver version requirements.


In conclusion, establishing TensorFlow/Keras GPU compatibility requires a multifaceted approach focusing primarily on CUDA toolkit version alignment with your TensorFlow installation. While GPU model and driver versions are significant, they are secondary to ensuring the CUDA toolkit version matches the expectations of your specific TensorFlow/Keras version.  The provided code examples and recommended resources should enable you to determine the relevant versions on your system and accurately assess compatibility.  Remember to thoroughly read the relevant documentation;  the specifics may vary slightly across operating systems and TensorFlow versions.  Through careful analysis of these factors, you can ensure seamless GPU acceleration with your older TensorFlow/Keras environment.
