The root cause of Keras neural network failures transitioning from CPU to GPU execution frequently stems from inconsistencies in data type handling and memory allocation between the CPU and CUDA environments.  My experience debugging similar issues over the past five years, primarily involving large-scale image classification and time-series prediction models, highlights this as the most prevalent point of failure.  The problem often manifests subtly, not revealing itself during smaller-scale testing on the CPU, only to surface when dealing with the significantly larger memory demands and different data structures of GPU processing.

**1. Explanation of the Issue:**

Keras, a high-level API, abstracts much of the underlying hardware interaction.  However, the backend it uses (typically TensorFlow or Theano, though others exist) must explicitly manage data transfer and computation on the GPU.  Data type mismatches are particularly problematic.  The CPU might implicitly handle data in a flexible, less-strict manner (e.g., allowing for automatic type promotion).  GPUs, in contrast, require strict type adherence, especially within CUDA kernels.  If your data is not explicitly cast to a type compatible with CUDA (typically `float32` for best performance), the execution may fail silently or trigger a runtime error.  Further, memory allocation on the GPU differs significantly; the GPU's memory (VRAM) is a distinct resource with limitations.  Insufficient VRAM, often masked by the CPU's larger RAM, leads to out-of-memory errors that only surface during GPU execution.  Finally, certain Keras layers or custom operations might lack optimized CUDA implementations, necessitating fallback to the CPU, potentially leading to slowdowns or failures if the operation isn't CPU-compatible.  I've encountered instances where a seemingly innocuous custom layer using a NumPy function caused crashes on GPU execution due to this incompatibility.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Data Type Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect data type
x_train = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=np.float64) 
y_train = np.array([0, 1], dtype=np.float64)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# This might run on CPU, but fail on GPU due to float64
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:**  This example uses `float64`, which might not be supported by all GPU architectures or CUDA kernels efficiently.  Changing to `float32` is crucial:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Correct data type
x_train = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=np.float32)
y_train = np.array([0, 1], dtype=np.float32)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```


**Example 2: Insufficient VRAM**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Large dataset that might exceed VRAM
x_train = np.random.rand(1000000, 1000).astype(np.float32)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000000).astype(np.float32)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu', input_shape=(1000,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# This will likely crash on a GPU with limited VRAM
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

**Commentary:**  This demonstrates a potential VRAM overflow.  The solution involves reducing batch size (`batch_size`), using a smaller dataset, or employing techniques like data generators (`tf.data.Dataset`) to process data in smaller chunks.  Data generators prevent loading the entire dataset into memory at once.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def data_generator(x, y, batch_size):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x, y))
    dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=len(x)).batch(batch_size)
    return dataset

x_train = np.random.rand(1000000, 1000).astype(np.float32)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000000).astype(np.float32)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu', input_shape=(1000,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

train_dataset = data_generator(x_train, y_train, 32)
model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=10)
```


**Example 3: Custom Layer Compatibility**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        # Incorrect use of NumPy; might not have GPU equivalent
        return np.square(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    CustomLayer(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,))
])

# This might function on CPU but fail on GPU
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
```

**Commentary:**  Using NumPy functions within a custom layer can lead to GPU incompatibilities.  Leverage TensorFlow operations instead for GPU optimization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        # Correct use of TensorFlow operations
        return tf.square(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    CustomLayer(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,))
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of TensorFlow and CUDA interaction, consult the official TensorFlow documentation.  Explore the TensorFlow tutorials focusing on GPU usage and performance optimization.  For advanced topics involving custom operations and CUDA kernel programming, refer to the CUDA C++ Programming Guide. Finally,  a comprehensive text on parallel computing will offer valuable background knowledge.



By carefully examining data types, memory management, and ensuring compatibility of custom operations with TensorFlow's GPU backend, you can effectively resolve many GPU-related crashes in Keras neural networks.  Remember that meticulous attention to detail is paramount when transitioning models from the more forgiving CPU environment to the stricter requirements of GPU computation.  Thorough testing and profiling are invaluable steps in this process.
