The fundamental misconception underlying the question of whether convolutional or fully connected layers operate on the channel dimension lies in a misunderstanding of their inherent operational mechanisms.  While neither layer explicitly *targets* the channel dimension as a primary axis of operation in the same way they do spatial dimensions, both implicitly interact with it.  This interaction, however, differs significantly, stemming from the distinct architectural characteristics of each layer type. My experience working on high-resolution image classification and video processing projects has consistently highlighted the nuances of this interaction.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Convolutional layers operate by applying learnable filters (kernels) to spatially local regions of an input feature map.  The key here is that these filters operate across *all* channels simultaneously.  A single filter has a depth equal to the number of input channels.  Each element within the filter interacts with the corresponding channel element at the current spatial location.  The output of this interaction, across all channels, is then summed and becomes a single element in the output feature map. Therefore, the channel dimension isn't processed independently; it's inherently integrated into the filter's operation. The spatial dimensions (height and width) determine the receptive field, while the channel dimension determines the filter's depth, dictating the number of input channels it considers at each spatial location.

Fully connected layers, on the other hand, perform a weighted sum of all inputs. In the context of a convolutional neural network (CNN), the input to a fully connected layer is typically a flattened representation of the output from the convolutional layers. This flattening process essentially merges all spatial and channel dimensions into a single, long vector.  Each neuron in the fully connected layer then receives input from every element in this vector, effectively considering all spatial locations and all channels.  While it doesn't explicitly operate *on* the channel dimension, the information from each channel is implicitly part of its calculation.  The weights of the fully connected layer learn to aggregate information from all channels, effectively learning correlations across the entire input feature representation.

Thus, neither layer directly "operates" on the channel dimension in isolation, but both fundamentally incorporate channel information in their computations. The distinction lies in *how* they incorporate this information: convolutional layers do so locally and spatially in a parallel manner; fully connected layers do so globally after a flattening operation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Convolutional Layer (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a convolutional layer
conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)

# Input tensor (Batch, Channel, Height, Width)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)

# Perform convolution
output_tensor = conv_layer(input_tensor)

# Print output shape
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 16, 32, 32])

# Commentary:
# The convolutional layer processes 3 input channels (RGB), producing 16 output channels.
# Each of the 16 output channels is a result of applying a 3x3 kernel across all 3 input channels.
# The 'in_channels' argument explicitly defines the number of input channels the layer operates on.
```

This example clearly shows how the `in_channels` argument defines the number of input channels processed by the convolutional kernel.  The kernel itself implicitly operates on each channel simultaneously, generating a single output element for each location.  The `out_channels` parameter determines the number of independent filters, resulting in the specified number of output channels.

**Example 2:  Channel-wise Convolution (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a channel-wise convolution using 1x1 kernels
channel_wise_conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=1)

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)
output_tensor = channel_wise_conv(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 16, 32, 32])

# Commentary:
# 1x1 convolution can be interpreted as a channel-wise linear transformation.
# Each output channel is a linear combination of the input channels, computed independently at each spatial location.
```

This demonstrates a specific application where the spatial information remains unchanged while performing transformations across channels. This is often used for dimensionality reduction or feature transformations within a CNN architecture. Note that this is still a convolution operation, not a fully connected layer operation on the flattened channel data.


**Example 3: Fully Connected Layer (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a fully connected layer
fc_layer = nn.Linear(in_features=128 * 7 * 7, out_features=10) #Example: flattening 128 channels, 7x7 spatial

# Example input (Batch, Channel, Height, Width) after convolution
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 128, 7, 7)

# Flatten the input
flattened_input = input_tensor.view(1, -1)

# Perform fully connected operation
output_tensor = fc_layer(flattened_input)

# Print output shape
print(output_tensor.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([1, 10])

# Commentary:
# The fully connected layer operates on a flattened representation of the convolutional output.
# The 'in_features' argument determines the total number of input features (channels x height x width after flattening).
# Channel information is implicitly included in the flattened input vector.
```

This illustrates how a fully connected layer necessitates flattening the convolutional output. The channel information is not treated separately; it becomes an integral part of the high-dimensional input vector. The weights of the fully connected layer learn to combine the information from all channels and spatial locations.
