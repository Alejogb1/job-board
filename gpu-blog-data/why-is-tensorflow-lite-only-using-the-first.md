TensorFlow Lite's consistent selection of the first label from `labelmap.txt`, despite seemingly correct model output, often stems from a mismatch in indexing between the model's prediction output and the label mapping process within the interpreter or post-processing logic. I've debugged this specific issue across several embedded vision projects and it usually points to a failure to correctly align the numerical class IDs output by the model with their corresponding text labels.

The core of the problem lies not in the model itself (assuming it is trained correctly), nor in the basic mechanics of TensorFlow Lite inference. The issue arises during the translation of the model’s output – a numerical prediction, usually an array of probabilities or logits - into a human-readable category. The `labelmap.txt` file provides a list of strings, each intended to correspond to a specific numerical output ID from the model. This correspondence is critical; a slight misalignment here will lead to the interpreter always picking the same, incorrect label.

To fully understand the issue, we need to consider how these class IDs are typically handled. During training, models are taught to output numerical representations of the classes they are intended to recognize. These representations are usually zero-indexed. For example, a model classifying images into three categories ("cat", "dog", "bird") might internally assign IDs 0, 1, and 2 respectively. The `labelmap.txt` file, which should follow this same numerical order, should then contain these labels on separate lines, in the same order:

```
cat
dog
bird
```

The TensorFlow Lite interpreter, or the post-processing code, needs to take the model's predicted class ID (e.g., the index of the highest probability or logit) and use it to retrieve the corresponding string from this `labelmap.txt` file. If the interpreter, or your custom post-processing code, doesn’t correctly use this index to access the `labelmap.txt`, it will default to reading only the first line, explaining the consistent selection of only the first label.

Let's delve into a few common scenarios where this mis-indexing can manifest, along with practical code examples.

**Scenario 1: Incorrect Accessing of `labelmap.txt` within a Loop**

Consider a scenario where the interpretation is occurring within a loop, but the loop counter is not aligned with the model's class IDs. Perhaps the code uses a loop iterator starting at ‘1’ instead of ‘0’, or employs a different value when reading the labelmap, instead of the model output index.

```python
# Incorrect Example
def interpret_model_output(output_tensor, label_file):
    with open(label_file, 'r') as f:
        labels = f.read().splitlines()

    predicted_class = np.argmax(output_tensor) # Get the numerical ID with highest value

    # Incorrect - Accesses the label by using the same number every time
    # This will always fetch the first label in the file
    predicted_label = labels[0]
    return predicted_label

# Assume output_tensor is the result from the TFLite model inference (numpy array)
output_tensor = [0.1, 0.8, 0.05, 0.05] # For class 1
label_file = "labelmap.txt"
result = interpret_model_output(output_tensor, label_file)

print(f"Predicted Label: {result}") # Always prints label from labelmap index '0'
```

In this example, the `interpret_model_output` function correctly determines the model’s output, however, it erroneously tries to return label `0` from the label file every single time, rather than using the predicted ID. The result will always be the first label in `labelmap.txt`, regardless of the model’s output. This happens because the predicted_class value is not used to index the `labels` list.

**Scenario 2: Index Mismatch during Preprocessing**

Another frequent issue I've seen is during preprocessing. Sometimes, the model is trained with indices adjusted during training, or with a different convention, but this detail was not carried over during inference. This happens when model outputs are not directly related to the labels, but instead are passed through a transformation function, such as an array of `one-hot-encoded` representations. Let’s say, for example, during model training you use an index to label function, but forget this during inference.

```python
# Incorrect example using a hypothetical one-hot-encoding
def interpret_model_output_onehot(output_tensor, label_file):
    with open(label_file, 'r') as f:
      labels = f.read().splitlines()

    # Suppose we do not return the index of maximum probability
    # Instead we return the index of the output where the value is '1'
    predicted_class = np.argmax(output_tensor) # Get the class index
    
    # One-Hot-Encoded output processing step missing
    predicted_label = labels[predicted_class]
    return predicted_label

output_tensor = np.array([0, 1, 0]) # Suppose the output is a one-hot encoding 
label_file = "labelmap.txt"
result = interpret_model_output_onehot(output_tensor, label_file)
print(f"Predicted Label: {result}")
```

This example assumes that the output is already one hot encoded, therefore, we must find the index of the one and use it to determine the label. However, if the output is an array of probabilities or logit values, then the index is not directly applicable. If the `labelmap.txt` file does not match this encoding scheme, the first line may be incorrectly chosen each time, especially if class '0' has a much higher probability than the rest. The output of a classification model will generally output an array of probablilities (e.g. [0.1, 0.8, 0.05, 0.05]), which is not the same as a one hot encoded output.

**Scenario 3: Incorrect Handling of Model Output**

A more subtle mistake can occur when the model output is not being correctly interpreted before accessing the label. This can happen if the model does not return a simple array of class probabilities or logit values, but an array with further dimensions. If you have not checked the model output shape, you could incorrectly process the model output before using it.

```python
import numpy as np

def interpret_model_output_incorrect_array(output_tensor, label_file):
    with open(label_file, 'r') as f:
        labels = f.read().splitlines()

    # Incorrectly assume it's a simple output
    predicted_class = np.argmax(output_tensor[0]) # output_tensor is actually a 2D array
    predicted_label = labels[predicted_class]
    return predicted_label

# Suppose output_tensor is actually [ [0.1, 0.8, 0.05, 0.05] ]
output_tensor = np.array([[0.1, 0.8, 0.05, 0.05]])
label_file = "labelmap.txt"
result = interpret_model_output_incorrect_array(output_tensor, label_file)
print(f"Predicted Label: {result}")
```
Here, the model output is a two-dimensional array, so attempting to return the index of the maximum value at index zero will always access the first dimension of the output tensor, therefore only accessing the first row every time, which may always have the maximum in the first index (0). The fix is to correctly retrieve the output by finding the maximum of the whole output, not just a slice of the output, depending on the model architecture.

To correctly address this issue, ensure that:

1.  The `labelmap.txt` file is generated in the correct order, corresponding to the numerical class IDs that your model is trained to produce (zero-indexed).
2.  The code that interprets the model output correctly accesses the `labelmap.txt` file using the index of the highest probability/logit. If the model uses one-hot encoding, the output should be converted to a single index representation before being used to query the labelmap.
3.  The interpretation logic must match the data structures that the model outputs. Verify the output shape and data types and ensure the code correctly processes and extracts the prediction index.

When troubleshooting, it's valuable to:

*   Inspect your model output by printing the full output tensors, not just the argmax result. This helps verify the model is indeed outputting predicted values as expected.
*   Temporarily use a simple loop to iterate through all the entries in `labelmap.txt`, and display these labels with a corresponding index to cross-reference the numerical predictions with the text labels.
*   Examine the training pipeline to check how labels are assigned to ensure that the interpretation logic matches the model behavior.

For further reference, I would recommend reviewing documentation on TensorFlow Lite model inference, especially sections detailing output tensor interpretation and label mapping. Additionally, examples from the TensorFlow repository that detail image classification tasks can provide insights. Finally, detailed guides on embedded machine learning inference may offer additional perspectives. I also advise you use a debugger, as this can help you inspect data structures.
