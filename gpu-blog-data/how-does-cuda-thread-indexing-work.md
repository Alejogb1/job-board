Directly addressing thread indexing in CUDA requires understanding that it's the fundamental mechanism for mapping parallel computations onto the GPU's hardware. It’s how we identify and assign individual work items to specific processing cores. My experience developing computational fluid dynamics solvers using CUDA has repeatedly driven home the critical need for precise thread indexing for correct and efficient execution. In essence, it's how a single kernel function operates on a massive dataset in parallel. Without it, the parallelism inherent in GPU architecture would be unusable.

CUDA organizes threads into a hierarchical grid structure composed of thread blocks and the grid itself. Each thread within a block has a unique identifier, or index, accessible within the kernel. Blocks themselves are also indexed within the overall grid. These indices are typically multidimensional, reflecting the structure of the problem we're trying to solve. This allows us to map, for example, array processing to the available GPU hardware resources effectively. The dimensionality of these indices is determined during kernel launch configuration, using parameters specifying the block and grid dimensions.

The kernel function executes a single instance for each thread created. Inside the kernel, built-in variables `threadIdx`, `blockIdx`, and `blockDim` allow each thread to compute its global index, essentially its specific place within the overall computation. `threadIdx` is a vector holding the thread's index within its block, `blockIdx` contains the index of the block within the grid, and `blockDim` gives the size of a block in each dimension. These variables are defined by the launch configuration. For a two-dimensional example, `threadIdx.x`, `threadIdx.y`, `blockIdx.x`, `blockIdx.y`, `blockDim.x`, and `blockDim.y` are all available. The dimensionality of these identifiers matches the specified block and grid dimensions.

The most common task is mapping this thread index to a data index for array processing, where each thread operates on a different element of a large array in parallel. For one-dimensional data, the computation is straightforward. Let's assume we have a vector and wish to process each element with a separate thread. The global index calculation combines the block index and the thread index.

```c++
__global__ void vector_add(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) { // Bounds check for array size 'n'
      c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

// Kernel Launch from Host
int n = 1024; // Example array size
int threads_per_block = 256;
int blocks_in_grid = (n + threads_per_block - 1) / threads_per_block; // Ensure full coverage
vector_add<<<blocks_in_grid, threads_per_block>>>(dev_a, dev_b, dev_c, n);
```

In this example, the `vector_add` kernel performs element-wise addition of two vectors `a` and `b`, storing the result in `c`. The global index `i` is computed by multiplying `blockIdx.x` (block ID in the x-dimension) with `blockDim.x` (number of threads per block in the x-dimension) and adding `threadIdx.x` (thread ID within the block). The `if` statement performs a bounds check, as not all threads may map perfectly to the data size, particularly when the size isn’t a multiple of the threads per block. This is crucial. The host code calculates the number of blocks needed based on array size and thread per block. The kernel is launched with the calculated grid and block dimensions.

When dealing with two-dimensional data, such as images or matrices, we can use two-dimensional thread and block indices. Let’s illustrate with a simple matrix multiplication kernel example.

```c++
__global__ void matrix_mult(float* A, float* B, float* C, int rowsA, int colsA, int colsB) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < rowsA && col < colsB) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for(int k = 0; k < colsA; k++)
            sum += A[row * colsA + k] * B[k * colsB + col];

        C[row * colsB + col] = sum;
    }

}

// Example Host Launch:
int rowsA = 1024; int colsA = 512; int colsB = 256;
dim3 threadsPerBlock(16, 16);
dim3 blocksInGrid( (colsB + threadsPerBlock.x - 1) / threadsPerBlock.x, (rowsA + threadsPerBlock.y - 1) / threadsPerBlock.y);

matrix_mult<<<blocksInGrid,threadsPerBlock>>>(dev_A, dev_B, dev_C, rowsA, colsA, colsB);
```

Here, each thread computes a single element in the output matrix `C`. The global row and column indices are derived by using both `threadIdx` and `blockIdx` along both dimensions. The linear indices of array `A`, `B` and `C` are derived from 2D coordinates, showing the mapping of the 2D thread index to a 1D data storage. Again, bounds checks are used to prevent invalid memory access. The kernel is called with appropriate grid and block dimensions.

For three-dimensional data, analogous computations are necessary. As an example, consider a 3D volume processing scenario, such as in scientific data analysis, for instance, filtering or performing convolutions on 3D volumetric images.

```c++
__global__ void volume_filter(float* input, float* output, int width, int height, int depth) {
    int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int z = blockIdx.z * blockDim.z + threadIdx.z;

    if (x < width && y < height && z < depth) {
        // Simplified Filter Computation - just a place holder. 
        output[z * width * height + y * width + x] = input[z * width * height + y * width + x] * 0.5f;

    }
}

// Example Host Launch:
int width = 64; int height = 64; int depth = 64;
dim3 threadsPerBlock(4, 4, 4);
dim3 blocksInGrid((width + threadsPerBlock.x -1) / threadsPerBlock.x, (height+threadsPerBlock.y-1)/threadsPerBlock.y,(depth+threadsPerBlock.z-1)/threadsPerBlock.z);

volume_filter<<<blocksInGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(dev_input, dev_output, width, height, depth);
```

In this code, the thread indexing extends to three dimensions, allowing for operations on each element in a three-dimensional data volume. The global x, y, and z coordinates are computed by incorporating `threadIdx` and `blockIdx` along all three axes. Each thread calculates its 1D array index based on its 3D position, mapping the 3D indexing to a 1D memory layout. The 3D block and grid dimensions are specified during the kernel launch. Again the kernel function uses bounds checks and carries out a filter operation (here simplified to illustrate the principle)

The key takeaway is that correct thread indexing is necessary for parallel processing, and it maps the multi-dimensional architecture of CUDA to data structures that are typically sequential in nature. Understanding the dimensionality and bounds are crucial for preventing out-of-bounds accesses. Proper management of global, block and thread indices within the kernel allows for scalable performance.

For a more in-depth understanding, I'd recommend consulting NVIDIA's official CUDA programming guide, which provides extensive explanations and code examples. Other invaluable resources include the programming guide offered by NVIDIA, and the CUDA Toolkit documentation, all accessible from their developer website. Several books on parallel programming with CUDA also offer detailed treatment of thread indexing, notably the texts from Sanders and Kandrot. These resources collectively offer a much more thorough coverage of the topic than can be reasonably presented here.
