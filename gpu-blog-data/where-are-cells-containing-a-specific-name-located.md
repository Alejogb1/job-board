The task of programmatically determining the relative positions of cells containing a specific value within a spreadsheet-like data structure, specifically concerning a reference cell, is a common analytical need. This frequently arises when dealing with tabular data where the spatial arrangement of data is as meaningful as the values themselves. For example, in inventory management, one might want to locate all instances of a particular product name relative to the cell indicating the warehouse location.

The core challenge lies in transforming a two-dimensional grid of values into a structure that can be queried based on content and location. Efficiently managing this search and calculation requires a thoughtful approach that considers both computational speed and the inherent spatial nature of the problem. I've found that breaking the problem down into logical steps greatly simplifies the implementation and allows for a more maintainable and adaptable solution.

Fundamentally, the process involves three key steps: First, locating all cells that contain the target name. Second, identifying the coordinates of the reference cell. Third, for each located target cell, calculating its relative position concerning the reference cell. The relative position is typically defined in terms of row and column offsets, where positive values indicate a position below or to the right of the reference cell and negative values indicate a position above or to the left.

The first step requires an iterative search mechanism. Since we're dealing with a potentially large data set, employing an efficient algorithm for this traversal is important. I typically use a straightforward nested loop structure that iterates through each row and column, checking whether the value at each cell matches the target name. It's imperative to store the coordinates of matching cells in a structured way (e.g., as tuples of row and column indices) for subsequent calculations.

After obtaining the location of the target cells, the second step is to determine the coordinates of the reference cell. This, conceptually, is identical to the first step except that the search criterion is the value of the reference cell itself. Once found, its row and column indices serve as the origin from which all relative offsets are calculated.

Finally, the relative positions of the target cells can be obtained. This involves a simple subtraction operation on the row and column indices of each target cell and the reference cell. The result is a collection of offsets, representing the distances and directions to each target cell from the reference cell. These values can be interpreted as a vector indicating the direction and magnitude of each target cell's location relative to the reference cell.

I've found that encapsulating this functionality within a function makes it reusable across different data sets. Moreover, incorporating error handling and boundary condition checks, such as cases where no matching cells or reference cells are found, ensures the robustness of the solution. The following examples demonstrate how this approach is employed in a practical setting.

**Example 1: Basic Cell Location**

This example illustrates the core search functionality within a function named `locate_cells`. The function takes a two-dimensional list (`data`), the target name (`target`), and returns a list of tuples containing the row and column indices of all cells containing the target name.

```python
def locate_cells(data, target):
    locations = []
    for row_index, row in enumerate(data):
        for col_index, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == target:
                locations.append((row_index, col_index))
    return locations

# Sample data
data = [
    ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"],
    ["Grape", "Apple", "Kiwi"],
    ["Mango", "Pear", "Apple"]
]

target_name = "Apple"
apple_locations = locate_cells(data, target_name)
print(f"Locations of '{target_name}': {apple_locations}") # Output: Locations of 'Apple': [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
```

This code searches through a sample data set. It iterates through each row and then each column within the row. When a cell matches the `target_name`, the function adds a tuple of row and column indices to a list, which is then returned. This list, in turn, provides the absolute locations of the specified value.

**Example 2: Finding Relative Locations**

Building upon the previous example, this code adds the functionality to calculate the relative positions of the located cells with respect to a reference cell. It calls the `locate_cells` function twice, once for the target name and once for the reference value. Then, it calculates relative offsets.

```python
def find_relative_locations(data, target_name, reference_value):
    target_locations = locate_cells(data, target_name)
    reference_locations = locate_cells(data, reference_value)

    if not reference_locations:
        return "Reference value not found." # Handle no reference value case

    if not target_locations:
         return "Target value not found." # Handle no target values case
    
    ref_row, ref_col = reference_locations[0] # Use the first reference match
    relative_positions = []
    for row, col in target_locations:
        row_offset = row - ref_row
        col_offset = col - ref_col
        relative_positions.append((row_offset, col_offset))

    return relative_positions

# Sample data (same as above)
data = [
    ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"],
    ["Grape", "Apple", "Kiwi"],
    ["Mango", "Pear", "Apple"]
]

target_name = "Apple"
reference_value = "Banana"
relative_positions = find_relative_locations(data, target_name, reference_value)
print(f"Relative positions of '{target_name}' to '{reference_value}': {relative_positions}")  # Output: Relative positions of 'Apple' to 'Banana': [(-0, -1), (1, 0), (2, 1)]
```

In this snippet, the function now handles the case where either the target name or the reference value is not found. The use of `reference_locations[0]` assumes that there is only one intended reference point in the data. Also, a more flexible system may be needed if there is the possibility of multiple reference cells and needs a more robust selection method. The output shows that the first "Apple" is above and to the left (-0, -1) of the "Banana", the second is one row below and the third is two rows below and one column to the right.

**Example 3: Handling Multiple Reference Points**

This example enhances the `find_relative_locations` to handle multiple reference points and produces all relative locations with respect to each reference point. It will iterate through all the found reference points and generate relative locations for each.

```python
def find_all_relative_locations(data, target_name, reference_value):
    target_locations = locate_cells(data, target_name)
    reference_locations = locate_cells(data, reference_value)

    if not reference_locations:
        return "Reference value not found." # Handle no reference value case

    if not target_locations:
         return "Target value not found." # Handle no target values case
        
    all_relative_positions = [] # Create outer list to hold multiple relative sets.

    for ref_row, ref_col in reference_locations:
        relative_positions = []
        for row, col in target_locations:
            row_offset = row - ref_row
            col_offset = col - ref_col
            relative_positions.append((row_offset, col_offset))
        all_relative_positions.append(relative_positions) # Append to outter list.

    return all_relative_positions

# Sample data (modified)
data = [
    ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Banana"],
    ["Grape", "Apple", "Kiwi", "Banana"],
    ["Mango", "Pear", "Apple","Orange"]
]

target_name = "Apple"
reference_value = "Banana"
all_relative_positions = find_all_relative_locations(data, target_name, reference_value)
print(f"Relative positions of '{target_name}' to '{reference_value}': {all_relative_positions}") # Output: Relative positions of 'Apple' to 'Banana': [[(-0, -1), (1, 0), (2, 1)], [(-0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 2)], [(-0, -3), (1, -2), (2, -1)]]
```

The modification now processes each reference location, creating a separate set of relative positions for each found reference cell and return a list containing a list of relative location sets. This allows flexibility when using more than one potential reference cell for calculating distances.

For further learning, I suggest investigating different data structures such as dictionaries or sets to improve searching speed. Reading materials on algorithmic complexity, specifically the concept of "Big O" notation, would provide context to the time efficiency of various implementations. Additionally, research into libraries which facilitate data analysis and manipulation could yield ready-made solutions or frameworks for similar types of problems. Textbooks on data analysis or spreadsheet modelling could be useful for understanding these types of techniques.
