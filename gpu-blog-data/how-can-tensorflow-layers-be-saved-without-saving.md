TensorFlow layer saving, by default, persists both the layer's architecture and its trainable variables (weights, biases). This behavior, while often desirable, can present challenges when deploying pre-trained models or when you need to transfer only the architectural blueprint to another computation graph. I've encountered this precise scenario when developing a model compression technique: I wanted to reuse a network's topology, but initialize it with random weights for fine-tuning, rather than loading pre-existing ones. Therefore, achieving separation – saving the architecture without the variables – requires a deliberate approach.

The key to separating the two components lies in recognizing how TensorFlow structures models and layers. A TensorFlow layer object, an instance of `tf.keras.layers.Layer`, or custom subclass thereof, holds not only the layer's connectivity information but also maintains references to the `tf.Variable` objects constituting its trainable parameters. The built-in `save` methods (such as `model.save` or `layer.save`) operate recursively, traversing this object graph and storing everything it finds. Thus, to prevent variable persistence, one must interrupt this process. We achieve this by selectively preserving only the layer's configuration and using this configuration to reconstruct a new layer instance when needed.

My team's initial attempt at solving this involved manually extracting architectural parameters (e.g., number of units in a Dense layer, kernel size of a Conv2D layer) and reconstructing the layers. This approach proved incredibly brittle, prone to errors, and difficult to maintain. The introduction of TensorFlow's configuration handling mechanisms rendered this method obsolete.

The process effectively entails the following steps: first, obtaining the layer's configuration dictionary using the `.get_config()` method; second, instantiating a new layer of the same type using the extracted configuration through the corresponding layer's constructor; and finally, bypassing variable loading by not calling specific restoration methods or parameters. The re-instantiated layer will have the identical structural parameters but will start with randomly initialized variables or can be initialized with custom values as required.

Let's illustrate this with three code examples, covering different types of layers:

**Example 1: Saving and Loading a `Dense` Layer without Variables**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a Dense layer with arbitrary parameters
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform')

# Get the layer configuration
config = dense_layer.get_config()

print("Original Layer Config:", config)

# Instantiate a new Dense layer using the configuration
new_dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense.from_config(config)

# Verify that parameters are different (before first use)
print("New Dense Layer Variables:", new_dense_layer.trainable_variables)

# Generate some input to force initialization
test_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 32))
_ = new_dense_layer(test_input)
print("New Dense Layer Variables (after initialization):", new_dense_layer.trainable_variables)
```

This example showcases how to retrieve the configuration of a `Dense` layer using `get_config()` and reconstruct it with `from_config()`. The key here is not directly using the original layer, but creating a new instance based on the config. Notice that the new instance, initially, has no trainable variables, and those are initialized only after it processes its first input. The configuration captures crucial information including `units` and `activation`, but not the weight matrices.

**Example 2: Saving and Loading a `Conv2D` Layer without Variables**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a Conv2D layer with arbitrary parameters
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')

# Get the layer configuration
config = conv_layer.get_config()

print("Original Layer Config:", config)

# Instantiate a new Conv2D layer using the configuration
new_conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D.from_config(config)

# Verify that parameters are different (before first use)
print("New Conv2D Layer Variables:", new_conv_layer.trainable_variables)

# Generate some input to force initialization
test_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 32, 32, 3))
_ = new_conv_layer(test_input)
print("New Conv2D Layer Variables (after initialization):", new_conv_layer.trainable_variables)

```
Here, a `Conv2D` layer is treated similarly. The output clearly demonstrates the reconstruction process, with a new layer object holding configuration details like `filters`, `kernel_size`, and `padding`. As with the `Dense` layer, the variables of the new layer are initialized when forward is called.

**Example 3: Saving and Loading a Custom Layer without Variables**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation)
        
    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.activation(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b)

    def get_config(self):
        config = super(CustomLayer, self).get_config()
        config.update({
            "units": self.units,
            "activation": tf.keras.activations.serialize(self.activation)
        })
        return config
    
# Define a custom layer
custom_layer = CustomLayer(units=128, activation='relu')

# Get the layer configuration
config = custom_layer.get_config()
print("Original Custom Layer Config:", config)

# Instantiate a new Custom layer using the configuration
new_custom_layer = CustomLayer.from_config(config)

# Verify that parameters are different (before first use)
print("New Custom Layer Variables:", new_custom_layer.trainable_variables)


# Generate some input to force initialization
test_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 64))
_ = new_custom_layer(test_input)
print("New Custom Layer Variables (after initialization):", new_custom_layer.trainable_variables)
```

This example shows how to extend this concept to custom layers. A crucial part is to override the `get_config()` method to save necessary parameters and to call `from_config` within the `CustomLayer` class definition. The new layer is instantiated and initialized similar to the built-in layers.

It is essential to understand the specific configuration parameters for each layer type, and for custom layers, to properly define the `get_config` and `from_config` methods. For recurrent layers such as LSTM or GRU, the configuration might include cell specific parameters such as dropout, recurrent_dropout, number of units and other configurations.

To further expand one's understanding of this process, several resources should be consulted. I recommend reviewing TensorFlow's official Keras API documentation focusing on the `tf.keras.layers.Layer` class and its methods `get_config()` and `from_config()`. The documentation provides exhaustive details on how layers are serialized and instantiated. Furthermore, scrutinizing the source code for individual layer classes (available within the TensorFlow codebase) proves valuable in comprehending how the `get_config` and `from_config` are implemented specific to each layer type. Also, research into model serialization techniques, particularly those that describe how models are saved and loaded by the `save()` and `load_model()` functionality in Keras, can provide additional insight. A practical approach would be to experiment with creating more complex architectures, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks, to gain practical experience saving their architectural blueprints. In short, I've outlined the method of separating model architectures from weights for efficient reuse.
