Simulating multiple GPUs on a single machine necessitates emulating the parallel processing capabilities and memory architecture inherent in a multi-GPU setup.  This is fundamentally different from simply leveraging multi-threading on a single CPU; we're aiming to replicate the behavior of distinct, independent processing units with their own dedicated memory spaces.  My experience working on high-performance computing simulations for large-scale fluid dynamics taught me the nuances of this challenge and the limitations involved.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core difficulty lies in the inherently parallel nature of GPU computation.  A single CPU, even with hyperthreading, cannot perfectly replicate the independent execution streams and the high bandwidth inter-GPU communication that a multi-GPU system offers.  Effective simulation requires a combination of software and hardware considerations.  On the software side, we need frameworks capable of managing parallel tasks and distributing workloads across simulated GPUs.  On the hardware side, sufficient CPU resources and RAM are crucial to avoid performance bottlenecks.  The simulation will always be an approximation; it's computationally infeasible to perfectly mirror the complexities of actual GPU hardware within a single CPU environment.

We can achieve a reasonable approximation by employing parallel computing techniques such as message passing or shared memory, simulating the inter-GPU communication overhead. This involves dividing the workload into smaller, independent tasks, distributing them across simulated GPU units (represented by threads or processes), and managing the exchange of data between these simulated units.  The accuracy of the simulation depends heavily on the chosen methodology and the granularity of task division.  For example, a fine-grained task division can provide a more accurate representation of parallel execution but will inevitably lead to higher overhead.

The most straightforward approach involves using libraries designed for parallel processing, such as OpenMP or MPI, to manage the simulated GPUs as independent processes.  Each process represents a virtual GPU, carrying out its assigned portion of the calculation.  The communication between these processes, mimicking inter-GPU communication, can be handled through inter-process communication primitives provided by the parallel computing library. This method simplifies development but might not perfectly capture the intricacies of real GPU architectures.

More sophisticated approaches might involve custom-built simulators that mimic the specifics of a particular GPU architecture, including memory hierarchy and instruction sets.  These are significantly more complex to develop and maintain but offer higher fidelity simulations, allowing for more accurate performance predictions and code profiling before deployment on actual multi-GPU systems.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches using Python.  Remember, these are simplified illustrations and may require adjustments depending on the specific task and chosen libraries.  These examples assume you have the necessary libraries installed (`mpi4py` for MPI, `openmp` if your compiler supports it).

**Example 1: MPI for simulating inter-GPU communication:**

```python
from mpi4py import MPI

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
size = comm.Get_size()

# Simulate data for each GPU
data = rank * 10

# Perform computation on simulated GPU
result = data * 2

# Simulate inter-GPU communication (sending/receiving data)
if rank == 0:
    received_data = comm.recv(source=1, tag=1)
    print(f"GPU 0 received: {received_data}")
elif rank == 1:
    comm.send(data, dest=0, tag=1)


MPI.Finalize()
```

This example utilizes MPI to simulate two GPUs (size=2). Each process (rank) represents a GPU, performing a simple calculation.  Inter-GPU communication is simulated by sending and receiving data between processes using `comm.send` and `comm.recv`.  This demonstrates a basic mechanism for mimicking data exchange between distinct GPU units.  Note that scaling this to more "GPUs" is straightforward by increasing `size`.


**Example 2: OpenMP for simulating parallel execution:**

```c++
#include <omp.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int num_threads = 4; // Simulate 4 GPUs
  omp_set_num_threads(num_threads);

  #pragma omp parallel
  {
    int id = omp_get_thread_num(); // GPU ID
    int data = id * 10;
    int result = data * 2;
    #pragma omp critical
    {
      std::cout << "Simulated GPU " << id << ": Result = " << result << std::endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This C++ example uses OpenMP directives to parallelize the computation across multiple threads, simulating the parallel execution of multiple GPUs.  Each thread represents a virtual GPU, and `omp_get_thread_num()` provides the ID of the simulated GPU. `#pragma omp critical` ensures that only one thread accesses the console output at a time. This example efficiently demonstrates parallel task division.  The limitations lie in shared memory access.


**Example 3: Python with threading (less accurate simulation):**

```python
import threading

def simulate_gpu(gpu_id, data):
    result = data * 2
    print(f"Simulated GPU {gpu_id}: Result = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_gpus = 3
    threads = []
    data = [i * 10 for i in range(num_gpus)]
    for i in range(num_gpus):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=simulate_gpu, args=(i, data[i]))
        threads.append(thread)
        thread.start()

    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

```

This Python example uses threads to simulate parallel GPU execution.  It's less accurate than MPI or OpenMP because it relies on the operating system's thread scheduler and doesn't explicitly model inter-GPU communication. This approach serves as a simpler illustration of parallelism, yet lacks the fidelity of explicit inter-process communication.  Inter-thread communication would require more sophisticated mechanisms like shared memory or queues.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of parallel computing and GPU simulation, I would recommend consulting textbooks on parallel algorithms, high-performance computing, and GPU architecture.  Exploring the documentation for parallel programming libraries like MPI and OpenMP is essential.  Furthermore, studying papers on GPU simulation techniques and frameworks would provide valuable insights into more advanced simulation methodologies.  Finally, reviewing the specifications and manuals of various GPU architectures will provide context for building more realistic simulators.
