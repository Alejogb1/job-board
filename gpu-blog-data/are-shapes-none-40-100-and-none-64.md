The compatibility of shapes (None, 40, 100) and (None, 64, 100) hinges on the interpretation of the `None` dimension and the context of their intended use.  In my experience working with multi-dimensional arrays and tensor manipulation within numerical computation libraries like NumPy and TensorFlow, the presence of `None` typically signifies a dynamic or unspecified dimension.  This allows for flexible operations where the exact size along that axis is not predefined, but instead determined at runtime based on the specific operation or input data.  Therefore, a blanket statement of compatibility is not possible without understanding the underlying operations.

**1. Explanation of `None` Dimension:**

The `None` type, when used to describe a dimension in a shape tuple, acts as a placeholder.  It does not indicate the absence of a dimension but rather a dimension whose size is not fixed.  This is crucial for broadcasting operations and handling variable-sized inputs, common in machine learning and data processing pipelines.  Consider, for example, a scenario where you are processing batches of images.  The number of images in a batch might vary (dynamic batch size), which can be represented by the `None` dimension.  The remaining dimensions (height and width, for instance) remain consistent.  Hence, a shape like `(None, 224, 224)` represents batches of images, each of size 224x224, with a variable number of images per batch.

The shapes (None, 40, 100) and (None, 64, 100) would represent two distinct datasets or tensors. The `None` dimension in both shapes indicates variable-length sequences or batches along that axis.  The other dimensions, 40 and 64, could represent features or time steps. If these are representing timesteps in a time-series dataset, this is incompatible. However, If these represent features (e.g., word embeddings in natural language processing) , it could be compatible, depending on the operation.  The key point here is that the 100 dimension is consistent, suggesting a common characteristic between the datasets.

The compatibility entirely depends on the operation to be performed.  Direct element-wise operations would be impossible without reshaping or broadcasting. Broadcasting rules, as implemented in NumPy and similar libraries, attempt to align dimensions by inferring dimensions of size 1.   Concatenation along the first axis, however, would be possible provided that the remaining dimensions align.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incompatible Element-wise Operation:**

```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.zeros((None, 40, 100)) # Placeholder for demonstration
array2 = np.zeros((None, 64, 100)) # Placeholder for demonstration

try:
    result = array1 + array2  # This will likely raise a ValueError
    print(result.shape)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"ValueError: {e}")

```

This example demonstrates an attempt at element-wise addition.  The fundamental incompatibility arises because the second dimension (40 vs. 64) is different.  NumPy's broadcasting cannot resolve this discrepancy; hence, a `ValueError` is expected.  Filling `None` with actual numbers would change the result, but even so, broadcasting would fail.


**Example 2: Compatible Concatenation:**

```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.random.rand(5, 40, 100) # Example with filled None dimension
array2 = np.random.rand(10, 64, 100) # Example with filled None dimension

concatenated = np.concatenate((array1, array2), axis=0) # Concatenation along the batch axis

print(concatenated.shape)
```

This example showcases a scenario where compatibility is achieved. By setting `None` to specific sizes for demonstrative purposes, we can perform a valid concatenation operation.  Concatenation happens along the first axis (axis=0), which is the one with the variable size and the `None`.  The consistency of the other two dimensions ensures successful concatenation, resulting in a shape (15, 64, 100) due to how Numpy handles broadcasting.  Note: In a real-world application, the `None` would be resolved during the actual data loading or tensor manipulation.


**Example 3:  Compatible Broadcasting (with caveats):**

```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.random.rand(1, 40, 100) #Example with  None replaced for broadcasting
array2 = np.random.rand(1, 1, 100) #Example with None replaced for broadcasting.

result = array1 + array2

print(result.shape)  # Output: (1, 40, 100)
```


In this example, we explicitly populate the `None` dimension with a size of 1 for demonstration. This allows for broadcasting to work.  However, it is important to note that this relies on NumPy's broadcasting rules. The result is the shape of `array1`, which is larger than `array2`, and broadcasting is carried out along the 40 axis of `array1`.  This assumes that the operation makes logical sense and there is an underlying implication that the operation is supposed to apply repeatedly.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of broadcasting and array manipulation in Python, I recommend consulting the official NumPy documentation.  Textbooks on linear algebra and numerical computation are also invaluable for grasping the underlying mathematical principles.  Similarly, the documentation for TensorFlow or PyTorch will prove invaluable should your applications involve tensors within deep learning or machine learning contexts.  Thorough review of these resources will enhance your understanding of the intricacies involved in handling dynamic dimensions.
