The core mechanism for gradient computation in TensorFlow/Keras hinges on automatic differentiation, specifically reverse-mode automatic differentiation, also known as backpropagation.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks for natural language processing heavily relies on a deep understanding of this process;  inefficient gradient calculations directly impact training speed and model convergence.  Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanics is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow and Keras leverage computational graphs to represent the network's architecture.  Each operation in the graph, whether a matrix multiplication, activation function application, or loss calculation, is represented as a node.  These nodes maintain a record of their inputs and the operation performed.  During the forward pass, data flows through the graph, producing the final output (e.g., predictions). The crucial step is the backward pass, where gradients are computed.

Reverse-mode automatic differentiation works by traversing the computational graph backward, starting from the loss function.  The gradient of the loss with respect to each parameter is calculated using the chain rule of calculus.  This chain rule application is efficiently implemented by TensorFlow's internal mechanisms, avoiding the explicit calculation of numerous partial derivatives.  Each node calculates its gradient contribution based on the gradients received from its downstream nodes.  This process recursively propagates gradients back to the network's parameters (weights and biases).  Finally, these computed gradients are then used by the chosen optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD) to update the model's parameters, aiming to minimize the loss function.

Crucially, this automatic differentiation process is transparent to the user in most cases. Keras's high-level API handles the complexities of gradient computation, allowing developers to focus on model architecture and training hyperparameters. However, understanding the underlying mechanisms is beneficial for debugging and optimizing training performance.  Specifically, understanding computational graph construction and memory management associated with the backpropagation algorithm is vital for handling complex models and large datasets efficiently, a lesson learned from numerous optimization projects involving recurrent neural networks.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Gradient Computation with `tf.GradientTape`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(3.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = x**2

dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)  # Computes dy/dx = 2x
print(dy_dx)  # Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=6.0>
```

This example demonstrates the simplest application of `tf.GradientTape`.  `tf.GradientTape()` records the operations performed within its context. The `tape.gradient()` method then computes the gradient of `y` with respect to `x`.  Note that `x` needs to be a `tf.Variable` for the `GradientTape` to track its value and compute its gradient.  This is a fundamental requirement for parameter updates during training. I've encountered numerous instances where forgetting this detail led to incorrect gradient calculations.

**Example 2: Gradient Computation with Multiple Variables and a Custom Loss Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([2, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0]])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y - tf.constant([[3.0]])))

dW, db = tape.gradient(loss, [W, b])
print(dW)
print(db)
```

This example showcases gradient computation with multiple variables (`W` and `b`) and a custom loss function (mean squared error). The `tape.gradient()` method efficiently computes the gradients of the loss with respect to both variables simultaneously.  This is particularly useful when training models with numerous parameters, a common scenario in my work with convolutional neural networks.  The ability to compute gradients for multiple variables within a single tape execution streamlines the optimization process.

**Example 3: Gradient Computation with Keras Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(2,), activation='linear')
])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
x_train = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
y_train = tf.constant([[3.0], [7.0]])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(x_train)
    loss = tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(y_train, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

```

This example demonstrates gradient computation within a Keras model.  The `tf.keras.optimizers.SGD` optimizer is used for updating the model's weights.  Keras automatically handles the construction of the computational graph and gradient computation. The `apply_gradients` method elegantly updates the model parameters based on the computed gradients.  This method is highly efficient and significantly simplifies the training process compared to manually managing gradients, a crucial advantage experienced during many large-scale model deployments.

This detailed explanation and the provided examples highlight the core mechanisms and practical applications of gradient computation in TensorFlow/Keras. The efficient and transparent automatic differentiation capabilities are fundamental to the framework's power and user-friendliness. Understanding these underlying principles is crucial for effective model building and optimization.
