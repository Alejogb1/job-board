Django's `CheckConstraint` migration failures often stem from subtle inconsistencies between the database schema's interpretation of the constraint and the constraint's definition within the Django model.  My experience with this, spanning several large-scale Django projects, reveals that the root cause usually lies in data type mismatches, implicit type conversions the database performs, or overlooked database-specific limitations on constraint expression complexity.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Django's ORM abstracts database interactions, but this abstraction isn't perfect.  `CheckConstraint` objects translate into database-specific SQL commands.  The failure to apply a migration involving a `CheckConstraint` indicates a mismatch between the SQL generated by Django and what the database's constraint enforcement engine can handle. This can arise from several factors:

* **Data Type Discrepancies:**  A common issue involves discrepancies between the data types defined in your Django model and the underlying database's representation. For instance, a `FloatField` in Django might map to a `DOUBLE PRECISION` in PostgreSQL, while MySQL might use `FLOAT`.  Constraints referencing these fields might fail if the database's implicit type conversion rules differ from those assumed by the Django ORM during migration generation.

* **Database-Specific Functions:** Django's `CheckConstraint` allows arbitrary SQL expressions.  However, you must ensure these expressions are compatible with the target database system. A function available in PostgreSQL might not exist in MySQL, leading to migration failure.

* **Constraint Complexity:**  Overly complex constraint expressions can exceed the database's parsing limits or violate normalization rules. Databases have limitations on the size and intricacy of constraints.  A constraint that is perfectly valid in Django's representation might be rejected by the database during migration.

* **Existing Data Violations:** If your database already contains data violating the newly introduced constraint, the migration will fail. The database will prevent the constraint's creation due to this inconsistency.

* **Migration Order and Dependencies:** Incorrect migration order or unmet dependencies can prevent the successful application of a `CheckConstraint` migration.  Ensuring proper sequencing and resolving any dependencies is crucial.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Data Type Mismatch**

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import CheckConstraint, Q

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)  # DecimalField is crucial

    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            CheckConstraint(check=Q(price__gte=0), name='price_non_negative')
        ]
```

*Commentary:*  Using `DecimalField` for `price` ensures precision and avoids potential type-related issues during constraint evaluation.  `FloatField` might lead to rounding errors that cause the constraint to fail.  The `Q` object facilitates constraint definition in a Django-friendly manner, reducing the risk of SQL syntax errors.


**Example 2: Database-Specific Function**

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import CheckConstraint, Func

class TimestampedEntry(models.Model):
    entry_time = models.DateTimeField()
    processed = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            CheckConstraint(check=Func(F('entry_time'), function='DATE'), name='date_constraint'),
        ]
```

*Commentary:* This example (hypothetical, may require adjustments based on database) illustrates a potential problem with database-specific functions.  `Func` allows incorporating database functions into constraints; however, ensure that `'DATE'` function (or its equivalent) is available in your database system. If not, this constraint will likely fail during migration.  Remember to adjust function names according to your database system.



**Example 3: Addressing Existing Data Violations**

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import CheckConstraint, Q

class User(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=150, unique=True)
    age = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            CheckConstraint(check=Q(age__gte=18), name='age_limit')
        ]
```

*Commentary:* Before applying this migration, ensure that no existing `User` records have `age` less than 18. If they do, the migration will fail. You must either update the data beforehand (using a separate migration or a script) or modify the constraint to accommodate existing data (e.g., by relaxing the condition temporarily and then tightening it later).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Consult the official Django documentation on database constraints and migrations. Pay close attention to the sections addressing specific database backends.
* Review the documentation for your specific database system regarding constraint syntax and limitations. Understand the implicit type casting rules.
* Explore Django's testing framework to write unit and integration tests to thoroughly validate the behaviour of your constraints.


Addressing these points helped me reliably implement `CheckConstraints` in my projects, avoiding many of the pitfalls I initially encountered.   Remember, meticulous attention to data types, database-specific functions, and a thorough understanding of database constraints is vital for successful Django migrations.  Always test thoroughly, especially before deploying to production.
