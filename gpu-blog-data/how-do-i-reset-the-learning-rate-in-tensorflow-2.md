In TensorFlow 2, a common scenario requires adjusting the learning rate during training, rather than maintaining a static value. This adjustment is not merely about assigning a new float, but involves modifying the internal state of the optimizer instance itself. Failing to do this correctly can lead to ineffective or unstable learning.

The learning rate, a crucial hyperparameter in gradient descent-based optimization, dictates the step size taken during each update to the model’s weights. It influences how rapidly or slowly the model learns from training data. A fixed rate throughout training might be suboptimal; an initially higher rate can accelerate early learning, while a lower rate later can facilitate convergence to a finer optimum. TensorFlow provides mechanisms to modify this rate, either directly or through more complex learning rate scheduling strategies.

To reset the learning rate, we must interact directly with the optimizer object, rather than the learning rate variable itself. The optimizer stores the current learning rate and utilizes it during gradient updates. When the learning rate is externally changed, the optimizer's internal value must be updated to reflect this. There are two primary approaches to achieve this. The first involves directly setting the optimizer’s learning rate attribute, and the second involves using a learning rate schedule and manipulating its state. Both effectively change the learning rate for subsequent training steps, but differ in their intended use cases and overall flexibility.

The simplest approach directly assigns a new value to the learning rate attribute of the optimizer. This assumes that the optimizer was initialized with a plain float as the learning rate, not a learning rate schedule. It’s straightforward but lacks the sophistication to apply dynamic or stepped adjustments based on training progress or other triggers. Consider this implementation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a model and optimizer are already initialized
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
                           tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

# Training loop (simplified)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
X = tf.random.normal((32, 784))
y = tf.random.uniform((32,), minval=0, maxval=9, dtype=tf.int32)
y = tf.one_hot(y, depth=10)


def train_step(X, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

for epoch in range(5):
    loss = train_step(X, y)
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, loss: {loss.numpy()}')

# Reset learning rate to 0.01
optimizer.learning_rate.assign(0.01)

for epoch in range(5, 10):
    loss = train_step(X, y)
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, loss: {loss.numpy()}')
```

In this example, an Adam optimizer is initialized with an initial learning rate of 0.001. After a few training epochs, `optimizer.learning_rate.assign(0.01)` directly sets the learning rate to 0.01. Notably, we use the `assign` method to change the value of the internal tensor managed by the optimizer. A direct assignment using the `=` operator is ineffective in modifying the optimizer's internal state. This approach works well if manual adjustments are required at specific points during training.

A more flexible approach involves using a learning rate schedule, particularly when specific patterns are needed. This involves creating a schedule object and passing it to the optimizer during initialization. Modifying the learning rate now requires changing the internal state of the schedule object itself, and the optimizer automatically uses the newly determined rate during each training step. Consider an example with a decaying learning rate:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a model is already initialized as before

initial_learning_rate = 0.001
lr_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay(
    initial_learning_rate,
    decay_steps=10,
    decay_rate=0.96,
    staircase=True)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=lr_schedule)

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
X = tf.random.normal((32, 784))
y = tf.random.uniform((32,), minval=0, maxval=9, dtype=tf.int32)
y = tf.one_hot(y, depth=10)


def train_step(X, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

for epoch in range(25):
    loss = train_step(X, y)
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, loss: {loss.numpy()}, lr: {optimizer.learning_rate.numpy()}')
```

In this scenario, an `ExponentialDecay` schedule dictates the learning rate's behavior. It starts with 0.001 and decays at a rate of 0.96 every 10 steps. The optimizer uses this schedule. Although there is not explicit "reset" here, the learning rate is constantly being reevaluated by the schedule, based on the training step.  To change the *rate* of decay or even the base learning rate mid-training, one must create a new schedule object, and then replace the learning_rate of the optimizer, as demonstrated next.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a model is already initialized as before

initial_learning_rate = 0.001
lr_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay(
    initial_learning_rate,
    decay_steps=10,
    decay_rate=0.96,
    staircase=True)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=lr_schedule)

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
X = tf.random.normal((32, 784))
y = tf.random.uniform((32,), minval=0, maxval=9, dtype=tf.int32)
y = tf.one_hot(y, depth=10)


def train_step(X, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss


for epoch in range(25):
    loss = train_step(X, y)
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, loss: {loss.numpy()}, lr: {optimizer.learning_rate.numpy()}')

# Replace learning rate schedule with a new one
new_initial_learning_rate = 0.005
new_lr_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay(
    new_initial_learning_rate,
    decay_steps=5,
    decay_rate=0.8,
    staircase=True
)
optimizer.learning_rate = new_lr_schedule

for epoch in range(25, 50):
    loss = train_step(X, y)
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, loss: {loss.numpy()}, lr: {optimizer.learning_rate.numpy()}')
```

Here, after an initial training phase, a new `ExponentialDecay` schedule with a different initial learning rate (0.005) and decay parameters is created, and then the optimizer's `learning_rate` attribute is directly assigned to the new learning rate schedule object. This results in an immediate update to the way in which the learning rate is calculated for all future steps of the training process. Note: this re-assignment is valid only in cases where the learning rate property has been assigned to an instance of a subclass of `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule`.

For further learning on learning rate manipulation, I would recommend exploring resources focusing on TensorFlow's `tf.keras.optimizers` module, particularly the documentation on available optimizers and learning rate scheduling. Additionally, materials on hyperparameter tuning, as a part of practical machine learning tutorials, should also be reviewed.  Detailed examples of specific optimizers' methods, such as Adam, SGD, and RMSprop, can help in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the various options. Lastly, deeper dives into adaptive learning rate schedules, such as those offered through Keras, can further enhance understanding of dynamic learning rate control.
