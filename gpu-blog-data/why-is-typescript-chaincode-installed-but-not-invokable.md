The core reason TypeScript-based chaincode might be installed successfully but remain uninvokable in Hyperledger Fabric 2.3.3 stems from a discrepancy between how the Fabric peer expects chaincode to be packaged and executed versus how a typical TypeScript project is structured and compiled. Specifically, the Fabric runtime seeks a compiled executable, typically in Go or a Docker image with an executable, while a standard TypeScript build process outputs JavaScript files that require a runtime environment like Node.js to execute.

Having spent considerable time deploying and debugging Hyperledger Fabric networks, I've repeatedly encountered this issue. The successful installation, indicated by successful peer chaincode install and instantiate commands, only validates the package’s presence on the peer's filesystem. It doesn’t guarantee correct execution. Invocation failure usually indicates that the peer cannot execute the installed package.

Let's break down the process. Hyperledger Fabric peer nodes expect chaincode to be provided either as a Go program that's compiled into a statically linked binary, or as a Docker image containing an executable capable of implementing the chaincode's logic. The peer executes chaincode within a secured Docker container, separate from its own process, which has implications on how we package TypeScript.

A standard TypeScript project is compiled into JavaScript, and unlike Go, JavaScript cannot run directly on the peer's container. We must bundle the compiled JavaScript code along with Node.js (or similar runtime) and instruct Fabric on how to execute it using Docker. This crucial step—creating a suitable Docker image—is frequently omitted or done incorrectly. The chaincode's installation, in this case, means that the tarred and gzipped package containing TypeScript code (likely containing package.json) has been successfully copied to the peer, and the peer can extract the files, and it does not validate whether the files are executable. This explains the seemingly paradoxical installation and inability to invoke.

Now, let's examine specific scenarios and code examples.

**Scenario 1: Basic TypeScript Project - Incorrect Packaging**

Assume we have a basic TypeScript chaincode project with a simple smart contract.

```typescript
// src/index.ts
import { Context, Contract } from 'fabric-contract-api';

export class BasicContract extends Contract {
  async initLedger(ctx: Context): Promise<void> {
      console.log('Initialization Completed');
  }

  async createAsset(ctx: Context, assetId: string, value: string): Promise<void> {
    const asset = { value };
    await ctx.stub.putState(assetId, Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(asset)));
  }

  async readAsset(ctx: Context, assetId: string): Promise<string> {
    const assetBytes = await ctx.stub.getState(assetId);
    if (!assetBytes || assetBytes.length === 0) {
      throw new Error(`Asset with ID ${assetId} does not exist.`);
    }
    return assetBytes.toString();
  }
}
```

After compilation (`tsc`), the `dist/` folder contains `index.js` and supporting `.js` files. A naive attempt to package this into a `chaincode.tar.gz`, without building a proper Docker image, and install it on fabric will lead to it being installed, but not invokable, as this `dist` folder by itself, without an entrypoint definition is not a runnable executable. Fabric, when invoking, doesn't find a defined execution mechanism and fails. This will be confirmed by checking container logs for errors about missing executable.

**Scenario 2: Docker Image with Node.js - Correct Packaging**

To rectify the situation, we must dockerize the application with Node.js. We create a Dockerfile.

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:16-slim as builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:16-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY package*.json ./
COPY ./scripts ./scripts
COPY ./node_modules ./node_modules

CMD [ "node", "./scripts/start.js"]
```

Here, the Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds. First, the `builder` stage installs npm dependencies and compiles the TypeScript code. The second stage copies the compiled JavaScript files, `package.json`, and a start script from the builder stage into the new final image. We also include an explicit entry point via `CMD` instruction.

Here is the `scripts/start.js` file to start the chaincode:
```javascript
const { ChaincodeServer } = require('fabric-shim');
const { BasicContract } = require('./dist');
new ChaincodeServer(new BasicContract()).start();
```

This `start.js` file imports `ChaincodeServer` from the `fabric-shim` module and starts our `BasicContract` instance. To make this setup invokable we now build the image with `docker build -t my-typescript-chaincode .`, and then create a connection.json file as required by Fabric peer for external chaincode, providing the image name to invoke the correct entrypoint.

```json
// connection.json
{
  "address": "localhost:7052",
  "dial_timeout": "10s",
  "tls_required": false,
  "peer_id": "peer0.org1.example.com",
  "chaincode_id": "basic-typescript",
  "msp_id": "Org1MSP"
}
```

We then install and instantiate the chaincode, specifying the external chaincode type with `--lang external`. The peer now has sufficient information to pull our Docker image and invoke our chaincode. The key difference is that this setup has a defined execution point within a Docker container that Fabric can utilize.

**Scenario 3: Fabric-contract-api and fabric-shim Compatibility**

A final, related point, relates to compatibility between installed version of `fabric-contract-api` and `fabric-shim`. Fabric requires precise version match between those two packages. Mismatched versions might result in installation working fine but invocation failing as the shim cannot properly interact with the chaincode.

```json
// package.json
  "dependencies": {
    "fabric-contract-api": "2.5.0",
    "fabric-shim": "2.5.0"
  },
```
In this code sample we ensure versions match. If those versions don't match, this can lead to similar 'installed but not invokable' symptoms.

**Resource Recommendations**

To better understand this issue and how to resolve it, I recommend referring to the following resources for in-depth guidance:

1.  **Hyperledger Fabric documentation:** The official documentation provides thorough explanations about chaincode development, packaging, and deployment, with specific sections dedicated to external chaincodes and Docker configurations. Pay close attention to the details around external chaincode packaging.

2.  **Hyperledger Fabric samples:** Exploring the provided sample chaincode projects, particularly the external chaincode examples, will provide practical insights into how these concepts are implemented. Observe the usage of Dockerfiles and packaging approaches.

3.  **Node.js documentation:** A basic grasp of how Node.js and npm manage packages and dependencies is essential, as is understanding the fundamentals of building and running Docker containers. Understanding Dockerfile syntax is paramount.

In summary, the issue of TypeScript chaincode being installed but not invokable in Hyperledger Fabric is primarily caused by incorrect packaging and lack of a Docker-based execution environment. By creating a proper Docker image containing a Node.js runtime, the compiled JavaScript code, and an entry point, one can circumvent this pitfall. Additionally, version compatibility between fabric-contract-api and fabric-shim is a critical consideration. A deeper understanding of Fabric’s chaincode lifecycle, coupled with the practical advice in the suggested resources, will empower developers to build and deploy robust TypeScript-based smart contracts.
