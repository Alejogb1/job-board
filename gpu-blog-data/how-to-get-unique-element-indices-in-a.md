TensorFlow's lack of a direct, single-function solution for obtaining unique element indices presents a common challenge.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects, particularly those involving feature extraction and subsequent analysis, frequently required isolating and indexing unique values within tensors.  The approach necessitates a combination of TensorFlow operations and potentially NumPy for efficient handling of the resulting data structures.


**1. Explanation of the Methodology**

The core strategy involves leveraging TensorFlow's `tf.unique` operation to identify unique elements and their corresponding indices.  However, `tf.unique` only returns the unique elements themselves and their first occurrence indices within the original tensor.  To obtain indices for *all* occurrences of each unique element, a further processing step is required. This involves comparing the original tensor with each unique element and using boolean indexing or `tf.where` to pinpoint locations.  The computational cost scales linearly with the number of unique elements and the size of the original tensor; for extremely large tensors, optimization strategies, such as partitioning the tensor, might be necessary.  Furthermore, handling multi-dimensional tensors requires careful consideration of indexing and axis specifications.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: One-Dimensional Tensor**

This example demonstrates the process for a simple one-dimensional tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tensor_1d = tf.constant([1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1])

unique_elements, unique_indices = tf.unique(tensor_1d)

all_indices = []
for element in unique_elements:
  indices = tf.where(tf.equal(tensor_1d, element))
  all_indices.append(indices)

print("Unique elements:", unique_elements.numpy())
print("Indices of first occurrences:", unique_indices.numpy())
print("Indices of all occurrences:", all_indices)

#Convert to a more usable format if needed
all_indices_np = np.array([index.numpy() for index in all_indices])
print("All Indices as Numpy array:",all_indices_np)
```

This code first extracts unique elements and their initial indices using `tf.unique`.  The subsequent loop iterates through the unique elements, comparing each against the original tensor to identify all occurrences. The output provides both the first and all occurrences of each unique element's indices in a readily interpretable format, leveraging NumPy for improved post-processing.


**Example 2: Two-Dimensional Tensor**

This example extends the process to a two-dimensional tensor, requiring careful management of axis information.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 2, 1], [1, 5, 2]])

unique_elements, unique_indices = tf.unique(tf.reshape(tensor_2d, [-1])) #Flatten for unique

all_indices = []
for element in unique_elements:
  indices = tf.where(tf.equal(tf.reshape(tensor_2d, [-1]), element))
  all_indices.append(indices)

#Convert to row and column indices for 2D
row_col_indices = []
for index_set in all_indices:
    rows = tf.cast(tf.math.floordiv(index_set[:,0],tensor_2d.shape[1]),dtype=tf.int32)
    cols = tf.math.floormod(index_set[:,0],tensor_2d.shape[1])
    row_col_indices.append(tf.stack([rows,cols],axis=1))

print("Unique elements:", unique_elements.numpy())
print("All Indices (Row, Col):", row_col_indices)

#Again,numpy for better handling.
row_col_indices_np = np.array([index.numpy() for index in row_col_indices])
print("Row Col Indices as Numpy array:",row_col_indices_np)
```

Here, the tensor is first flattened to apply `tf.unique` effectively.  Post-processing then reconstructs the row and column indices using element-wise division and modulo operations, providing a more meaningful representation for the two-dimensional data.  The conversion to NumPy array for ease of access highlights a pragmatic element of this type of processing.


**Example 3:  Handling Sparse Tensors**

Dealing with sparse tensors requires additional considerations to optimize for memory efficiency.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

indices = tf.constant([[0, 0], [1, 2], [2, 0], [0,0]])
values = tf.constant([1, 2, 1, 1])
dense_shape = tf.constant([3, 3])
sparse_tensor = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices, values, dense_shape)
dense_tensor = tf.sparse.to_dense(sparse_tensor)

unique_elements, unique_indices = tf.unique(tf.reshape(dense_tensor, [-1]))

all_indices = []
for element in unique_elements:
  indices = tf.where(tf.equal(tf.reshape(dense_tensor, [-1]), element))
  all_indices.append(indices)

row_col_indices = []
for index_set in all_indices:
    rows = tf.cast(tf.math.floordiv(index_set[:,0],dense_tensor.shape[1]),dtype=tf.int32)
    cols = tf.math.floormod(index_set[:,0],dense_tensor.shape[1])
    row_col_indices.append(tf.stack([rows,cols],axis=1))

print("Unique elements:", unique_elements.numpy())
print("All Indices (Row, Col):", row_col_indices)
print("Row Col Indices as Numpy array:",np.array([index.numpy() for index in row_col_indices]))

```

This example showcases processing a sparse tensor by first converting it to a dense tensor for easier manipulation.  While direct manipulation of sparse tensors is possible, it involves more intricate handling of sparse tensor indices and values, which adds complexity.  For clarity and maintainability, the approach of converting to dense is adopted.  Efficiency considerations would lead to different strategies when dealing with extremely large sparse tensors in production environments.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on tensor manipulation and sparse tensors, is crucial.  A thorough understanding of NumPy's array manipulation functionalities will greatly assist in post-processing the results from TensorFlow operations.  Finally, exploring advanced TensorFlow concepts like custom operations might be necessary for significantly improved performance with exceptionally large datasets.  Consulting literature on efficient sparse matrix operations will also be beneficial when dealing with tensors where sparsity is a defining characteristic.
