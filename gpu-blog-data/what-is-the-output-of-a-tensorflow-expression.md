The output of a TensorFlow expression is fundamentally a `tf.Tensor` object, a multi-dimensional array holding numerical data,  but its precise nature depends heavily on the context of the expression and the operations involved.  This isn't simply a matter of evaluating a mathematical formula; TensorFlow's operational semantics incorporate concepts of computation graphs and eager execution, significantly influencing the resultant output. My experience building large-scale recommendation systems using TensorFlow has underscored this nuanced behavior repeatedly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A TensorFlow expression, in its most basic form, is a sequence of operations defined on `tf.Tensor` objects.  These operations can range from simple arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to complex matrix manipulations (dot products, transposes, convolutions) and activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh). The result of each operation is itself a `tf.Tensor`.  Crucially, TensorFlow doesn't necessarily execute these operations immediately. In graph mode (the default prior to TensorFlow 2.x), the expression defines a computational graph – a directed acyclic graph where nodes represent operations and edges represent data flow between them.  Execution only happens when a session is run, explicitly triggering the evaluation of the graph.

Eager execution, introduced in TensorFlow 2.x, changes this paradigm.  Operations are executed immediately as they are encountered, providing a more intuitive and Pythonic experience. However, the underlying principle remains the same: the output of any TensorFlow expression, whether in eager or graph mode, is a `tf.Tensor` object encapsulating the computed result.  The dimensions, data type (e.g., `float32`, `int64`), and the actual numerical values within that `tf.Tensor` are determined by the operations in the expression and the input tensors.

It's crucial to distinguish between the `tf.Tensor` itself and its *value*. The `tf.Tensor` is a data structure, a handle to the computation result.  To access the numerical values within the tensor, you need to use methods like `.numpy()` (which converts the tensor to a NumPy array) or similar operations depending on the specific backend and desired output format. This is particularly important when dealing with large tensors to avoid unnecessary data copying.  In distributed training scenarios, for example, directly accessing the tensor's value might entail expensive data transfers across the network.  Therefore, working directly with the `tf.Tensor` object allows for efficient manipulation and optimization within the TensorFlow ecosystem.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Arithmetic Operation (Eager Execution)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Eager execution is enabled by default in TensorFlow 2.x
x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
z = x + y

print(f"Tensor z: {z}")
print(f"Value of z: {z.numpy()}")
```

This demonstrates a straightforward addition operation. The output `z` is a `tf.Tensor` containing the element-wise sum of `x` and `y`. `z.numpy()` provides the numerical values as a NumPy array for inspection.


**Example 2: Matrix Multiplication (Graph Mode - illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Illustrative Graph mode example.  Requires explicit session management in earlier TF versions.
# This example is for conceptual illustration and might require adaptation for modern TF versions.

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
    y = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
    z = tf.matmul(x, y)

with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    result = sess.run(z)
    print(f"Result of matrix multiplication: {result}")
```

This example showcases matrix multiplication, a common operation in deep learning.  While modern TensorFlow largely favors eager execution, this illustrates the fundamental concept of a computational graph:  the multiplication only occurs when `sess.run(z)` is called. The output `result` is a NumPy array representing the matrix product.  Note the use of `tf.compat.v1.Session` which is essential for running this example in a manner compatible with older graph-mode TensorFlow versions.  Modern versions would encourage equivalent operations performed within an eager context.


**Example 3:  Gradient Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(tf.constant(3.0))
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = x**2

dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(f"Derivative of y with respect to x: {dy_dx.numpy()}")
```

Here, the output is the gradient of a function (`y = x^2`) with respect to its input (`x`).  `tape.gradient()` calculates this derivative, and the result `dy_dx` is a `tf.Tensor` containing the value 6.0 (2*x). This highlights the use of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities –  the output is still a tensor, representing the calculated gradient.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive information on tensors, operations, eager execution, and graph mode.  Explore the sections covering TensorFlow core concepts and the API reference for detailed explanations of functions and classes.  A deep understanding of linear algebra and calculus is essential for comprehending TensorFlow's functionalities, especially when working with gradients and neural networks.  Finally, practical experience through building and running various TensorFlow projects is invaluable for mastering its intricacies.  Many excellent introductory and advanced textbooks cover deep learning, providing background context and practical examples which solidify understanding of TensorFlow's operational nature.
