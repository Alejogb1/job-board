TensorFlow 2.0's model subclassing offers a powerful and intuitive approach to building custom models, deviating from the functional API's declarative style.  My experience implementing complex recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks heavily leveraged this approach, highlighting its flexibility in handling intricate architectures and custom training loops.  The core principle lies in defining a model as a Python class inheriting from `tf.keras.Model`, overriding essential methods like `__init__` and `call`. This allows for fine-grained control over the model's structure and training process.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Model subclassing in TensorFlow 2.0 empowers developers to define custom layers and models by extending the `tf.keras.Model` class.  Instead of specifying a model architecture sequentially through function calls as in the functional API, subclassing employs object-oriented programming.  The `__init__` method constructs the model's layers, while the `call` method defines the forward pass, determining how input data flows through the defined layers.  This design provides significant advantages when facing non-standard architectures or requiring custom training procedures.

The `__init__` method is where you instantiate the layers that compose your model. These layers can be pre-built Keras layers or custom layers you've defined yourself.  Crucially, you should assign these layers as attributes of your class instance using `self`. This allows Keras to track them during training, enabling functionalities like weight updates and serialization.

The `call` method dictates the forward pass. It receives input tensors as arguments and returns the output tensors.  Within this method, you specify how the input data flows through your previously defined layers. This provides complete control over the flow of information within your custom model.  Itâ€™s important to remember that the `call` method should be purely functional; it should not modify the internal state of the model outside of layer operations.  State management should be explicitly handled using class variables if necessary.

Beyond `__init__` and `call`, other methods like `build`, `compute_output_shape`, and `get_config` can be overridden for more sophisticated control.  The `build` method is automatically called the first time the `call` method is executed; it's ideal for situations where layer shapes need to be determined dynamically based on the input shape.  `compute_output_shape` explicitly specifies the output shape given an input shape, crucial for model inference. `get_config` facilitates model saving and loading.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Sequential Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleSequentialModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleSequentialModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

# Model instantiation and summary
model = SimpleSequentialModel()
model.build((None, 32)) # Specifying input shape (batch_size, input_dim)
model.summary()
```

This example demonstrates a basic sequential model mirroring the functionality of the Keras Sequential API.  The `__init__` method initializes two dense layers. The `call` method defines the sequential application of these layers to the input.  Note the `model.build` call; it's crucial for models whose layer shapes cannot be inferred statically.


**Example 2:  Model with Custom Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.multiply(inputs, self.w)

class CustomLayerModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomLayerModel, self).__init__()
        self.custom_layer = MyCustomLayer(10)
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.custom_layer(inputs)
        return self.dense(x)

# Model instantiation and use
model = CustomLayerModel()
model(tf.random.normal((1,10))) # Dummy input for testing
```

This showcases the integration of a custom layer within a subclassed model.  `MyCustomLayer` performs element-wise multiplication with a trainable weight vector.  The `CustomLayerModel` uses this custom layer followed by a dense layer. This exemplifies how subclassing permits sophisticated layer customization not readily available in other Keras APIs.


**Example 3:  Model with Control Flow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ConditionalModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ConditionalModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
        self.dense3 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='sigmoid')

    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        if training:
          return self.dense2(x)
        else:
          return self.dense3(x)

# Model instantiation and conditional execution
model = ConditionalModel()
training_output = model(tf.random.normal((1,32)), training=True)
inference_output = model(tf.random.normal((1,32)), training=False)

print("Training Output Shape:", training_output.shape)
print("Inference Output Shape:", inference_output.shape)

```
Here, the `call` method's behaviour is conditioned on the `training` flag, a common pattern for models with different behaviour during training and inference. This example demonstrates the flexibility of model subclassing in handling conditional logic within the forward pass.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend revisiting the official TensorFlow documentation on custom model building.  Furthermore, explore advanced Keras resources focusing on custom layer creation and model subclassing.  Finally, delve into examples showcasing complex model architectures implemented using model subclassing to solidify your understanding.  Pay close attention to examples employing custom training loops and loss functions, as these areas fully leverage the power of this approach.  Working through these resources and experimenting with various architectures will ultimately solidify your grasp of model subclassing in TensorFlow 2.0.
