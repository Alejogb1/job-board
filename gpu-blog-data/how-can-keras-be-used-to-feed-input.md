The core challenge in feeding data to a Siamese network using Keras lies in appropriately structuring the input to reflect the network's architecture – specifically, the need to present pairs of input samples for comparison.  My experience building recommendation systems heavily leveraged this, necessitating custom data generators to handle this paired data efficiently.  Standard Keras input pipelines aren't directly suited for this; hence, careful consideration of data preprocessing and generator design is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A Siamese network, by design, operates on pairs of input data points.  These inputs are processed independently through identical (Siamese) subnetworks, generating feature embeddings.  The network then compares these embeddings to assess the similarity between the input pairs. This differs fundamentally from standard neural networks which operate on single input vectors.  Therefore, the data feeding mechanism must supply these input pairs in a format compatible with the model's architecture.

Two primary approaches exist:  One involves directly manipulating NumPy arrays to create paired data before feeding it to the `model.fit()` method.  The second, and generally preferred for larger datasets, involves creating a custom Keras data generator that yields batches of paired samples. This significantly improves efficiency by avoiding loading the entire dataset into memory.

The model itself typically employs a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance, cosine similarity) applied to the resulting embeddings from the Siamese subnetworks. The output layer then maps this distance to a prediction, often a binary classification (similar/dissimilar) or a regression (similarity score).  Successfully feeding data means correctly creating and presenting these input pairs and ensuring their consistent correspondence with the output labels.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Direct NumPy Array Approach (Suitable for small datasets):**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, Lambda, concatenate

# Define Siamese network architecture
input_shape = (10,)  # Example input shape
input_a = Input(shape=input_shape)
input_b = Input(shape=input_shape)

# Siamese subnetwork
shared_layer = Dense(64, activation='relu')
processed_a = shared_layer(input_a)
processed_b = shared_layer(input_b)

# Concatenate embeddings and apply distance metric (Euclidean distance)
merged = concatenate([processed_a, processed_b])
distance = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged) # Sigmoid for binary classification

model = Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=distance)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Prepare data (Small Dataset Example)
data_a = np.random.rand(100, 10)
data_b = np.random.rand(100, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100) # 0: dissimilar, 1: similar

# Train the model
model.fit([data_a, data_b], labels, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates creating a simple Siamese network with two input tensors, processing them through a shared layer, concatenating their embeddings, and using a dense layer for similarity prediction.  The data is directly provided as two NumPy arrays and the labels indicating similarity.  This approach is only practical for datasets that fit comfortably in memory.

**Example 2:  Custom Data Generator for Larger Datasets:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.utils import Sequence

class SiameseDataGenerator(Sequence):
    def __init__(self, data, labels, batch_size):
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def __len__(self):
        return int(np.ceil(len(self.data) / float(self.batch_size)))

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        batch_indices = np.arange(idx * self.batch_size, (idx + 1) * self.batch_size)
        batch_indices = batch_indices[batch_indices < len(self.data)]

        batch_data_a = self.data[batch_indices]
        batch_data_b = np.random.choice(self.data, size=len(batch_indices), replace=False) #negative sampling for dissimilars
        batch_labels = np.where(batch_data_a == batch_data_b, 1, 0)

        return [batch_data_a, batch_data_b], batch_labels

# Assuming 'data' contains your feature vectors and is appropriately structured

data_generator = SiameseDataGenerator(data, labels, batch_size=32)
model.fit(data_generator, epochs=10)

```

This example showcases a custom data generator inheriting from `keras.utils.Sequence`. This approach is memory-efficient, loading only batches of data at a time. Negative sampling is implemented here by randomly selecting different data points for comparison, creating dissimilar pairs.  This generator is crucial for efficient training on large datasets.

**Example 3:  Handling different similarity metrics and output types:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, Lambda, concatenate
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Siamese subnetwork definition as before) ...

# Custom layer for cosine similarity
def cosine_distance(ves):
    x, y = ves
    x = tf.nn.l2_normalize(x, axis=1)
    y = tf.nn.l2_normalize(y, axis=1)
    return tf.reduce_sum(x * y, axis=1, keepdims=True)

# Apply cosine distance instead of concatenation
distance = Lambda(cosine_distance)([processed_a, processed_b])

#Regression output instead of classification
distance = Dense(1)(distance) # Linear activation for regression

model = Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=distance)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae']) # MSE for regression

# ... (Data preparation and training as in Example 1 or 2) ...
```

This demonstrates employing a custom Lambda layer to calculate cosine similarity between embeddings.  It also shows how to modify the output layer and loss function for a regression task instead of binary classification, allowing for a continuous similarity score as output.  The choice of metric and output layer depends entirely on the specific task.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, and relevant research papers focusing on Siamese networks and metric learning provide in-depth understanding.  The Keras documentation itself, alongside TensorFlow tutorials, is invaluable for practical implementation details.   Thorough exploration of these resources will significantly enhance one's comprehension of the subject matter.
