Deep learning models, particularly those trained with high precision requirements, sometimes necessitate saving model weights in 64-bit floating-point format for subsequent analysis or deployment in environments requiring that precision. While Keras primarily defaults to saving weights in 32-bit format due to performance and storage efficiency considerations, a direct save in 64-bit isn’t readily available via the typical `model.save()` or `model.save_weights()` methods. Instead, achieving this requires more granular control at the tensor manipulation level, involving conversion before the save operation. I've personally encountered this constraint when working with simulations dependent on the fidelity afforded by higher precision. The core concept revolves around converting the weights to a `float64` datatype before serializing them, and then deserializing them with the same data type for usage.

The issue lies in how Keras typically handles model weights. Underneath, these weights are often represented as TensorFlow tensors, which, by default, are of type `float32`. While `float32` offers sufficient accuracy for many deep learning tasks, there are circumstances where the finer granularity of `float64` is necessary. The standard Keras saving mechanisms, both for the complete model and just its weights, essentially serialize these `float32` tensors to disk without any explicit conversion.

The process of saving in 64-bit format, therefore, isn't a direct switch but rather a manual conversion. We first extract the model's weights, convert each weight tensor to `float64`, and then save these converted values, usually through a custom approach utilizing `numpy`. Similarly, during loading, we read the `float64` values, and then set those as the model weights; the model itself doesn't *operate* in 64-bit precision unless the operations are explicitly carried out in it, but, for use cases like numerical analysis, the weight values at this higher precision may be necessary. This process bypasses Keras’s default save function, therefore ensuring we serialize the weights as `float64`.

Here are three practical code examples illustrating how this can be achieved. Each focuses on saving weights using a slightly different technique.

**Example 1: Saving `float64` weights using `numpy.save`**

This approach is perhaps the simplest. We iterate through all the weight tensors of a model, convert each tensor's data type to `float64`, and then save each as an individual file using `numpy.save`. This method offers granular control over each weight tensor's storage.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Get the model's weight tensors
weights = model.get_weights()

# Path where the weights are saved
save_path = "model_weights_64"

# Save each converted weight tensor individually
for i, w in enumerate(weights):
    float64_w = w.astype(np.float64)
    np.save(f'{save_path}/weight_{i}.npy', float64_w)

print(f"64-bit weights saved to {save_path}")

# Loading and setting the weights

loaded_weights = []
for i in range(len(weights)):
    loaded_w = np.load(f'{save_path}/weight_{i}.npy')
    loaded_weights.append(loaded_w)

model.set_weights(loaded_weights)

print("64-bit weights loaded into model.")
```

*Commentary:* This script creates a simple sequential model, extracts its weights, and iterates through them. It converts each weight tensor to `float64` using `astype(np.float64)` and saves it as a `.npy` file with a descriptive name. When loading, `np.load` is used to retrieve the 64-bit data, before calling `model.set_weights`, enabling reconstruction of a model using the higher precision weights. This is simple, yet might prove cumbersome with very large models which could have a large number of tensors.

**Example 2: Saving `float64` weights using `numpy.savez`**

Instead of saving each weight tensor as a separate file, this approach bundles all converted weights into a single compressed archive using `numpy.savez`. This simplifies managing and transferring weights.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Get the model's weight tensors
weights = model.get_weights()

# Convert and save into single compressed archive
float64_weights = [w.astype(np.float64) for w in weights]
np.savez('model_weights_64.npz', *float64_weights)

print("64-bit weights saved to model_weights_64.npz")

# Loading weights

with np.load('model_weights_64.npz') as data:
    loaded_weights = [data[key] for key in data.files]
model.set_weights(loaded_weights)

print("64-bit weights loaded into model.")

```

*Commentary:* This script first converts all weight tensors into a list of `float64` arrays. It then utilizes `np.savez` to create a compressed archive containing all the converted weight arrays. The loading process uses `np.load` to load the archive and reconstructs the list of weights, enabling the `set_weights` operation. This method avoids a large number of individual files, which can be beneficial when handling complex models.

**Example 3: Saving and loading using custom file handling for larger models**

When dealing with very large models, memory usage during the conversion process can become an issue. This example shows how to use custom saving and loading routines with `numpy.memmap` for handling large weight tensors, allowing conversion without loading them entirely into memory. While this approach does not achieve a *true* streaming functionality, it's more memory efficient for large tensors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os
# Create a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Get the model's weight tensors
weights = model.get_weights()

save_path = "model_weights_64_memmap"
os.makedirs(save_path, exist_ok=True)

# Save weights to memory mapped files
for i, w in enumerate(weights):
    float64_w = w.astype(np.float64)
    memmap_file = os.path.join(save_path, f"weight_{i}.dat")
    fp = np.memmap(memmap_file, dtype='float64', mode='w+', shape=float64_w.shape)
    fp[:] = float64_w[:]
    del fp

print("64-bit weights saved using memmap.")


# Loading Weights back from memmap files
loaded_weights = []
for i,w in enumerate(weights):
    memmap_file = os.path.join(save_path, f"weight_{i}.dat")
    fp = np.memmap(memmap_file, dtype='float64', mode='r', shape=w.shape)
    loaded_weights.append(fp)
    del fp

model.set_weights(loaded_weights)
print("64-bit weights loaded from memmap.")

```
*Commentary:* Here, we use `numpy.memmap` to create a memory-mapped file. When saving, the weight tensors are converted to `float64` and then written to these memory-mapped arrays. Similarly, during loading, the memory-mapped arrays are loaded and directly set as the model's weights. `memmap` allows the data to be accessed without loading it all into RAM, providing a performance advantage for large models and limited memory environments. Each weight tensor is saved to its own dedicated file for simplicity of access. It is also important to `del fp` after usage, to deallocate the memory-mapped arrays when no longer required.

In summary, saving Keras model weights in a 64-bit format necessitates converting the underlying weight tensors before serialization, as Keras’s standard save operations don't provide this functionality directly. The most common method is to extract weights, convert them to `float64` using `numpy`, and then save them using techniques like `numpy.save`, `numpy.savez`, or, for larger models, with `numpy.memmap` to handle memory usage. Proper loading requires reading these `float64` values and setting them back as model weights. While the model itself won't *operate* in 64-bit precision without further modifications, this achieves saving weights at the higher-precision, a useful first step.

For further information on tensor manipulation and storage, consult the TensorFlow documentation, specifically on data types and tensor operations. The Numpy documentation provides comprehensive details on `numpy.save`, `numpy.savez`, and `numpy.memmap`. I would also recommend referencing literature on data representation in machine learning.
