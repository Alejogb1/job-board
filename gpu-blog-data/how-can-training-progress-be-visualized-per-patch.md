Visualizing training progress per patch and epoch requires a nuanced approach, carefully considering the dimensionality of the data.  My experience optimizing large-scale convolutional neural networks for satellite imagery analysis revealed that simply plotting loss or accuracy aggregates across epochs obscures crucial information about the model's performance at a granular level.  Effective visualization necessitates a multi-faceted strategy incorporating both aggregate metrics and patch-level analyses.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The challenge lies in reconciling the high-level epoch-based progress with the fine-grained information available at the patch level.  Each epoch represents a complete pass through the training dataset.  However, the dataset itself is composed of numerous patches, each representing a smaller region of the input data.  The model updates its weights based on the errors calculated across all patches in each epoch.  Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of training progress requires visualizing both the overall trend (epoch-wise) and the performance variations across individual patches.

A simple epoch-level plot showing loss or accuracy is inadequate, as it doesn't reveal spatial information or potential inconsistencies in model learning across different regions of the input data.  For instance, a model might learn effectively from patches representing one type of feature but struggle with others.  Such issues are masked by aggregate metrics.

To address this, a multi-level visualization approach is necessary. This involves:

* **Epoch-level aggregate plots:**  Standard plots showcasing the training and validation loss and accuracy over each epoch provide the overall training trend.
* **Patch-level visualizations:**  This requires more sophisticated techniques to represent the performance (e.g., loss, prediction accuracy) on individual patches throughout the training process.  This can be done using heatmaps, image overlays, or other spatially-aware visualizations.
* **Per-patch metric analysis:**  Calculating and tracking specific metrics for each patch over epochs enables the identification of persistently problematic patches.

By combining these three visualization strategies, a thorough understanding of the training process can be achieved, highlighting both overall trends and potential issues at a patch level.  This allows for targeted intervention and model improvement.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate different aspects of visualizing training progress, assuming a PyTorch environment.  These are simplified illustrative examples and may require adaptation for specific use cases and dataset characteristics.

**Example 1: Epoch-level loss and accuracy plot:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume 'train_losses' and 'val_losses' are lists containing loss values for each epoch
# Similarly, 'train_accuracies' and 'val_accuracies' contain accuracy values

epochs = range(1, len(train_losses) + 1)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(epochs, train_losses, label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(epochs, val_losses, label='Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(epochs, train_accuracies, label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(epochs, val_accuracies, label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This code generates a simple plot showing training and validation loss and accuracy across epochs.  This provides the high-level overview of training progress.


**Example 2:  Patch-level loss heatmap at the final epoch:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Assume 'patch_losses' is a NumPy array representing loss values for each patch at the final epoch.
#  The array should be reshaped to match the spatial dimensions of the input data.

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.imshow(patch_losses.reshape(image_height, image_width), cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar(label='Loss')
plt.title('Patch-Level Loss (Final Epoch)')
plt.show()
```

This code snippet generates a heatmap representing the loss associated with each patch at the end of training.  High loss values are indicated by darker colors.  This allows for the identification of regions where the model performed poorly. The `image_height` and `image_width` variables would need to be defined appropriately for your data.

**Example 3: Tracking patch-level accuracy over epochs:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume 'patch_accuracies' is a dictionary where keys are epoch numbers and values are lists of patch-level accuracies.

epochs = sorted(patch_accuracies.keys())
num_patches = len(patch_accuracies[epochs[0]])

for i in range(num_patches):
    patch_acc_over_epochs = [patch_accuracies[epoch][i] for epoch in epochs]
    plt.plot(epochs, patch_acc_over_epochs, label=f'Patch {i+1}')

plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.title('Patch-Level Accuracy Over Epochs')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This code plots the accuracy of individual patches over all epochs.  This helps understand the learning trajectory of individual patches, revealing patches that show slow or inconsistent learning.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For detailed information on visualizing data and creating effective plots, I recommend exploring comprehensive resources on data visualization techniques and best practices.  Studying existing literature on evaluating deep learning models and specific works on visualizing convolutional neural network performance will prove extremely beneficial.  Furthermore, examining the documentation for visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn is crucial for mastering the intricacies of plot customization.  Finally, exploring case studies of similar visualization efforts in your domain will highlight relevant techniques and interpretations.
