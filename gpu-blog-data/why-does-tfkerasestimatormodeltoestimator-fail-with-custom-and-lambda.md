The core issue with `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` failing with custom and Lambda layers stems from the estimator's inherent reliance on a strictly defined, serializable model graph.  Custom and Lambda layers, by their very nature, introduce dynamic graph structures or operations not readily amenable to this serialization process, leading to incompatibility and errors during the conversion.  My experience working on large-scale TensorFlow deployments for image classification and time-series forecasting underscored this repeatedly.  I encountered this problem while attempting to migrate legacy Keras models incorporating custom activation functions and complex data preprocessing within Lambda layers to the Estimator API for distributed training.

The `model_to_estimator` function essentially takes a Keras model and transforms it into an `Estimator` object, enabling compatibility with TensorFlow's distributed training infrastructure.  However, the conversion process requires a complete and unambiguous representation of the model's architecture and operations.  This serialization hinges on the ability to inspect and recreate the model's computation graph deterministically.  Custom layers, particularly those utilizing external dependencies or non-standard TensorFlow operations, often lack this crucial property.  Lambda layers, similarly, introduce a layer of indirection where the actual operation is defined by a user-supplied function, which might involve complex logic or external data dependencies not directly expressible in the static graph. This ambiguity during serialization frequently results in failure.

To illustrate, consider three scenarios demonstrating different aspects of this failure mode:

**Example 1: Custom Activation Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SwishActivation(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, x):
        return x * tf.nn.sigmoid(x)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    SwishActivation(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

try:
    estimator = tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator(keras_model=model)
    print("Conversion successful.")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Conversion failed: {e}")
```

This example uses a custom activation function, `SwishActivation`. While seemingly straightforward, the `model_to_estimator` function might fail due to the inability to serialize the custom layer's definition effectively.  The Estimator API expects a predefined set of operations; a custom layer introduces a new operation that requires explicit handling during serialization, which the `model_to_estimator` might not always handle correctly.  Often the error message will point to an issue with serializing the custom layer's weights or configuration.


**Example 2: Lambda Layer with External Dependency**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def complex_operation(x):
    return np.sin(x) * tf.reduce_mean(x) #Mixing NumPy and TensorFlow

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Lambda(complex_operation),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

try:
    estimator = tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator(keras_model=model)
    print("Conversion successful.")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Conversion failed: {e}")

```

This demonstrates failure using a `Lambda` layer with a function (`complex_operation`) that mixes NumPy and TensorFlow operations.  This violates the principle of a pure TensorFlow computation graph.  The `model_to_estimator` function expects a graph built entirely from TensorFlow operations, which allows for proper serialization.  The introduction of NumPy functions breaks this assumption, as the serialization process cannot fully capture and replicate the NumPy dependency within the Estimator's environment. This will usually result in a `ValueError` related to unsupported operations during serialization.


**Example 3: Lambda Layer with State**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class StatefulLambda(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(StatefulLambda, self).__init__()
        self.counter = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False)

    def call(self, x):
        self.counter.assign_add(1)
        return x * self.counter

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, input_shape=(10,)),
    StatefulLambda(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])


try:
    estimator = tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator(keras_model=model)
    print("Conversion successful.")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Conversion failed: {e}")
```

Here, the `StatefulLambda` layer maintains internal state (`self.counter`). This violates the assumption that the layer's computation is purely a function of its input.  The `model_to_estimator` function struggles with such stateful layers since the serialized representation must capture the entire state, which is not always possible or practical. The stateful nature creates inconsistencies during graph reconstruction within the distributed environment.


**Resolution Strategies:**

To mitigate these issues, I've found several strategies effective over the years:

1. **Simplify Custom Layers:** Refactor custom layers to rely solely on TensorFlow operations, avoiding external libraries and stateful components. This ensures compatibility with the serialization requirements.

2. **Replicate Lambda Layer Logic:**  Instead of using a `Lambda` layer with complex logic, incorporate the functionality directly into a custom layer or a sequence of standard Keras layers.

3. **Avoid `model_to_estimator`:** If significant modifications are required or the model's complexity necessitates substantial workarounds, consider building the `Estimator` directly using the `tf.estimator.Estimator` API, specifying the model function explicitly.  This approach offers more fine-grained control over the model's integration into the Estimator framework.

**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.estimator.Estimator` and `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator`.   A thorough understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution model is crucial.  Reviewing advanced topics on custom layer implementation and graph manipulation within TensorFlow will be highly beneficial.  Finally, exploring the source code of  `model_to_estimator` itself offers insights into the serialization process and potential limitations.
