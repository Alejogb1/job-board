My experience debugging Tensorflow models, specifically custom layers, has repeatedly shown that an incorrect argument being passed to a `Layer.call` function usually stems from a misunderstanding of how Tensorflow manages input tensors during the forward pass, particularly within `tf.keras` models. The `call` method of a custom layer does not directly receive the original input data provided to the model, but rather intermediate tensors resulting from the preceding layers' operations. Therefore, a discrepancy between what a layer expects and what it actually receives is a common source of error.

Typically, a layer’s `call` method is designed to accept a single tensor or a sequence of tensors as the first positional argument, often labeled `inputs`. When building a `tf.keras.Model`, which implicitly creates a computational graph, Tensorflow passes the output tensor(s) from the preceding layer(s) into the `call` method of the current layer. This graph construction process ensures the correct data flows through the network. However, if you manipulate the input tensors improperly, such as reshaping them outside of the layer, or if there is a mismatch in tensor shapes due to inconsistent operations in prior layers, the `call` method might receive something unexpected.

Specifically, the type of argument, its shape, and its rank are common points of failure. The `call` method expects inputs that are compatible with its internal operations, like matrix multiplication, or reshaping. A scalar passed to a layer expecting a rank-2 tensor will, predictably, cause an issue.

Another common situation involves layers that internally maintain learnable parameters, like `tf.keras.layers.Dense` which has weights and biases. These layers have their `build` method called once they are initialized. The `build` method usually takes the shape of the input tensor (or a shape spec) as a parameter to initialize these parameters. If the input tensor shape is not consistent with the initialized parameter sizes, unexpected errors during the forward pass become inevitable.

To further clarify, let’s examine these situations with some hypothetical code examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect Reshape Outside Layer**

Assume you want to reshape input tensor before it arrives to your custom layer. Here, I've created a simplistic layer, `MyDense`, which expects a tensor of rank 2 as input for matrix multiplication.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyDense, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.w = None
        self.b = None

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                               initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                               initializer='zeros', trainable=True)


    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b


# Example usage with incorrect reshape
input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 10)) # Batch of 100, each sample has 10 features

reshaped_input = tf.reshape(input_data, (1, 100, 10))  # Incorrect Reshape Before Layer
my_dense_layer = MyDense(5)
output = my_dense_layer(reshaped_input)

print("Output Shape:", output.shape)
```

The intent is to apply the layer to an input of shape (100, 10). However, the input is reshaped to (1, 100, 10) before being passed to the `MyDense` layer. The `build` method would initialize the weight matrix based on a shape (10), while the `call` method now receives a tensor of shape (1, 100, 10). This shape is incompatible with the matrix multiplication defined in the call. Therefore, the `call` method of `MyDense` would receive the incorrect input rank and would result in a shape mismatch error. The user would likely misinterpret the error as relating to the custom layer when the actual issue is the preceding reshape operation. The error message would highlight this.

**Example 2: Incorrect Layer Configuration Affecting Shape**

Here, assume two custom layers. One layer, `MyReshape`, reshapes the input, and the second, `MyMatrixMul`, performs matrix multiplication, expecting the output of the `MyReshape`. However, there’s a mistake in the `MyReshape` definition.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyReshape(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, new_shape):
        super(MyReshape, self).__init__()
        self.new_shape = new_shape

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.reshape(inputs, self.new_shape)


class MyMatrixMul(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyMatrixMul, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.w = None


    def build(self, input_shape):
       self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                             initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)


    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)


# Example usage:

input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 10))

reshape_layer = MyReshape((100, 2, 5)) # Intended to reshape from (100,10) -> (100, 2, 5).
matmul_layer = MyMatrixMul(3)

output = matmul_layer(reshape_layer(input_data))
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
```

The intention is for `MyReshape` to take an input of shape (100, 10) and output (100, 2, 5). This is based on the understanding that the last dimension from reshaped data `(2, 5)` must match the expected input of MyMatrixMul. `MyMatrixMul` then multiplies the reshaped tensor by its weight matrix. However, in this case, the last dimension of `(2, 5)` is 5. The `build` method for `matmul_layer` initializes based on input being (..., 5) and creates a weight of shape (5, 3). The multiplication should now proceed. However, a mistake in the layer config was introduced. Instead of the intended (100,2,5), it takes the (100, 10) and reshapes it to (100, 2, 5). Here, the `call` method of `MyMatrixMul` will have the right input shape. The bug was not within this layer.

**Example 3: Incorrect Input Type (Not a Tensor)**

A less frequent issue, though important to highlight, is attempting to pass a non-tensor type into the `call` function. This could occur when a preprocessing operation fails to return a tensor and returns instead a Python primitive. Consider a scenario where you manipulate the input within a custom layer, accidentally returning a list of numbers instead of a tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class IncorrectTypeLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(IncorrectTypeLayer, self).__init__()

    def call(self, inputs):
       # Intentional error - return list instead of tensor.
       return [tf.reduce_sum(x).numpy() for x in tf.unstack(inputs)]


input_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 5))
layer = IncorrectTypeLayer()
output = layer(input_tensor)
print(output)
```
The `call` method iterates through the input tensor and returns a list of NumPy floats. This list, not a tensor, will then cause subsequent layers expecting tensors to fail when they receive this list. This example demonstrates that while the function may appear to execute, the output is not a compatible TensorFlow object. The error will typically surface during a computation involving this output in the subsequent layers.

To address such issues, methodical debugging is necessary. Using `tf.shape(inputs)` within a layer's `call` method, and printing it can help you immediately understand what your layer is receiving. Moreover, using print statements to track the shapes of tensors after operations such as reshaping can pinpoint at what exact point an incorrect tensor manipulation occurs. Utilizing Tensorflow's debugging tools, or an IDE debugger, can prove invaluable when pinpointing these mismatches. Always ensure that all input preprocessing operations result in tensors and that the shape of the tensor conforms to the expected shape before it's passed to the layer.

For further learning on working with custom layers in Tensorflow, I recommend exploring the official Tensorflow documentation regarding custom layers and models within the `tf.keras` API. The “Guide on Custom Layers and Models” is especially valuable. Also, several good online learning platforms offer courses on deep learning and Tensorflow that delve deeper into the nuances of building custom layers and models and address debugging these situations. In addition to official documentation, studying code implementations from open-source projects or even reproducing the existing layers within `tf.keras.layers` from scratch, will also assist in understanding the underlying mechanics and avoiding such errors. A good knowledge of linear algebra and tensor operations are also required to fully understand the process. These approaches will build a solid foundational knowledge to troubleshoot these kinds of errors.
