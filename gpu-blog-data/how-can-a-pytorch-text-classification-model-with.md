Porting a PyTorch text classification model that utilizes a Keras tokenizer to Deeplearning4j (DL4J) for production deployment necessitates a careful bridge between these two distinct ecosystems. The core challenge lies in mapping the trained PyTorch model's architecture and weights, along with the pre-processing logic of the Keras tokenizer, onto equivalent structures and operations within the Java-based DL4J framework. This process is not a direct, one-to-one translation; it requires understanding the fundamental concepts of both libraries and implementing suitable transformations.

The first crucial step is extracting the model architecture and learned weights from PyTorch. PyTorch models are defined using classes that inherit from `torch.nn.Module`, and their weights are stored as `torch.Tensor` objects. I've frequently used `torch.save()` to serialize the entire model state, including parameters, for later use or transfer. In our scenario, we would need to load this saved state into memory, analyze the layers, and meticulously replicate the equivalent structures in DL4J. This architectural mapping involves defining a neural network in DL4J using `ComputationGraph`, specifying equivalent layer types such as `DenseLayer`, `EmbeddingLayer`, `LSTM`, or `Conv1DLayer`, and setting the corresponding activation functions. The challenge here isn't merely about naming the layers similarly; it's about ensuring that the connectivity and output dimensions of each layer match precisely between the two models.

Moving from PyTorch’s tensor-based representations to DL4J’s ND4J array representation is crucial for weight transfer. The weight tensors from the PyTorch model, accessed through the `state_dict()` method, are essentially multi-dimensional arrays. These tensors need to be transferred and converted into ND4J’s `INDArray` type while also paying attention to memory layout differences, such as row-major and column-major order. This conversion often involves reshaping and transposing tensors as well as a correct reordering when handling dimensions in convolutional operations. The bias terms also need a similar type of conversion.

The second key element is the Keras tokenizer. The tokenizer converts text into sequences of numerical IDs, and this pre-processing step is critical for achieving correct input to the neural network. I often find myself having to replicate this in another system, and this process is not trivial as a direct equivalent of Keras’ Tokenizer doesn't exist in DL4J. The core of the Keras tokenizer involves creating a word index mapping words to unique integers, often built from a corpus of training data. Additionally, the Keras tokenizer typically performs operations such as tokenization, lower casing, filtering out punctuation, and padding sequences. The challenge is not only to replicate this logic but to handle potential out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in a consistent manner. My usual practice when migrating tokenizers is to serialize the word index (a dictionary or map data structure) from Keras, often into a JSON file. This serialized data allows me to build a corresponding map in the Java environment. For tokenization itself, I often resort to using an existing Java library for text tokenization, and implement a manual mapping based on this pre-loaded index.

In terms of the DL4J model creation, I have found that starting with a basic model that can be further extended based on requirement is often the best course. The first example below shows a simple sequential model that takes a 1000-dimension vocabulary. We have to convert the weights and initialize it based on our PyTorch equivalent model.

public class BasicTextModel {

    public static MultiLayerNetwork createModel(int vocabularySize, int embeddingDim, int hiddenUnits, int numClasses) {

        MultiLayerConfiguration conf = new NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder()
                .seed(12345)
                .optimizationAlgo(OptimizationAlgorithm.STOCHASTIC_GRADIENT_DESCENT)

                .list()
                    .layer(0, new EmbeddingLayer.Builder()
                            .nIn(vocabularySize)
                            .nOut(embeddingDim)
                            .build())
                     .layer(1, new DenseLayer.Builder()
                             .nIn(embeddingDim)
                             .nOut(hiddenUnits)
                             .activation(Activation.RELU)
                             .build())
                    .layer(2, new OutputLayer.Builder(LossFunctions.LossFunction.MCXENT)
                            .activation(Activation.SOFTMAX)
                            .nIn(hiddenUnits)
                            .nOut(numClasses)
                            .build())
                .build();

        return new MultiLayerNetwork(conf);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
       int vocabularySize = 1000;
       int embeddingDim = 128;
       int hiddenUnits = 64;
       int numClasses = 2;


        MultiLayerNetwork model = createModel(vocabularySize, embeddingDim, hiddenUnits, numClasses);
        model.init();

        // At this point weights can be set from saved tensors

        System.out.println("Model created.");

    }
}
```

In this example, the Java code sets up a basic three layer network. The `EmbeddingLayer` handles the initial mapping of tokens to vector representations. The `DenseLayer` introduces a hidden layer with ReLU activation. Finally, an `OutputLayer` provides the predictions with a Softmax activation for probability distribution across different classes.  The weights of these layers must be populated from the PyTorch model. The weights of each corresponding layer can be set using the `setParam()` function that takes the layer index and name as parameters.

The second example builds on the first one by including some simple sequence processing, specifically a unidirectional LSTM. It also handles the input with a sequence length, which is common in text processing.

public class LSTMTextModel {

    public static MultiLayerNetwork createModel(int vocabularySize, int embeddingDim, int lstmUnits, int hiddenUnits, int numClasses, int sequenceLength) {

        MultiLayerConfiguration conf = new NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder()
                .seed(12345)
                .optimizationAlgo(OptimizationAlgorithm.STOCHASTIC_GRADIENT_DESCENT)
                .updater(new Adam(0.001))
                .weightInit(WeightInit.XAVIER)
                .list()
                    .layer(0, new EmbeddingLayer.Builder()
                            .nIn(vocabularySize)
                            .nOut(embeddingDim)
                            .build())
                     .layer(1, new LSTM.Builder()
                         .nIn(embeddingDim)
                         .nOut(lstmUnits)
                         .activation(Activation.TANH)
                         .build())
                     .layer(2, new DenseLayer.Builder()
                         .nIn(lstmUnits)
                         .nOut(hiddenUnits)
                         .activation(Activation.RELU)
                         .build())
                    .layer(3, new OutputLayer.Builder(LossFunctions.LossFunction.MCXENT)
                            .activation(Activation.SOFTMAX)
                            .nIn(hiddenUnits)
                            .nOut(numClasses)
                            .build())
                .build();
        MultiLayerNetwork model = new MultiLayerNetwork(conf);
        model.init();

        // Set the mask if dealing with sequences
        // INDArray mask = Nd4j.ones(1, sequenceLength); // Example mask assuming fixed length
       // model.getLayer(1).setMaskArray(mask);
        return model;
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
       int vocabularySize = 1000;
       int embeddingDim = 128;
       int lstmUnits = 100;
       int hiddenUnits = 64;
       int numClasses = 2;
       int sequenceLength = 50;


        MultiLayerNetwork model = createModel(vocabularySize, embeddingDim, lstmUnits, hiddenUnits, numClasses, sequenceLength);

        //Set weights

        System.out.println("LSTM model created.");

    }
}
```

This Java code introduces an LSTM layer after the Embedding layer. The `LSTM` layer processes the input sequence and passes its output to a `DenseLayer`, which handles the hidden units before the output. Again, the masks and weights have to be handled explicitly.

Finally, here is a basic code snippet that shows how we can load a Keras tokenizer from a JSON file and use it to tokenize text in Java. The focus here is to demonstrate how you can mimic the functionality. A detailed explanation regarding tokenizing a complete text is out of scope, however, this should give a clear idea.

```java
import org.json.JSONObject;
import org.json.JSONArray;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class KerasTokenizer {

     private HashMap<String, Integer> wordIndex;
     private  Pattern pattern;

     public KerasTokenizer(String jsonPath) throws IOException {
       loadWordIndexFromJson(jsonPath);
       //Pattern for splitting tokens - adjust for more complex tokenization if needed
       pattern = Pattern.compile("\\s+");
     }

     private void loadWordIndexFromJson(String jsonPath) throws IOException {
         String content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(jsonPath)));
         JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject(content);
         JSONObject wordIndexJson = jsonObject.getJSONObject("word_index");

         wordIndex = new HashMap<>();
         for(String key: wordIndexJson.keySet()){
          wordIndex.put(key, wordIndexJson.getInt(key));
         }
     }

    public List<Integer> tokenize(String text) {
        List<String> tokens = Arrays.asList(pattern.split(text.toLowerCase())); // simple tokenization
        List<Integer> sequence = new ArrayList<>();

        for(String token : tokens){
            if(wordIndex.containsKey(token)){
               sequence.add(wordIndex.get(token));
            }else {
               sequence.add(1); // Handling OOV, index 1 is typically reserved for OOV

            }

        }

        return sequence;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      try {

          KerasTokenizer tokenizer = new KerasTokenizer("tokenizer.json");
          String text = "This is an example text to tokenize";
          List<Integer> sequence = tokenizer.tokenize(text);
          System.out.println("Tokenized sequence: " + sequence);

      }catch (IOException e) {
          System.out.println("Unable to load tokenizer" + e.getMessage());
      }
    }

}
```

In this class, I load the word index from a json file. The `tokenize()` method converts a string to a list of integers using the pre-loaded index. Note that the simple tokenization (splitting based on whitespace and lower casing) will need to be adjusted based on Keras tokenizer settings in your original Python notebook. You also have to decide how you want to handle OOV tokens based on the Keras tokenizer settings.

In summary, the migration involves meticulously replicating the PyTorch model architecture using DL4J classes, transferring the learned weights with attention to tensor formats and dimensions, implementing the Keras tokenization logic, and performing thorough testing at each stage. This is not a trivial task and requires a good understanding of both frameworks and a lot of painstaking effort. In my experience, this is a time-consuming but doable task if each step is performed with sufficient accuracy. For production deployment, careful performance tuning and error handling need to be added, which are outside of the scope here.

For further study, I would recommend reading the DL4J documentation focusing on `ComputationGraph` and specific layer configurations. Understanding of the DL4J ND4J array manipulation functionalities is also essential. Also, reading the Keras documentation related to tokenizers and associated pre-processing steps would be beneficial.
