TensorFlow's graph execution model, particularly in the pre-eager execution era (which I extensively worked with during my time developing large-scale NLP models), presents unique challenges when it comes to iterating over tensor contents within the graph itself.  Directly looping over a tensor's elements isn't possible in the same manner as with NumPy arrays; the graph's computational steps are defined beforehand, and runtime iteration necessitates specific mechanisms.  The key lies in leveraging TensorFlow operations that can process tensors element-wise or in batches, effectively achieving the desired iteration.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Iteration within TensorFlow's graph execution relies on defining operations that mimic iterative behavior. This isn't a direct loop in the Python sense; instead, we utilize TensorFlow's built-in functions to apply operations across tensor elements.  The core strategies include:

* **`tf.map_fn`:** This function applies a given function to each element (or a slice of elements) of a tensor. It's crucial for element-wise operations requiring individual processing.  The applied function must also be a TensorFlow operation, not a standard Python function.

* **`tf.while_loop`:**  For more complex scenarios requiring conditional execution or a variable number of iterations based on tensor contents, `tf.while_loop` provides a way to construct loops within the graph.  This involves defining a condition tensor which determines loop termination and updating state tensors within each iteration.

* **`tf.scan`:** This function applies a cumulative operation across a tensor's elements. It's suitable for scenarios where the result of one iteration affects the next, such as recursive calculations or cumulative sums.

The choice of method depends on the specific iterative task.  Simple element-wise operations are best suited for `tf.map_fn`.  Cases requiring conditional logic or stateful updates are handled by `tf.while_loop`.  Cumulative operations across the tensor's elements are ideal for `tf.scan`.  Crucially, remember that these operations themselves become part of the computational graph, executed during the graph's execution, not during Python's interpretation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: `tf.map_fn` for Element-wise Squaring**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor
tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Define a function to square each element.  Note this is a TensorFlow operation.
def square_element(x):
  return tf.square(x)

# Apply the function to each element using tf.map_fn
squared_tensor = tf.map_fn(square_element, tensor)

# Initialize the session (for older TensorFlow versions; eager execution simplifies this)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(squared_tensor)
    print(result)  # Output: [ 1  4  9 16 25]
```

This example demonstrates the simplest use case.  `tf.map_fn` iterates through `tensor`, applying `square_element` to each element individually. The resulting `squared_tensor` contains the squared values.  This avoids explicit looping within the graph.


**Example 2: `tf.while_loop` for Conditional Summation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize variables for the loop
i = tf.constant(0)
sum_tensor = tf.constant(0.0)
limit = tf.constant(5)

# Define the condition for the loop
condition = lambda i, sum_tensor: tf.less(i, limit)

# Define the body of the loop (TensorFlow operations only)
body = lambda i, sum_tensor: (tf.add(i, 1), tf.add(sum_tensor, tf.cast(i, tf.float32)))


# Run the while loop
_, final_sum = tf.while_loop(condition, body, [i, sum_tensor])

# Initialize the session (for older TensorFlow versions)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(final_sum)
    print(result)  # Output: 10.0
```

This example showcases `tf.while_loop`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `limit`. Inside the loop, `i` is incremented, and its value is cumulatively added to `sum_tensor`. The final result is the sum of integers from 0 to 4.  Note the careful use of TensorFlow operations within the `body` function.


**Example 3: `tf.scan` for Cumulative Product**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor
tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Define a function to accumulate the product
def cumulative_product(a, b):
  return a * b

# Apply the function cumulatively using tf.scan
cumulative_tensor = tf.scan(cumulative_product, tensor)

# Initialize the session (for older TensorFlow versions)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(cumulative_tensor)
    print(result)  # Output: [ 1  2  6 24 120]
```

Here, `tf.scan` efficiently computes the cumulative product.  The `cumulative_product` function takes the previous result and the current element, returning their product.  `tf.scan` applies this cumulatively across the entire tensor. This approach is highly efficient for such cumulative operations, avoiding explicit looping.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution, I recommend studying the official TensorFlow documentation's sections on graph construction and control flow operations.  Furthermore, reviewing tutorials and examples focused specifically on `tf.map_fn`, `tf.while_loop`, and `tf.scan` will solidify understanding and enable tackling more complex scenarios.  A good grasp of TensorFlow's fundamental concepts, including tensors, operations, and sessions (or the equivalent in later versions), is also prerequisite for effective graph manipulation.  Finally, exploring advanced topics like custom gradients can be beneficial for complex scenarios involving iterative computations within the graph.
