The root cause of your MintTo contract's ERC721 transfer failure stems from the recipient contract's lack of adherence to the ERC721Receiver interface.  Specifically, the absence of a correctly implemented `onERC721Received` function is triggering a revert condition within the ERC721 standard's transfer logic.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work developing and auditing various NFT projects, particularly when integrating with third-party contracts whose implementation details are not readily apparent.  Let's delve into the specifics.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The ERC721 standard mandates that when transferring an NFT to a contract address (rather than an EOA â€“ Externally Owned Account), the receiving contract *must* implement the `ERC721Receiver` interface. This interface defines a single function: `onERC721Received`.  This function receives four parameters:  `operator`, `from`, `tokenId`, and `data`.  Its purpose is to allow the recipient contract to process the received NFT and signal successful acceptance via its return value.

Crucially, the `onERC721Received` function must return a `bytes4` value equal to `bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`. This specific value, often referred to as the `ERC721_RECEIVED` selector, acts as a confirmation signal to the transferring contract. If the function returns any other value or reverts, the ERC721 transfer fails, typically resulting in a revert exception visible in your transaction trace.

The failure isn't inherently within your `MintTo` contract's code.  Instead, it's a consequence of the incompatibility between your `MintTo` contract (which correctly implements ERC721 transfer logic) and the recipient contract that lacks the necessary `ERC721Receiver` implementation.  This indicates a design flaw in the recipient contract, not in your minting mechanism.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct `ERC721Receiver` Implementation:**

```solidity
interface IERC721Receiver {
    function onERC721Received(address operator, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes4);
}

contract MyNFTReceiver is IERC721Receiver {
    function onERC721Received(address operator, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external override returns (bytes4) {
        // Process the received NFT (e.g., store it, update internal state)
        // ... your logic here ...

        return IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector; //Return the expected selector
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates the correct implementation.  The contract inherits the `IERC721Receiver` interface and overrides the `onERC721Received` function.  The crucial aspect is the return statement, which explicitly provides the `ERC721_RECEIVED` selector, guaranteeing acceptance of the NFT.  The commented section indicates where your custom NFT processing logic would reside.  Failure to return the correct selector will cause the transfer to fail.

**Example 2: Incorrect `ERC721Receiver` Implementation (Missing Selector):**

```solidity
interface IERC721Receiver {
    function onERC721Received(address operator, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes4);
}

contract IncorrectNFTReceiver is IERC721Receiver {
    function onERC721Received(address operator, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external override returns (bytes4) {
        // Process the received NFT (e.g., store it, update internal state)
        // ... your logic here ...

        // Missing the correct return value! This will cause the transfer to revert
        return 0x0; 
    }
}
```

This example showcases a common error. The contract implements the function, but it fails to return the expected `bytes4` value.  The return value `0x0` will trigger the revert in the ERC721 transfer.  Even if the internal processing logic within `onERC721Received` executes successfully, the incorrect return value nullifies the transfer.

**Example 3: Incorrect `ERC721Receiver` Implementation (Missing Function):**

```solidity
// This contract does NOT implement the IERC721Receiver interface
contract MissingNFTReceiver {
    // ... other functions ...
}
```

This contract completely omits the `onERC721Received` function.  This absence directly violates the ERC721 standard's requirement, leading to the transfer reverting.  Attempting to send an NFT to this contract will invariably result in failure.  The lack of interface implementation is a fundamental flaw.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further study, I suggest consulting the official ERC721 specification document.  This document provides the definitive guide to the standard's behavior and requirements.  Additionally, a thorough understanding of the Solidity programming language and smart contract best practices is indispensable for resolving such issues. Finally, exploring well-documented open-source ERC721 implementations can offer valuable insights into correct coding patterns.  Scrutinizing these resources will equip you to effectively debug and prevent similar issues in future projects.

In conclusion, the failure of your `MintTo` contract's ERC721 transfer is not a defect within your minting logic but rather a direct consequence of the recipient contract's inadequate adherence to the ERC721Receiver interface.  Ensuring the recipient contract correctly implements `onERC721Received` and returns the appropriate selector is paramount for successful NFT transfers to contract addresses.  Thorough testing and auditing of both your minting contract and the receiving contract are crucial steps in preventing such issues.  My experience suggests this type of error is easily overlooked during initial development, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive testing procedures.
