COBOL, despite its age, remains critical in many legacy systems, and managing overlapping errors, particularly in complex batch processing, can become a significant challenge. Overlapping errors occur when multiple program sections attempt to report errors on similar or related data sets, potentially leading to a cascade of unhelpful and misleading diagnostic messages. From my experience maintaining a large insurance claim processing system, the core issue isn't just that errors occur, but that their reporting mechanisms can interfere with each other, obscuring the true root cause and delaying resolution. Effective debugging requires not just identifying individual errors, but also understanding their interdependencies.

The principal difficulty arises from COBOL's historical nature, which often results in procedural code heavily reliant on global variables and section-based processing. Without a structured error-handling approach, multiple sections or paragraphs might independently flag errors related to the same record or data element. For example, consider three sections: data validation, claim logic processing, and database update. Each section might encounter issues with the same claim record, and each might trigger a unique error message or flag. If not managed correctly, these overlapping signals can create a cacophony, making it difficult to determine the initial failure point. The resulting diagnostic log might contain multiple, seemingly unrelated errors, when they stem from a single root cause.

To address this, I typically adopt a hierarchical error handling approach coupled with judicious use of conditional evaluation and structured error flags. The goal is to establish a system that reports the earliest encountered error and suppresses subsequent, dependent errors. This is achieved by using global error flags carefully managed at section entry and exit points.

The first step involves creating a dedicated WORKING-STORAGE section to house error flags and error messages. For example:

```cobol
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01  ERROR-FLAGS.
           05  WS-ERR-DATA-INVALID       PIC X VALUE 'N'.
           05  WS-ERR-CLAIM-LOGIC        PIC X VALUE 'N'.
           05  WS-ERR-DATABASE           PIC X VALUE 'N'.
           05  WS-ERR-RECORD-REJECTED    PIC X VALUE 'N'.
       01  ERROR-MESSAGES.
           05  WS-MSG-DATA-INVALID       PIC X(50) VALUE
               'Invalid data format found for claim record'.
           05  WS-MSG-CLAIM-LOGIC        PIC X(50) VALUE
               'Claim processing logic failure detected'.
           05  WS-MSG-DATABASE           PIC X(50) VALUE
               'Database update error occurred'.
           05  WS-MSG-RECORD-REJECTED   PIC X(50) VALUE
                'Record rejected due to fatal error'.

```
Here, I establish a set of flags indicating whether a specific type of error has occurred and corresponding messages. Initializing these flags to 'N' ensures no error is initially assumed. This setup provides a central location for error tracking and makes it simpler to determine the execution flow related to error occurrence. Each section can reference these flags, which allows for conditional error message generation and suppression.

The next critical element is embedding conditional evaluations within each major processing section of the COBOL program.  This ensures only the first encountered error for a given record is reported. Consider a simplified data validation section:

```cobol
       DATA-VALIDATION SECTION.
           IF WS-ERR-RECORD-REJECTED = 'Y'
               GO TO DATA-VALIDATION-EXIT.

           MOVE 'N' TO WS-ERR-DATA-INVALID.
           IF CLAIM-NUMBER NOT NUMERIC OR
              CLAIM-DATE NOT NUMERIC OR
              CLAIM-AMOUNT NOT NUMERIC
                 MOVE 'Y' TO WS-ERR-DATA-INVALID
                 DISPLAY WS-MSG-DATA-INVALID
           END-IF.

           IF WS-ERR-DATA-INVALID = 'Y'
              MOVE 'Y' TO WS-ERR-RECORD-REJECTED
           END-IF.

       DATA-VALIDATION-EXIT.
           EXIT.
```

In this section, I initially check if the `WS-ERR-RECORD-REJECTED` flag is already set. This flag, if set in a previous section, implies that a higher-priority error has already occurred. If thatâ€™s the case, the validation section immediately exits, avoiding the generation of any further errors associated with this specific record. If no prior error has been identified, the validation logic is executed, and `WS-ERR-DATA-INVALID` flag is set and message displayed accordingly, followed by setting `WS-ERR-RECORD-REJECTED` when validation fails, to suppress errors in later processing sections.

The third example illustrates how subsequent sections react to the error flags, allowing for controlled skipping of further processing:
```cobol
       CLAIM-LOGIC-PROCESSING SECTION.
           IF WS-ERR-RECORD-REJECTED = 'Y'
                GO TO CLAIM-LOGIC-PROCESSING-EXIT.

           MOVE 'N' TO WS-ERR-CLAIM-LOGIC.
           * Claim processing logic here.
           IF CLAIM-PROCESSING-ERROR
                MOVE 'Y' TO WS-ERR-CLAIM-LOGIC
                DISPLAY WS-MSG-CLAIM-LOGIC
           END-IF.

           IF WS-ERR-CLAIM-LOGIC = 'Y'
               MOVE 'Y' TO WS-ERR-RECORD-REJECTED
           END-IF.

        CLAIM-LOGIC-PROCESSING-EXIT.
           EXIT.

       DATABASE-UPDATE SECTION.
           IF WS-ERR-RECORD-REJECTED = 'Y'
                GO TO DATABASE-UPDATE-EXIT.
           MOVE 'N' TO WS-ERR-DATABASE.
           * Database update logic here.
           IF DATABASE-UPDATE-ERROR
                MOVE 'Y' TO WS-ERR-DATABASE
                DISPLAY WS-MSG-DATABASE
           END-IF.

           IF WS-ERR-DATABASE = 'Y'
                MOVE 'Y' TO WS-ERR-RECORD-REJECTED
           END-IF.
        DATABASE-UPDATE-EXIT.
            EXIT.
```

Here, both the `CLAIM-LOGIC-PROCESSING` and `DATABASE-UPDATE` sections follow the same approach, exiting immediately if the `WS-ERR-RECORD-REJECTED` flag is already set. This approach ensures that once a critical error has been encountered (e.g. during data validation), subsequent processing sections for the same record do not generate spurious and overlapping error messages. The `WS-ERR-RECORD-REJECTED` acts as a global gate, preventing secondary errors on the same record from being reported, thereby focusing debugging efforts on the primary error.

This combination of structured flags and conditional execution significantly enhances the debuggability of COBOL programs. When an error occurs, the log will primarily display the first error encountered, greatly simplifying root-cause analysis.  It's important to note, for more complex scenarios, a separate error log file should be created for more detailed debugging instead of using the display function. This approach is particularly valuable when troubleshooting large batch jobs that process millions of records, where a barrage of overlapping messages would be effectively useless. This method is iterative, and further error flags can be added if the number of possible failures increase.

Further improvement can be made by implementing an error logging subroutine. This routine can record the error flags, specific data, and timestamps for better analysis. In more advanced environments, it may be suitable to utilize an output file to act as an error log which can be examined after the batch job has completed to further inspect any issues. This is a crucial step when moving from display statements which can be quickly lost in large logs to something persistent and reviewable.

For further exploration on error management strategies in batch processing systems, I'd suggest reviewing resources related to structured programming and batch job design. Also, articles regarding software testing, specifically focusing on boundary value analysis, and equivalence partitioning, can provide further insight on anticipating common errors. While there aren't specific COBOL books focusing solely on error management, many books on software engineering and quality assurance touch upon similar principles applicable across various languages. Studying best practices in system design and maintenance is a crucial part of preventing these issues in the first place.
