TensorFlow's lack of a direct, single-function call for obtaining log probabilities is a common source of confusion.  The approach hinges on understanding the underlying probability distribution and leveraging TensorFlow's built-in functions for that distribution.  My experience debugging production models with intricate likelihood calculations has taught me that a nuanced understanding of this process is crucial for efficient and accurate model building.  Direct computation of log probabilities is generally preferred over transforming probabilities post-hoc due to numerical stability concerns; probabilities can easily underflow to zero, whereas log probabilities remain manageable.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The method for calculating log probabilities in TensorFlow depends entirely on the probability distribution involved.  There isn't a universal "get_log_probability" function. Instead, you must utilize the appropriate distribution's specific methods. TensorFlow Probability (TFP) provides a comprehensive suite of probability distributions, each equipped with a `log_prob` method.  If you're working with a distribution not directly supported by TFP, you'll need to derive the log probability formula yourself and implement it using TensorFlow's core operations.  This might involve using functions like `tf.math.log`, `tf.exp`, and potentially custom gradient calculations depending on the complexity of the distribution.

Remember that the log probability is simply the natural logarithm of the probability density function (PDF) for continuous distributions or the probability mass function (PMF) for discrete distributions. For instance, the log probability for a single data point `x` from a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma` would be calculated as:

`log_prob(x) = -0.5 * log(2 * pi * sigma^2) - (x - mu)^2 / (2 * sigma^2)`

This formula directly addresses the numerical stability issue mentioned earlier.  Calculating the probability directly using `(1/sqrt(2 * pi * sigma^2))*exp(-(x - mu)^2 / (2 * sigma^2))` is far more prone to underflow, particularly for values of `x` far from `mu`.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Here are three examples demonstrating how to obtain log probabilities in TensorFlow using different distributions.

**Example 1: Normal Distribution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define a normal distribution
normal_dist = tfd.Normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0)

# Sample data points
x = tf.constant([[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [2.0, -2.0, 0.0]])

# Compute log probabilities
log_probs = normal_dist.log_prob(x)

# Print the results
print(log_probs)
```

This code snippet utilizes TFP's `tfd.Normal` distribution. The `log_prob` method directly calculates the log probabilities for the provided data points `x`. The output is a tensor of log probabilities, one for each data point.  This approach leverages the optimized and numerically stable implementations within TFP.


**Example 2: Categorical Distribution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define a categorical distribution
categorical_dist = tfd.Categorical(probs=[0.2, 0.5, 0.3])

# Sample data points (representing indices)
x = tf.constant([0, 1, 2, 1, 0])

# Compute log probabilities
log_probs = categorical_dist.log_prob(x)

# Print the results
print(log_probs)
```

This example demonstrates log probability computation for a categorical distribution.  The input `x` represents the indices of the categories.  Again, TFP's built-in functionality simplifies the process and ensures numerical stability.

**Example 3: Custom Distribution (Log-Normal)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def log_prob_lognormal(x, mu, sigma):
    """Calculates the log probability for a lognormal distribution.

    Args:
        x: Tensor of values.
        mu: Tensor of means (in log space).
        sigma: Tensor of standard deviations (in log space).

    Returns:
        Tensor of log probabilities.
    """
    return -tf.math.log(x) - (tf.math.log(x) - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2) - tf.math.log(sigma) - 0.5 * tf.math.log(2 * tf.constant(3.14159265359))

# Define parameters
mu = tf.constant(0.0)
sigma = tf.constant(1.0)

# Sample data points
x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Compute log probabilities
log_probs = log_prob_lognormal(x, mu, sigma)

# Print the results
print(log_probs)
```

This demonstrates a scenario where a distribution isn't readily available in TFP. Here, we manually implement the log probability function for a lognormal distribution.  This requires a more thorough understanding of the underlying mathematical formula. Note the direct use of `tf.math.log` to avoid potential numerical instability issues associated with direct probability calculation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The TensorFlow Probability documentation;  a comprehensive textbook on probability and statistics; and a well-structured tutorial on numerical computation in Python. These resources will aid in deeper understanding of the concepts and best practices.  Focusing on the mathematical underpinnings of probability distributions is key to effectively using TensorFlow for probabilistic modeling.  Thorough comprehension of these foundations ensures correct implementation and interpretation of results.  Prioritize understanding the subtleties of numerical stability when working with probabilities and logarithms.
