The incompatibility between a 3D input and a 4D weight arises from the fundamental nature of linear algebra operations within neural networks, specifically matrix multiplication. These operations dictate that for a meaningful transformation, the inner dimensions of the matrices involved must match.

I've frequently encountered this discrepancy when working on convolutional neural networks for video processing. A 3D input, such as a single frame of a video represented as `(height, width, channels)`, possesses an implicit third dimension, often referred to as depth in volumetric data but considered the "channels" dimension in image contexts. Conversely, a 4D weight tensor, typically encountered in convolutional layers, is structured as `(output_channels, input_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width)`. This discrepancy immediately exposes the issue. We're essentially attempting a multiplication of a 3-dimensional object with a 4-dimensional one, which doesn't conform to the standard rules of matrix multiplication.

The core problem lies in how convolutions are implemented. Convolution, despite being commonly understood as a sliding window operation, is mathematically equivalent to matrix multiplication once the input feature map and kernel are appropriately flattened (or, more accurately, reorganized). The kernel, though represented as a 4D tensor for human readability, is ultimately reshaped to perform the necessary matrix multiplication.  During the forward pass, the input image is similarly converted into a matrix. The number of input channels in the weight matrix must match the number of channels in the flattened version of the input for the dot product operations to be defined. 

Consider an input tensor `X` with shape `(batch_size, height, width, channels)` after appropriate padding, striding and pooling. When processing only one image of a batch at a time, `X` is effectively `(height, width, channels)`, a 3D tensor. Now consider a single kernel from the set of weights, `W`, which has the shape of `(output_channels, input_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width)`. For simplification, let's look at a single output channel, so the kernel W becomes `(input_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width)`. In essence, the weight effectively "sits" on the image `X` at a single spatial location, multiplying its values by those in `X` that fit within its `kernel_height` and `kernel_width`. So there should be a match in the "channels" dimensions. When one outputs many channels then effectively this process is repeated for each "output" channel in W.

In standard matrix multiplication, if we have matrix A with dimensions `(m, n)` and matrix B with dimensions `(p, q)`, the multiplication `A @ B` is defined only if `n == p`. Similarly, in the convolution operation, the 'input_channels' of the weight acts as the 'n' dimension for the weight matrix and 'p' dimension for the flattened input feature map. The 3D input’s third dimension corresponds to the 'n' and the 4D weight’s second dimension corresponds to the 'p'. When these differ, no matrix multiplication between the flattened matrices can occur. This discrepancy leads to an undefined operation, resulting in an error.

To overcome this, we do not multiply the raw 3D tensor by the raw 4D tensor, rather, we perform a multi-step process. We extract regions from the input `X`, flatten them, then perform a matrix multiplication with the flattened version of `W`, this operation is then done across many spatial positions in the input. The process requires that the 'input_channels' dimension of the weight exactly matches the depth (channel) dimension of the 3D input. This ensures that the dot product is performed over a compatible number of channels across each spatially-extracted image patch and the corresponding filter in the kernel.

Here are three practical code examples illustrating this issue and its resolution using Python and NumPy:

**Example 1: The Incompatible Dimensions**

This example showcases the error that arises when we attempt a naive dot product between a 3D input and a 4D weight.

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate 3D input (height=3, width=4, channels=3)
input_3d = np.random.rand(3, 4, 3)

# Simulate 4D weight (output_channels=2, input_channels=4, kernel_height=2, kernel_width=2)
weight_4d = np.random.rand(2, 4, 2, 2)

# Attempting a direct dot product - this will fail.
try:
    result = np.dot(input_3d, weight_4d)
    print("Result shape: ", result.shape)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # This will be a ValueError due to dimension mismatch.
```

In this snippet, `input_3d` represents a simplified image or feature map and `weight_4d` a set of convolutional filters. The attempt to directly use `np.dot` demonstrates the fundamental mismatch; we get a `ValueError` stating that the dimensions are incompatible for matrix multiplication. This is expected; the underlying matrix multiplication operation cannot be performed.

**Example 2: Reshaping for Compatibility (Conceptual)**

This example conceptually shows the intermediate reshapes that occur during the convolution to make the operation feasible. It uses NumPy to simulate this process. It is important to understand that in practice the convolution is not implemented in this way, instead optimized methods are used, but the underlying principles hold.

```python
import numpy as np

# Same input from before (height=3, width=4, channels=3)
input_3d = np.random.rand(3, 4, 3)

# Same weight as before (output_channels=2, input_channels=4, kernel_height=2, kernel_width=2)
weight_4d = np.random.rand(2, 4, 2, 2)

# Conceptual reshaping: Extract 2x2 spatial regions, then flatten, but only 1 output
# Simulating a single output channel
output_channel_index = 0
reshaped_weight = weight_4d[output_channel_index].reshape(4, 2*2) # (4,4)

# Flatten input features: Simulating by taking all 2x2 patches and flatten them
flattened_input_patches = []
for i in range(0, input_3d.shape[0] - 1):
    for j in range(0, input_3d.shape[1] - 1):
        patch = input_3d[i:i+2, j:j+2] #(2,2,3)
        flattened_patch = patch.reshape(2*2*3) #(12)
        flattened_input_patches.append(flattened_patch)
flattened_input_patches = np.array(flattened_input_patches).T # (12,n_patches)
print(f'Flattened patches shape: {flattened_input_patches.shape}')

#Conceptual re-org of weight: Simulating input channel reshaping
reshaped_weights = reshaped_weight.reshape(4, 4) # (4,4)
print(f'Reshaped weight shape: {reshaped_weights.shape}')

#Now multiply, but note we need to select input channel subsets from the reshaped input patches
final_result_for_single_output = []
for i in range(0, flattened_input_patches.shape[1]):
   input_channel_subset = flattened_input_patches[:,i].reshape(3,4) #shape = (3,4)
   if (reshaped_weights.shape[0] == input_channel_subset.shape[0]):
        res = np.dot(reshaped_weights, input_channel_subset)
        final_result_for_single_output.append(res.flatten())
final_result_for_single_output = np.array(final_result_for_single_output)

print(f'Result after conceptual reshaping of input: {final_result_for_single_output.shape}')
```

This example is less about actual efficient implementation, and more about illustrating the flattening of patches, and how they are then multiplied by the weights. It shows that the final result (the output) is determined by both input dimensions, the filter size, and input_channel number, and the matrix multiplication can only happen when inner dimensions align (as reshaped and in subsets as shown here). Note that this is not how optimized convolutions are actually performed.

**Example 3: Correct Convolution with Matching Channels**

This corrected example highlights the necessity of matching the input channels within the 4D weight with the input channels from the 3D input. Using a simplified scenario to illustrate.

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate 3D input (height=3, width=4, channels=3)
input_3d = np.random.rand(3, 4, 3)

# Simulate 4D weight with matching input channels (output_channels=2, input_channels=3, kernel_height=2, kernel_width=2)
weight_4d = np.random.rand(2, 3, 2, 2)


#This example shows the necessity of matching input channels, the correct calculation would involve the steps demonstrated conceptually in example 2
#The matrix dimensions that have to match are (input_channels in weight) and (channels in input 3d tensor) which is the third dimension.
#The result of this multiplication (conceptual) would be a 3D Tensor. 
#The example is simplified such that the result would be a 2D Tensor with output shape (2,12).
print('Weight 4D Shape: ',weight_4d.shape)
reshaped_weight = weight_4d.reshape(2,12) # reshaped to (2,12)
print('Reshaped weight Shape: ',reshaped_weight.shape)
flattened_input = input_3d.reshape(1,12) #reshaped to (1,12)
print('Flattened input Shape: ', flattened_input.shape)
result = np.dot(reshaped_weight, flattened_input.T)
print("Result shape (Simplified for demonstration): ", result.shape) # Shape will be (2,1)

```

In this scenario, we alter the 4D weight tensor to have the matching `input_channels=3`. This is a simplified conceptual illustration. Actual convolution operations are far more complex due to sliding windows, striding and padding, but conceptually follow the same inner dimension matching requirements when considering flattened patches and reshaped weights.

For a more comprehensive understanding of convolutional neural networks and their inner workings, I recommend referring to textbooks covering deep learning. Further study of linear algebra concepts, focusing on matrix operations and their application in machine learning, would also prove beneficial. Detailed explanations of convolution mechanisms can be found in many online resources, particularly those focused on computer vision. Specifically I recommend exploring materials describing the implementation details of convolution operations in libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Additionally, carefully reviewing the documentation of relevant deep learning libraries will assist in interpreting the required input dimensions and structure.
