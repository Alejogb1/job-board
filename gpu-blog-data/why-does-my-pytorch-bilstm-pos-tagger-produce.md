The "input.size(-1) must be equal to input_size" error in a PyTorch BiLSTM POS tagger almost invariably stems from a mismatch between the dimensionality of your input embeddings and the expectation of your BiLSTM layer.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale NLP projects, particularly those involving complex architectures like stacked BiLSTMs and conditional random fields (CRFs), highlights this as the primary culprit.  This error arises when the last dimension of your input tensor (typically representing the embedding dimension) does not align with the `input_size` parameter you explicitly specified during the BiLSTM layer's construction.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core of the problem lies in the fundamental architecture of a BiLSTM.  The BiLSTM layer, a core component of many sequence labeling tasks such as POS tagging, expects a consistent input dimension across all time steps. This input dimension is determined by the size of the word embeddings you are using. Each word in your input sentence is represented as a vector; the length of this vector is the embedding dimension. The BiLSTM's `input_size` parameter dictates the expected dimensionality of these word embedding vectors.  If your word embeddings have a dimension of, for example, 300, and you set `input_size` to 100, the BiLSTM will throw this error because it's expecting vectors of length 100, but receiving vectors of length 300.


This mismatch can occur at various points in your pipeline:

* **Incorrect Embedding Dimension:** The most frequent cause is a simple discrepancy between the embedding dimension generated by your embedding layer (e.g., using `nn.Embedding`) and the `input_size` parameter you've provided to your `nn.LSTM` layer.  Double-checking these values is always the first step.

* **Data Preprocessing Errors:**  Problems during data preprocessing can lead to inconsistent embedding dimensions. For instance, if your vocabulary contains words not present in your embedding lookup table, you might be inadvertently using a default embedding vector of a different dimension.  Robust error handling during vocabulary creation and embedding lookup is critical.

* **Incorrect Input Tensor Reshaping:**  If your input tensor is not correctly reshaped to have the appropriate dimensions (batch size, sequence length, embedding dimension), this mismatch will occur. This is particularly relevant when handling variable-length sentences.  Ensure your tensor is of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim).

* **Layer Misconfiguration:** A more subtle error could arise from misconfiguring other layers preceding the BiLSTM.  For example, a linear transformation layer applied before the BiLSTM might inadvertently alter the embedding dimension if its output size is not carefully matched.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Here are three examples demonstrating the error and its correction, mirroring scenarios I've encountered in my own projects:


**Example 1: Incorrect Embedding Dimension**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Incorrect: Embedding dimension is 300, but input_size is set to 100.
embedding_dim = 300
hidden_dim = 128
vocab_size = 10000

embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
bilstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=100, hidden_size=hidden_dim, bidirectional=True) # Error here

input_sentence = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (1, 10))  # Batch size 1, sequence length 10
embedded_input = embedding(input_sentence)
output, _ = bilstm(embedded_input) # Throws the error

# Correct: Match input_size to embedding_dim
bilstm_correct = nn.LSTM(input_size=embedding_dim, hidden_size=hidden_dim, bidirectional=True)
output_correct, _ = bilstm_correct(embedded_input)
print(output_correct.shape)
```

This example shows the error arising from a direct mismatch.  The correction simply involves setting `input_size` in the LSTM layer to match the `embedding_dim`.


**Example 2: Data Preprocessing Issues (OOV Words)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

embedding_dim = 100
hidden_dim = 128
vocab_size = 10000

# Assume 'embedding' is pre-trained embeddings with dimension 100.
# Simulate a missing word:
embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
# ... (pre-trained weight loading omitted for brevity) ...

input_sentence = torch.tensor([[1, 2, vocab_size +1, 4]]) #OOV word
#Handling OOV words requires a default embedding.  Here, we demonstrate a flawed approach that results in an error.
embedded_input = embedding(input_sentence)
#Note:  This example's error would be different if the default embedding has a different dimension

bilstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=embedding_dim, hidden_size=hidden_dim, bidirectional=True)
output, _ = bilstm(embedded_input) # Would throw an error if default embedding dimension differs.

# Correct approach: handle OOV words with a designated embedding.
# This avoids inconsistent dimensions.

# ... (code for handling OOV words with a separate, appropriately sized vector)
```

Here, the issue stems from out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.  The correction necessitates proper handling of OOV words,  often involving the use of a dedicated "unknown" embedding vector with the same dimension as other word embeddings.


**Example 3: Incorrect Input Reshaping**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

embedding_dim = 100
hidden_dim = 128
vocab_size = 10000

embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
bilstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=embedding_dim, hidden_size=hidden_dim, bidirectional=True)

input_sentence = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (10,)) #Incorrect shape
embedded_input = embedding(input_sentence)  #Shape is now 10 x 100

#Incorrect input will throw error. Correct shape is required: (batch_size, seq_len, embedding_dim)

# Correct reshaping:
embedded_input_correct = embedded_input.unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dimension (1,10,100)
output, _ = bilstm(embedded_input_correct)
print(output.shape)
```

This example underscores the importance of input tensor reshaping.  The BiLSTM requires a three-dimensional tensor (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dimension). Failing to ensure this shape leads to the error.  The correction involves explicitly adding a batch dimension using `unsqueeze`.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a more in-depth understanding of BiLSTMs, recurrent neural networks, and PyTorch's implementation, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation and tutorials.  Exploring textbooks on deep learning and natural language processing, focusing on sequence modeling, will further solidify your understanding of the underlying principles.  Furthermore, reviewing code examples from established NLP libraries and examining the architecture of successful sequence labeling models can prove invaluable.  Finally, actively engaging with online communities dedicated to PyTorch and NLP will provide avenues to seek further assistance and learn from others' experiences.
