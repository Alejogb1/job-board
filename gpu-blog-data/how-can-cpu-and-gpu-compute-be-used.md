The fundamental challenge in concurrent CPU and GPU computation lies in efficiently managing data transfer between these distinct processing units.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects for financial modeling highlighted this bottleneck repeatedly.  Optimal solutions hinge on a deep understanding of data locality, memory bandwidth, and the specific architectures of both the CPU and GPU involved.  Ignoring these aspects leads to performance severely hampered by data transfer overhead.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Concurrent CPU and GPU computation necessitates a carefully orchestrated division of labor.  The CPU, with its inherent versatility and efficient handling of complex control flow, typically handles tasks requiring intricate logic or sequential operations.  Conversely, the GPU excels at massively parallel computations on large datasets, due to its many cores optimized for floating-point arithmetic.  The key to efficient concurrency is to identify portions of the problem ideally suited to each processor.

This often involves breaking down a larger computational problem into smaller, independent subproblems. The CPU pre-processes data, prepares inputs for the GPU, and then offloads the computationally intensive sections to the GPU.  Upon completion, the GPU sends its results back to the CPU for final processing, aggregation, and subsequent actions.  Effective communication between the CPU and GPU is achieved through efficient data transfer mechanisms, such as CUDA's unified memory or OpenCL's shared memory, depending on the chosen programming framework.  However, simply dividing the problem is insufficient; careful consideration must be given to minimizing data transfer volume and latency.

Efficient concurrency also requires asynchronous operation.  The CPU should not idly wait for the GPU to finish its task. Instead, it should overlap computation on the CPU with GPU execution.  This can involve initiating multiple GPU tasks and processing the results as they become available, significantly reducing idle time.  Furthermore, techniques like double buffering can enhance performance by allowing the CPU to prepare the data for the next GPU task while the GPU processes the current one.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate concurrent CPU-GPU computation using Python with CUDA (using the `cupy` library as a proxy for direct CUDA code for clarity) for demonstrating the concepts.  Note that actual CUDA code would involve more low-level details, but these examples capture the core principles.

**Example 1: Simple Matrix Multiplication:**

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np

# CPU performs initial data generation
a_cpu = np.random.rand(1024, 1024).astype(np.float32)
b_cpu = np.random.rand(1024, 1024).astype(np.float32)

# Transfer data to GPU
a_gpu = cp.asarray(a_cpu)
b_gpu = cp.asarray(b_cpu)

# GPU performs matrix multiplication
c_gpu = cp.matmul(a_gpu, b_gpu)

# Transfer results back to CPU
c_cpu = cp.asnumpy(c_gpu)

# CPU performs post-processing (e.g., analysis of results)
# ...
```

*Commentary:* This example showcases the basic workflow: data transfer to GPU, GPU computation, and transfer back to CPU.  The CPU is idle during GPU computation.  More sophisticated techniques are needed for true concurrency.

**Example 2: Concurrent Data Processing with Asynchronous Operations:**

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np
import time

def gpu_task(data):
    # Simulate a GPU-intensive task
    time.sleep(2)  # Replace with actual GPU computation
    return cp.sum(data)

# CPU generates multiple datasets
data1 = cp.random.rand(1000000)
data2 = cp.random.rand(1000000)

# Asynchronous GPU tasks
future1 = cp.cuda.Stream().use()
result1 = gpu_task(data1)
future2 = cp.cuda.Stream().use()
result2 = gpu_task(data2)

# CPU performs other tasks concurrently
# ... some computation on the CPU ...

# Retrieve results from GPU (may block if not ready)
result1_cpu = cp.asnumpy(result1)
result2_cpu = cp.asnumpy(result2)

# CPU performs final processing
# ...
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates asynchronous execution.  The CPU initiates two GPU tasks and continues with other computations before retrieving results, maximizing CPU utilization while the GPU works.


**Example 3:  Double Buffering for Improved Efficiency:**

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np

# Initialize buffers
buffer_a = cp.zeros((1024,1024), dtype=np.float32)
buffer_b = cp.zeros((1024,1024), dtype=np.float32)

# Data for first iteration
data_in = cp.random.rand(1024, 1024).astype(np.float32)
buffer_a = data_in

#GPU Processing
result = process_data(buffer_a) # placeholder function

#While GPU processes prepare the next data for buffer_b
data_in_2 = cp.random.rand(1024, 1024).astype(np.float32)
buffer_b = data_in_2


# Retrieve results from GPU and switch buffers
result_cpu = cp.asnumpy(result)
buffer_a, buffer_b = buffer_b, buffer_a
data_in = data_in_2

#Continue processing with new data


def process_data(data):
    # Placeholder for actual GPU processing
    time.sleep(1)
    return cp.sum(data)

```

*Commentary:* This illustrates double buffering. While the GPU processes data from `buffer_a`, the CPU prepares the next dataset in `buffer_b`.  Once the GPU is done, the buffers are swapped, minimizing idle time.  This technique is particularly beneficial for iterative computations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of GPU programming and concurrent computation, I recommend exploring CUDA programming guides from NVIDIA,  OpenCL documentation, and textbooks on parallel computing.  Furthermore,  familiarity with parallel algorithms and data structures will prove invaluable.  Studying advanced techniques like stream management, memory coalescing, and asynchronous data transfers is crucial for achieving optimal performance in real-world applications.  Finally, profiling tools specific to your hardware and programming framework are essential for identifying bottlenecks and optimizing code.
