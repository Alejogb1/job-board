The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values in TensorFlow GPU matrix multiplications almost invariably stems from numerical instability, specifically the propagation of infinities or undefined results from intermediate calculations.  My experience debugging high-performance computing applications, particularly those involving deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, has shown this to be a pervasive issue, often masked by the inherent parallelism of GPU operations.  The problem isn't necessarily a bug within TensorFlow itself, but rather a consequence of the data being processed.

**1.  Explanation of NaN Propagation in Matrix Multiplication**

TensorFlow's GPU acceleration relies heavily on optimized libraries like cuBLAS.  While these libraries are remarkably efficient, they do not inherently handle or prevent the generation of NaN values.  The fundamental cause is often subtle: an operation within the matrix multiplication produces an infinity (positive or negative), which then propagates through subsequent computations, ultimately resulting in NaN values throughout significant portions of the resulting matrix.

Several scenarios contribute to this:

* **Division by Zero:**  The most straightforward cause.  If any element in a matrix involved in the multiplication participates in a division operation where the divisor is zero, the result is infinity.  This immediately leads to NaN values when combined with other numbers, even if only indirectly.

* **Overflow:**  Extremely large numbers, exceeding the representable range of floating-point numbers (typically float32 or float64), result in overflow, yielding infinity. This frequently happens in exponential functions or repeated multiplications involving large initial values.

* **Underflow:**  The opposite of overflow. Extremely small numbers, closer to zero than the machine's precision can represent, get rounded to zero, which can lead to the division by zero problem mentioned above.

* **Logarithm of Non-Positive Numbers:** Attempting to calculate the natural logarithm (or any logarithm) of a non-positive number results in NaN.  This frequently occurs when dealing with probability distributions or activation functions in neural networks.

* **Invalid Square Roots:** Taking the square root of a negative number yields NaN.  This is less common in direct matrix multiplications but can arise within broader computations involving the matrices.


The crucial point is that these issues arenâ€™t always immediately apparent. The NaN values might not originate directly from the `tf.matmul` operation itself but from preceding computations affecting the input matrices.  The parallel nature of GPU computations means that errors can propagate widely before becoming detectable.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate with three TensorFlow examples demonstrating potential NaN generation scenarios:

**Example 1: Division by Zero**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

matrix_a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 0.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
matrix_b = tf.constant([[4.0, 5.0], [6.0, 7.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Introducing division by zero within matrix_a
matrix_a = tf.divide(tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 1.0]]), matrix_a)

result = tf.matmul(matrix_a, matrix_b)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(result))
```

This example deliberately introduces a division by zero in `matrix_a`. The resulting matrix will contain infinity and consequently, the matrix multiplication will produce NaN values.

**Example 2: Overflow in Exponential Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

large_number = 1000.0
matrix_a = tf.constant([[large_number, large_number], [large_number, large_number]], dtype=tf.float32)
matrix_b = tf.constant([[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

matrix_a = tf.exp(matrix_a) #exponential function causes overflow

result = tf.matmul(matrix_a, matrix_b)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(result))
```

Here, the exponential function applied to a large number within `matrix_a` leads to overflow, resulting in infinities and subsequent NaN values in the final result.


**Example 3: Logarithm of Negative Numbers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

matrix_a = tf.constant([[-1.0, 2.0], [3.0, -4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
matrix_b = tf.constant([[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

matrix_a = tf.math.log(matrix_a) #Logarithm of negative numbers

result = tf.matmul(matrix_a, matrix_b)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(result))
```

This example showcases the issue of taking the logarithm of negative numbers. The `tf.math.log` function will yield NaN values, contaminating the subsequent matrix multiplication.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of numerical stability and floating-point arithmetic, I suggest consulting standard numerical analysis texts.  Furthermore, the official TensorFlow documentation provides extensive details on data types and potential numerical pitfalls.  Finally, exploration of the cuBLAS documentation will offer valuable insights into the low-level matrix multiplication operations employed by TensorFlow's GPU backend.  Careful consideration of data scaling and normalization techniques, as described in machine learning literature, is also crucial for mitigating these issues in real-world applications.  Debugging tools within TensorFlow, particularly those that allow for inspection of intermediate tensor values, are invaluable in pinpointing the source of NaN values.  Always remember to validate your input data rigorously before performing computationally intensive operations.
