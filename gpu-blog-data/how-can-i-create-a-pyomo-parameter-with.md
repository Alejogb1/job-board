Pyomo, being a modeling language embedded in Python, primarily relies on the static nature of mathematical programming problem definitions. Parameters within Pyomo, by default, are not designed for dynamically adjustable sizes in the sense of runtime growth or reduction. However, strategic utilization of Pyomo's flexible indexing and Python's dynamic capabilities allows us to effectively emulate this behavior within the problem definition process. I've faced similar constraints in large-scale optimization projects involving dynamic resource allocation where the set of available options changed between model iterations, and discovered that directly manipulating the parameter's size wasn’t the solution. Instead, re-constructing the parameters with the correct dimensions is the necessary approach.

The core challenge arises from Pyomo's reliance on fixed dimensions for parameters once the model is constructed. A parameter, when initialized, expects a specific number of indices, defined by the set or sets it's indexed by. Directly changing the size after the model has been created would break the internal data structures of Pyomo, leading to inconsistencies. Therefore, the solution isn't to change parameter size *in situ,* but to construct a *new* parameter object with the revised size and then carefully update the existing model with this replacement parameter before a solve.

The general approach involves several key steps: 1) Identify the indices that need to be dynamically adjusted. This could be a subset of the total indices of the parameter, or all of them. 2) Prior to creating the Pyomo model (or between solves if needed), determine the desired size based on your application’s logic. 3) Construct a new Pyomo parameter object with the determined size. 4) Either partially update the model (if using indexed parameters and the data source remains consistent and in memory) or reconstruct the part of the model involving the parameter as a whole. 5) Populate the values of the new parameter. 6) Ensure all model components that refer to the old parameter are updated to use the new parameter. This usually involves rebuilding the respective model components that reference the parameter being replaced.

Let's illustrate with specific examples. Consider a parameter representing resource capacities, indexed by time period, which has to expand as we proceed through the planning horizon:

**Example 1: Expanding Capacity with Simple Sets**

```python
import pyomo.environ as pyo

# Initial data for the first 3 time periods
data = {
    (1,): 10,
    (2,): 15,
    (3,): 20
}

# Create a function to dynamically expand the time set and parameter
def create_capacity_param(current_periods):
    model = pyo.ConcreteModel()
    model.T = pyo.Set(initialize=current_periods)
    model.capacity = pyo.Param(model.T, initialize=data)
    return model


# Initialize with 3 time periods
model = create_capacity_param([1,2,3])

# Print the initial capacity
print("Initial capacity parameter")
for t in model.T:
    print(f"Time {t}: {model.capacity[t]}")


# Add a new time period using a model recreation
new_periods = [1,2,3,4] # Updated time periods
data[(4,)] = 25 # Additional data

model = create_capacity_param(new_periods)

# Print the extended capacity
print("\nExtended capacity parameter")
for t in model.T:
    print(f"Time {t}: {model.capacity[t]}")
```

In the first example, rather than altering the existing model's parameter *in situ*, I used a function, `create_capacity_param`, that constructs a completely new Pyomo model, sets the time period set, and parameter. The initial instantiation has three periods, and its print output confirms the capacities. The second model created within the scope has the time period set, and the capacity parameter, extended by adding period 4. I’m re-initializing with the same data dictionary, adding the new period data and passing the new set directly to the function that rebuilds the whole model. This works because the indices are explicitly encoded into the *data* dictionary. If we were to change the *keys* of the dictionary during runtime, it would be necessary to use copy data into a new dictionary structure before passing it to the model re-building procedure. The example shows the simplest version, with a one-dimensional set and an associated parameter.

**Example 2: Partial Parameter Update with Data Consistency**

```python
import pyomo.environ as pyo

# Initial data for resources (r1, r2) at time (t1, t2)
data = {
  ('r1', 't1') : 10,
  ('r1', 't2') : 15,
  ('r2', 't1') : 5,
  ('r2', 't2') : 20
}

def create_capacity_param(current_resources, current_time):
  model = pyo.ConcreteModel()
  model.R = pyo.Set(initialize=current_resources)
  model.T = pyo.Set(initialize=current_time)
  model.capacity = pyo.Param(model.R, model.T, initialize=data)
  return model


# Initial model with 2 resources and 2 time periods
resources_init = ['r1', 'r2']
time_periods_init = ['t1', 't2']
model = create_capacity_param(resources_init, time_periods_init)

# Print the initial capacity
print("Initial capacity parameter")
for r in model.R:
  for t in model.T:
    print(f"Resource {r}, Time {t}: {model.capacity[r, t]}")


# Add a new time period and corresponding data
time_periods_extended = ['t1','t2','t3']
data[('r1','t3')] = 12
data[('r2','t3')] = 18

# Recreate the model with extended time periods
model = create_capacity_param(resources_init, time_periods_extended)
# Print the capacity
print("\nExtended capacity parameter")
for r in model.R:
    for t in model.T:
        print(f"Resource {r}, Time {t}: {model.capacity[r, t]}")
```

In this example, the capacity is indexed by two sets. Here the new approach is still to build a completely new model. Note that the `data` dictionary holds *all* data. In this case, the change is the addition of a new time period, ‘t3’. I've added the two data points before re-constructing the model with the new extended time set, and new parameter instance. The key is that the `data` dictionary still contains all of the previous time period data (it’s still accessible by the re-initialized `model.capacity` parameter) and all of the keys in the dictionary are valid combinations of entries in `model.R` and `model.T`. The new capacity parameter retains the original data for 'r1' and 'r2' at 't1' and 't2' while adding entries for 't3'.

**Example 3: Using a Python function to define the parameter**

```python
import pyomo.environ as pyo

# Sample Python data structure
data_struct = {
    'group1': {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3},
    'group2': {'d': 4, 'e': 5, 'f': 6},
    'group3': {'g':7}
}

def get_param_value(group, index, data):
    try:
      return data[group][index]
    except KeyError:
      return None

def create_dynamic_param(data):
    model = pyo.ConcreteModel()
    model.Groups = pyo.Set(initialize=data.keys())
    model.Indices = pyo.Set(initialize= [ key for group in data.values() for key in group.keys()] )
    # Initialize the parameter using a Python function
    model.dynamic_param = pyo.Param(model.Groups, model.Indices, initialize= lambda model, group, index: get_param_value(group, index, data))
    return model


# Initial model based on the data structure
model = create_dynamic_param(data_struct)

#Print data
print("Initial dynamic parameter values:")
for group in model.Groups:
    for index in model.Indices:
      value = model.dynamic_param[group,index]
      if value != None:
          print(f"Group: {group}, Index: {index}, Value: {value}")

# Add more data to the data structure
data_struct['group3']['h'] = 8
data_struct['group4'] = {'i': 9, 'j': 10}

# Rebuild model with additional data
model = create_dynamic_param(data_struct)

# Print data
print("\nUpdated dynamic parameter values:")
for group in model.Groups:
    for index in model.Indices:
      value = model.dynamic_param[group,index]
      if value != None:
          print(f"Group: {group}, Index: {index}, Value: {value}")
```

This example uses the structure of a Python dictionary with a more complex form. The dictionary’s keys become the `Groups` set, and keys of the nested dictionary become the `Indices` set. Importantly, the parameter is initialized using a Python function `get_param_value` which accesses the Python dictionary outside the model, based on its indexes. When the `data_struct` is modified and the model is rebuilt, the dynamic parameter is recomputed with the new underlying data, and its size and values change accordingly. This effectively provides a way to use Python data structures to represent data that changes before re-initializing the Pyomo model.

In summary, while Pyomo parameters do not directly support runtime dynamic resizing, their flexible indexing, combined with Python's capacity to modify data structures, and the ability to rebuild models enable a workaround to emulate dynamically sized parameters. The underlying approach requires careful handling of data, and rebuilding model instances rather than directly modifying parameters or sets within an existing instance. The key is to use Python data structures to manage the changing sizes, then to re-construct the Pyomo model based on the changed structure when necessary. It is not necessary to re-initialize the Pyomo model every time some data is changed; it is only necessary when parameter *size* (or set content) is changed.

For further study of these topics, I would suggest reviewing literature on large-scale optimization and dynamic programming, as well as the Pyomo documentation (especially the sections on model creation, parameters, and sets). Also, consider the design of optimization models with staged approaches, which sometimes require model reconstruction and/or model updates. Additionally, exploring Python’s dictionary implementation would be helpful for understanding how to best represent data structures for Pyomo. Finally, reviewing Pyomo's `update_parameter` method might be advantageous when only parameter *values* need to be updated, but not sizes, after construction.
