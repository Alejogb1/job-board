The root cause of many font display inconsistencies when AirPrinting HTML from iOS stems from the fact that the rendering pipeline for printed documents often differs significantly from that of web browsers. iOS, in its attempt to optimize for print, may substitute fonts or misinterpret styles not directly supported by its printing subsystem, leading to undesirable output. Having spent a considerable amount of time troubleshooting this issue in a previous project involving generating printable reports, I found that carefully managing font declarations and utilizing specific CSS properties are crucial steps toward achieving consistent results.

The core problem arises from two primary factors: limited font availability on the printer or within the iOS printing service and variability in font metric calculations. Unlike a browser, which has access to system fonts and web fonts, the print service is often restricted to a curated set of core fonts. When encountering a font not in its repertoire, the service will either default to a replacement font (often Times New Roman or Helvetica) or, in more problematic scenarios, improperly render glyphs. Moreover, discrepancies in how font metrics are calculated across rendering engines can result in differing line heights, letter spacing, and overall layout distortions. A font that appears perfectly sized on screen can appear substantially different on paper.

To mitigate these problems, the first strategy revolves around explicit and redundant font declaration. Instead of relying solely on CSS generic family names (e.g., `serif`, `sans-serif`), I consistently specify a more robust font stack. This means providing a list of font names, ordered by preference, allowing the print engine to fall back gracefully if the primary font is unavailable. For example, if I desired Helvetica Neue for a particular section, I would write CSS similar to:

```css
.my-section {
  font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

This snippet explicitly prioritizes "Helvetica Neue", followed by “Helvetica”, then "Arial", and lastly defaults to a generic sans-serif font. This approach minimizes the chance of the printing service making a random, often undesired substitution. By including widely available fonts like Arial, I establish a high probability that at least one font in the list will be recognized and rendered correctly.

Secondly, utilizing `@media print` stylesheets offers further granular control. I found it useful to define a separate stylesheet block or file dedicated entirely to print-specific styles. This allows the decoupling of screen styles from print styles, enabling fine-tuning specifically for the printing context. For example, within a `@media print` block, one could enforce specific font sizes, line heights, and spacing values that are optimized for the printed page. This is where the bulk of my print-related adjustments reside.

```css
@media print {
  .my-section {
    font-size: 12pt; /* Explicit font size */
    line-height: 1.2;  /* Controlled line height */
    letter-spacing: 0.01em; /* Minor adjustments to spacing */
  }
  body {
      font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; /* Default font for body*/
  }
  h1, h2, h3 {
    font-family: "Arial Black", Arial, sans-serif;
  }

}
```

This code specifically sets the font size, line height, and letter spacing of `.my-section` when printed. It also specifies a default font for the body and headings. This approach ensures that adjustments do not impact the screen display, preserving the user interface as intended, while simultaneously optimizing the printed output. I also often find myself specifying `pt` units instead of `px` for print styling, as `pt` units are physically measured and often more predictable on physical output.

Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, I discovered that certain CSS properties can directly interfere with how iOS handles font rendering for print. Properties like `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` or `font-variant-ligatures` can sometimes cause significant distortions when printing, even when the specified font is present. I systematically remove these properties or explicitly set `text-rendering: auto` within the `@media print` block to ensure the print engine doesn't attempt any unwanted optimizations. Additionally, I sometimes need to explicitly set the `font-smooth` property to `none`. The removal of potentially problematic properties was a critical step in my debugging process. Here's an example:

```css
@media print {
  .my-section {
     text-rendering: auto; /* Ensure standard rendering */
     -webkit-font-smoothing: none;
     -moz-osx-font-smoothing: none;
  }
  /* Other print-specific styles */
}

```

By setting `text-rendering` to `auto`, and explicitly disabling font smoothing, I provide the print engine with more straightforward rendering instructions, often resulting in a more faithful reproduction of the intended layout and preventing some common rendering artifacts. Experimentation with these properties was often a necessary, albeit time-consuming, part of getting consistent print output across varied iOS versions.

While these techniques address the majority of issues, they do not completely eliminate the inherent variability in print environments. Some printers may still make substitutions or have limitations. Additionally, complex layouts involving intricate CSS might still produce minor differences. However, consistent application of these techniques – robust font stacks, print-specific stylesheets, and careful control of font-related properties – significantly reduces the occurrence of undesirable printing results on iOS.

For those who encounter consistent print formatting issues, I recommend exploring resources that cover CSS print best practices in detail. Specifically, any text covering advanced techniques for print stylesheet creation, or information concerning font metrics, rendering differences, and typography on print outputs would be helpful. Publications detailing cross-platform print rendering considerations can also be invaluable. While I cannot provide specific URLs here, there are numerous publications and articles available online concerning these topics. Lastly, I would suggest experimenting with different font options and always testing print layouts on varied printers to ensure consistency across a range of devices.
