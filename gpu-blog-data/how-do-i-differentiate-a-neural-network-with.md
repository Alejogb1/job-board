Differentiating a neural network with multiple outputs hinges on understanding that the output layer's structure fundamentally dictates the differentiation process.  Unlike single-output networks where a simple loss function suffices, multi-output networks require careful consideration of the relationships between outputs and the choice of loss function.  My experience optimizing recommendation systems and image captioning models has highlighted the critical role of this choice in achieving optimal performance and avoiding issues like gradient vanishing or exploding gradients.

The core problem lies in how we define "differentiation" in this context. We are not differentiating the network's architecture itself, but rather the loss function used to train it.  This loss function quantifies the discrepancy between predicted and actual outputs for each output node, and its gradient then directs the backpropagation process.  The choice of this loss function depends significantly on the type of outputs and their interdependencies.

**1. Independent Outputs:**

If the multiple outputs are independent of each other, meaning the prediction for one output doesn't influence the prediction for another, then we can use a straightforward approach.  We can simply sum individual loss functions for each output. This is commonly done when dealing with multiple regression tasks or classification tasks where each output represents a separate, unrelated prediction.

**Code Example 1: Independent Multi-Output Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y1 = np.random.rand(100, 1)  # Output 1
y2 = np.random.rand(100, 1)  # Output 2

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2) # Two output nodes
])

# Define individual loss functions (Mean Squared Error)
loss1 = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
loss2 = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

# Training loop
epochs = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(X)
        pred1 = predictions[:, 0:1]
        pred2 = predictions[:, 1:2]
        loss_val1 = loss1(y1, pred1)
        loss_val2 = loss2(y2, pred2)
        total_loss = loss_val1 + loss_val2

    gradients = tape.gradient(total_loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {total_loss.numpy()}")

```

This example showcases a multi-output regression model where the outputs are treated independently.  The total loss is simply the sum of the individual Mean Squared Errors for each output.  This approach leverages TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities for efficient gradient computation.  The model architecture uses two dense layers for feature extraction followed by a final layer with two output nodes, one for each target variable.


**2. Dependent Outputs with Shared Layers:**

When outputs are correlated, treating them independently can be suboptimal.  Sharing layers between branches allows the network to learn shared features that benefit all outputs. This approach is especially effective when outputs represent different aspects of the same underlying phenomenon.

**Code Example 2: Shared Layers for Dependent Outputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (data definition as before)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,)), outputs=[])

shared_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
x = shared_layer(tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,)))
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)

output1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, name='output1')(x)
output2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, name='output2')(x)

model.add(tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,)))
model.add(shared_layer)
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, name='output1'), tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, name='output2')])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss={'output1': 'mse', 'output2': 'mse'}) # Multiple loss specification

model.fit(X, {'output1': y1, 'output2': y2}, epochs=100)
```

Here, a shared lower layer processes the input features.  Then, separate branches predict each output using different dense layers.  The `compile` method in TensorFlow/Keras allows specifying separate loss functions for each output, which are weighted implicitly during backpropagation based on the network architecture. This implicitly encourages the shared layers to learn features relevant to both outputs.  Note that a custom model is used to specify separate output layers which all take input from a common intermediate layer.


**3.  Outputs with Different Loss Functions:**

Sometimes, different outputs require different loss functions.  For instance, one output might be a continuous value (regression), while another is a categorical value (classification).  This necessitates a weighted sum of different loss functions tailored to each output type.

**Code Example 3: Combining Regression and Classification Outputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Data definition - adjust to include categorical y3)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3) # Two regression, one classification
])

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true_reg = y_true[:, :2]  # Regression targets
    y_pred_reg = y_pred[:, :2]  # Regression predictions
    y_true_class = tf.one_hot(tf.cast(y_true[:, 2], dtype=tf.int32), depth=2) #One-hot conversion for categorical
    y_pred_class = y_pred[:, 2:] # Classification predictions

    mse_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true_reg - y_pred_reg))
    categorical_loss = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()(y_true_class, y_pred_class)

    return mse_loss + categorical_loss # Weighted loss function

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss)
model.fit(X, np.concatenate((y1, y2, y3), axis=1), epochs=100)
```

This example uses a custom loss function combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the regression outputs and Categorical Crossentropy for the classification output.  A weighted average (or sum in this instance) of these individual losses drives the training process. The custom loss function provides the necessary flexibility to handle the dissimilar nature of the different output types.
