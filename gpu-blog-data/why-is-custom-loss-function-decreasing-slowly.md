The observed slow decrease in a custom loss function, despite seemingly reasonable gradient calculations, is frequently attributable to the specific shape and properties of that function relative to the optimization landscape. Custom loss functions, unlike well-studied and widely used alternatives like mean squared error or cross-entropy, often possess unique characteristics which exacerbate convergence issues. These issues manifest as plateaus, shallow valleys, or highly elongated contours, hindering gradient descent.

A custom loss function is typically designed to target particular aspects of a model’s output or behavior, tailored to the specific needs of a problem. It might incorporate a composite of several factors, each having its own contribution to the overall loss. When these factors are not properly balanced, or when the function's design introduces non-linearities, the resulting loss surface can become difficult for gradient-based optimization methods to navigate efficiently. A primary cause stems from the gradients being very small over large regions of the parameter space, leading to minimal updates with each iteration.

I've encountered scenarios, throughout my work on various machine learning projects, where the issue wasn't a bug in the implementation, but the nature of the loss function itself. For instance, a project involved creating a system to evaluate the quality of generated synthetic audio, requiring a custom loss that penalized both spectral deviations and temporal inconsistencies, weighted by perceptually relevant factors. The initially defined loss combined these elements in a non-linear fashion, producing an extremely flat loss surface in several regions of the parameter space, resulting in vanishingly small gradients despite the model's performance being far from optimal. The model would often stagnate, making little to no progress after a certain number of epochs, even when parameters were initialized properly and learning rates were tuned.

To illustrate the challenges, consider these synthetic examples:

**Example 1: Loss with a Plateau**

The following Python snippet defines a custom loss that emulates a flat region.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class PlateauLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, predicted, target):
        diff = torch.abs(predicted - target)
        #Simulating a plateau where gradients are very small for |diff| > 0.5
        loss = torch.where(diff <= 0.5, diff, 0.001*diff + 0.4995)
        return loss.mean()

# Usage
model_output = torch.tensor([0.3], requires_grad=True)
true_value = torch.tensor([0.8])
loss_func = PlateauLoss()
loss = loss_func(model_output,true_value)
loss.backward()
print(model_output.grad)  # very small gradient outside the threshold
```

This `PlateauLoss` deliberately creates a loss function where for error values greater than 0.5, the gradient is reduced to a tenth of its value + a constant. When the predicted value is far from the target, the gradient update becomes very small, causing optimization to stall. This is a simplified analogy of a real-world case; in actual complex loss landscapes, such plateaus aren't simple step-changes, but can have complex curvature. The takeaway is that the loss itself contains areas where gradients provide little useful information, forcing the optimizer to wander aimlessly.

**Example 2: Loss with an Asymmetrical Shape**

The following example generates a loss function with an asymmetrical shape and steep gradients in a narrow region.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class AsymmetricLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, scale=5.0):
       super().__init__()
       self.scale = scale

    def forward(self, predicted, target):
       diff = predicted - target
       # Asymmetric scaling of the error
       loss = torch.where(diff > 0, (diff ** 2) * self.scale, diff ** 2)
       return loss.mean()

# Usage
model_output = torch.tensor([0.5], requires_grad=True)
true_value = torch.tensor([1.0])
loss_func = AsymmetricLoss()
loss = loss_func(model_output, true_value)
loss.backward()
print(model_output.grad)  # a gradient with a different scale depending on sign

model_output2 = torch.tensor([1.5], requires_grad=True)
loss2 = loss_func(model_output2, true_value)
loss2.backward()
print(model_output2.grad) # a different gradient scale
```

In this scenario, if the model’s initial prediction is on the side with a smaller gradient magnitude, the model will be slow to adapt initially, even if its output is far from the target. The optimizer might also "overshoot" as the model enters a region with very large gradients. Such asymmetrical shapes can hinder optimization because they make it difficult to select a consistent learning rate: a small rate might not move the model sufficiently in one direction, while a high rate might destabilize the optimization in other regions.

**Example 3: Loss with Poor Conditioning**

The next snippet presents a custom loss that has poor conditioning.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class PoorlyConditionedLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
      super().__init__()

    def forward(self, predicted, target):
      diff = predicted - target
      # Squared difference is multiplied by a small constant to have poor condition
      loss = (diff ** 2) * 0.01 + (diff * 1)
      return loss.mean()

# Usage
model_output = torch.tensor([0.2], requires_grad=True)
true_value = torch.tensor([1.0])
loss_func = PoorlyConditionedLoss()
loss = loss_func(model_output, true_value)
loss.backward()
print(model_output.grad)

model_output2 = torch.tensor([1.2], requires_grad=True)
loss2 = loss_func(model_output2, true_value)
loss2.backward()
print(model_output2.grad)
```

This loss function effectively has a squared error component multiplied by a small constant, and a linear error component. In practice, the small constant amplifies the scale of the landscape, causing the optimizer to move extremely slowly when gradients are small, thus making the optimization inefficient. Such conditioning issues are often not trivial to pinpoint in custom-built loss functions.

Addressing the slow decrease of custom loss functions often requires a multi-faceted approach. First, visualize the loss function's behavior by plotting it over a relevant range of predictions. Doing so can reveal the presence of plateaus, sharp changes, or other problematic features. This provides valuable insight into areas that are particularly difficult for the optimization algorithm.

Second, consider re-parametrizing your loss function, or re-scaling its different components, which may improve the conditioning and remove plateaus or cliffs. Using a log-scale on certain components, squaring or square-rooting other components might result in a better shaped loss. If the loss function is a combination of multiple factors, carefully examining their relative importance and adjusting their weights often provides a significant improvement. It’s important that no factor overwhelms the others, so that their contributions remain relevant throughout the optimization process.

Third, experiment with different optimization algorithms. While Adam is generally a good default, algorithms like SGD with momentum, or more sophisticated optimizers, might fare better with certain types of loss surfaces. Furthermore, careful tuning of the learning rate schedule can help to escape plateaus or local minima. Employing adaptive learning rates or learning rate warm-up could also be beneficial.

Finally, if the problem is well-defined, try to find similar problems in research papers and if possible, reuse the loss functions that have been used previously, since they have been validated. In the absence of prior work, careful evaluation of all aspects of your loss function and a robust experimentation strategy will typically lead to improvements and resolve slow convergence.

For further study, I recommend delving into literature on optimization techniques in machine learning; specifically resources discussing saddle points, vanishing gradients, and the challenges associated with non-convex optimization. Books on deep learning architectures often include entire chapters dedicated to loss function design and strategies for stable optimization. Additionally, focusing on research papers that use similar loss functions is a useful strategy, where you can read how they have optimized the models. Investigating the literature surrounding activation functions can also be valuable, as certain activation functions, when used in the loss function, can compound optimization issues.
