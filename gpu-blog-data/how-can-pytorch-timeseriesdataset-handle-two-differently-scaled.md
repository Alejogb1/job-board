The core challenge when using PyTorch's `TimeSeriesDataSet` with differently scaled input and output DataFrames, both indexed by a common Unix timestamp, lies in aligning the data for consistent time-series processing while adhering to the expected data structure by the dataset. Disparate scales between input and output typically arise when predicting quantities or features that differ significantly in magnitude. I've encountered this frequently during forecasting projects, where sensor readings (inputs) might have small integer values, and predicted energy consumption (output) could be in kilowatt-hours.

To address this, a careful pre-processing pipeline needs to be implemented before feeding the data into `TimeSeriesDataSet`. We cannot directly pass raw, differently scaled DataFrames. `TimeSeriesDataSet` expects data that can be indexed by a time-index, group ID, and potentially a value at that time; it does not inherently handle arbitrary scaling differences between input and output sequences. Instead, the necessary data for the `TimeSeriesDataSet` is typically prepared as a single pandas DataFrame that contains all input features along with the target, aligned to the same temporal index. Consequently, the scaling divergence must be resolved during the preparation stage, generally via a combination of feature engineering and transformation.

The process generally includes: merging the input and output DataFrames based on their common time index, potentially handling missing values if any exists in either the input or output sets of data after merging, and applying scaling techniques to input features, while keeping outputs, such as forecasting targets, in their native scale. After completing the transformations, the dataset is now ready for ingestion by `TimeSeriesDataSet`.

Here are the code examples that demonstrate this approach, focusing on the crucial transformations:

**Example 1: Merging and Initial Handling**

```python
import pandas as pd
from pytorch_forecasting import TimeSeriesDataSet
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
import numpy as np

# Assume two dataframes, input_df and output_df, with different scales
# Simulate dataframe input
dates = pd.to_datetime(pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=100, freq='D')).astype('int64') // 10**9
input_df = pd.DataFrame({'timestamp': dates})
input_df['feature1'] = np.random.randint(10, 100, size=len(input_df))
input_df['feature2'] = np.random.rand(len(input_df))
input_df['group'] = 1

# Simulate dataframe output
dates_output = pd.to_datetime(pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=100, freq='D')).astype('int64') // 10**9
output_df = pd.DataFrame({'timestamp': dates_output})
output_df['target'] = np.random.randint(1000, 10000, size=len(output_df))
output_df['group'] = 1

# Convert timestamps to datetime format
input_df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(input_df['timestamp'], unit='s')
output_df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(output_df['timestamp'], unit='s')

# Merge the input and output dataframes
merged_df = pd.merge(input_df, output_df, on=['timestamp', 'group'], how='inner')

# Display merged dataframe
print(merged_df.head())
```

This first example demonstrates the critical step of merging the two DataFrames. I've used an inner join to retain only the overlapping time ranges. `group` column is essential in `TimeSeriesDataSet` so the synthetic data also contains the group information.  Additionally, time stamps have been converted to `datetime` from `int64` format for the later steps. It's important to note that the actual time-series dataset would be generated based on this merged dataframe.

**Example 2: Feature Scaling**

```python
# Scaling the input features
scaler_input_features = MinMaxScaler()
merged_df[['feature1', 'feature2']] = scaler_input_features.fit_transform(merged_df[['feature1', 'feature2']])

# Display scaled merged dataframe
print(merged_df.head())
```

In this example, I've applied `MinMaxScaler` to the input features.  This scales the input variables to a range between 0 and 1. This step is crucial, as unscaled input features with different ranges can negatively impact model performance, especially when using algorithms like neural networks. We selectively transform the input features to preserve the target variable's original scale. Alternative scaling methods like `StandardScaler` might be considered based on specific data distributions.

**Example 3: Creating and Using TimeSeriesDataSet**

```python
# Create TimeSeriesDataSet for training
training_cutoff = merged_df['timestamp'].quantile(0.8) # Split training and validation

training_data = merged_df[merged_df['timestamp'] <= training_cutoff]
validation_data = merged_df[merged_df['timestamp'] > training_cutoff]

max_prediction_length = 20
max_encoder_length = 40

training_dataset = TimeSeriesDataSet(
    training_data,
    time_idx="timestamp",
    target="target",
    group_ids=["group"],
    max_encoder_length=max_encoder_length,
    max_prediction_length=max_prediction_length,
    time_varying_known_reals=[],
    time_varying_unknown_reals=["feature1", "feature2", "target"],
)

validation_dataset = TimeSeriesDataSet(
    validation_data,
    time_idx="timestamp",
    target="target",
    group_ids=["group"],
    max_encoder_length=max_encoder_length,
    max_prediction_length=max_prediction_length,
    time_varying_known_reals=[],
    time_varying_unknown_reals=["feature1", "feature2", "target"],
)


#Verify the resulting dataset is correctly configured
training_dataloader = training_dataset.to_dataloader(train=True, batch_size=32, num_workers=2)
validation_dataloader = validation_dataset.to_dataloader(train=False, batch_size=32, num_workers=2)

sample_batch = next(iter(training_dataloader))
print("Training Data Batch:",sample_batch.keys())
sample_batch = next(iter(validation_dataloader))
print("Validation Data Batch:", sample_batch.keys())


```

In this final example, I instantiate the `TimeSeriesDataSet` using the merged and scaled DataFrame. The `time_idx`, `target`, and `group_ids` parameters are set to use the correct column from the prepared dataframe. `max_encoder_length` and `max_prediction_length` are defined, defining the sequence lengths used for input and prediction respectively.  The `time_varying_known_reals` parameter is left empty, and `time_varying_unknown_reals` specifies that the input features (scaled) and the target are the unknown reals. This allows the model to learn patterns using these features. Train and validation split has been carried out on the basis of timestamp and corresponding datasets are generated. Lastly, `DataLoader` objects are created to feed into a PyTorch model. Lastly, a sample batch is extracted to verify the data is being prepared as expected. The keys represent the various parts of data required by the model.

**Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the documentation of `pytorch-forecasting`. Pay close attention to the section on data preparation and the expected format for input. Further, exploring the `scikit-learn` documentation regarding `MinMaxScaler`, `StandardScaler`, and other relevant transformation classes is invaluable for making more informed scaling decisions. Additionally, reviewing literature on common time-series pre-processing techniques is recommended, as different problems might require specific approaches such as handling outliers or seasonality.
