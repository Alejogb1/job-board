TensorFlow's `saved_model.load()` failing to predict with multiple input batches often stems from an incompatibility between the model's expected input signature and the shape of the input batch provided during inference.  This frequently manifests as a `ValueError` or similar exception indicating a shape mismatch. In my experience debugging large-scale deployment pipelines, this issue has consistently been rooted in subtle differences between the training data preparation and the inference data pipeline.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `saved_model` format, while robust, relies heavily on the input signature defined during the model's saving process.  This signature explicitly defines the expected data types and shapes of the input tensors.  When loading a model via `tf.saved_model.load()`, TensorFlow uses this signature to validate the input provided during prediction. If the shape of your input batch deviates from what's specified in the signature, the loading process itself might succeed, but the `predict()` method will fail.

The most common cause is a mismatch in the batch size dimension.  The signature might expect a batch size of, for example, 32, while the inference code provides a batch of size 64 or even a single sample (batch size of 1).  However, mismatches can also arise in the other dimensions representing features or time steps, particularly when dealing with sequential models or models with multiple input tensors.  Furthermore, inconsistencies in data types (e.g., attempting to feed `float32` data to a model expecting `float64`) will also lead to failure.

A less common, but equally problematic, cause is an incorrect interpretation of the input signature itself. The `saved_model`'s `signatures` attribute can be complex, especially when multiple input tensors are involved.  Misunderstanding the order, names, and expected shapes of these tensors will invariably lead to prediction failures.  Careful examination of the signature and meticulous matching with the provided inference data is crucial for avoiding this pitfall.  Finally,  ensure the data pre-processing steps used during inference are precisely replicating those used during model training. Any discrepancies, even seemingly insignificant ones like different scaling factors or missing normalization, will corrupt the input and cause prediction errors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Batch Size Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Model definition (simplified for illustration)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,))])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Training data (batch size 32)
train_data = np.random.rand(32, 5)
train_labels = np.random.rand(32, 1)
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=1)

# Save the model
model.save('my_model')

# Load the model
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('my_model')

# Incorrect inference: Batch size mismatch
incorrect_input = np.random.rand(64, 5)  # Incorrect batch size: 64 instead of 32

try:
    predictions = loaded_model.signatures['serving_default'](tf.constant(incorrect_input))
    print(predictions)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Expecting a shape mismatch error here

# Correct inference: Using the correct batch size
correct_input = np.random.rand(32,5)
predictions = loaded_model.signatures['serving_default'](tf.constant(correct_input))
print(predictions)
```

This example highlights a common error. The model was trained and saved with an implicit batch size of 32. Attempting inference with a batch size of 64 results in an error because the input shape doesn't align with the saved model's expectations.

**Example 2: Multiple Input Tensors**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Model with two inputs
input_a = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
input_b = tf.keras.Input(shape=(5,))
x = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([input_a, input_b])
output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Training data
train_a = np.random.rand(32, 10)
train_b = np.random.rand(32, 5)
train_labels = np.random.rand(32, 1)
model.fit([train_a, train_b], train_labels, epochs=1)

model.save('my_model_multi_input')

loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('my_model_multi_input')

# Incorrect inference: Incorrect shape for input_a
incorrect_a = np.random.rand(32, 12)
incorrect_b = np.random.rand(32,5)

try:
    predictions = loaded_model.signatures['serving_default'](a=tf.constant(incorrect_a), b=tf.constant(incorrect_b))
    print(predictions)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Expecting an error due to shape mismatch in input_a

#Correct inference
correct_a = np.random.rand(32,10)
correct_b = np.random.rand(32,5)
predictions = loaded_model.signatures['serving_default'](a=tf.constant(correct_a), b=tf.constant(correct_b))
print(predictions)
```

This example showcases a model with two inputs.  Incorrect shapes for either `input_a` or `input_b` will cause a prediction failure.  Note the explicit naming (`a`, `b`) of input tensors when calling `signatures['serving_default']`. This is crucial when working with multiple inputs.

**Example 3: Data Type Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,), dtype='float64')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
train_data = np.random.rand(32, 5).astype('float64')
train_labels = np.random.rand(32, 1).astype('float64')
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=1)
model.save('my_model_dtype')
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('my_model_dtype')

# Incorrect inference: Wrong data type
incorrect_input = np.random.rand(32, 5).astype('float32')

try:
    predictions = loaded_model.signatures['serving_default'](tf.constant(incorrect_input))
    print(predictions)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Expecting an error due to data type mismatch.


#Correct Inference: Correct data type
correct_input = np.random.rand(32, 5).astype('float64')
predictions = loaded_model.signatures['serving_default'](tf.constant(correct_input))
print(predictions)
```

This demonstrates the importance of matching data types.  If your model is saved using `float64`, providing `float32` data will likely cause issues.  TensorFlow might implicitly cast the data, but this can lead to performance degradation or unexpected results.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.saved_model` and the `tf.saved_model.load()` function.  Furthermore, examining the  `signatures` attribute of the loaded `saved_model` object to understand the expected input shapes and data types will prove invaluable. Finally, carefully review the documentation on Keras model saving and loading for best practices.  These resources provide detailed explanations and examples covering various aspects of model saving, loading and inference, including handling multiple inputs and outputs.  Thorough understanding of these guidelines is essential for robust model deployment.
