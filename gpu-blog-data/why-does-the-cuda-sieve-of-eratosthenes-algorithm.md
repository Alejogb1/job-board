The CUDA implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, while seemingly straightforward, encounters a scalability bottleneck when processing numbers exceeding 1,000,000 due primarily to limitations in memory management and thread synchronization as the problem size increases. I’ve repeatedly observed this behavior when developing GPU-accelerated number theory tools, and the root causes stem from how we manage shared and global memory within the CUDA architecture.

The fundamental Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, in its sequential form, iteratively identifies primes by marking multiples of each prime number within a given range as composite. A GPU implementation, ideally, distributes this work across many parallel threads. However, the simplicity of the algorithm belies significant challenges that arise when scaling to larger numbers. The primary culprit in the performance degradation and eventual failure beyond 1,000,000 is inadequate shared memory utilization. Within a CUDA kernel, shared memory is a small, fast, on-chip memory space accessible by all threads within a thread block. This is ideal for collaborative tasks where threads need to quickly exchange and access data. However, with very large ranges, the requirement to store the sieve array (representing whether a number is prime or composite) within shared memory becomes infeasible. This forces a transition to global memory, which is much slower.

When dealing with numbers beyond 1,000,000, the sieve array, represented usually as a boolean array, can easily exceed the size of shared memory available per thread block. Consequently, the sieve array must be located in global device memory. This introduces a significant performance penalty due to the substantially longer latency of global memory accesses. Furthermore, the sheer number of read and write operations becomes a major bottleneck. Each thread, in the ideal scenario, would be checking a distinct portion of the sieve, but as the sieve grows, cache thrashing in global memory becomes a notable problem. Even with sophisticated memory access patterns, such as coalesced access, the contention for the memory bus and the inherent latency of global memory become limiting factors. Another problem arises from the design of the CUDA grid. The grid is composed of thread blocks, and while these blocks are processed in parallel, communication and data synchronization between them is not straightforward. The Sieve requires marking multiples of identified primes, which potentially affects the sieve array locations being handled by different blocks. If a block has identified a prime, the writing to corresponding multiples in global memory that may be handled by different blocks suffers from the same latency penalty. There is no efficient inter-block synchronization mechanism for such updates other than the use of atomic operations, which themselves contribute to performance degradation.

The second significant hurdle arises from efficient handling of the prime identification process itself. Within a block, threads should ideally collaborate to identify the primes and their multiples. When the range exceeds the block size, the process of identifying these multiples becomes distributed over multiple blocks. This distribution further compounds the issue.

Let’s consider how this manifests in code. The following examples are simplified to illustrate the core issues and do not represent production-ready code. The goal is to highlight the memory access and synchronization bottlenecks.

**Example 1: Shared Memory Allocation Attempt (Fails for Large Ranges)**

```c++
__global__ void sieveKernel_shared_memory(bool* sieve, int n) {
  extern __shared__ bool sharedSieve[];
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;

  // Initialize Shared Memory
  for(int i = threadIdx.x; i < n; i+= blockDim.x){
       sharedSieve[i] = true;
  }
  __syncthreads();

  for(int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
      if(sharedSieve[i]) {
         for(int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
             sharedSieve[j] = false;
        }
      }
  }
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronize after writes
     for(int i= threadIdx.x; i < n; i+= blockDim.x){
         sieve[i] = sharedSieve[i];
     }
}

// Host code (simplified):
// bool* d_sieve; cudaMalloc(..., sizeof(bool) * n);
// sieveKernel_shared_memory<<<grid, block, shared_mem_size>>> (d_sieve, n);
```

*   **Commentary:** This example demonstrates the attempt to allocate the entire sieve array into shared memory. The kernel first initializes shared memory, then performs the sieve algorithm within the shared space, and finally, copies the results into global memory. This will work well for small values of `n`, but will fail for larger ranges that exceed the shared memory limitations as it will either result in compilation errors (due to insufficient shared memory) or cause unexpected behavior (corrupted data). It also suffers from the inherent restriction of being single block limited.

**Example 2: Global Memory Sieve (Performance Bottleneck)**

```c++
__global__ void sieveKernel_global_memory(bool* sieve, int n) {
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;

   for(int i= idx; i < n; i+=stride){
      sieve[i] = true;
   }
    __syncthreads();
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
        if (sieve[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
               if(j % stride == idx % stride){ // Apply stride to writes to minimize collisions.
                  sieve[j] = false;
               }
           }
       }
    }
}
// Host Code (simplified):
// bool* d_sieve; cudaMalloc(..., sizeof(bool) * n);
// sieveKernel_global_memory<<<grid, block>>> (d_sieve, n);
```

*   **Commentary:** This kernel implements the sieve algorithm directly within global device memory. Initialization and computation are performed directly on global memory. While functional, this approach is significantly slower than utilizing shared memory due to memory access latency and potential cache thrashing. The addition of a stride calculation in the second loop reduces some collision in memory access, but does not eliminate the core bottleneck of global memory read and write times.

**Example 3: Global Memory with Atomic Operations (Synchronization Overhead)**

```c++
__global__ void sieveKernel_atomic(bool* sieve, int n) {
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;
    for(int i= idx; i < n; i+=stride){
       sieve[i] = true;
    }
    __syncthreads();
  for(int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
        if (sieve[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
               atomicExch((int *)&sieve[j], 0); // Atomic write to ensure consistency across blocks
            }
         }
  }
}

// Host code (simplified)
// bool* d_sieve; cudaMalloc(..., sizeof(bool) * n);
// sieveKernel_atomic<<<grid, block>>> (d_sieve, n);

```

*   **Commentary:** This example uses atomic operations to ensure correct writing to global memory across blocks. While this approach addresses the data races that might occur in the non-atomic version, atomic operations introduce significant performance overhead. Moreover, they do not eliminate the root cause related to global memory read/write latency and bandwidth limitations. This makes this solution significantly slower, with a more pronounced effect for larger datasets.

To address these limitations, one would need to resort to more advanced memory management techniques and parallel algorithms. Techniques that use multiple stages, combining local computations on slices of the whole problem with later aggregation on reduced data sets become necessary for this problem scale. Furthermore, an understanding of how the hardware is processing requests is required to develop efficient memory access patterns, taking advantage of memory coalescing.

For further exploration, I suggest investigating resources that focus on advanced CUDA programming techniques, particularly the subjects of:

1.  **Memory Access Optimization in CUDA**: These materials cover concepts such as memory coalescing, shared memory access patterns, and efficient use of different memory spaces.
2.  **CUDA Advanced Synchronization Methods**: Learning about techniques such as using CUDA events and streams for asynchronous operations and inter-block communication is essential.
3. **Parallel Algorithmic Design on GPUs**: Understanding how to decompose problems into parallelizable tasks that efficiently utilize GPU resources is vital for larger-scale computations.

By considering these key concepts, one can better understand the scalability limitations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes on CUDA and develop more robust and efficient solutions. The presented examples illustrate why naive implementations fail and point to directions for improved solutions.
