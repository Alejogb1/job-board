Mailchimp's failure to render template variables, despite correct syntax in the editor, often stems from a misalignment between how merge tags are defined in the campaign template and how the associated data is structured within the audience (contact list) or passed via the API. I've encountered this numerous times managing email marketing workflows, and the issue rarely lies with Mailchimp's core rendering engine itself, but more frequently with the data pipeline leading up to it.

**Explanation of the Problem**

The central concept to understand is Mailchimp's use of *merge tags*. These are placeholders, typically denoted by `*|MERGE_TAG|*`, which are meant to be dynamically replaced with data when a campaign is sent.  The data source for these tags is typically a combination of:

1.  **Audience Fields:**  Each contact list in Mailchimp has associated custom fields (or default ones like `FNAME` for first name).  The merge tags refer to these field names. If, for instance, you have a field named `PREFERRED_COLOR`, a merge tag would be `*|PREFERRED_COLOR|*`.

2.  **Campaign Settings:** Certain merge tags are configured directly within the campaign settings, such as subject lines or pre-header text.

3.  **Transactional API Data:** For transactional emails or campaigns triggered via API calls, custom merge tag data is passed along with the recipient information.

The disconnect occurs when the merge tag name in the email template does not precisely match the corresponding audience field name or API-provided data key.  Even minor discrepancies, such as differing case (e.g., `Preferred_Color` vs. `PREFERRED_COLOR`), or the presence of extra spaces (e.g., `PREFERRED COLOR` vs. `PREFERRED_COLOR`), will prevent the system from resolving the tag and rendering the associated value. Consequently, the merge tag remains visible as plain text in the email.

Furthermore, data types and formats play a significant role. If a merge tag is designed to display a numerical value, but the corresponding audience field or API data provides a text string, the tag may fail to render or, in some cases, may render improperly, displaying unexpected characters.

It’s essential to also consider the context in which the merge tags are being used.  While Mailchimp is generally good at interpolating variables in various parts of the email body, certain sections, like custom HTML blocks, may require special handling or might interact differently with conditional merge tag logic.

Additionally, the existence of conditional merge tag logic, often using `*|IF:MERGE_TAG|* ... *|END:IF|*` statements, introduces another layer of potential failures.  If the condition is not correctly formulated or the provided data does not satisfy the condition, the entire conditional block might not render. Improperly nested conditional logic is another common source of rendering issues.

**Code Examples and Commentary**

Below are illustrative examples, assuming the user is working through Mailchimp’s UI or a custom integration.

*Example 1: Simple Merge Tag Mismatch*

Imagine an email template containing:

```html
<p>Hello, *|FirstName|*!</p>
```

However, the corresponding field in the Mailchimp audience list is actually named `FNAME`. The email sent will literally display:

```html
<p>Hello, *|FirstName|*!</p>
```

This is a straight-forward case of a merge tag name mismatch.

To correct this, the email template needs to be adjusted:

```html
<p>Hello, *|FNAME|*!</p>
```

The fix involves directly aligning the merge tag to the defined audience field. I’ve found that thoroughly auditing the Mailchimp audience's field names against the used merge tags often reveals this kind of mistake.

*Example 2: Case Sensitivity and White Space Errors*

Consider this example within a conditional block.

```html
*|IF:USER_TYPE|*
  <p>Your user type is *|user_type|*.</p>
*|END:IF|*
```

Here, both a merge tag and a conditional test rely on `USER_TYPE`. Let's say in the audience data, there is a field named `user type`, lowercase with a space. The email will likely render nothing, because the case and space do not match, resulting in neither the IF statement, nor the merge tag, to be valid.

To rectify, the Mailchimp audience field must be named `USER_TYPE` exactly as the conditional and the merge tag expect:

```html
*|IF:USER_TYPE|*
  <p>Your user type is *|USER_TYPE|*.</p>
*|END:IF|*
```

Consistent naming conventions and meticulous attention to case and spacing are paramount to avoid such issues. Using a code editor with syntax highlighting can greatly assist in catching these errors before deployment.

*Example 3: API data passing issues with arrays*

When utilizing the Mailchimp Transactional API, suppose I am attempting to pass an array of order items:

```json
{
    "to": [
        {
            "email": "test@example.com",
            "type": "to",
             "merge_vars": {
                "ORDER_ITEMS": ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]
              }
        }
    ],
	"template_name": "order-confirmation",
  	"template_content":[]
}
```

Within my Mailchimp email template I have

```html
<p>Order items: *|ORDER_ITEMS|*</p>
```

This would result in the email rendering the merge tag as text. When providing complex data structures from an external source via the API, direct output of an array via merge tags like this is not supported by Mailchimp. I must instead extract individual values from the array within my external code before sending, or use Mailchimp's syntax for looping over the array.

Alternatively, the data could be processed beforehand, perhaps by converting it to a string and then passing it via the API. This could be done by combining each item with a line-break:

```python
def create_order_string(items):
  return "<br/>".join(items)

order_items = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]

order_items_string = create_order_string(order_items)


api_payload = {
    "to": [
        {
            "email": "test@example.com",
            "type": "to",
             "merge_vars": {
                "ORDER_ITEMS": order_items_string
              }
        }
    ],
	"template_name": "order-confirmation",
  	"template_content":[]
}
```
And then the template would render.

```html
<p>Order items: *|ORDER_ITEMS|*</p>
```

This demonstrates that API-driven campaigns require careful mapping and transformation of data to be compatible with merge tags.

**Resource Recommendations**

While Mailchimp provides ample documentation, direct references are not provided here. When troubleshooting, I have found these resources essential:

1.  **Mailchimp's Merge Tag Documentation:** Familiarizing myself with the official documentation is always the starting point. The documentation covers supported tag syntax, data type expectations, and troubleshooting tips. Pay close attention to the specific nuances when working with conditional statements.

2.  **Mailchimp Support Forums:** Engaging with the broader Mailchimp community through their forums often reveals solutions to specific edge cases that may not be immediately apparent in the official documentation.

3.  **Email Testing Platforms:** To see email rendering more accurately, I've often utilized third-party email testing platforms which can offer a more precise picture of how the email will appear across diverse email clients, including rendering of merge tag values. These allow you to preview how rendered output and potential template issues are handled by the software.
