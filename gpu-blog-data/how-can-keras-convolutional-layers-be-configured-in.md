The fundamental aspect governing Keras convolutional layer configuration within TensorFlow 2.0 lies in the nuanced interplay between layer parameters and the inherent properties of the input data.  My experience optimizing image recognition models has highlighted the critical need for precise control over these parameters to achieve optimal performance and computational efficiency.  Failing to consider these interdependencies often leads to suboptimal models, characterized by overfitting, slow training times, or inadequate feature extraction.  This response will detail the essential configurations and provide illustrative examples.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras convolutional layers, implemented within the TensorFlow 2.0 framework, are defined using the `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` class.  This class offers a comprehensive suite of parameters enabling fine-grained control over the convolutional process.  The most critical parameters include:

* **`filters`:** This integer specifies the number of output filters in the convolution. Each filter learns a distinct set of weights, effectively detecting different features in the input. Increasing the number of filters generally increases model capacity but also computational cost.  Experimentation, guided by validation performance, is essential to find the optimal number.

* **`kernel_size`:**  This parameter defines the spatial dimensions of the convolutional kernel (filter).  Common sizes include (3, 3) and (5, 5), representing 3x3 and 5x5 kernels respectively.  Larger kernels capture broader contextual information but require more computation.

* **`strides`:** This tuple or integer determines the step size at which the kernel moves across the input.  A stride of (1, 1) implies that the kernel moves one pixel at a time, while a larger stride reduces computational cost at the expense of potentially losing fine-grained detail.

* **`padding`:** This parameter, usually set to 'valid' or 'same', controls how the input boundaries are handled.  'valid' padding discards boundary pixels that cannot be fully covered by the kernel, resulting in a smaller output.  'same' padding ensures the output has the same spatial dimensions as the input by padding the boundaries with zeros.  The choice between these significantly affects the output shape and computational requirements.

* **`activation`:** This specifies the activation function applied to the output of the convolution.  Popular choices include ReLU (`'relu'`), sigmoid (`'sigmoid'`), and tanh (`'tanh'`).  The choice of activation function impacts the non-linearity of the model and its ability to learn complex patterns.

* **`use_bias`:**  A boolean indicating whether to use a bias term in the convolutional layer.  Biases add an additional degree of freedom to the learning process and are often included unless specific regularization strategies suggest otherwise.

* **`kernel_initializer` and `bias_initializer`:** These parameters control the initialization of the convolutional kernel weights and bias terms, respectively. Appropriate initialization strategies, such as 'glorot_uniform' or 'he_normal', can aid in faster and more stable training.

Careful consideration of these parameters, in relation to the input data's dimensions and the desired model complexity, is crucial for successful convolutional layer configuration.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Convolutional Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))

# Commentary: This defines a simple convolutional layer with 32 filters, a 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation, and expects an input of 28x28 grayscale images (1 channel). Input_shape is crucial for the first layer.
```

**Example 2:  Convolutional Layer with Striding and Padding**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(5, 5), strides=(2, 2), padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(128,128,3)))

# Commentary: This example demonstrates the use of strides and 'same' padding. The output will have the same spatial dimensions as the input (128x128) despite the 5x5 kernel due to padding. The stride of (2,2) downsamples the feature maps.  This is useful in reducing computational load in deeper networks.  The input is a 128x128 color image (3 channels).
```

**Example 3:  Advanced Configuration with Weight Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=128, kernel_size=(3,3), strides=(1,1), padding='valid', activation='relu',
                                  kernel_initializer='he_normal', bias_initializer='zeros', input_shape=(64,64,3)))

# Commentary: This example showcases more advanced options. 'he_normal' initializer is used for the weights, which is suitable for ReLU activation. Bias is initialized to zero.  'valid' padding is used; therefore, the output dimensions will be smaller than the input.  This configuration might be suitable for a later layer in a deeper network where the feature maps are already sufficiently reduced.
```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation for detailed explanations of each parameter and their impact.  Furthermore, reviewing established deep learning textbooks focusing on convolutional neural networks provides a strong theoretical foundation.  Finally, examining well-documented Keras example projects will offer practical insights into effective layer configurations for various tasks.  These resources will provide a comprehensive understanding beyond the scope of this response.  Careful experimentation and iterative model refinement based on validation performance remain paramount in optimizing convolutional layer configurations.  Remember to meticulously track your experiments and the resulting metrics to make informed decisions.  My experience has shown that systematic approaches yield the most robust and efficient models.
