Accessing the current learning rate and training step within a custom TensorFlow layer requires careful consideration of TensorFlow's execution graph and the lifecycle of training operations.  My experience building and deploying large-scale models for image recognition has highlighted the importance of this functionality, particularly for implementing dynamic learning rate scheduling and logging custom metrics directly within the layer itself.  The key fact is that this information isn't directly available as attributes of the layer; rather, it needs to be accessed through the training context using TensorFlow's built-in mechanisms.

1. **Clear Explanation:**  The learning rate and training step aren't inherent properties of a TensorFlow layer.  A layer encapsulates the computation performed on its input, not the global training parameters. To retrieve this information, you must leverage the `tf.compat.v1.train.get_global_step()` function for the training step and access the learning rate indirectly through the optimizer. The optimizer holds the current learning rate, and while it's not directly exposed as an attribute, you can access it through its associated slot variables or by querying the optimizer's learning rate schedule.  Crucially, this access must occur within the `call` method of your custom layer, during the forward pass, where the training context is active.  Attempting to access these values outside of the training loop or within a separate function will result in errors, as the necessary training context will be unavailable.  Also remember that the global step counter is incremented only during the training process; attempting access during model inference will yield unpredictable behavior.  This difference in context is a frequent source of errors I've encountered in my development efforts.

2. **Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Accessing Learning Rate via Optimizer Slots (TensorFlow 2.x)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units):
    super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
    self.units = units
    self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(1, units), initializer='random_normal')

  def call(self, inputs):
    global_step = tf.compat.v1.train.get_global_step()
    optimizer = self.optimizer # Assumes optimizer is set at a higher level.
    learning_rate = optimizer._decayed_lr(var_list=[self.w]) # Access lr via decayed_lr method

    print(f"Step: {global_step.numpy()}, Learning Rate: {learning_rate.numpy()}") #for printing

    return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)


model = tf.keras.Sequential([CustomLayer(10)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')
model.optimizer = optimizer # crucial step to connect optimizer to layer
# ...training loop...
```

This example demonstrates accessing the learning rate using the optimizer's internal `_decayed_lr` method, which provides the learning rate after any decay schedules have been applied.  The optimizer is explicitly set both during compilation and within the layer. This addresses scenarios where multiple optimizers might be used in a larger model, ensuring the correct optimizer is used in the layer.  The crucial aspect is associating the optimizer instance correctly with the model and then referencing it within the custom layer's `call` method.

**Example 2:  Indirect Learning Rate Access (TensorFlow 1.x Compatibility)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units):
    super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
    self.units = units
    self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(1, units), initializer='random_normal')

  def call(self, inputs):
    global_step = tf.compat.v1.train.get_global_step()
    # Indirect Access - assuming a learning rate variable exists in the graph.
    lr = tf.compat.v1.get_variable('learning_rate') # Requires prior definition
    print(f"Step: {global_step.numpy()}, Learning Rate: {lr.numpy()}")

    return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

# ... (Requires prior definition of learning_rate variable in the graph) ...
```

This example illustrates an indirect method, suitable for environments maintaining TensorFlow 1.x compatibility. This approach requires pre-defining a `learning_rate` variable within the TensorFlow graph before the layer's creation.  This method is less preferred due to its reliance on external variable management and potential for conflicts.


**Example 3: Handling Potential Errors (Robust Approach)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units):
    super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
    self.units = units
    self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(1, units), initializer='random_normal')

  def call(self, inputs, training=True):
    global_step = tf.compat.v1.train.get_global_step()
    try:
      optimizer = self.optimizer
      learning_rate = optimizer._decayed_lr(var_list=[self.w])
      print(f"Step: {global_step.numpy()}, Learning Rate: {learning_rate.numpy()}")
    except AttributeError:
      print("Optimizer not found.  This likely indicates inference mode.")
      learning_rate = tf.constant(0.0) # Default value during inference

    return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

# ... (rest of the code similar to Example 1) ...

```

This example incorporates error handling to manage scenarios where the optimizer might not be available, which typically occurs during inference. The `try-except` block gracefully handles the `AttributeError` that would arise if the `optimizer` attribute is missing, providing a fallback mechanism to prevent runtime crashes.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on custom layers, optimizers, and training loops, are invaluable resources.  A deep understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution model and variable scopes is essential.  Furthermore, studying examples of custom training loops and dynamic learning rate schedules provided in TensorFlow tutorials will significantly enhance understanding.  Finally, reviewing advanced topics like custom training routines and tf.function usage will provide further context and address advanced scenarios.
