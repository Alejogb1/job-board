The ability to inspect a function's own state, as well as the arguments it receives, is a powerful capability for debugging, logging, and dynamic adaptation within Python. I’ve found that techniques using introspection, specifically via the `inspect` module, and decorator-based approaches, offer the most effective means of achieving this.

**Explanation:**

Python, unlike some statically typed languages, allows significant runtime introspection. This means a function can inquire about its own details (like the code it contains) and the environment it executes within (like the arguments it was invoked with). This is facilitated primarily through the `inspect` module and its related functionalities.

The `inspect` module provides tools to dissect callable objects—functions, methods, classes, and even generators. Key functions that enable this specific type of self and argument profiling include:

*   `inspect.currentframe()`: This retrieves the frame object for the current execution stack. From this frame, we can access various details about the current function's execution context.
*   `inspect.getargvalues(frame)`: Using a frame object, this returns a named tuple containing local variables, arguments, and the keyword arguments passed to a function.
*   `inspect.signature(callable)`: This function allows for retrieving a `Signature` object, which gives us detailed information about the callable’s parameters and their default values.
*   `inspect.getsource(callable)`: This returns the source code of the callable object, enabling analysis of its structure.
*   `inspect.getmembers(object)`: This method can retrieve the attributes of a given object, for instance, to access data related to a class instance (`self` in the context of an instance method).

When we want to inspect arguments, `getargvalues` and `signature` are usually our starting points. `getargvalues` gives us the actual values of the arguments at the point the frame is being analyzed. `signature`, on the other hand, gives us information about the function’s parameter definition.

To capture the instance of an object (i.e., `self`) in methods, we can directly pass the instance as the object argument to `getmembers`. Within the method we can access `self` implicitly.

Decorator usage provides a very clean and reusable approach. A decorator wraps a function, allowing interception of function calls and modification of their behavior without altering the original function's code directly. These wrappers can access the original function and its arguments and, therefore, provide the desired profiling capability.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Argument Inspection with `inspect.getargvalues`**

This example demonstrates how to inspect argument values using `inspect.getargvalues` within a function.

```python
import inspect

def inspect_arguments(a, b, c=3, *args, **kwargs):
    frame = inspect.currentframe()
    args_info = inspect.getargvalues(frame)
    print(f"Function Name: {args_info.frame.f_code.co_name}")
    print(f"Arguments: {args_info.args}")  # The parameter names
    print(f"Argument values: {args_info.locals}") # The actual values
    print(f"Variable Args: {args_info.varargs}") # Args captured by *args
    print(f"Keyword Args: {args_info.keywords}") # Kwargs captured by **kwargs
    return a + b + c

inspect_arguments(1, 2, 5, 6, 7, key1="value1", key2="value2")
```

**Commentary:**

Here, within `inspect_arguments`, `inspect.currentframe()` gets the current frame. `inspect.getargvalues()` extracts various elements of the execution context. The output clearly shows how arguments `a`, `b`, and the optional `c` are identified by name and have their respective values printed. The example also shows variable position and keyword arguments. This illustrates the capability to access argument names as well as their values during runtime. It is important to note that `args_info.args` provides the names of the function parameters, whereas `args_info.locals` provides a dictionary of the actual local variables available during function execution, including the arguments with their assigned values. `args_info.varargs` captures positional arguments passed via the *args parameter, and `args_info.keywords` those passed via the **kwargs parameter.

**Example 2: Decorator-based Logging of Arguments**

This example demonstrates a decorator to log arguments passed to any function.

```python
import inspect
from functools import wraps

def log_arguments(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        signature = inspect.signature(func)
        bound_arguments = signature.bind(*args, **kwargs)
        bound_arguments.apply_defaults()  # handle default argument
        print(f"Calling function: {func.__name__}")
        for name, value in bound_arguments.arguments.items():
            print(f"  Argument: {name} = {value}")

        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return result
    return wrapper


@log_arguments
def sample_function(x, y=2):
    return x * y


sample_function(5, y=4)
sample_function(x=3)

```

**Commentary:**

The `log_arguments` function is a decorator that wraps another function.  The inner `wrapper` function uses `inspect.signature` to retrieve parameter information about the decorated function. We bind the arguments passed to the wrapper function using `signature.bind`. `apply_defaults()` fills in default argument values when not explicitly provided. The function name, arguments, and their values are printed to the console before the original function is called. The `functools.wraps` decorator preserves the identity (e.g., name and docstring) of the wrapped function. Finally, the result of the original function is returned. This shows a clean, reusable way to incorporate profiling behavior into various functions.

**Example 3: Accessing ‘self’ and Attributes in a Class Method**

This demonstrates how to access the `self` instance and its attributes using `inspect` and the object instance.

```python
import inspect

class ExampleClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.attribute = value

    def method(self, x):
        print(f"self: {self}")
        members = inspect.getmembers(self)
        for name, value in members:
            if not name.startswith("__") and not callable(value):
                 print(f"{name} = {value}")
        return self.attribute + x

instance = ExampleClass(10)
result = instance.method(5)

print(f"Result from method: {result}")

```

**Commentary:**

Inside the `method`, the implicit `self` argument is the instance of `ExampleClass`. We obtain a list of all members of the instance using `inspect.getmembers(self)`. We filter out magic methods and callable attributes. This allows accessing and printing the instance's members (e.g., `attribute`). This example uses the direct access of `self` within the scope of the function, and illustrates how its members can be explored via `inspect` functionality. The output confirms the access to the attributes of the instance and that `self` is indeed the calling object. This demonstrates how ‘self’ and instance attributes can be profiled in a class method.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further study, the official Python documentation for the `inspect` module is essential. Exploring resources that delve into decorators, specifically the `functools` module, will aid in understanding how to use decorators in advanced ways, including wrapping functions for profiling. In-depth tutorials on Python's data model, focusing on how objects and classes are structured, provides deeper context on how the `self` attribute works and how to best analyze object attributes. Finally, delving into the underlying mechanisms of the CPython interpreter can assist in understanding the frame concept and its implications for profiling and inspection.
