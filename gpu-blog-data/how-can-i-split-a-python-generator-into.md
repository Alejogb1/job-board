Achieving parallel processing with a Python generator directly is not inherently possible due to the single-threaded nature of generators. Generators are designed for sequential, lazy evaluation. However, the objective of dividing generator output for concurrent handling can be accomplished through strategic approaches involving techniques like process pools and customized iterators. I've implemented various forms of this while processing large telemetry datasets, where dividing computation becomes crucial.

My strategy focuses on decoupling the generation process from the parallel processing component. This involves creating an initial generator, often a data source, which produces elements. Subsequently, I divide the processing based on this stream, assigning portions to different workers. I'll detail the common methods and provide specific code examples.

The most frequent scenario I encounter involves needing to accelerate computations on large, read-only datasets. Directly working with the raw generator for parallel execution is problematic due to generator's statefulness. Each call advances the internal pointer; it cannot be rewound or copied across multiple threads or processes. To handle this, I primarily use two techniques: creating multiple iterators based on a shared data structure or using a process pool to consume the generator output and distribute the workload.

The first method involves creating custom iterators. I've used this method when needing fine-grained control over the distribution logic or when I don't have a clearly defined number of processing units in advance. This involves a function or class that takes the generator and desired chunk size as input. It creates multiple "independent" iterators that draw data from the original generator in slices. This, of course, assumes the data source is structured in a way that makes slicing meaningful and that order isn't absolutely critical, since the overall processing order of all data will be different but each individual chunk within a worker will be processed in order.

Here's a Python example of this concept:

```python
from itertools import islice

def chunked_generator(generator, chunk_size):
    """
    Transforms a generator into an iterator of chunked iterators.

    Args:
        generator: The original generator object.
        chunk_size: The desired size of each chunk.

    Yields:
       An iterator representing a slice of the original generator.
    """
    while True:
        chunk = list(islice(generator, chunk_size))
        if not chunk:
            break
        yield iter(chunk)

def process_chunk(chunk_iterator):
    """
    A placeholder function simulating chunk processing by a worker.

    Args:
        chunk_iterator: An iterator containing data for this worker.

    Returns:
        A list of processed results.
    """
    results = []
    for item in chunk_iterator:
       results.append(item*2)
    return results

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Sample Generator
    sample_gen = (x for x in range(100))
    # Get chunked iterators, 10 elements at a time
    chunk_iterators = chunked_generator(sample_gen, 10)

    # Process the chunks (simulating parallel)
    all_results = []
    for chunk_iterator in chunk_iterators:
        chunk_results = process_chunk(chunk_iterator)
        all_results.extend(chunk_results)

    print (all_results)
```

In this example, `chunked_generator` transforms the original `sample_gen` into an iterator that yields new iterators of the specified chunk size. This allows for a loop or other logic (such as utilizing threads or processes) to handle each chunk independently. The function `process_chunk` acts as a placeholder for processing each chunk individually. `islice` from the itertools library allows to extract a 'slice' without consuming the whole generator. The main part of the code demonstrates how a consumer would iterate through these slices for parallel processing.

A second and more robust approach, particularly for CPU-bound tasks, involves using the `multiprocessing` library's process pool. This methodology consumes data from a single generator instance but uses multiple processes for computation, and is usually better for leveraging true parallelism across CPU cores. The poolâ€™s `map` or `imap` functions can distribute the data among processes. I've found this approach especially useful when handling computationally expensive operations.

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def generator():
    """ A dummy generator yielding elements. """
    for i in range(100):
       yield i
       time.sleep(0.01) # To mimic processing time


def process_element(element):
    """ A dummy processor function. """
    return element * 2

if __name__ == '__main__':
   with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:
      results = pool.imap(process_element, generator())
      all_results = list(results)
      print(all_results)
```

Here, the generator is directly passed into the `pool.imap` method.  `imap` returns an iterator that yields results as they become available from the worker processes; this prevents all the results from having to be stored in memory which might be important for large datasets. The `process_element` function represents a placeholder for whatever work you want to do on a given element. The pool creates four separate processes to carry out the work.

Another variant, still leveraging process pools, involves distributing the data processing in chunks, which can be more efficient when dealing with high computational overhead per unit. Instead of distributing the individual elements, a sequence of these elements are processed by each worker.

```python
import multiprocessing
from itertools import islice

def generator():
    """ A dummy generator yielding elements. """
    for i in range(100):
       yield i

def chunked_generator(generator, chunk_size):
    """
    Transforms a generator into a sequence of chunked lists.

    Args:
       generator: The original generator object.
       chunk_size: The desired size of each chunk.

    Yields:
       A list representing a slice of the original generator.
    """
    while True:
        chunk = list(islice(generator, chunk_size))
        if not chunk:
           break
        yield chunk


def process_chunk(chunk):
    """
        A placeholder function simulating chunk processing by a worker.

    Args:
       chunk: A list of elements to be processed.

    Returns:
       A list of processed results.
    """
    results = []
    for item in chunk:
        results.append(item * 2)
    return results


if __name__ == '__main__':
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:
        # Create chunks of data
        data_chunks = chunked_generator(generator(), 10)
        # Map the processing function to the chunks, returning a list of lists
        results = pool.map(process_chunk, data_chunks)
        # Combine all results into one list
        all_results = []
        for result_list in results:
            all_results.extend(result_list)
        print(all_results)

```

This example creates chunks of the generator, as in the first example, but then uses multiprocessing to process entire chunks of elements in parallel using `pool.map`. This can be advantageous if the overhead of creating a process is significant compared to the amount of processing per single item. The returned results are stored in a list of lists, which then need to be flattened after all processing is done. This approach combines the ideas of both previous techniques for a potential performance benefit in some use cases.

For readers wanting to learn more, I would suggest a focused study of Python's `itertools` module for generator manipulation, including functions such as `islice`, and the `multiprocessing` library for utilizing CPU cores. Books dedicated to concurrency in Python and guides focused on efficient data processing can also be helpful. Exploring concepts of generator exhaustion and statefulness will allow for a deeper understanding of the problems involved and provide context to choose the correct solution.
