The core challenge in preventing redundant asynchronous tasks in Python's `asyncio` when awaiting previous results lies in effectively managing task dependencies and avoiding the creation of duplicate tasks while handling potentially delayed or failed operations.  My experience implementing high-throughput data processing pipelines has highlighted the crucial role of proper task orchestration in addressing this.  Ignoring this leads to resource exhaustion and unpredictable execution times.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Redundant async tasks arise when the same operation is initiated multiple times, particularly when awaiting the outcome of a preceding task.  This often stems from a lack of proper synchronization or error handling within the asynchronous flow.  For example, if a task fails and a retry mechanism is poorly implemented, multiple instances of the same retry task might be launched concurrently. Similarly,  in scenarios where multiple parts of the application might independently initiate the same long-running asynchronous operation,  duplication is easily introduced without a central coordination mechanism.

Efficient prevention requires a multi-pronged approach:

* **Task Queues:**  Using a queue (such as `asyncio.Queue`) allows centralizing the requests for asynchronous operations. Before initiating a task, check if an identical task (defined by a unique identifier representing its parameters) is already present in the queue or currently running.  If so, simply await its completion instead of spawning a duplicate.

* **Futures and `asyncio.gather`:**  `asyncio.Future` objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. They can be used to track the progress and outcome of a task, even across different parts of the application.  `asyncio.gather` facilitates awaiting multiple futures concurrently, simplifying the management of dependent tasks.  Careful use of these primitives ensures that dependencies are correctly handled and prevents unnecessary task creation.

* **Task Cancellation:**  Implement robust cancellation mechanisms to terminate redundant tasks that are launched before a prior instance completes.  This prevents resource wastage and improves responsiveness.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Using a Queue to Prevent Duplicate Tasks:**

```python
import asyncio

async def my_long_running_task(task_id):
    print(f"Task {task_id}: Starting...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate long-running operation
    print(f"Task {task_id}: Completed.")
    return task_id

async def main():
    queue = asyncio.Queue()
    task_ids_in_progress = set()

    async def process_task(task_id):
        if task_id in task_ids_in_progress:
            print(f"Task {task_id}: Already in progress. Awaiting completion.")
            return await queue.get()
        task_ids_in_progress.add(task_id)
        queue.put_nowait(await my_long_running_task(task_id))
        task_ids_in_progress.remove(task_id)


    await asyncio.gather(
        process_task(1),
        process_task(1), # Duplicate task
        process_task(2),
        process_task(3),
        process_task(2) # Duplicate task
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

This example demonstrates how a queue and a set tracking in-progress tasks prevent the redundant execution of `my_long_running_task`.


**Example 2:  Using Futures and `asyncio.gather` for Dependent Tasks:**

```python
import asyncio

async def task_a():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Result A"

async def task_b(result_a):
    print(f"Task B received: {result_a}")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return "Result B"

async def main():
    future_a = asyncio.create_task(task_a())
    result_a = await future_a
    future_b = asyncio.create_task(task_b(result_a))
    result_b = await future_b
    print(f"Final Result: {result_b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Here, `task_b` depends on the completion of `task_a`. The use of `asyncio.create_task` and `await` ensures that `task_b` is only executed after `task_a` finishes, preventing potential race conditions and ensuring correct dependencies.

**Example 3:  Implementing Task Cancellation:**

```python
import asyncio

async def long_running_task(task_id, cancel_event):
    print(f"Task {task_id}: Starting...")
    try:
        await asyncio.sleep(5) # Simulate long running operation.
        print(f"Task {task_id}: Completed.")
        return task_id
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print(f"Task {task_id}: Cancelled.")
        return None

async def main():
    cancel_event = asyncio.Event()
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(long_running_task(1, cancel_event))
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(long_running_task(2, cancel_event))
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    cancel_event.set()
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    task1.cancel()  # Cancel task 1 if it is still running.

    try:
        await task1
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
    print("All tasks handled.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
This example shows how to use `asyncio.Event` and `asyncio.CancelledError` to manage task cancellation.  `task1` is cancelled after `task2` is initiated, demonstrating how to gracefully handle cancelled tasks.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of asynchronous programming in Python, I recommend consulting the official Python documentation on `asyncio`.  A thorough understanding of concurrency and parallelism concepts is essential.  Furthermore, studying design patterns for asynchronous systems, particularly those related to task management and coordination, will prove invaluable.  Finally, dedicated books and courses on advanced Python programming and concurrent programming will offer valuable insights.  The careful study of these materials helped me significantly improve my understanding and approach to the challenges described above.
