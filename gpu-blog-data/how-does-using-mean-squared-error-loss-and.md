The interaction between mean squared error (MSE) loss and the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function in the context of MNIST digit classification is often suboptimal, leading to slower convergence and potentially lower accuracy compared to more conventional pairings like cross-entropy loss and sigmoid or ReLU activations.  This stems from the inherent characteristics of MSE and tanh, which are better suited to regression problems than classification tasks.  My experience working on various image recognition projects, including several involving variations on MNIST, has consistently highlighted this discrepancy.

**1. A Clear Explanation:**

MSE loss measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.  It's designed for regression problems where the output is a continuous variable. In classification, however, the output represents a probability distribution over discrete classes (0-9 for MNIST). While one could conceptually use MSE with a classification problem, treating class labels as continuous variables misrepresents the nature of the problem. The output of a neural network with a tanh activation in the output layer will produce values between -1 and 1, not probabilities between 0 and 1.  These outputs must then be mapped to class probabilities, often requiring a further transformation like a sigmoid or softmax function.

The tanh activation function, while having a similar S-shaped curve to sigmoid, maps inputs to the range [-1, 1].  This range is not directly interpretable as a probability. Unlike the sigmoid activation, which outputs values between 0 and 1, inherently representing probabilities, tanh's output requires additional post-processing for probabilistic interpretation.   This added complexity introduces computational overhead and may hamper the network's ability to learn effectively.  Furthermore, the saturation at both ends of the tanh function (-1 and 1) can hinder gradient flow during backpropagation, especially in deep networks, leading to the vanishing gradient problem and slow learning.

Combining MSE and tanh exacerbates these issues.  The MSE loss function, expecting continuous values, is applied to outputs that are not directly probabilistic interpretations of class membership.  The backpropagation process then calculates gradients based on these inappropriately scaled values, resulting in inefficient updates of the network weights. Cross-entropy loss, on the other hand, is specifically designed for classification problems and directly penalizes the model for incorrect probability assignments.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Below are three code examples illustrating the use of MSE and tanh in MNIST classification using Keras/TensorFlow. These examples highlight the pitfalls and potential for improvement.  Note that these examples are simplified for clarity.  Real-world applications would require more sophisticated architectures and hyperparameter tuning.

**Example 1: Basic Model with MSE and tanh**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='tanh'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='tanh') # Output layer with tanh
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mse',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255.0
x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255.0
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy:', accuracy)
```

This example uses a simple fully connected network.  Notice the `tanh` activation in the output layer. The MSE loss function will be inefficient because the output isn't directly representing probabilities.  The accuracy will likely be significantly lower than using a more suitable loss function and activation.


**Example 2:  Post-Processing with Sigmoid**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# ... (same model as Example 1) ...

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mse',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... (data loading as in Example 1) ...

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

predictions = model.predict(x_test)
#Post-processing to map to probability range [0,1]
predictions = (predictions + 1) / 2  #Shift and scale to [0,1]
predicted_labels = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
y_test_labels = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)
accuracy = np.mean(predicted_labels == y_test_labels)
print('Test accuracy:', accuracy)
```

Here, a post-processing step is added to map the tanh outputs to the range [0,1]. This improves interpretability but doesn't address the fundamental incompatibility between MSE and the tanh activation in a classification context. The accuracy might be slightly improved but would still likely be inferior to a more appropriate approach.

**Example 3:  Improved Model with Cross-Entropy and Sigmoid**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Softmax for probability distribution
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... (data loading as in Example 1) ...

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy:', accuracy)
```

This example demonstrates a more suitable architecture.  The ReLU activation addresses the vanishing gradient problem, and the softmax activation in the output layer produces a probability distribution over the 10 classes. The cross-entropy loss function is specifically designed for multi-class classification, leading to more efficient learning and improved accuracy.  This approach is far more effective than the previous two.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of neural network architectures, loss functions, and activation functions, I recommend consulting standard machine learning textbooks focusing on deep learning.   Look for chapters on backpropagation, optimization algorithms, and the theory behind different activation functions.  Exploring research papers on image classification and MNIST datasets will provide valuable insights into best practices. Studying the documentation of popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch is also beneficial.  Pay particular attention to tutorials and examples related to image classification.  Finally, focusing on mathematical background material in linear algebra and calculus will solidify your understanding of the underlying principles.
