The crux of performing tensor transformations while preserving gradients lies in the automatic differentiation capabilities of modern deep learning frameworks.  My experience building and optimizing large-scale neural networks has consistently shown that naive tensor manipulations can disrupt the gradient flow, leading to training instability or outright failure.  The key is to leverage framework-specific operations that track gradients implicitly.  Failing to do so necessitates manual gradient computation, a complex and error-prone task.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Tensor transformations, such as reshaping, transposing, and element-wise operations, are fundamental in deep learning.  However, simply using standard NumPy-like array manipulations within a computational graph built by frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch will often result in gradient loss. This is because the framework's automatic differentiation system needs to understand the relationship between the input and output tensors to correctly compute gradients during backpropagation.  Standard array operations typically break this relationship.

The solution is to use the framework's built-in functions designed for tensor manipulation. These functions are integrated with the automatic differentiation system, ensuring that gradients are correctly propagated through the transformation.  These functions are usually optimized for performance and ensure computational efficiency within the framework's graph execution.

For example, simply reshaping a tensor using NumPy's `reshape` function within a TensorFlow computation graph will not allow for proper gradient propagation.  However, TensorFlow's `tf.reshape` function will handle this seamlessly. This is because `tf.reshape`  creates a node in the computational graph that explicitly defines the relationship between the input and output tensors.  This allows the framework to compute the gradients during the backward pass.  The same principle applies to other transformations, such as transposition and matrix multiplications.  Using the framework’s specialized functions is paramount.

In essence, it’s not about *how* the transformation is implemented mathematically, but rather about *how* the framework's automatic differentiation system perceives and tracks the transformation within its computational graph.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate gradient preservation using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX.  I've deliberately chosen diverse examples reflecting my experience debugging various models.

**Example 1: TensorFlow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor
x = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([2, 3]))

# Perform a reshape operation using tf.reshape
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = tf.reshape(x, [3, 2])
  loss = tf.reduce_sum(y)

# Compute gradients
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, x)

# Print the gradients and original tensor
print("Original Tensor:\n", x.numpy())
print("Gradients:\n", gradients.numpy())
```

This TensorFlow example clearly demonstrates the usage of `tf.reshape`. The `tf.GradientTape` context manager automatically tracks the operations, enabling the calculation of gradients with respect to the input tensor `x` even after reshaping.


**Example 2: PyTorch**

```python
import torch

# Define a tensor
x = torch.randn(2, 3, requires_grad=True)

# Perform a transpose operation
y = x.transpose(0, 1)
loss = y.sum()

# Compute gradients
loss.backward()

# Print the gradients and original tensor
print("Original Tensor:\n", x)
print("Gradients:\n", x.grad)
```

Here, PyTorch's automatic differentiation is utilized.  The `requires_grad=True` argument is crucial; it signals PyTorch to track gradients for this tensor. The `transpose` function, being a native PyTorch operation, ensures gradient flow.  The `backward()` function computes gradients.


**Example 3: JAX**

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import grad

# Define a function performing a matrix multiplication and reshaping
def my_function(x):
  y = jnp.dot(x, x.T)
  z = jnp.reshape(y, (4,3))
  return jnp.sum(z)

# Define the input tensor
x = jnp.array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])

# Compute gradients using JAX's grad function
gradient_fn = grad(my_function)
gradients = gradient_fn(x)

#Print the gradients and original tensor
print("Original Tensor:\n", x)
print("Gradients:\n", gradients)

```

This JAX example showcases the usage of `jax.grad`.  JAX uses a functional approach, making it important to define the entire transformation as a function.  `jax.grad` automatically computes the gradient of the function with respect to its input.  Note the use of `jax.numpy` instead of NumPy to ensure compatibility with JAX's autodiff system.  The explicit use of `jnp.dot` and `jnp.reshape` is essential for gradient tracking.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation, I would suggest consulting relevant chapters in advanced calculus textbooks focusing on vector calculus and optimization theory.  Furthermore, the official documentation for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX, along with their respective tutorials on automatic differentiation, are invaluable resources.  Finally, exploration of research papers on automatic differentiation techniques within the context of deep learning would provide a more comprehensive understanding.  These resources will equip you with the theoretical grounding and practical skills necessary to confidently perform and understand tensor transformations while preserving gradients.  Remember to focus on understanding the underlying principles of computational graphs and automatic differentiation for maximal understanding and application.
