The behavior of TensorFlow's `timeseries_dataset_from_array` in adding a dimension to the input data but not the target variable stems directly from its design to prepare data for sequential machine learning models, specifically those expecting input tensors with a time-series component. This function automatically shapes the input array into a 3D tensor of the form `[batch_size, sequence_length, features]`, whereas the target variable, if explicitly provided, is assumed to already be structured to match the model’s required output format. This distinction is fundamental to the function’s purpose and reflects the common needs of time series analysis and forecasting.

My experience with time series modeling, particularly in projects involving sensor data and financial market analysis, has demonstrated the critical importance of correctly formatting input data for recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and similar architectures. These models are designed to process sequences of data points, understanding dependencies across time. The `timeseries_dataset_from_array` function essentially automates the process of creating these sequences, a process that often involves windowing and lagging operations when done manually.

Let's clarify the dimensionality transformation. When you input a 2D NumPy array into `timeseries_dataset_from_array`, such as shape `[n_samples, n_features]`, the function will internally create sliding windows of a specified length (`sequence_length`). Each window is essentially a slice along the time axis. Therefore, if you provide 1000 data points and specify a `sequence_length` of 10, you will get many sequences (depending on `sequence_stride`), each of 10 consecutive data points. This transforms a collection of individual samples into a collection of sequences. The output will be a 3D tensor with shape `[number_of_sequences, sequence_length, n_features]`. The target variable, on the other hand, is treated as labels or values associated with the *entire* sequence. Thus, no new time-series dimension is added to it. It's usually a 1D or 2D tensor, matching the expected output of a forecasting model.

To illustrate, consider an input array of sensor readings `sensor_data` and associated temperature values as `temperatures`. In this simplified example, I'll use synthetic data.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Generate synthetic sensor data (n_samples, n_features)
n_samples = 100
n_features = 2
sensor_data = np.random.rand(n_samples, n_features)

# Generate synthetic temperature data (n_samples)
temperatures = np.random.rand(n_samples)

# Parameters for timeseries_dataset_from_array
sequence_length = 10
sequence_stride = 1 # Example setting a stride

# Create the dataset
dataset = tf.keras.utils.timeseries_dataset_from_array(
    data=sensor_data,
    targets=temperatures,
    sequence_length=sequence_length,
    sequence_stride=sequence_stride,
    batch_size=32
)

# Iterate through a single batch to observe the shapes
for inputs, targets in dataset.take(1):
    print("Input Shape:", inputs.shape)
    print("Target Shape:", targets.shape)
```
In this first example, you can observe that the `inputs` have a shape of `(32, 10, 2)`, meaning 32 batches of sequences, each sequence of length 10, and 2 features from the input.  However, the `targets` have a shape of `(32,)`, corresponding to the target values for each of the 32 sequence batches, not a sequence. The targets remain as single values, associated with each sequence.  This is an important distinction as it explains the dimensional difference.

Now, consider a case where targets are lagged (representing a lagged temperature as a target). In this case the target data will be 2D:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Generate synthetic sensor data (n_samples, n_features)
n_samples = 100
n_features = 2
sensor_data = np.random.rand(n_samples, n_features)

# Generate synthetic temperature data (n_samples)
temperatures = np.random.rand(n_samples)

# Create lagged temperatures as target
target_offset = 5
target_temperatures = temperatures[target_offset:] #Lag the target
sensor_data = sensor_data[:-target_offset] # Crop to match length
temperatures = temperatures[:-target_offset]


# Parameters for timeseries_dataset_from_array
sequence_length = 10
sequence_stride = 1

# Create the dataset
dataset = tf.keras.utils.timeseries_dataset_from_array(
    data=sensor_data,
    targets=target_temperatures,
    sequence_length=sequence_length,
    sequence_stride=sequence_stride,
    batch_size=32
)


# Iterate through a single batch to observe the shapes
for inputs, targets in dataset.take(1):
    print("Input Shape:", inputs.shape)
    print("Target Shape:", targets.shape)


```
Here, the input shape remains consistent with the previous example `(32, 10, 2)`, representing the input sequence. The target now has the shape `(32,)`, indicating that each target value corresponds to an entire sequence. If the target variable represented a multi-dimensional target (e.g., multiple temperature sensors), then the target shape will change accordingly. It will not however, have the sequence dimension like the inputs.

Finally, let's examine a case with a multi-dimensional target, still with an offset, so we create a target dimension matching the number of features in the original `sensor_data`.  This illustrates how the target shape changes with the kind of prediction:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Generate synthetic sensor data (n_samples, n_features)
n_samples = 100
n_features = 2
sensor_data = np.random.rand(n_samples, n_features)

# Generate synthetic temperature data (n_samples, n_features)
temperatures = np.random.rand(n_samples, n_features)

# Create lagged temperatures as target
target_offset = 5
target_temperatures = temperatures[target_offset:]
sensor_data = sensor_data[:-target_offset]
temperatures = temperatures[:-target_offset]

# Parameters for timeseries_dataset_from_array
sequence_length = 10
sequence_stride = 1

# Create the dataset
dataset = tf.keras.utils.timeseries_dataset_from_array(
    data=sensor_data,
    targets=target_temperatures,
    sequence_length=sequence_length,
    sequence_stride=sequence_stride,
    batch_size=32
)

# Iterate through a single batch to observe the shapes
for inputs, targets in dataset.take(1):
    print("Input Shape:", inputs.shape)
    print("Target Shape:", targets.shape)

```
In this last example, the target shape now changes to `(32, 2)`, representing that each target has now become a 2D array for the prediction rather than a 1D value, but the input shape remains consistent at `(32,10,2)`. This demonstrates that target shapes are determined by the data passed in and their dimensionality is not controlled or modified by `timeseries_dataset_from_array`. The function simply assumes the target is correctly shaped for the task and output of the model.

The core insight is that `timeseries_dataset_from_array` is concerned with generating time series *inputs*, which necessitate the addition of a time dimension, but does not perform any such transformations on the output which it is assumed is correct.

When working with TensorFlow, understanding the dimensionality of your tensors is paramount. Failure to grasp this distinction can lead to subtle bugs in your data pipeline, causing misaligned inputs and targets during model training.  Debugging such problems can be time-consuming, hence the importance of explicit awareness of these function's mechanics.

For further exploration, consider the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the guides on data preparation and time series modeling. Look for material discussing data pipelines, `tf.data.Dataset` API, and the specific needs of recurrent neural networks. Additionally, books and tutorials on practical machine learning offer excellent context for such function's application and best practices when preparing time-series data. Examining example notebooks where they generate and train time-series models also clarifies this distinction.
