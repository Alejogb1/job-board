The inefficiency inherent in executing multiple SQL statements to retrieve data from a single table stems from redundant network round trips and the inherent overhead associated with each individual query execution.  In my experience optimizing database interactions for high-throughput systems, consolidating these operations into a single, well-structured query significantly improves performance, especially under heavy load. This optimization is fundamental for maintaining application responsiveness and minimizing database server strain.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue with employing multiple SELECT statements against the same table revolves around the database management system's (DBMS) need to process each query individually.  This involves parsing the query, creating an execution plan, accessing the necessary data pages from disk or memory, performing any required filtering or sorting, and then returning the result set to the application.  Repeating this cycle for multiple, related queries incurs significant overhead.  This overhead is exacerbated by factors such as network latency (especially in distributed systems) and the potential for locking conflicts if the queries modify data concurrently.

Consolidation involves structuring a single query using appropriate SQL clauses—specifically `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and potentially `UNION ALL` or `JOIN` (though self-joins are generally avoided for performance reasons if simpler methods exist)—to retrieve all necessary data in one operation.  This reduces the number of round trips, minimizes parsing and planning overhead, and potentially allows the DBMS to optimize data access more effectively.  Furthermore, careful indexing can dramatically enhance the performance of the consolidated query, negating potential performance downsides often associated with large `WHERE` clauses or complex joins.

The optimal approach depends heavily on the specific nature of the individual queries and the table's schema.  Simple scenarios might only require restructuring the `WHERE` clause to encompass multiple conditions.  More complex situations may necessitate the use of subqueries or more advanced SQL techniques.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's assume we have a table named `Customers` with columns `CustomerID`, `Name`, `City`, `Country`, and `OrderTotal`.

**Example 1: Inefficient Multiple Queries**

```sql
-- Query 1: Customers from the USA with OrderTotal > 1000
SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'USA' AND OrderTotal > 1000;

-- Query 2: Customers from Canada with OrderTotal > 500
SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Canada' AND OrderTotal > 500;

-- Query 3: Total number of customers
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers;
```

This approach involves three separate queries.  The database needs to process each one independently, leading to unnecessary overhead.

**Example 2: Consolidated Query using `WHERE` and `UNION ALL`**

```sql
-- Consolidated Query: Combines the first two queries using UNION ALL
SELECT CustomerID, Name, 'USA' as Country FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'USA' AND OrderTotal > 1000
UNION ALL
SELECT CustomerID, Name, 'Canada' as Country FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Canada' AND OrderTotal > 500;

-- Query to get total count, separate from the previous query as it's fundamentally different.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers;
```

This example combines the first two queries from the previous example using `UNION ALL`.  Note that `UNION ALL` preserves duplicate rows, while `UNION` removes them.  The count query remains separate, demonstrating that not all queries can always be combined efficiently.  Adding a country column ensures a distinction between results from both countries.


**Example 3:  Consolidated Query with Subquery for Count**

```sql
-- Consolidated Query: Combines all queries into one statement with a subquery for the count
SELECT CustomerID, Name, 'USA' as Country
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'USA' AND OrderTotal > 1000
UNION ALL
SELECT CustomerID, Name, 'Canada' as Country
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Canada' AND OrderTotal > 500
UNION ALL
(SELECT  CustomerID, Name, 'Total' as Country FROM Customers LIMIT 0); -- this row will be removed during the final `UNION ALL` operation.


SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers) AS TotalCustomerCount; -- Count query can be separated; if speed is critical, this may need refactoring.

```
This example demonstrates a more advanced approach of embedding the count query as a subquery.  While potentially slightly more complex, this method illustrates the flexibility of SQL in merging related queries. A separate `SELECT` statement for `TotalCustomerCount` is preserved due to it fundamentally being a different query than the other two.




**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest consulting the official documentation for your specific DBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle). These resources provide in-depth information on query optimization techniques, including indexing strategies, query planning, and performance tuning tools.  Furthermore, books on SQL optimization and database design principles provide valuable theoretical knowledge and practical guidance.  Finally, exploring advanced SQL features such as common table expressions (CTEs) can further improve query efficiency for complex scenarios.  Consider studying the query execution plans generated by your DBMS to identify potential bottlenecks.  This insight can inform effective optimization strategies.  Thorough understanding of your data and how the application interacts with it is equally crucial for efficient query design. Remember that premature optimization is the root of all evil, so only optimize when needed.
