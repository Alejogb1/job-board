The core challenge when merging fields in older Microsoft Office documents using C# lies in the disparate object models and limitations of COM interop. Specifically, manipulating Word and Excel documents from 2003 and 2007 requires navigating the complexities of older API versions, often lacking the streamlined features present in later Office iterations. Direct programmatic manipulation of document content, therefore, requires careful handling of COM objects and their associated properties.

The primary approach for merging fields involves utilizing the Microsoft Office Primary Interop Assemblies (PIAs). These assemblies allow .NET applications to interact with COM components exposed by Office applications. However, older versions present unique hurdles. Object models are less consistent across different versions, and error handling requires meticulous attention to potential exceptions resulting from attempting operations not supported by the given Office version.

To merge fields, I would typically perform a process that includes opening the document, identifying the target fields, and writing the desired data. This involves accessing specific elements of the document’s object model, often navigating through nested collections. With Word, this means interacting with the `Document` object, accessing `Fields` collection within the document's story ranges, then manipulating field results or their code. In Excel, this process involves working with the `Workbook` object, `Sheets` collections, and ultimately, individual `Range` objects containing the desired field data. The methods employed for extracting data and populating the relevant locations are dependent on the specific structure and requirements of the source data and destination documents.

The initial stage involves adding the proper PIA references to your C# project. Specifically, this would require references to the `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word` and `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel` libraries for the respective applications. It is paramount to select the correct version of these libraries matching the deployed Office version the user intends to work with. Incorrect versioning may lead to type conflicts and runtime errors, even when seemingly similar versions are employed.

Let’s examine a scenario focused on Word document merging. Suppose I have a Word document template (.doc file) containing fields named “FirstName,” “LastName,” and “Email”. The code below will demonstrate how to open this document, iterate through the fields, and replace their content:

```csharp
using System;
using Word = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word;

public class WordFieldMerger
{
    public static void MergeWordFields(string templatePath, string firstName, string lastName, string email)
    {
        Word.Application wordApp = null;
        Word.Document wordDoc = null;

        try
        {
           wordApp = new Word.Application();
           wordDoc = wordApp.Documents.Open(templatePath);

           foreach (Word.Field field in wordDoc.Fields)
           {
              if (field.Code.Text.Contains("MERGEFIELD FirstName"))
              {
                 field.Result.Text = firstName;
              }
              else if(field.Code.Text.Contains("MERGEFIELD LastName"))
              {
                 field.Result.Text = lastName;
              }
              else if(field.Code.Text.Contains("MERGEFIELD Email"))
              {
                  field.Result.Text = email;
              }
           }

           string outputPath = System.IO.Path.ChangeExtension(templatePath, "output.doc");
           wordDoc.SaveAs(outputPath);
           wordDoc.Close();
       }
       catch(Exception ex)
       {
           Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
       }
       finally
       {
           if (wordDoc != null) System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject(wordDoc);
           if (wordApp != null)
           {
              wordApp.Quit();
              System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject(wordApp);
           }
       }
    }
}
```

In this snippet, I’m first initiating the Word application. Then I open the specified Word document. The key action takes place within the `foreach` loop. The program inspects the field code, specifically looking for the keywords `MERGEFIELD FirstName`, `MERGEFIELD LastName` and `MERGEFIELD Email`. When found, the value set against that field is updated with passed-in variables, using the Result.Text property. It is crucial to ensure the field names exactly match within the document to enable correct targeting. Finally, it saves a modified copy of the document. The proper disposal of COM objects within a `finally` block prevents memory leaks and ensures that the Word application releases resources properly. Always use `Marshal.ReleaseComObject` to release COM objects after use. This method directly targets the field's content.

Consider a different scenario involving an Excel workbook where the program needs to update cells. Suppose there is an Excel sheet (.xls file) containing placeholders with the names “CompanyName,” “ContactName,” and “Phone” in cells A1, A2, and A3, respectively. The following code demonstrates the process of populating those cells:

```csharp
using System;
using Excel = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel;

public class ExcelFieldMerger
{
    public static void MergeExcelFields(string templatePath, string companyName, string contactName, string phone)
    {
        Excel.Application excelApp = null;
        Excel.Workbook workbook = null;

        try
        {
           excelApp = new Excel.Application();
           workbook = excelApp.Workbooks.Open(templatePath);

           Excel.Worksheet worksheet = (Excel.Worksheet)workbook.Sheets[1];

           worksheet.Cells[1, 1].Value2 = companyName;
           worksheet.Cells[2, 1].Value2 = contactName;
           worksheet.Cells[3, 1].Value2 = phone;

           string outputPath = System.IO.Path.ChangeExtension(templatePath, "output.xls");
           workbook.SaveAs(outputPath);
           workbook.Close();
        }
        catch(Exception ex)
        {
           Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
        }
        finally
        {
           if(workbook != null) System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject(workbook);
           if(excelApp != null)
           {
               excelApp.Quit();
               System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject(excelApp);
           }
        }
     }
}
```

Here, we initialize the Excel application and load the desired workbook. We then target specific cells by index through the `worksheet.Cells` property, starting from 1. I assign `companyName`, `contactName`, and `phone` directly into their respective cells using the `Value2` property for improved data type handling. Following this, I save a copy and close the workbook. Again, I use `Marshal.ReleaseComObject` within the `finally` block to release the COM objects effectively. This method provides a direct means to update cell content using coordinates rather than relying on field names.

For more complex scenarios, consider a situation where multiple rows require merging in an Excel file. Instead of hardcoding cell references, the code can iterate over a data collection and write into corresponding rows. This is crucial for situations where one-to-many relationships need to be represented in tabular form within excel. Let us assume the `contactData` list contains objects that represent each individual’s data with `CompanyName`, `ContactName`, and `Phone` properties. The code would then modify the previous example to populate multiple rows:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Excel = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel;

public class ExcelComplexFieldMerger
{
   public class ContactData
   {
      public string CompanyName { get; set; }
      public string ContactName { get; set; }
      public string Phone { get; set; }
   }

    public static void MergeExcelMultipleRows(string templatePath, List<ContactData> contactData)
    {
       Excel.Application excelApp = null;
       Excel.Workbook workbook = null;

       try
       {
          excelApp = new Excel.Application();
          workbook = excelApp.Workbooks.Open(templatePath);
          Excel.Worksheet worksheet = (Excel.Worksheet)workbook.Sheets[1];

           int row = 1;
          foreach (ContactData data in contactData)
          {
             worksheet.Cells[row, 1].Value2 = data.CompanyName;
             worksheet.Cells[row, 2].Value2 = data.ContactName;
             worksheet.Cells[row, 3].Value2 = data.Phone;
             row++;
          }

          string outputPath = System.IO.Path.ChangeExtension(templatePath, "output.xls");
          workbook.SaveAs(outputPath);
          workbook.Close();
       }
       catch(Exception ex)
       {
           Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
       }
       finally
       {
           if(workbook != null) System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject(workbook);
           if(excelApp != null)
           {
              excelApp.Quit();
              System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject(excelApp);
           }
        }
     }
}
```

In this updated example, we iterate over `contactData`, incrementing the `row` variable to place each record on a subsequent row, within three columns. This demonstrates the dynamic nature of working with COM to achieve merging multiple data rows. This is critical when dealing with multiple records to be populated into a spreadsheet.

When working with the PIA objects, I highly recommend consulting Microsoft’s official documentation for the specific Office version in question. These documents detail the object model’s properties and methods, providing specific implementation details. Additionally, consider exploring resources such as the MSDN documentation archives for relevant articles and samples related to Office interop. While the code remains the same when targeting 2003 or 2007 document formats, using the correct version of the Primary Interop Assemblies is critical. Older versions of the object model can have significant differences which must be understood for effective use. Finally, the handling of COM objects requires careful attention to memory management. Always ensure that COM objects are released after being used to prevent potential memory leaks and resource issues. This is not just good practice, it is critical when working with COM Interop.
