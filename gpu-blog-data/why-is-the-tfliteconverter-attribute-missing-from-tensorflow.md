TensorFlow Lite, post version 1.x, fundamentally shifted its model conversion paradigm, deprecating the direct `TFLiteConverter` attribute.  My experience with TensorFlow spanning multiple projects, particularly in embedded systems, has demonstrated that the rationale behind this change isn't arbitrary; it stems from a move towards a more modular and flexible API structure, enabling better support for diverse conversion workflows and backend target devices.

In TensorFlow 1.x, the `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter` class provided a relatively monolithic interface for converting TensorFlow models into TensorFlow Lite flatbuffer formats.  This single class attempted to encapsulate all aspects of conversion, handling everything from frozen graph input, SavedModel loading, and quantization techniques to post-training optimizations.  This approach, while initially convenient, proved difficult to maintain and extend as the complexity of model conversion requirements grew rapidly. Adding new features or different conversion pipelines often meant modifying the core `TFLiteConverter` logic, introducing risks of instability.

The shift in TensorFlow 2.x towards a modular design addresses these shortcomings. The `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter` class was essentially deconstructed into a series of distinct conversion workflows, primarily driven by the input source format. Instead of a single class encompassing all scenarios, separate functions are now employed depending on the nature of the model being converted. Specifically, the core logic now resides in specific converter functions, and the user now explicitly chooses which conversion function is appropriate. The user will commonly use `tf.lite.convert`,  `tf.lite.convert_saved_model`, `tf.lite.convert_keras_model` or, for models using specific custom functions, the process becomes more involved. The benefit is that this new method separates concerns, makes the code base more modular, and it has become easier to add new conversion strategies, custom optimization and hardware targets in subsequent releases. The change encourages a more directed and explicit conversion pipeline, removing implicit assumptions and enabling more granular control.

Here’s a breakdown of these different conversion paths and code examples illustrating their use:

**Example 1: Converting a Keras Model**

The most common scenario involves a Keras model. In this case, we utilize the `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model` method (or the shortcut `tf.lite.convert_keras_model` function), which is the current approach to converting such models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple Keras model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Create a sample input (required for some methods)
input_data = tf.random.uniform((1, 10), 0, 1, dtype=tf.float32)

# Convert the Keras model to TFLite format
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()


# Save the TFLite model to disk
with open("keras_model.tflite", 'wb') as f:
  f.write(tflite_model)

# Alternatively using the convience function:
# tflite_model = tf.lite.convert_keras_model(model)

```

In this example, we instantiate a simple Keras sequential model. The core conversion step now happens via `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)` which returns an instance of the converter class specific to keras models. This is followed by the `convert()` method, which executes the conversion logic based on our converter instance. Note the optional convenience method `tf.lite.convert_keras_model`, used to invoke the whole conversion with a single function call, which internally performs the steps outlined above. This change isolates the keras-specific aspects of the model conversion process.

**Example 2: Converting a SavedModel**

For scenarios where you have a pre-trained model saved in the TensorFlow SavedModel format, you use the `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model` method (or `tf.lite.convert_saved_model`.)

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a SavedModel is stored at ./my_saved_model
# In reality, you would load it using
# tf.saved_model.load("./my_saved_model")
# This is skipped here for example purposes.
# Instead we are creating a dummy model as if we did the above step


@tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(shape=(1, 2), dtype=tf.float32)])
def add_one(x):
    return x + 1.0

tf.saved_model.save(add_one, "./my_saved_model")
imported = tf.saved_model.load("./my_saved_model")

# Use the from_saved_model approach, supplying the filepath, not the loaded object
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model("./my_saved_model")
tflite_model = converter.convert()


with open("saved_model.tflite", 'wb') as f:
  f.write(tflite_model)

# Alternatively using the convience function:
# tflite_model = tf.lite.convert_saved_model("./my_saved_model")

```

This snippet shows how to convert a SavedModel to TFLite.  Instead of passing a model object, we pass a string representing the SavedModel’s directory path to the converter constructor, and the conversion is executed as before. Again, a `tf.lite.convert_saved_model` shortcut exists to accomplish the task with a single function call. Again, the approach is very similar to the Keras model example and ensures that all conversion logic pertaining to `SavedModel` loading is contained inside the `from_saved_model` function. The underlying logic will load the `SavedModel` object internally and perform its specific steps.

**Example 3: Converting a Concrete Function**

For custom models, especially those utilizing `tf.function` or other TensorFlow graph constructs, you might need to use `TFLiteConverter.from_concrete_functions`

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple tf.function
@tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(shape=(1, 3), dtype=tf.float32)])
def custom_func(x):
    return x * 2.0

# Convert function into a ConcreteFunction
concrete_func = custom_func.get_concrete_function()

# Provide a list of concrete functions for conversion.
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_concrete_functions([concrete_func])
tflite_model = converter.convert()

with open("concrete_function.tflite", 'wb') as f:
  f.write(tflite_model)

```

In this example, we first create a `tf.function` and then create a concrete function. We then provide a list of concrete functions to the converter for conversion. This approach becomes necessary for models using custom ops, or graphs that the automatic conversion methods cannot process. This demonstrates the flexibility of the new paradigm; providing options for even very complicated conversion workflows.

These changes, while requiring a shift in how users approach model conversion, provide substantial benefits. The move to more modular functions means better support, extensibility, and fewer maintenance issues overall. In essence, the `TFLiteConverter` attribute is "missing" because it is not the single entry-point anymore.  Instead, it's a family of related, yet specialized converters accessed via these from_* methods or the convenience functions.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For continued development and further learning, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation. The TensorFlow Lite guides section provides detailed explanations about model conversion, including more details on using various optimization and quantization strategies, and platform specific considerations. Also, review the TensorFlow API documentation, specifically for the `tf.lite` module, which outlines the usage of various methods and classes involved in the conversion process.  Studying code examples in the TensorFlow GitHub repository can also shed more light into the internal working of each conversion path, and demonstrate how to use the converter API for very custom and specific conversion flows.
