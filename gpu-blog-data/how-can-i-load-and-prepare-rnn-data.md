Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) necessitate data structured as sequential inputs.  Directly loading data from multiple CSV files into a format suitable for PyTorch RNN training requires careful consideration of data organization and preprocessing. My experience working on financial time-series forecasting projects heavily involved this process, often encountering challenges related to inconsistent data lengths and feature alignment across multiple files.  Therefore, a robust solution needs to address data loading, sequence generation, and tensorization for optimal PyTorch compatibility.

**1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:**

The first critical step is consolidating data from the three CSV files.  Assuming each file represents a different feature set associated with the same time series (e.g., opening price, volume, and moving average), a Python script needs to read each CSV, ensuring consistent indexing across all datasets. This indexing, typically a timestamp or sequence index, is crucial for maintaining the temporal relationships between features.  Missing data needs careful handling.  Simple imputation strategies, such as forward fill or backward fill, might suffice for relatively complete datasets. However, more sophisticated methods such as spline interpolation or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation may be required for scenarios with significant missing values.  Furthermore, data normalization or standardization is frequently crucial for RNN training, ensuring features are on a comparable scale and preventing numerical instability.


**2. Sequence Generation:**

Once the data is consolidated and preprocessed, it needs to be transformed into sequences suitable for RNN input. This usually involves creating fixed-length sequences or variable-length sequences with padding.  Fixed-length sequences offer simplicity but may discard useful information at the beginning or end of the longer sequences. Variable-length sequences, often padded with zeros or a special padding token, provide more flexibility but introduce complexities in the RNN model architecture and may increase computational cost.  The sequence length is a hyperparameter to be tuned and depends on the nature of the time-series data.  Longer sequences capture more context but increase computational demand, while shorter sequences are computationally cheaper but might lose vital long-term dependencies.

**3. PyTorch Tensor Creation:**

Finally, the generated sequences need to be converted into PyTorch tensors.  PyTorch's tensor structure is optimized for GPU acceleration and efficient processing within the RNN model.  This involves organizing the sequences into a tensor with dimensions [sequence_length, batch_size, num_features]. The `batch_size` determines how many sequences are processed simultaneously, affecting memory usage and training speed.  The `num_features` is determined by the number of feature sets loaded from the CSV files.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing with Pandas:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def load_and_preprocess(file1, file2, file3):
    df1 = pd.read_csv(file1, index_col='timestamp')
    df2 = pd.read_csv(file2, index_col='timestamp')
    df3 = pd.read_csv(file3, index_col='timestamp')

    # Align dataframes based on timestamp index
    merged_df = pd.concat([df1, df2, df3], axis=1)
    merged_df = merged_df.fillna(method='ffill') # Forward fill missing values

    # Standardize features
    for column in merged_df.columns:
        merged_df[column] = (merged_df[column] - merged_df[column].mean()) / merged_df[column].std()

    return merged_df

# Example usage
data = load_and_preprocess('file1.csv', 'file2.csv', 'file3.csv')
print(data.head())
```

This example demonstrates the use of Pandas to load, align, and preprocess the data from three CSV files.  The `fillna` function performs forward fill imputation.  Feature standardization is achieved by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each column.


**Example 2: Sequence Generation:**

```python
def generate_sequences(data, seq_length):
    sequences = []
    for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
        sequence = data[i:i + seq_length].values
        sequences.append(sequence)
    return np.array(sequences)

# Example usage
seq_length = 20
sequences = generate_sequences(data, seq_length)
print(sequences.shape)
```

This function takes the preprocessed Pandas DataFrame and the desired sequence length as input.  It iterates through the data, creating fixed-length sequences.  The resulting sequences are converted into a NumPy array for easier conversion to PyTorch tensors.


**Example 3: PyTorch Tensor Creation:**

```python
import torch

def create_pytorch_tensor(sequences):
    x = torch.tensor(sequences[:, :-1, :], dtype=torch.float32) # Input sequences
    y = torch.tensor(sequences[:, -1, :], dtype=torch.float32)  # Target values
    return x, y

# Example usage
x, y = create_pytorch_tensor(sequences)
print(x.shape, y.shape)
```

This function converts the NumPy array of sequences into PyTorch tensors.  The input `x` consists of sequences of length `seq_length - 1`, while the target output `y` consists of the next time step in the sequence.  This setup is common for many sequence prediction tasks.  The `dtype=torch.float32` specifies the data type for optimal performance.

*  PyTorch documentation:  Provides comprehensive information on tensors, datasets, and RNN models.
*  "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet:  Offers an accessible introduction to deep learning with PyTorch examples.
*  "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron:  Includes relevant sections on time series analysis and RNNs.


These examples and recommendations should provide a solid foundation for loading, preparing, and using your RNN data in PyTorch.  Remember that the specifics of data preprocessing and sequence generation will depend significantly on the nature and characteristics of your particular dataset.  Experimentation and iterative refinement are key to optimizing the performance of your RNN model.
