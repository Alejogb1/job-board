The issue of a custom painting animation halting at half the frame width frequently stems from a misunderstanding of coordinate systems and how they interact with canvas dimensions within the rendering context.  Specifically, I've encountered this problem numerous times while developing custom OpenGL and Canvas-based animation systems, and it almost always boils down to an incorrect calculation of the drawing area or a failure to account for the origin point of the rendering context.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Custom painting animations, irrespective of the underlying framework (whether it's using OpenGL, Canvas, or a higher-level library like SFML), rely on precise coordinate specification to position and render elements. The most common culprit when an animation prematurely terminates at half the frame width is an improper transformation matrix or a flawed calculation of the animation's bounds. The rendering context, in most systems, has a default origin at the top-left corner (0, 0).  Animations often progress by incrementing an x-coordinate, but if the width calculation is halved implicitly or explicitly (for instance, through a faulty scaling operation or a division by two in the position calculation), the animation will reach only half the intended width before ceasing its progression.  Another contributing factor is the failure to account for the dimensions of the elements being drawn. If an element larger than half the screen width is rendered, it may visually appear to stop at the half-width mark, even though the calculation may be correct.

Further complicating matters is the potential involvement of viewports and projection matrices.  In OpenGL, for instance, specifying a viewport that's only half the screen's width effectively limits the rendering area, causing the animation to terminate prematurely. Similarly, a flawed projection matrix can scale the animation, making it appear truncated.  The underlying problem, however, remains rooted in an inaccurate calculation of either the drawing area or the animation's position within that area.  Incorrectly using screen coordinates instead of normalized device coordinates (NDC) in OpenGL is another source of such issues.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential scenarios and their solutions, focusing on JavaScript's Canvas API due to its broad accessibility.  These illustrate principles that readily translate to other graphics programming contexts.

**Example 1: Incorrect Width Calculation**

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
const width = canvas.width;
const height = canvas.height;

function animate() {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, width, height); // Clear the canvas

  let x = 0; // Animation position
  x += 1; // Increment

  // INCORRECT: Using width / 2 instead of width
  if (x > width / 2) {
      return; //Animation stops at half width
  }

  ctx.fillRect(x, 50, 10, 10); //Draw a rectangle

  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}

animate();
```

**Commentary:** This example shows a blatant error. The `if` condition terminates the animation when `x` surpasses half the canvas width.  The solution is straightforward: replace `width / 2` with `width` to allow the animation to traverse the entire width.


**Example 2:  Hidden Off-Screen Rendering**

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
const width = canvas.width;
const height = canvas.height;

function animate() {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);

    let x = 0;
    x += 5; //Larger increment

    //Animation stops due to large rectangle dimensions
    if (x > width /2){
        return;
    }

    ctx.fillRect(x, 50, 100, 100);  // Large rectangle
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}

animate();
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a scenario where the animation seems to stop at half the width. However, the problem isn't the x-coordinate calculation. Instead, the large rectangle (100px wide) being drawn obscures the continuation of the animation.  A visual inspection might mistakenly lead one to conclude that the animation stops at half the width, even though the x-coordinate continues to increase beyond this point.  The solution involves carefully considering the dimensions of drawn elements and possibly adjusting the `x` coordinate to account for their size.



**Example 3:  Incorrect Transformation Matrix (Conceptual OpenGL)**

```c++
//Conceptual OpenGL example - simplified for illustration
void animate() {
    // ... OpenGL initialization ...

    glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION); //Setting Projection Matrix
    glLoadIdentity();
    // INCORRECT: Scaling by 0.5
    glScalef(0.5, 1.0, 1.0); // Scales the scene by 50% in x
    glOrtho(0, 100, 0, 100, -1, 1); // Setting orthographic projection

    glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
    glLoadIdentity();

    // Animation loop
    float x = 0;
    x += 0.1;

    if (x > 50) { // x will reach 50 because of the scaling
        return;
    }

    glBegin(GL_QUADS);
    glVertex2f(x, 50);
    glVertex2f(x + 10, 50);
    glVertex2f(x + 10, 60);
    glVertex2f(x, 60);
    glEnd();

    glutSwapBuffers();
    glutPostRedisplay();
}
```

**Commentary:**  This illustrative (and simplified) OpenGL example showcases how an incorrect scaling transformation (glScalef(0.5, 1.0, 1.0)) effectively halves the animation's visible range. Even though `x` might increment past 50 in world coordinates, the scaling transforms it to a value that still falls within the half-width range of the screen. Removing or correcting the scaling operation resolves this. Note that real-world OpenGL code would be far more complex, but this highlights the core issue.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of coordinate systems and transformation matrices, I recommend consulting relevant chapters in standard computer graphics textbooks.  Specific texts covering OpenGL programming, the Canvas API, and general game development principles will offer the required depth.  Furthermore, exploring online documentation for the specific graphics API you are using is crucial for resolving these types of issues.  Finally, referring to example code from reliable sources helps to visualize and understand the correct implementation of various drawing and animation techniques.  Careful debugging and stepping through the code with a debugger is also a powerful tool for identifying these sorts of problems.
