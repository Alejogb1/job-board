The core distinction between a 1x1 convolution and a 1x1 transposed convolution lies in their effect on the spatial dimensions of the input feature map.  While both operate with a kernel size of 1x1, they achieve fundamentally opposite transformations: a 1x1 convolution reduces dimensionality by performing channel-wise linear combinations, whereas a 1x1 transposed convolution increases dimensionality, effectively upsampling the feature map. This understanding is crucial when designing efficient architectures, particularly in network bottlenecks and upsampling layers.  My experience optimizing CNNs for real-time object detection solidified this understanding.

**1. 1x1 Convolution: Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Aggregation**

A 1x1 convolution, despite its seemingly trivial kernel size, plays a powerful role in feature aggregation and dimensionality reduction.  It operates independently on each spatial location of the input feature map. Imagine an input tensor of shape (N, C_in, H, W), where N is the batch size, C_in is the number of input channels, and H and W are the height and width respectively.  The 1x1 convolution with K filters (output channels C_out) performs a linear transformation on the C_in channels at each spatial location (H, W). This can be viewed as a weighted sum of the input channels, where the weights are learned during training.  The output tensor will then have a shape of (N, C_out, H, W). Crucially, the spatial dimensions (H, W) remain unchanged, but the number of channels is reduced or increased depending on the value of K (C_out).

When C_out < C_in, dimensionality reduction occurs.  This is especially beneficial in reducing computational complexity and mitigating overfitting.  In my work on resource-constrained embedded systems, 1x1 convolutions significantly reduced the model size and inference time without severely impacting accuracy.  They effectively learn a more compact representation of the features.  When C_out > C_in, the network learns to generate richer feature representations from the input channels, possibly increasing the network's capacity.

**Code Example 1: 1x1 Convolution in PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input tensor: (batch_size, input_channels, height, width)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 64, 28, 28)

# 1x1 Convolutional layer: reduces channels from 64 to 32
conv1x1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=64, out_channels=32, kernel_size=1)

# Perform convolution
output_tensor = conv1x1(input_tensor)

# Output tensor: (batch_size, output_channels, height, width)
print(output_tensor.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([32, 32, 28, 28])
```

This code demonstrates a simple 1x1 convolution that reduces the number of channels from 64 to 32. The spatial dimensions remain the same.  The `nn.Conv2d` function efficiently handles the computation, utilizing optimized CUDA kernels when available. This is a core operation in many modern CNN architectures, reflecting its utility.


**2. 1x1 Transposed Convolution: Dimensionality Increase and Upsampling**

A 1x1 transposed convolution (also known as a 1x1 deconvolution), unlike its non-transposed counterpart, increases the number of channels in the feature map.  While it's often mistakenly associated with upsampling the spatial dimensions (height and width), this is not its primary function in the 1x1 case.  The spatial dimensions remain unchanged.  The increase in channels occurs via a process that is mathematically the transpose of the 1x1 convolution operation.  Effectively, it learns to project the input channels onto a higher-dimensional space.  This is essential in tasks like semantic segmentation or generating higher resolution feature maps.  During my work on medical image analysis, I used 1x1 transposed convolutions to increase the channel depth prior to spatial upsampling operations.  The increase in channels allowed for richer representation and facilitated sharper segmentation boundaries.

**Code Example 2: 1x1 Transposed Convolution in PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input tensor: (batch_size, input_channels, height, width)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 32, 28, 28)

# 1x1 Transposed Convolutional layer: increases channels from 32 to 64
transposed_conv1x1 = nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels=32, out_channels=64, kernel_size=1)

# Perform transposed convolution
output_tensor = transposed_conv1x1(input_tensor)

# Output tensor: (batch_size, output_channels, height, width)
print(output_tensor.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([32, 64, 28, 28])
```

Here, the channel count doubles, going from 32 to 64.  The use of `nn.ConvTranspose2d` correctly implements the transposed convolution operation.  It's important to understand that this increases the channel dimensionality, not the spatial resolution.


**Code Example 3:  Combining 1x1 Convolution and Transposed Convolution**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input tensor: (batch_size, input_channels, height, width)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 64, 28, 28)

# 1x1 Convolution (dimensionality reduction)
conv1x1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=64, out_channels=32, kernel_size=1)
reduced_tensor = conv1x1(input_tensor)

# 1x1 Transposed Convolution (dimensionality increase)
transposed_conv1x1 = nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels=32, out_channels=64, kernel_size=1)
output_tensor = transposed_conv1x1(reduced_tensor)

# Output tensor: (batch_size, output_channels, height, width)
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: torch.Size([32, 64, 28, 28])
```

This example showcases a common pattern: using a 1x1 convolution for dimensionality reduction, followed by a 1x1 transposed convolution to restore the original channel count. While the number of channels is the same as the input, the learned feature representations differ due to the non-linear activations between the operations.


**3. Resources and Further Study**

To deepen your understanding, I recommend consulting established deep learning textbooks, focusing on the mathematical underpinnings of convolution and its transpose.  Pay close attention to the role of weight matrices in these operations and how they relate to dimensionality transformations.  Exploring academic papers on CNN architectures that extensively use 1x1 convolutions and transposed convolutions will also be invaluable.  Understanding the implications for computational efficiency and parameter counts is crucial for practical applications.  Finally, experimenting with code examples and visualizing the intermediate tensor outputs is highly beneficial in grasping the effect of these operations.
