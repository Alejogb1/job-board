The core of training any neural network, PyTorch models included, involves updating model parameters based on calculated gradients. These gradients are derivatives of a loss function with respect to those parameters, which necessitate the *output* of the model. Therefore, training a PyTorch model without a traditional forward pass in the context of standard supervised learning with backpropagation is not generally possible. The forward pass is foundational; it computes the prediction which is the anchor point for the loss and, in turn, the gradients. However, we *can* achieve an effective "forward-less" training scenario by re-framing the problem, specifically with techniques like meta-learning or surrogate gradient methods. Let's examine a few strategies.

The standard training loop in PyTorch is inextricably linked to the forward pass. We typically move data through the model (forward pass), calculate a loss, then propagate gradients backwards (backward pass) to update model weights. Eliminating the forward pass, in its direct sense, removes the primary means of obtaining a loss value for gradient computation. Consider the following standard training loop:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.utils.data as data

# Define a basic model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

# Generate sample data
X = torch.randn(100, 10)
y = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))
dataset = data.TensorDataset(X, y)
dataloader = data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10)

# Instantiate model, loss and optimizer
model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Standard training loop
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for xb, yb in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(xb)       # Standard forward pass
        loss = criterion(output, yb)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

This code demonstrates the dependency of backpropagation on the output of the forward pass. Removing `output = model(xb)` would break the process, because `loss` would not have a derivative relationship to the model's parameters. However, certain techniques bypass this direct relationship, essentially performing a forward-equivalent without explicitly using the model in the same way.

**Meta-Learning with Gradient Approximation**

One technique that partially sidesteps a direct forward pass is meta-learning. In this setting, we do not train the model on data directly but train it to learn *how* to learn. This is typically performed via episodic training, where each episode samples tasks and trains an *inner learner* for those tasks. Here, the main, or *meta*, model does not directly produce a loss via an immediate forward pass on a single datapoint, as with our example above. Instead, we evaluate the performance of the inner model (which *does* employ a forward pass on the sampled task) and the meta model learns to improve the performance of that inner learner. This can be thought of as learning parameter initialization, or parameter updates themselves, using a different loss calculation than standard single-pass backpropagation. Consider the following:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import copy

# Inner Learner Model
class InnerModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(InnerModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)


# Meta-Learner Model (approximating gradient updates)
class MetaModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_size=10, out_size=2):
        super(MetaModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc_theta = nn.Linear(in_size, out_size)
        self.fc_grad = nn.Linear(in_size, out_size)
    def forward(self, X): #Approximating the parameter updates based on input
        theta_update = self.fc_theta(X)
        grad_approx = self.fc_grad(X) #Approximating gradient updates
        return theta_update, grad_approx

# Parameters:
num_meta_iterations = 100
inner_lr = 0.01
meta_lr = 0.001
in_size = 10
out_size= 2

# Instantiate models and optimizer:
meta_model = MetaModel(in_size, out_size)
meta_optimizer = optim.Adam(meta_model.parameters(), lr=meta_lr)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Sample episodic data
def generate_episodic_data(num_tasks = 10, num_samples_per_task = 10):
    tasks = []
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        X = torch.randn(num_samples_per_task, in_size)
        y = torch.randint(0, out_size, (num_samples_per_task,))
        tasks.append((X, y))
    return tasks

# Training loop:
for meta_iter in range(num_meta_iterations):
    tasks = generate_episodic_data()
    meta_loss = 0
    for xb, yb in tasks:
        inner_model = InnerModel() #Reset inner model
        inner_optimizer = optim.SGD(inner_model.parameters(), lr = inner_lr)
        # Inner loop training - use the actual gradients:
        inner_output = inner_model(xb)
        inner_loss = criterion(inner_output, yb)
        inner_optimizer.zero_grad()
        inner_loss.backward()
        inner_optimizer.step()

        # Meta-level training - approximate gradient update with meta model
        meta_optimizer.zero_grad()
        parameter_updates, grad_approx = meta_model(xb)
        # Compute the 'pseudo-loss' based on the meta-model prediction
        # This example is highly simplified, typically more complex
        pseudo_loss = criterion(parameter_updates,yb) # Using the approximated parameter update
        pseudo_loss.backward()
        meta_optimizer.step()

        meta_loss += pseudo_loss.item()

    print(f"Meta Iteration: {meta_iter+1}, Loss: {meta_loss/len(tasks):.4f}")

```
Here, the `MetaModel` attempts to directly predict parameter updates, effectively performing an operation equivalent to a 'forward pass' *without* using the model in its conventional forward function. This is a vastly simplified example and actual implementations are much more involved, but demonstrate the concept.

**Surrogate Gradient Methods (Direct Feedback Alignment)**

Another method that avoids a direct forward pass is direct feedback alignment (DFA). DFA is part of a broader category of surrogate gradient algorithms. Unlike backpropagation, which computes gradients by propagating error information backward through the network layers, DFA uses a random fixed matrix to approximate the gradients at each layer. This eliminates the need for a backward pass through the model's functional computation itself. However, a small forward pass is used to calculate activity needed to generate the "surrogate" error signal used during the backward pass.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Define the model
class SimpleDFA(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleDFA, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Define the surrogate error signal
class DFAError(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_size, out_size):
         super(DFAError,self).__init__()
         self.B = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(in_size,out_size), requires_grad = False)
    def forward(self, x, error_signal):
         surrogate_error = x.T @ error_signal @ self.B.T # No backpropagation through x, only fixed B
         return surrogate_error # surrogate error used as the 'gradient'

# Parameters
in_size = 10
hid_size=20
out_size = 2
num_epochs = 100
learning_rate = 0.01

# Instantiate model, loss, and optimizer
model = SimpleDFA()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# DFA parameters
dfa_error1 = DFAError(in_size, hid_size)
dfa_error2 = DFAError(hid_size, out_size)

# Sample data
X = torch.randn(100, 10)
y = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))
dataset = torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(X, y)
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for xb, yb in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # Forward pass with DFA
        x1 = F.relu(model.fc1(xb))
        output = model.fc2(x1)
        loss = criterion(output, yb)
        grad = (output - yb)

        # Calculate surrogate error signals
        surrogate_error2 = dfa_error2(x1, grad)
        surrogate_error1 = dfa_error1(xb, surrogate_error2)

        # Update weights with surrogate gradients
        model.fc1.weight.grad = surrogate_error1
        model.fc2.weight.grad = surrogate_error2

        optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

```
Here the `DFAError` module generates an error signal, that, coupled with activations from the model's layers, create a surrogate gradient using an operation equivalent to the backward pass but without it. Note that, in the above case, the model is still used for a forward pass to obtain activations for use with the surrogate error signal.

**Discussion**
While the canonical use case of a forward pass is a fundamental part of gradient calculation, it can be circumvented through various techniques. Meta-learning uses nested loops where parameter optimization is not a direct consequence of a single forward pass. Surrogate gradient methods use alternative strategies to compute parameter updates, which, similarly, do not rely on a traditional backpropagation step from a standard model forward calculation. These methods require additional considerations with respect to architectural choices and parameter settings.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of meta-learning, I recommend exploring literature on *model-agnostic meta-learning* (MAML) and related algorithms. These offer a more thorough explanation of episodic training and meta-optimization. Regarding surrogate gradient methods, research into direct feedback alignment and *target-propagation* is recommended. These methods provide insight into how gradient-like information can be generated without standard backpropagation. Finally, carefully reviewing PyTorch's documentation, specifically around `torch.autograd` and `torch.nn`, will offer a clearer perspective on how gradients are calculated in the context of standard forward/backward operations.
