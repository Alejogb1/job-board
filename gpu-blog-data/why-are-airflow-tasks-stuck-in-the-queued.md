Airflow tasks lingering in the 'queued' state often stem from resource contention within the scheduler and executor.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous large-scale data pipelines reveals that this isn't a singular issue with a single solution, but rather a confluence of factors requiring systematic investigation.

**1. Clear Explanation of the Queued State and Contributing Factors**

The 'queued' state signifies that an Airflow task is ready to execute but hasn't been assigned to a worker.  This happens because the task's dependencies have been met, and it's awaiting allocation of resources within the execution environment.  Several factors contribute to tasks becoming stuck in this state:

* **Scheduler Bottleneck:** The Airflow scheduler is responsible for assigning tasks to workers.  If the scheduler itself is overloaded – perhaps due to insufficient resources (CPU, memory),  a poorly tuned scheduler configuration (e.g., low `max_threads`), or a large number of simultaneously triggered tasks – it can become a bottleneck, delaying the queuing and scheduling process.

* **Executor Limitations:**  The executor, responsible for actually running the tasks, plays a critical role.  The `SequentialExecutor`, suitable for small deployments, processes tasks sequentially, and therefore only one task can execute at a time, creating a significant queue buildup.  The `LocalExecutor` and `CeleryExecutor` are more scalable, but still suffer if the number of available worker processes or Celery worker nodes is insufficient or the tasks are excessively resource-intensive. KubernetesExecutor offers more elasticity, but misconfigurations in the Kubernetes cluster or insufficient resources (pods, nodes) will equally lead to queuing issues.

* **Resource Constraints:** Individual tasks, irrespective of the executor, require resources (CPU, memory, network I/O).  If a task requests more resources than available on a worker node, it might remain indefinitely in the queue. This can be exacerbated by poorly optimized task code, inefficient data handling, or excessive resource requests in the task definition.

* **Deadlocks and Circular Dependencies:**  Incorrect task dependencies can lead to deadlocks. If tasks A and B depend on each other, neither will ever run, leading to tasks further downstream also staying in the queue. Circular dependencies are a subtle but common cause of this type of deadlock.

* **Database Issues:** Airflow relies on a database (usually PostgreSQL or MySQL) to track task states. Database performance issues (slow queries, connection pool exhaustion) can severely impact the scheduler's ability to efficiently manage tasks, leading to queue buildup.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate potential scenarios and their respective debugging approaches.  These are simplified for illustrative purposes and are designed for a `LocalExecutor`.

**Example 1: Overloaded Worker and Resource Contention**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='resource_intensive_task',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    # Simulates a resource-intensive task
    heavy_task = BashOperator(
        task_id='heavy_task',
        bash_command='sleep 600; echo "Task complete"', #Simulates a long running task
    )
```

**Commentary:** This example shows a single task that takes 10 minutes to complete. In a `LocalExecutor` with limited worker threads, multiple such tasks scheduled concurrently will lead to queuing. Solution involves either reducing the runtime of the task (optimizing code, improving data processing efficiency), increasing the number of worker processes in the `LocalExecutor`, or switching to a more scalable executor like `CeleryExecutor` or `KubernetesExecutor`.

**Example 2: Circular Dependency**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='circular_dependency',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    task_a = DummyOperator(task_id='task_a')
    task_b = DummyOperator(task_id='task_b')
    task_a >> task_b >> task_a #Creates a circular dependency
```

**Commentary:** This DAG exhibits a clear circular dependency. Task A depends on B, and B depends on A, resulting in a deadlock. The solution requires careful review and restructuring of the task dependencies to eliminate the cycle.  Thoroughly examining the business logic and data flow is crucial here.

**Example 3:  Database Overload (Illustrative)**

```python
# This example doesn't directly show database code, but illustrates the impact
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import time

def slow_database_operation():
    time.sleep(10) # Simulates a slow database operation

with DAG(
    dag_id='database_overload',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    db_intensive_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='db_intensive_task',
        python_callable=slow_database_operation,
    )

```

**Commentary:**  This example simulates a task that performs a slow database operation.  If numerous such tasks run concurrently, they'll exacerbate database load, impacting the scheduler's ability to manage the queue. The solution involves database optimization (indexing, query tuning, connection pooling configuration), load balancing, and possibly sharding. Investigating database query logs to pinpoint slow-running queries is critical in these cases.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

To effectively diagnose and resolve Airflow task queuing issues, consider the following resources:

* **Airflow Documentation:**  The official Airflow documentation provides detailed information on executors, schedulers, and best practices for configuration and troubleshooting.

* **Airflow's logging mechanism:**  Thoroughly examine Airflow's logs (scheduler, worker, and database logs) to identify bottlenecks, errors, and resource usage patterns.

* **Monitoring Tools:** Utilize monitoring tools to observe resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O) on scheduler, worker nodes, and the database server to identify resource constraints.

* **Profiling Tools:**  Employ profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks within individual tasks, guiding optimization efforts.


In summary, resolving Airflow tasks stuck in the queued state demands a systematic approach encompassing scheduler and executor configuration review, resource monitoring, task code optimization, dependency analysis, and database performance analysis.  A blend of careful observation and systematic investigation usually points towards the root cause. My experience highlights that this is often not a singular problem, but rather a combination of factors demanding a holistic approach to resolution.
