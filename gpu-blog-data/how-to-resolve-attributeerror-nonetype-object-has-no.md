In my experience optimizing distributed training pipelines for deep learning, encountering `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'update'` during Keras multi-GPU setups is a common pitfall, specifically within custom training loops or when integrating with libraries that manipulate training steps. This error arises because the gradient update step, which typically expects a valid optimizer object with an `update` method, receives a `None` value. This situation often stems from incorrectly handling gradient aggregation and application across different GPUs when not using Keras’ built-in data parallelism strategies.

The core issue lies in how Keras, and particularly `tf.distribute.Strategy` implementations, manage the training procedure across replicas. With distributed training, each GPU computes gradients on a subset of the batch, and these gradients must be aggregated and then applied to the model's variables by the optimizer. When constructing custom training routines or when adapting model architectures in ways that affect gradient propagation, the `None` type error indicates a disconnection in this carefully orchestrated process. The error essentially means that the distributed training strategy, during a specific point in its operation, expects an optimizer object capable of updating the model’s parameters, but instead, it encounters an object that lacks the method it’s searching for.

This problem frequently materializes when utilizing `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` or `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, and can be compounded by specific custom loss or metric functions which fail to propagate the computation correctly across GPUs. During the training loop, the optimizer instance, which should be responsible for applying the gradients, becomes `None` at some point. The most direct cause is typically the loss function's inability to be computed on a distribution across GPUs, resulting in a `None` value instead of a valid gradient. This can arise through improperly defined losses or metrics within the strategy scope. These often neglect to correctly synchronize results between replicas, which leads to a missing gradient that subsequently becomes a NoneType within the optimizer's operation.

To illustrate and demonstrate common error points and their fixes, here are three code examples. The first code example creates an example with a common problem and a second example demonstrates a possible solution with more defined structures. The third example will address the usage of custom gradient operations within a multi GPU strategy.

**Example 1: Incorrect Loss Definition in a Multi-GPU Setup**

This example will showcase a common mistake where the loss calculation doesn’t properly distribute when using mirrored strategy. I'll be working with a very simple model to make the issue clear.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

def loss_fn(y_true, y_pred):
    # Incorrect: Assuming single batch execution. Does not work for a distributed training.
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred))

@tf.function
def train_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(inputs)
      loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.random.normal((100,10)), tf.random.uniform((100,1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32))).batch(16).repeat()

for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(dataset):
    if i > 10:
      break
    loss = strategy.run(train_step, args=(inputs,labels,))
    print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

**Commentary:** In this example, the `loss_fn` calculates the loss on the entire mini-batch at once, without distributing the loss calculation across multiple replicas in the distributed training setup. Consequently, the gradients are not computed correctly when using `strategy.run`, and when `optimizer.apply_gradients` attempts to apply the (in this case incorrectly calculated) gradients, it encounters a `None` because the gradients are not computed appropriately, thus generating the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'update'` error. The `tf.reduce_mean` outside of the distributed loss does not distribute the calculation.

**Example 2: Corrected Loss Calculation with `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`**

Here's a modified version that addresses the issue by appropriately distributing the loss computation using `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

def loss_fn(y_true, y_pred):
   per_example_loss = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
   return tf.nn.compute_average_loss(per_example_loss, global_batch_size=tf.cast(tf.shape(y_true)[0], tf.float32))

@tf.function
def train_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.random.normal((100,10)), tf.random.uniform((100,1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32))).batch(16).repeat()

for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(dataset):
    if i > 10:
        break
    loss = strategy.run(train_step, args=(inputs,labels,))
    print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

**Commentary:** The key change here is using `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`. This function scales the per-example losses by the global batch size, effectively averaging the loss across all replicas. This ensures that each replica is contributing appropriately to the final loss, and a valid gradient is passed to the optimizer. Using this function to distribute the loss calculation across the number of replicas of the device allows proper gradient calculations which avoids the aforementioned `NoneType` error.

**Example 3: Custom Gradient Computation within Strategy**

Sometimes you may be using custom gradient computations. This example will demonstrate how to properly compute gradients with a custom method under distributed training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

def custom_gradient(loss, trainable_variables):
    # Custom logic here, for demonstration using tf.clip_by_global_norm
    grads = tf.gradients(loss, trainable_variables)
    grads, _ = tf.clip_by_global_norm(grads, 5)
    return grads

def loss_fn(y_true, y_pred):
  per_example_loss = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
  return tf.nn.compute_average_loss(per_example_loss, global_batch_size=tf.cast(tf.shape(y_true)[0], tf.float32))


@tf.function
def train_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)

    grads = custom_gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.random.normal((100,10)), tf.random.uniform((100,1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32))).batch(16).repeat()

for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(dataset):
    if i > 10:
        break
    loss = strategy.run(train_step, args=(inputs,labels,))
    print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

**Commentary:**  In this scenario, a custom gradient function `custom_gradient` is introduced. This example function computes gradients and clips them using `tf.clip_by_global_norm`, a common approach in certain applications. The critical point is that the `tape.gradient` and subsequent manual gradient processing are still executed within the distributed context through `strategy.run`. If such custom steps are applied outside of this scope, then we may still see `None` values during the optimization process. This demonstrates how to perform custom operations within the constraints of the distribute strategy.

To summarize, diagnosing the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'update'` generally involves ensuring that the loss calculation and gradients are appropriately handled across devices. Debugging should start by verifying your loss function. Secondly, consider checking custom gradient processing that could be causing an issue. Finally, confirm that gradient values are propagating through to the optimizer within your distributed strategy scope using tools like `tf.print` or the TensorFlow debugger.

For further understanding of these concepts, the TensorFlow documentation provides detailed explanations of distributed training with Keras, particularly in the guides for `tf.distribute.Strategy`. Additionally, researching resources specifically on distributed training best practices, like the official tensorflow blog and specific papers on model training, can significantly enhance your troubleshooting skills in distributed systems.
