The discrepancy between a container exiting with a 0 code and the script within failing is almost always attributable to improper signal handling or a lack of robust error reporting within the script itself.  In my experience troubleshooting containerized applications over the past decade, including extensive work with Kubernetes and Docker Swarm, this is a deceptively common problem stemming from subtle differences in the execution environment.  A 0 exit code signifies successful completion *from the container's perspective*, but this doesn't necessarily reflect the success or failure of the processes *within* the container.


**1. Explanation:**

Containers provide a lightweight, isolated execution environment.  The container runtime (Docker, containerd, etc.) manages the container's lifecycle, including starting, stopping, and reporting the exit code.  This exit code reflects the status of the primary process the container was launched with, often the entrypoint defined in the Dockerfile.  However, this primary process might execute other scripts or applications. If those child processes encounter errors and terminate, they may not automatically cause the parent process (and therefore the container) to exit with a non-zero code.

Several scenarios can lead to this behavior:

* **Unhandled Exceptions:** The script might throw exceptions that are not caught. In languages like Python, if an exception isn't caught, it will terminate the script, but the parent process might continue running or return a default 0 exit code.

* **Signal Handling:**  The script might receive a signal (e.g., SIGTERM) from the container runtime during graceful shutdown.  If the script doesn't handle this signal properly, it might terminate abruptly without properly cleaning up or logging an error, leaving the parent process with a 0 exit code.

* **Background Processes:** The script might launch background processes or threads that encounter errors without affecting the main process's exit status.

* **Asynchronous Operations:** If the script involves asynchronous operations (like network requests or database interactions), an error might occur asynchronously, leading to the script finishing seemingly successfully but having actually failed some internal task.

* **Incorrect Exit Code Setting:** The script itself might not be properly setting its exit code. Languages offer mechanisms to set exit codes explicitly (e.g., `sys.exit(1)` in Python), which are crucial for indicating failure.

To diagnose the issue, we need to meticulously examine the script's error handling, signal handling, and output to identify the point of failure.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Python with Unhandled Exception:**

```python
import sys

def my_function(arg):
    try:
        result = 10 / arg
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero")  # This will be printed, but the script exits without an exit code set

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_function(0)
    print("Script completed")  # This is printed in spite of the prior error.

```

This script will print the error message, but because the `ZeroDivisionError` isn't caught, the script will terminate, likely leaving the parent process (and thus the container) with a 0 exit code.  A proper solution would involve catching the exception and explicitly setting a non-zero exit code:

```python
import sys

def my_function(arg):
    try:
        result = 10 / arg
        return 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero")
        return 1 #Setting an exit code

if __name__ == "__main__":
    exit_code = my_function(0)
    sys.exit(exit_code)
```

**Example 2: Bash Script with Signal Handling:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

trap "echo 'Received signal, exiting gracefully...'; exit 1" SIGTERM SIGINT

# Simulate a long-running process that might get interrupted.
sleep 60

echo "Process completed successfully"
exit 0
```

This Bash script demonstrates handling signals.  If the container receives a `SIGTERM` (often sent during container shutdown), the trap will execute, print a message, and exit with a code 1. Without the `trap`, the container might exit with 0 even if the script was interrupted.


**Example 3: Node.js with Asynchronous Operation Failure:**

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    //Simulate a failure
    setTimeout(() => { throw new Error("Something went wrong!")}, 1000)
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('Hello World!');
});


server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

In this Node.js example, an error is thrown asynchronously within the request handler.  This could go unnoticed by the main process if not properly handled within a `try...catch` block, especially if the error occurs *after* the response is sent. Even if the `server.listen` function completes, a non-zero exit code should be set on the thrown error to signify that the script, from its internal perspective, was not fully successful.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For comprehensive understanding of containerization, consult the official Docker documentation and guides on container orchestration systems like Kubernetes.  Study advanced shell scripting and your chosen programming language's exception handling mechanisms.  Understanding process management concepts, including signals and their handling, is also critical.  Finally, dedicated debugging tools and container logging solutions will help analyze the specific behavior of your application within the container environment.
