My experience optimizing high-performance computing simulations using CUDA has often highlighted the nuances of correctly configuring block dimensions. Ineffective block size selections are a common source of underperformance and can, in some cases, lead to incorrect computational results when boundary conditions or shared memory usage are not carefully considered. The core issue typically stems from a misunderstanding of how threads within a block interact and how the block itself is mapped to the available streaming multiprocessors (SMs) on a given GPU. When the dimensions don't align with the problem's inherent structure or the GPU's architecture, we see results that deviate from expectations. This discrepancy manifests in several ways, including poor memory access patterns, inefficient resource utilization, and subtle errors due to incorrect assumptions about thread indexing.

Fundamentally, a CUDA kernel execution involves a hierarchy of threads. The smallest unit of execution is the individual thread. Threads are then organized into blocks, and blocks are organized into a grid. Block dimensions define the number of threads within a single block. Choosing appropriate dimensions is not arbitrary; it's a balance between several factors. Too few threads within a block and the GPU’s resources are underutilized. Too many and you may exceed shared memory or register limits. Furthermore, if the problem inherently has structures that align well with a particular block shape, performance increases can be significant by exploiting these structures. Let's consider scenarios where the desired results were not being generated, examining underlying causes and effective mitigation.

The first common issue I've encountered involves mismatched indexing within a kernel function. Suppose we're performing element-wise addition on two arrays. A naive approach might assume that each thread directly corresponds to an element index in our input arrays. Consider this initial kernel implementation:

```cpp
__global__ void addArrays(float *a, float *b, float *c, int N) {
    int i = threadIdx.x; // Assuming 1D block and grid

    if(i < N) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

// Launch configuration would be:
// int threadsPerBlock = 256;
// int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock -1) / threadsPerBlock;
// addArrays<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, N);
```

Here, the kernel only leverages the `threadIdx.x` component, implicitly assuming a one-dimensional block structure. This may work correctly for small datasets or with particular launch configurations, but it fails when we want to use a multi-dimensional block. If, for example, we were to use a 2D block, we would be addressing the same elements multiple times since each block would independently generate indexes [0, threadsPerBlock-1]. This leads to duplicate work and incorrect results, since multiple threads would try to write to the same `c[i]`. In such a scenario, a more robust indexing mechanism is necessary, and this might involve grid dimensions as well.

This corrected example shows how to handle a 2D block configuration to handle 2D data.

```cpp
__global__ void addArrays2D(float *a, float *b, float *c, int width, int height) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  if (x < width && y < height) {
    int index = y * width + x; // convert to a 1D index.
    c[index] = a[index] + b[index];
  }
}
// Launch configuration would be:
// int threadsPerBlockX = 16;
// int threadsPerBlockY = 16;
// dim3 threadsPerBlock(threadsPerBlockX, threadsPerBlockY);
// dim3 blocksPerGrid( (width+ threadsPerBlockX - 1) / threadsPerBlockX, (height+ threadsPerBlockY -1 )/threadsPerBlockY);
// addArrays2D<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, width, height);
```

In this revised kernel, the index `i` is constructed by combining the grid and block indices using the formulas `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x` and `blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y`, allowing us to map threads uniquely to the 2D data. The grid dimensions are now also considered when generating the index, enabling this example to handle multi-dimensional blocks and data. Additionally we convert from the 2D coordinate system `(x, y)` to a 1D index. The bounds checking `(x < width && y < height)` prevents out-of-bounds memory access, crucial for correctness.

A second area where incorrect results arise is during operations requiring shared memory. Consider a matrix transposition task. If each thread attempts to directly write to the global output array without proper synchronization or using shared memory, race conditions occur, leading to incorrect output. For example, if a simple in-place transposition is attempted without considering that each element of the input matrix will be written to a new position, we can obtain wrong values.

This example below illustrates a naive, incorrect implementation.

```cpp
__global__ void transposeMatrix(float *input, float *output, int width) {
    int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int row = x;
    int col = y;
    if (row < width && col < width){
       output[col*width + row] = input[row*width + col]; // Potential race condition
    }
}

// Launch configuration would be similar to the 2D example.
```

While this might appear logically sound, each write to `output` is asynchronous. When a thread writes to the shared memory, another thread might overwrite it before the first thread's intended value can be used. This leads to an incorrect transpose. The problem is that threads need to cooperate by first transposing to shared memory. Therefore, threads must cooperate in the transposition process using shared memory.

A corrected example leveraging shared memory is shown below.

```cpp
__global__ void transposeMatrixShared(float *input, float *output, int width) {
    __shared__ float tile[32][32]; // Example size; must be square
    int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int row = x;
    int col = y;

    if (row < width && col < width){
        tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = input[row * width + col]; // Load from global memory to shared
    }

    __syncthreads(); // Wait for all threads in the block to finish writing to shared memory

    if (row < width && col < width) {
        output[col * width + row] = tile[threadIdx.x][threadIdx.y]; // Write from shared memory to global memory
    }
}

// Launch configuration would be similar to the 2D example. Here blockDim.x and blockDim.y would be 32 to match tile size.
```

In this improved version, a shared memory array `tile` is used. Each thread first loads its corresponding input value into `tile`. The `__syncthreads()` directive ensures that all threads within the block complete their writes before any thread attempts to read from `tile`. After the synchronization point, each thread reads the transposed value from shared memory, thereby eliminating the race conditions. The choice of `32x32` for shared memory depends on the hardware, so experimentation is vital to finding the best fit. It's also important to verify that block size is not larger than the capacity of shared memory. This highlights the importance of not only thread dimension mapping but also explicit handling of shared memory when needed.

Finally, performance can degrade significantly if blocks aren't adequately sized or if the grid is poorly configured. As an example, if the grid size is too small, the GPU resources will be underutilized. If the block size is not a multiple of 32 or the wavefront size of the architecture in use, this can affect performance negatively. For example, in NVIDIA architectures, a wavefront (warp) is composed of 32 threads. The threads in a warp execute instructions in lockstep. If the number of threads is not a multiple of the warp size, the execution is inefficient because a single warp may not fully fill. So, if using block dimensions that result in non-full warps, we would be wasting potential compute power. Conversely, too-large block sizes can lead to resource exhaustion. Specifically, the number of active warps per SM influences GPU occupancy and consequently, performance. A carefully tuned block dimension maximizes the overall GPU utilization.

In conclusion, achieving the desired results with CUDA block dimensions demands a comprehensive understanding of thread indexing, shared memory usage, synchronization, and architectural considerations. The three code examples illustrated above each address a specific concern that can often lead to incorrect results. Mismatched indexing with multi-dimensional blocks leads to duplicate work. Naive memory access leads to race conditions, and improper sizes or a grid of blocks can result in performance bottlenecks. Understanding thread indexing, using shared memory and synchronizing when needed, and choosing sizes that work well with the hardware are crucial for obtaining correct results. To deepen understanding, I recommend exploring publications related to CUDA programming, including NVIDIA’s CUDA programming guides and materials. Texts on parallel programming can also provide a broader perspective on related concepts. It's often useful to work through examples and experiment on different hardware.
