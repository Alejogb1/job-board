Swift closures, unlike functions, can capture and retain values from their surrounding scope. This mechanism, while powerful, has nuances when dealing with value types, specifically those that might be "boxed" to achieve heap allocation. This response details how closures retain these boxed instances, focusing on memory management and the implications for development.

Initially, it’s critical to understand Swift's typical handling of value types like `struct` and `enum`. Normally, when such values are used within a closure, they are copied. This ensures each closure maintains its own independent copy. However, when value types are intentionally allocated on the heap—often through the use of classes (reference types) or specific library constructs—the behavior shifts. The closure doesn't capture copies of the value, but rather, it captures the *reference* to the heap-allocated instance.

The term "box" in this context represents a specific instantiation where a value type is wrapped in a class. This boxing process isn't automatic; it's an intentional decision made by the developer or a specific framework. When a closure captures this box, it implicitly increases the reference count of the class instance within. The closure thus becomes a *strong reference* holder, thereby preventing the box and its contained value from being deallocated as long as the closure is alive. The consequence of this strong retention cycle is that when a closure goes out of scope, it releases its reference count on the class, which may, in turn, cause the class to be deallocated, freeing the memory it holds.

A fundamental understanding lies in the inherent nature of memory management in Swift, particularly when dealing with reference counting. When a closure captures a class instance, it becomes an owner of that instance and keeps it alive as long as it exists. The reference count is updated implicitly, a detail that isn’t always immediately apparent from syntax. This is a departure from the usual behavior of value type captures, where copies are made, and no reference counting is involved. This distinction is crucial to avoid memory leaks and unexpected resource usage patterns.

Now, let's examine this through several code examples.

**Example 1: Basic Boxed Value Capture**

```swift
class Box<T> {
    var value: T
    init(value: T) {
        self.value = value
        print("Box init")
    }
    deinit {
        print("Box deinit")
    }
}


func createClosureWithBox() -> () -> Void {
    let boxedInt = Box(value: 10)
    let capturedClosure = {
        print("Value is: \(boxedInt.value)")
    }
    return capturedClosure
}

var myClosure: () -> Void? = createClosureWithBox()
myClosure!()
myClosure = nil
```

**Commentary:** In this example, we define a generic `Box` class, serving as a container for any type. The `createClosureWithBox` function creates an instance of `Box<Int>` and a closure capturing this instance. The `capturedClosure` doesn't make a copy of the `boxedInt` value, instead, it maintains a reference to the `Box` instance on the heap. When `myClosure` is set to `nil`, the last remaining reference to the captured closure is released, which in turn reduces the reference count of the Box instance, causing its deallocation, and printing `Box deinit`. The important point is the lifecycle of the Box instance is tied to the closure’s lifetime because of reference semantics.

**Example 2: Modification Through Captured Box**

```swift
class Box<T> {
    var value: T
    init(value: T) {
        self.value = value
        print("Box init")
    }
    deinit {
        print("Box deinit")
    }
}

func createModifyingClosure() -> (() -> Void, () -> Int) {
    let boxedInt = Box(value: 5)

    let incrementClosure = {
        boxedInt.value += 1
    }

    let readClosure = {
        return boxedInt.value
    }
    
    return (incrementClosure, readClosure)
}

let (increment, reader) = createModifyingClosure()

increment()
print("Value after increment: \(reader())")

increment()
print("Value after second increment: \(reader())")
```

**Commentary:** This expands upon the previous example by demonstrating the mutability of the captured `Box` instance. The `incrementClosure` modifies the `value` property of `boxedInt` directly since it holds a reference. The `readClosure` can observe these modifications. This further emphasizes that the closure isn't operating on copies, but the very same object instantiated outside the closure. This type of behavior is vital when you need shared mutable state between closures or function scopes. However, be mindful of thread safety issues in concurrent scenarios.

**Example 3: Retaining a Box within an Object**

```swift
class MyContainer {
    var closure: (() -> Void)?

    init() {
        print("Container init")
    }

    func createBoxedClosure() {
        let boxedValue = Box(value: "Hello")
        self.closure = {
           print("Boxed value is: \(boxedValue.value)")
        }
    }

    deinit {
        print("Container deinit")
    }

}

var container: MyContainer? = MyContainer()
container!.createBoxedClosure()
container!.closure!()
container = nil
```

**Commentary:** In this example, we encapsulate the box and closure creation logic inside the `MyContainer` class. When an instance of `MyContainer` creates a closure using `createBoxedClosure()`, it not only captures the `boxedValue` but also retains it. `MyContainer` also retains a reference to the closure. Setting the `container` variable to `nil` will cause the container’s `deinit` to be called. This reduction in reference count to 0 will trigger the deallocation of `container`, which will in turn reduce the reference count for the closure, and then the box.  This showcases how ownership flows through object composition and the strong reference capture by closures. Again, this is the key to understanding the management of instances allocated on the heap.

To further explore this topic, I would recommend resources focusing on Swift’s memory management and closure mechanics. Look at detailed explanations of Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) and how it interacts with closures. Resources explaining reference types versus value types, with detailed examples, can also help grasp these concepts better. Pay close attention to documentation and examples describing the behavior of classes when they are used within closures as this is where the essence of this mechanism resides. Additionally, articles and books discussing retain cycles and memory leaks in Swift would be very beneficial, specifically, resources that explain capture lists to avoid unintended strong references. Be sure to understand when to use weak or unowned references within a capture list, as they provide solutions to break strong reference cycles. Lastly, focus on the performance implications related to allocating values on the heap, as it may introduce overhead and should be used only when truly needed. The performance characteristic of creating and destroying the reference-counted objects might be a bottleneck in some scenarios.
