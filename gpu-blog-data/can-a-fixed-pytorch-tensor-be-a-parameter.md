A common misunderstanding arises concerning the fundamental difference between a tensor’s *data* and its *role* within a PyTorch module. A tensor’s data is simply a multi-dimensional array holding numerical values. However, when a tensor is intended to be modified by the optimizer during training, it must be registered as a parameter of a `torch.nn.Module`. This implies more than just storing the data; it signals to the PyTorch framework that the tensor’s contents should be tracked and updated through gradient descent. Therefore, while you can *hold* a fixed tensor within a module, it will not function as a trainable parameter.

My experience building convolutional networks for image segmentation consistently highlights this distinction. I've seen errors where pre-computed transformation matrices, stored as tensors, were directly utilized within a module without being registered as parameters. Consequently, the optimizer ignored these tensors during training, resulting in suboptimal performance. This stems from the way PyTorch tracks gradients and updates model parameters; only tensors declared as module parameters are considered trainable.

To clarify, a `torch.Tensor` becomes a parameter of a `torch.nn.Module` by explicitly registering it using `torch.nn.Parameter`. This conversion tells PyTorch to:

1.  **Track Gradients:** PyTorch records the operations performed on the parameter tensor during the forward pass, enabling backpropagation to compute gradients.
2.  **Participate in Optimization:** The optimizer, such as Adam or SGD, uses these calculated gradients to adjust the parameter's values, aiming to minimize the loss function.

If you hold a standard `torch.Tensor` within a module, its gradients are not tracked, and thus it will not be updated by the optimizer. It acts as a read-only entity, regardless of whether it is mutable or immutable data wise.

Consider this first example of a simple linear layer that attempts to use a directly instantiated tensor instead of `torch.nn.Parameter`:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class IncorrectLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super().__init__()
        # Incorrect: direct tensor usage
        self.weight = torch.randn(out_features, in_features)
        self.bias = torch.randn(out_features)

    def forward(self, x):
      return torch.matmul(x, self.weight.T) + self.bias

# Create a dummy model and input
model_incorrect = IncorrectLinear(10, 2)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Attempt a backwards pass
loss = (model_incorrect(input_tensor) - torch.randn(1,2)).pow(2).mean()
loss.backward()

# Check if gradients for weight and bias are available
print("Weight grad:", model_incorrect.weight.grad)
print("Bias grad:", model_incorrect.bias.grad)
```
In this case, running this script will output `None` for the gradients, indicating the weight and bias tensors are not parameters and hence their gradients weren't computed. Note that no explicit error is produced. This is because PyTorch doesn't restrict us from performing computations, only from adjusting the tensors in question via backpropagation.

The corrected version using `torch.nn.Parameter` is shown below:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CorrectLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super().__init__()
        # Correct: Register as parameters
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_features, in_features))
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_features))

    def forward(self, x):
      return torch.matmul(x, self.weight.T) + self.bias


# Create a dummy model and input
model_correct = CorrectLinear(10, 2)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Attempt a backwards pass
loss = (model_correct(input_tensor) - torch.randn(1,2)).pow(2).mean()
loss.backward()

# Check if gradients for weight and bias are available
print("Weight grad:", model_correct.weight.grad)
print("Bias grad:", model_correct.bias.grad)
```
Here, we explicitly wrap the initial `torch.randn` tensors with `nn.Parameter`. Upon inspection, you will find both weight and bias now have associated gradients after backpropagation. This allows them to be optimized with training algorithms.

To further illustrate the concept, consider a scenario where you have a pre-calculated kernel for a convolution layer. Attempting to load this kernel directly will result in a similar situation.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class IncorrectConv(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, precomputed_kernel):
    super().__init__()
    self.precomputed_kernel = precomputed_kernel # No parameter registration
    self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_channels))

  def forward(self, x):
      return F.conv2d(x, self.precomputed_kernel, bias=self.bias)

#Dummy data, create kernel
input_channels = 3
output_channels = 6
kernel_size = 3
precomputed_k = torch.randn(output_channels, input_channels, kernel_size, kernel_size)

# Instantiate Model
model_incorrect_conv = IncorrectConv(input_channels, output_channels, kernel_size, precomputed_k)
input_conv = torch.randn(1, input_channels, 20, 20)

# Attempt backpass
loss_conv = (model_incorrect_conv(input_conv) - torch.randn(1, output_channels, 18, 18)).pow(2).mean()
loss_conv.backward()

# Check grads
print("Precomputed kernel grad: ", model_incorrect_conv.precomputed_kernel.grad)
print("Bias grad:", model_incorrect_conv.bias.grad)
```
In this example, the precomputed kernel is directly assigned. Even with a correctly registered bias parameter, its gradient is available, but not for the `precomputed_kernel`, as expected.

In summary, a plain `torch.Tensor` can be held inside a `torch.nn.Module`, but if that tensor should be trainable – meaning its values are subject to gradient descent updates – it *must* be explicitly wrapped within `torch.nn.Parameter`.  Failing to do so will prevent it from participating in the learning process and will lead to unexpected results or poor performance during optimization. Remember: tensor data and its role as a parameter are distinct concepts in PyTorch.  The tensor data stores the values;  `torch.nn.Parameter` denotes its function within the model optimization framework.

For further exploration of this topic, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation specifically sections relating to `torch.nn.Module`, `torch.nn.Parameter`, and the autograd functionalities.  Additionally, tutorials explaining the basics of neural network implementation with PyTorch would provide practical examples to solidify these concepts. Online courses focusing on deep learning with PyTorch also often discuss this topic thoroughly. Finally, actively working through simple models, observing behaviors and analyzing errors will solidify the distinction between these two concepts.
