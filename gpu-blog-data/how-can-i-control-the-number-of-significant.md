The `stat_regline_equation` function within the `ggpubr` package, often used in conjunction with `ggscatter` for visualizing regression lines and associated statistics, lacks direct control over the number of significant digits displayed in the coefficient estimates.  This limitation stems from its reliance on base R's formatting mechanisms, which are not tailored for precise numerical display within a ggplot2 context. My experience working on several large-scale data visualization projects involving regression analysis revealed this deficiency, necessitating the development of custom solutions.  I've found three reliable approaches to overcome this limitation.

**1.  Direct String Manipulation with `sprintf()`**

The most straightforward method involves leveraging `sprintf()` to format the regression equation string generated by `stat_regline_equation`. This function offers fine-grained control over the number of decimal places.  However, this approach requires careful parsing of the output string to identify and replace the coefficient values.

```R
library(ggpubr)
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data
data("mtcars")

# Perform regression
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

# Extract coefficient estimates, rounded to 3 decimal places
intercept <- sprintf("%.3f", coef(model)[1])
slope <- sprintf("%.3f", coef(model)[2])

# Construct custom equation string
custom_equation <- paste0("y = ", slope, "x + ", intercept)

# Create plot with custom equation
ggscatter(mtcars, x = "wt", y = "mpg",
          add = "reg.line", conf.int = TRUE,
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson",
          xlab = "Weight (1000 lbs)", ylab = "Miles per gallon") +
  stat_regline_equation(label.x = 3, label.y = 25,
                        equation = custom_equation)
```

This code first performs a linear regression on the `mtcars` dataset. It then extracts the intercept and slope coefficients using `coef(model)`, rounds them to three decimal places using `sprintf("%.3f", ...)` and constructs a new equation string.  Finally, it utilizes `stat_regline_equation` with the custom equation, replacing the default output.  The key is the explicit formatting within `sprintf()`; changing "%.3f" to "%.2f" would display two decimal places, and so on.  This method is efficient for simple regressions but may become complex for more intricate models.


**2. Custom `stat_function` for Enhanced Control**

For more robust control and flexibility, a custom `stat_function` can be implemented.  This offers complete autonomy over the equation generation and formatting. This approach also neatly sidesteps issues associated with string manipulation.

```R
library(ggpubr)
library(ggplot2)

# Custom stat function
stat_custom_equation <- function(mapping = NULL, data = NULL,
                                 geom = "text", position = "identity",
                                 ...,
                                 digits = 3,
                                 parse = FALSE) {
  ggplot2::layer(
    stat = StatCustomEquation, data = data, mapping = mapping, geom = geom,
    position = position, show.legend = FALSE, inherit.aes = TRUE,
    params = list(digits = digits, parse = parse, ...)
  )
}

StatCustomEquation <- ggproto("StatCustomEquation", Stat,
                             compute_group = function(data, scales, digits) {
                               model <- lm(y ~ x, data = data)
                               intercept <- round(coef(model)[1], digits)
                               slope <- round(coef(model)[2], digits)
                               equation <- paste0("y == ", slope, "*x + ", intercept)
                               data.frame(x = min(data$x), y = max(data$y), label = equation)
                             },
                             required_aes = c("x", "y")
)

# Sample Data and Plot
data("mtcars")
ggscatter(mtcars, x = "wt", y = "mpg",
          add = "reg.line", conf.int = TRUE,
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson",
          xlab = "Weight (1000 lbs)", ylab = "Miles per gallon") +
  stat_custom_equation(aes(label = ..label..), digits = 2)
```

Here, we define a new stat, `StatCustomEquation`, which directly computes the regression, rounds coefficients using the `digits` parameter, and constructs the equation string. The `stat_custom_equation` wrapper provides a user-friendly interface.  This approach is superior to the previous one due to its modularity and ability to handle various regression types easily by modifying the `compute_group` function.


**3.  Post-Processing with `ggedit` (For Advanced Users)**

For those familiar with the `ggedit` package,  post-processing the ggplot object offers a powerful, albeit indirect, solution. This method allows for manipulation of the plot elements after rendering, offering flexibility but with a slight increase in complexity.

```R
library(ggpubr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggedit)

# Generate the plot
p <- ggscatter(mtcars, x = "wt", y = "mpg",
               add = "reg.line", conf.int = TRUE,
               cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson",
               xlab = "Weight (1000 lbs)", ylab = "Miles per gallon")

# Extract the equation text grob
grob <- ggplot_build(p)$data[[2]]

# Identify the equation text and round to two decimal places.  Careful handling of potential inconsistencies in the structure of 'label' is needed here to ensure robustness
# This part requires careful examination of the specific structure returned by ggplot_build for different scenarios.
# The following code is illustrative and might need adjustment based on the specific plot structure.  Error handling should be added for production code.
grob$label <- gsub("([0-9]+\\.[0-9]+)", function(x) sprintf("%.2f", as.numeric(x)), grob$label)

# Recreate the plot with modified equation text
p + annotation_custom(textGrob(grob$label, x = grob$x, y = grob$y, gp = grob$gp))
```

This code first generates the plot using `ggscatter`. Then, using `ggplot_build`, it extracts the underlying graphical objects (grobs). The equation text is identified (the indexing and data structure manipulation here is crucial and may vary depending on the specifics of your plot) and modified using string manipulation and `sprintf()`. The modified grob is then re-inserted into the plot using `annotation_custom`.  This method is potent but necessitates a deeper understanding of ggplot2's internal structure.

These three approaches offer varying degrees of control and complexity. Choosing the optimal method depends on the desired level of precision, the complexity of the regression models involved, and the programmer's familiarity with R's graphics capabilities.
