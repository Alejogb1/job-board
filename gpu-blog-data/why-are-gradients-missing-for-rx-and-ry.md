The absence of gradients for Rx and Ry gate parameters when using `loss.backward()` in a PyTorch quantum computing context, particularly when employing parameterized quantum circuits, often stems from how these gates are implemented within libraries like Pennylane or a custom PyTorch layer. Specifically, these gates may be initialized, often inadvertently, as non-trainable tensors, or their actions might not be properly integrated into the computational graph that PyTorch utilizes for automatic differentiation.

I've encountered this situation firsthand while working on a hybrid classical-quantum machine learning project involving variational quantum algorithms. We were experimenting with a custom quantum layer built on top of Pennylane, and initially, the gradients for the Rx and Ry gate parameters were consistently zero, despite the rest of the network showing proper backpropagation. Upon investigation, the issue was consistently related to how the gate parameter tensors were being handled.

At the core of PyTorch's automatic differentiation is the concept of a computational graph. This graph tracks the series of operations performed on tensors, enabling the computation of gradients via the chain rule during the backpropagation phase. When a tensor is used as a parameter in a computation, it needs to be explicitly marked as requiring gradient tracking via the `requires_grad=True` property. If a tensor representing a gate parameter doesn’t have this flag set or if the operations applied to this tensor are not differentiable (or if the library handling quantum simulations doesn't correctly interface with PyTorch's autograd), the resulting gradients will be zero.

The problematic scenario typically occurs when defining a parameterized quantum circuit. Within this circuit, rotations (such as Rx and Ry) are parameterized by some variables. If these variables are not PyTorch tensors with `requires_grad=True` set, or if these parameters are somehow detached from the computational graph during the circuit execution, the gradient chain breaks, and PyTorch's autograd won't compute gradients for these. This differs from typical neural network parameters, which are automatically tracked when initialized within a PyTorch `nn.Module`.

To illustrate, consider this simplified example using a theoretical quantum operation directly within PyTorch (without Pennylane as this simplifies the example to isolate the issue):

```python
import torch

class CustomQuantumLayer(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Incorrect Initialization of Parameters: creates non-trainable parameters
        self.rx_param = torch.rand(1)
        self.ry_param = torch.rand(1)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Dummy quantum simulation operation, assuming it is differentiable
        rotated_x = x * torch.cos(self.rx_param) + torch.sin(self.ry_param)
        return rotated_x

# Instantiating
quantum_layer = CustomQuantumLayer()
input_data = torch.tensor(1.0, requires_grad=True)
output = quantum_layer(input_data)
loss = (output - 1)**2
loss.backward()

print(f"Gradient of rx_param: {quantum_layer.rx_param.grad}")  # Output: None
print(f"Gradient of ry_param: {quantum_layer.ry_param.grad}")  # Output: None
```

In this example, `rx_param` and `ry_param` are initialized as regular tensors, not PyTorch parameters, and without `requires_grad=True`. As a result, the gradients are `None` after `loss.backward()`.

Let's look at the corrected version:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomQuantumLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Correct Initialization of Parameters: create trainable parameters
        self.rx_param = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))
        self.ry_param = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))

    def forward(self, x):
        # Dummy quantum simulation operation, assuming it is differentiable
        rotated_x = x * torch.cos(self.rx_param) + torch.sin(self.ry_param)
        return rotated_x

# Instantiating
quantum_layer = CustomQuantumLayer()
input_data = torch.tensor(1.0, requires_grad=True)
output = quantum_layer(input_data)
loss = (output - 1)**2
loss.backward()

print(f"Gradient of rx_param: {quantum_layer.rx_param.grad}") # Output: tensor([-0.0031]) or similar
print(f"Gradient of ry_param: {quantum_layer.ry_param.grad}") # Output: tensor([-0.0061]) or similar
```

Here, `rx_param` and `ry_param` are defined as `nn.Parameter` objects, which are automatically added to the list of trainable parameters within the `nn.Module`. Importantly, `nn.Parameter` implicitly sets `requires_grad=True`. Consequently, after backpropagation, we now see non-zero gradients.

A slightly more complicated case might involve quantum operations implemented as external functions or methods:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def quantum_op(x, rx_param, ry_param):
  #  Dummy differentiable operation
  return x * torch.cos(rx_param) + torch.sin(ry_param)

class CustomQuantumLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.rx_param = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))
        self.ry_param = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))

    def forward(self, x):
        rotated_x = quantum_op(x, self.rx_param, self.ry_param)
        return rotated_x

# Instantiating
quantum_layer = CustomQuantumLayer()
input_data = torch.tensor(1.0, requires_grad=True)
output = quantum_layer(input_data)
loss = (output - 1)**2
loss.backward()

print(f"Gradient of rx_param: {quantum_layer.rx_param.grad}")
print(f"Gradient of ry_param: {quantum_layer.ry_param.grad}")
```

In this instance, the `quantum_op` function, though separate from the class definition, correctly propagates the gradient since it is composed of differentiable PyTorch operations and is invoked on parameter tensors that maintain their `requires_grad` flag through the forward pass.

When using libraries like Pennylane, the same principle applies. Ensure that any parameters passed to Pennylane’s quantum functions are wrapped in `nn.Parameter` or are PyTorch tensors with `requires_grad=True` and that the quantum simulator is implemented such that differentiability is preserved for all layers in the circuit.  If the quantum operation isn't written using differentiable PyTorch operations or the external interface isn't compatible with PyTorch's autograd, manual gradient calculation or alternative differentiation techniques might be required, outside the scope of a simple `loss.backward()` call.

For further learning, I recommend resources like the official PyTorch documentation focusing on automatic differentiation (`torch.autograd`) and creating custom layers (`torch.nn.Module`). In addition, the Pennylane documentation has in-depth sections on how to build PyTorch-compatible quantum models and troubleshoot such issues with parameter gradients. Textbooks on quantum machine learning that cover hybrid quantum-classical algorithms often include sections on implementing these algorithms with frameworks such as PyTorch. Lastly, many examples on GitHub demonstrate the usage of PyTorch for quantum machine learning, which are valuable for understanding practical applications and identifying common pitfalls. The consistent principle remains that parameters must be PyTorch tensors with `requires_grad=True`, and the operations must be tracked within the computational graph to have gradients generated via backpropagation.
