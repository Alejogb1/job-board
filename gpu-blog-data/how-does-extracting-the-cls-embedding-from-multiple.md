The core difference between extracting the CLS token embedding from multiple BERT outputs versus a single output lies in the aggregation strategy employed and its impact on downstream tasks.  My experience working on sentiment analysis and question answering systems has shown that simply averaging multiple CLS embeddings can lead to suboptimal performance compared to more sophisticated aggregation methods. While a single output provides a straightforward embedding, utilizing multiple outputs offers the potential for richer contextual representation, but requires careful handling to avoid information dilution.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The [CLS] token in BERT's architecture is designed to aggregate contextual information across the entire input sequence.  Its embedding at the output layer is often used as a sentence embedding.  When processing a single input, extracting the [CLS] embedding is a straightforward procedure.  However, scenarios arise where multiple BERT outputs are generated for a single input, such as when employing ensemble methods, different BERT configurations, or multiple passes over the same input with varying attention mechanisms. In these instances, a decision must be made regarding how to combine the multiple [CLS] embeddings into a single representative embedding.


Simple averaging is a common, but often naive approach.  Consider a binary classification task.  If one BERT output yields a [CLS] embedding strongly indicating class A, and another indicates class B, averaging these embeddings might result in an embedding that poorly represents either class, leading to classification errors.  More sophisticated techniques account for the inherent variability and potentially conflicting information contained within the multiple outputs.

Methods for aggregating multiple [CLS] embeddings include:

* **Averaging:**  The simplest approach; computationally inexpensive but prone to information loss.
* **Weighted Averaging:** Assigns weights to each embedding based on a confidence score or other criteria derived from each individual BERT output.  This addresses the issue of equal weighting in simple averaging, allowing more "confident" embeddings to contribute more to the final representation.
* **Concatenation:** Combines all embeddings into a single, larger vector.  This preserves all information but requires a larger embedding space and may introduce redundancy.  Dimensionality reduction techniques may be necessary afterward.
* **Max Pooling:**  Selects the maximum value for each dimension across all embeddings.  This approach is robust to outliers but can lose valuable information present in other embeddings.
* **Learned Aggregation:** Uses a learned function (e.g., a neural network) to combine the embeddings. This offers the greatest flexibility and potential for optimal performance but requires significantly more training data and computational resources.


The choice of aggregation method significantly impacts the final embedding's quality and consequently the performance of the downstream task.  The optimal choice depends on several factors, including the dataset characteristics, the task's complexity, and the computational resources available.  My experience suggests that simple averaging is seldom the best choice for complex tasks.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples assume `bert_outputs` is a list of PyTorch tensors, each representing the output of a BERT model, with the [CLS] embedding being the first element (index 0).

**Example 1: Simple Averaging**

```python
import torch

def average_cls_embeddings(bert_outputs):
    """Averages multiple CLS embeddings."""
    cls_embeddings = [output[0] for output in bert_outputs]
    averaged_embedding = torch.stack(cls_embeddings).mean(dim=0)
    return averaged_embedding

# Example usage
bert_outputs = [torch.randn(768), torch.randn(768), torch.randn(768)] #Example outputs
averaged_embedding = average_cls_embeddings(bert_outputs)
print(averaged_embedding.shape) # Output: torch.Size([768])
```

This example demonstrates the simplest aggregation method. Its simplicity is its strength, but its susceptibility to noise and lack of consideration for individual output quality is a significant weakness.

**Example 2: Weighted Averaging based on Confidence Scores**

```python
import torch

def weighted_average_cls_embeddings(bert_outputs, confidence_scores):
    """Weighted average of CLS embeddings based on confidence scores."""
    cls_embeddings = torch.stack([output[0] for output in bert_outputs])
    weights = torch.softmax(torch.tensor(confidence_scores), dim=0)
    weighted_embedding = torch.sum(cls_embeddings * weights.unsqueeze(1), dim=0)
    return weighted_embedding

# Example usage
bert_outputs = [torch.randn(768), torch.randn(768), torch.randn(768)]
confidence_scores = [0.8, 0.6, 0.9] #Example confidence scores
weighted_embedding = weighted_average_cls_embeddings(bert_outputs, confidence_scores)
print(weighted_embedding.shape) # Output: torch.Size([768])
```

This example introduces confidence scores (e.g., obtained from a separate classifier or through uncertainty estimation techniques) to weight the contribution of each embedding.  Higher confidence outputs have a greater influence on the final embedding.

**Example 3: Concatenation with Linear Layer for Dimensionality Reduction**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class EmbedAggregator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, bert_outputs):
        cls_embeddings = torch.cat([output[0].unsqueeze(0) for output in bert_outputs], dim=0)
        concatenated_embedding = self.linear(cls_embeddings.mean(dim=0))
        return concatenated_embedding

# Example usage
input_dim = 768 * 3 #For three BERT outputs
output_dim = 768
aggregator = EmbedAggregator(input_dim, output_dim)
bert_outputs = [torch.randn(768), torch.randn(768), torch.randn(768)]
final_embedding = aggregator(bert_outputs)
print(final_embedding.shape) # Output: torch.Size([768])
```
This code showcases concatenation, followed by a linear layer to reduce the dimensionality of the combined embedding. The linear layer learns an optimal mapping from the high-dimensional concatenated space to a lower-dimensional space, improving efficiency and potentially performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Several excellent texts on deep learning and natural language processing provide in-depth discussions of embedding techniques and aggregation strategies.  Consult resources covering sentence embeddings, BERT architectures, and ensemble methods in the context of NLP.  Furthermore, exploring research papers focused on multi-task learning and model ensembling within BERT frameworks can offer valuable insights into optimal aggregation techniques.  A thorough understanding of dimensionality reduction techniques is also beneficial when employing concatenation methods.
