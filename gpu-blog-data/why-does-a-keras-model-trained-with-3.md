A core tenet of deep learning model design, specifically within frameworks like Keras, is the immutability of input dimensions once a model’s architecture has been finalized and training commences. Attempting to feed a model trained with three input features, a four-dimensional data tensor, will invariably lead to failure due to a mismatch in expected and supplied input shapes at the layer level. This failure manifests not as a gradual decline in performance, but as an immediate, and often verbose, error.

The fundamental issue stems from the weight matrices established during training. Keras models, by design, associate specific weight parameters with each input dimension. These weights, randomly initialized and refined through backpropagation, form the learned representation of the training data. When a model is trained on data with three input features, the initial layer—often a dense or convolutional layer—establishes a weight matrix with a number of columns corresponding to these three dimensions. During the feedforward pass, the model performs matrix multiplication between the input tensor and these weights. The expected number of columns in the input tensor must match the rows or the columns of the weights, based on the transpose, for this operation to be mathematically possible and not to generate an error.

The input shape of the initial layer dictates the expected shape of subsequent layers. When a model is trained with three features, subsequent layers also adopt a structure that anticipates the output of the preceding layer, creating a coherent pathway. This pathway is a consequence of calculating error gradients and updating the weights during backpropagation. Feeding a four-feature input disrupts this architecture. The initial layer will not accept a four-feature tensor, triggering a shape mismatch error. The error arises because the matrix multiplication operation at the input layer, which forms the backbone of neural network computations, is not defined for inputs with four features when the trained weights anticipate three.

Let me illustrate this with examples, based on typical experiences I've encountered in projects.

**Example 1: Mismatch in Dense Layer Input Shape**

Consider a simple sequential Keras model with one dense layer. This example showcases a fully connected layer which accepts an input of three features.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Define a model expecting 3 inputs
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,))
])

# Generate dummy training data with 3 features
X_train_3 = np.random.rand(100, 3)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model successfully.
model.fit(X_train_3, y_train, epochs=2)

# Attempt to use the model with an input of 4 features
X_test_4 = np.random.rand(10, 4)
try:
    predictions = model.predict(X_test_4)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
```

This code segment demonstrates what happens when we attempt to use the model trained with three features and we introduce a four dimensional tensor during prediction. The `input_shape=(3,)` parameter dictates that this layer is expecting a 3-element vector for each sample. Consequently, during the predict phase, a `ValueError` is raised because the shapes of the input provided (a four feature vector) does not match that specified at the instantiation of the initial layer.

**Example 2: Convolutional Layer Input Shape (Image)**

This example demonstrates a similar issue within convolutional neural networks. I will simplify this to 1D convolution for illustrative purposes, instead of 2D, but the principle is equivalent. Consider time-series data input for example.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Model expecting a sequence of 3 channels
model = keras.Sequential([
  layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(10, 3)),
  layers.Flatten(),
  layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])


# Generate time series training data, 10 time steps, 3 channels
X_train_3 = np.random.rand(100, 10, 3)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train_3, y_train, epochs=2)

# Generate test data with 4 channels.
X_test_4 = np.random.rand(10, 10, 4)
try:
    predictions = model.predict(X_test_4)
except Exception as e:
     print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
```

In this snippet, the `Conv1D` layer is initialized with `input_shape=(10,3)`, expecting sequences of length 10 with 3 channels each. This reflects a typical scenario where the input is a feature vector at each of 10 time steps. When we present the model with sequences having four channels, the matrix multiplication during forward propagation fails, generating a shape related error.

**Example 3: Input Layer Modification Attempt**

While modifying the input layer using the code below will not generate the error, it will also not function as intended. Instead, it will result in a retraining of the model that may not reflect the weights established previously.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Model expecting 3 inputs
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,))
])


X_train_3 = np.random.rand(100, 3)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)


model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(X_train_3, y_train, epochs=2)


# Attempt to "modify" the input layer using a new input shape.
# This only creates a model with the updated input
model_modified = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,))
])

# This new model is not trained with the initial 3 feature training data, and weights
# will be different.
X_train_4 = np.random.rand(100, 4)
model_modified.fit(X_train_4, y_train, epochs=2)


#Attempting to use a different input will not cause error now, but is not what we want.
X_test_4 = np.random.rand(10, 4)
predictions = model_modified.predict(X_test_4)
```

In this final snippet, I have shown the incorrect attempt to modify the input layer. Note that instead, an entirely new model must be instantiated. The layers in the initial model will not be updated and a shape-mismatch error would still be raised, if used in tandem with the new test data, `X_test_4`.

**Recommended Resources**

For a deep understanding, one should consult standard textbooks on deep learning, focusing on the mathematical foundations of neural networks and backpropagation. Detailed documentation on Keras API is indispensable for clarifying layer parameterizations. Online resources, including interactive courses, provide practical implementations and visualizations which greatly aids the understanding of practical applications. Articles on data pre-processing are also pertinent, especially if data dimensionality needs to be changed before the model is deployed. Finally, it is always recommended to review scientific articles on the usage of specific machine learning models if complex use cases are encountered.
