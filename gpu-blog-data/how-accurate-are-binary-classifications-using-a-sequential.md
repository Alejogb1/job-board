The accuracy of binary classifications using sequential models, while theoretically capable of approaching perfect classification, is significantly influenced by the specific characteristics of the data, the architecture of the model, and the chosen training methodology. This is not a blanket statement guaranteeing success but rather a conditional assertion based on my experiences deploying such models in time-series anomaly detection. In practice, I’ve observed a wide spectrum of performance ranging from exceptionally high precision and recall to models that are practically unusable, highlighting the necessity for careful consideration during every stage of the development lifecycle.

The efficacy of a sequential model for binary classification, particularly when dealing with temporal data, stems from its ability to capture dependencies between data points. Unlike feedforward networks which treat each input independently, sequential models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTMs and GRUs or transformer-based architectures, maintain an internal state. This allows them to retain information about the past, which is critical when classifying sequences where the context preceding a specific data point is a strong predictor of its label. For instance, in fraud detection, a single transaction might be innocuous, but a sequence of similar transactions within a short timeframe could signify fraudulent behavior. A sequential model can leverage this pattern, whereas a stateless classifier would be forced to evaluate each transaction in isolation.

The accuracy of the model is, however, not inherent to the architecture alone. Several practical factors limit how effectively these dependencies are learned and utilized. The length of the sequence, for example, plays a critical role. With longer sequences, RNNs can struggle with vanishing or exploding gradients which can make it difficult to learn long-range dependencies. Transformers, through mechanisms like attention, address this issue to some degree, but even they are bounded by practical concerns, such as memory consumption and computational time.

Another crucial element impacting accuracy is the quality of the training data. Sequential models, in particular, are sensitive to class imbalances. If the training set is dominated by one class, the model can become biased toward that class, resulting in poor generalization performance on minority class samples. In the case of our anomaly detection system, where anomalous events were infrequent, simply training the model on raw historical data resulted in a model that rarely identified anomalies. To counteract this, we had to implement oversampling techniques and introduce weighted loss functions to put greater emphasis on the minority class.

Hyperparameter tuning is another area where seemingly subtle differences can have a profound impact on accuracy. The number of layers, the number of units in each layer, the learning rate, and regularization parameters such as dropout – all influence the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns. Determining the optimal combination of these values often requires iterative experimentation, a process that can be computationally expensive. Furthermore, the specific method used to split the data into training, validation, and test sets can affect how accurately the model's performance is assessed. For sequential data, conventional random splitting can lead to temporal leaks, where data from the future contaminates the training set, giving an overly optimistic picture of performance. Therefore, time-based splitting is usually preferred to maintain the temporal dependency structure of the data.

Let's consider some code examples. These examples use TensorFlow and Python. They are deliberately simplified to illustrate fundamental aspects of model definition and training, while not directly applicable to real-world scenarios.

**Example 1: Basic LSTM model with binary classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Define the model architecture
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(None, 1)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Sigmoid for binary classification
])

# Define the loss and optimizer
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Assume X_train and y_train are numpy arrays of sequences and labels
# Assume X_val and y_val are validation sequences and labels
# Data pre-processing steps would need to be performed such as scaling

# Training loop
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

```

This example shows how to set up a basic LSTM model for binary classification. The `input_shape` parameter specifies that the sequences have one feature, but the length of the sequence can vary as denoted by `None` for the time dimension. The final layer is a dense layer with a sigmoid activation which squashes the output to between 0 and 1, interpretable as a probability for the positive class. Adam is used as the optimizer and `binary_crossentropy` is the suitable loss function for the classification task. Note the comments; the data here has to be scaled and split before training, which is essential in any practical model.

**Example 2: LSTM with dropout and batch normalization**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Define the model architecture
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(None, 1), return_sequences=True),
    BatchNormalization(), # Batch normalization
    Dropout(0.2), # Dropout
    LSTM(50, activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile and train as in example 1
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

```

This example expands on the first by adding two crucial elements. Batch normalization helps stabilize training and speeds up convergence. Dropout reduces overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training. Both can improve the final generalization accuracy. `return_sequences=True` in the first LSTM layer ensures that the full sequence is available for the next layer. The two dropout layers introduce more regularization to the model, and the inclusion of batch normalization speeds up training and improves model stability.

**Example 3: Using a Transformer encoder for sequence classification**

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
# Define the Transformer Encoder Layer
class TransformerEncoder(layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, embed_dim, dense_dim, num_heads, **kwargs):
    super(TransformerEncoder, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.embed_dim = embed_dim
    self.dense_dim = dense_dim
    self.num_heads = num_heads
    self.attention = layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=embed_dim)
    self.dense_proj = keras.Sequential([layers.Dense(dense_dim, activation="relu"), layers.Dense(embed_dim),])
    self.layernorm_1 = layers.LayerNormalization()
    self.layernorm_2 = layers.LayerNormalization()
  def call(self, inputs, mask=None):
    attention_output = self.attention(query=inputs, value=inputs, key=inputs, attention_mask=mask)
    proj_input = self.layernorm_1(inputs + attention_output)
    proj_output = self.dense_proj(proj_input)
    return self.layernorm_2(proj_input + proj_output)

# Example Usage:
input_shape = (None, 10) # Assume sequences of length, with 10 features
inputs = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
x = TransformerEncoder(embed_dim=32, dense_dim=64, num_heads=4)(inputs)
x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(x) # Average across sequence for binary classification
outputs = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

#Compile and Train
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="binary_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
```

This more complex example shows the use of a single custom Transformer encoder layer. Instead of simple LSTMs, attention allows the model to weigh different parts of the sequence more effectively. The key is the attention mechanism within the Transformer encoder which will give us more accurate dependencies compared to LSTMs. A global average pooling layer reduces the dimension after applying the encoder, while a final `Dense` layer provides the probability output.

Regarding resources, I recommend exploring texts that cover the fundamentals of recurrent neural networks, including detailed explanations of LSTM and GRU architectures, with an emphasis on dealing with vanishing and exploding gradients.  A second area to explore would be the mechanics and theoretical underpinnings of the transformer architecture, with particular attention to the multi-head attention mechanism. Finally, any focused publications that delve into techniques for handling class imbalance in sequence data would be highly valuable to enhance the performance of these kinds of models.
