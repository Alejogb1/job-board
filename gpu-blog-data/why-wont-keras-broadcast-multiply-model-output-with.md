Keras, by design, operates on tensors, requiring explicit shape compatibility for element-wise operations like multiplication. The apparent failure to broadcast a batch-wide mask across the output of a model stems from a mismatch in the rank or spatial dimensions of the involved tensors. I've encountered this frequently while implementing attention mechanisms where masking specific sequence elements is essential. The issue isn't that Keras 'won't' broadcast; rather, it’s a matter of ensuring tensor shapes are aligned so that broadcasting can naturally occur under NumPy's underlying mechanics. Broadcasting, in its essence, allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays with different shapes when their dimensions are compatible.

Specifically, if the model output has a shape of `(batch_size, sequence_length, feature_dim)` and the mask is intended to apply across the entire `feature_dim` of each sequence in the batch, the mask typically needs a shape of either `(batch_size, sequence_length, 1)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length)`. A naive attempt using a mask of shape `(batch_size, 1)` won't work because it's intended to multiply the entire sequence, not each individual element within the sequence in the model output. This mismatch can result in errors, or, more subtly, an undesired application of the mask. Keras, building atop TensorFlow or other backends, generally follows similar broadcasting rules as NumPy, and this becomes clear when exploring practical examples.

The first example showcases a common scenario. Consider a recurrent neural network producing a sequence output. Let's assume the output shape is `(batch_size, sequence_length, 128)`, representing a sequence of length ‘sequence_length’ and a feature vector of 128 dimensions for each element in that sequence for each sample in the batch.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Example Model
class SimpleRNN(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, hidden_units, sequence_length):
        super(SimpleRNN, self).__init__()
        self.rnn = keras.layers.SimpleRNN(hidden_units, return_sequences=True)
        self.time_distributed = keras.layers.TimeDistributed(keras.layers.Dense(128))

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.rnn(inputs)
        x = self.time_distributed(x)
        return x

# Parameters
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 20
feature_dim = 64
hidden_units = 256

# Generate Dummy Input
inputs = tf.random.normal((batch_size, sequence_length, feature_dim))

# Instantiate the Model
model = SimpleRNN(hidden_units, sequence_length)
output = model(inputs) #Shape: (32, 20, 128)

# Incorrect Mask
mask_incorrect = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, 1))
masked_output_incorrect = output * mask_incorrect  # Produces an error due to rank mismatch

print(f"Incorrect Mask Shape: {mask_incorrect.shape}") #Shape: (32, 1)
print(f"Incorrectly Masked Output Shape: {masked_output_incorrect.shape}")
```
Here, the `mask_incorrect` tensor has the shape `(32, 1)`, intending to apply a mask across the entire `sequence_length` and `feature_dim` of the output for each sample in the batch. This operation will result in a `ValueError` because TensorFlow cannot broadcast across an entire sequence and `feature_dim` from just a `(32,1)` shape.

Now, let’s look at the correct usage. In the next example, I demonstrate how to generate a mask with a shape that facilitates proper broadcasting. Typically, for a mask intended to apply across the sequence elements of a batch, the mask’s shape needs to be either `(batch_size, sequence_length, 1)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length)`. The latter will broadcast against the output automatically if it's being used to mask specific time steps within the sequence.

```python
# Correct Mask using explicit shape for feature dimensions
mask_correct_1 = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, sequence_length, 1))
masked_output_correct_1 = output * mask_correct_1 #Shape: (32, 20, 128)

#Correct Mask which will automatically broadcast against feature dimensions if masking elements of sequences
mask_correct_2 = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, sequence_length))
masked_output_correct_2 = output * tf.expand_dims(mask_correct_2, axis=-1) # Shape:(32, 20, 128)

print(f"Correct Mask 1 Shape: {mask_correct_1.shape}") # Shape: (32, 20, 1)
print(f"Correctly Masked Output 1 Shape: {masked_output_correct_1.shape}")
print(f"Correct Mask 2 Shape: {mask_correct_2.shape}") # Shape: (32, 20)
print(f"Correctly Masked Output 2 Shape: {masked_output_correct_2.shape}")

```
The tensor `mask_correct_1` has the shape `(32, 20, 1)` which is broadcast against the output tensor of shape `(32, 20, 128)` during the element wise multiplication. `mask_correct_2` of shape `(32, 20)` can mask a sequence’s elements. When used with `tf.expand_dims(mask_correct_2, axis=-1)`, its dimension becomes `(32, 20, 1)` which results in the same correct broadcast multiplication. The key takeaway is to make sure the mask dimension match the dimensions you intend to apply the mask to with trailing dimensions of size 1, enabling broadcasting.

Finally, consider a scenario where a global mask applies to the entire output tensor. In this case, a mask with the shape `(batch_size, 1, 1)` or, even more simply, `(batch_size,1)` can be used. The batch-wide mask will broadcast against the sequence and feature dimensions to mask the entire output. Note, it can be of shape `(batch_size, 1)` if `tf.expand_dims(mask,axis=[1,2])` is used or `(batch_size,1,1)` if not.

```python
#Correct Mask for global operation
mask_global = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, 1, 1))
masked_output_global = output * mask_global #Shape: (32, 20, 128)
print(f"Global Mask Shape: {mask_global.shape}")
print(f"Globally Masked Output Shape: {masked_output_global.shape}")

mask_global_2 = tf.random.uniform((batch_size,1))
masked_output_global_2 = output * tf.expand_dims(tf.expand_dims(mask_global_2,axis=1),axis=1)
print(f"Global Mask 2 Shape: {mask_global_2.shape}")
print(f"Globally Masked Output 2 Shape: {masked_output_global_2.shape}")
```

Here the mask `mask_global` of shape `(32,1,1)` is applied to the entire output via broadcasting. Similarly `mask_global_2` with the shape of `(32,1)` is expanded to shape `(32,1,1)` via `tf.expand_dims` before broadcasting against the output tensor.

In summary, the problem is not that Keras won’t broadcast, rather that the shapes of the mask tensor and the model output are incompatible. Understanding broadcasting rules is essential for applying masking operations correctly. It's vital to ensure that the mask's dimensions either match the output or have a trailing dimension equal to 1 for the intended masking operation. Correct mask shapes of `(batch_size, sequence_length, 1)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length)` are necessary for masking sequence elements. A shape of `(batch_size, 1, 1)` or `(batch_size, 1)` is used when applying global masks to an entire sequence batch. Incorrect mask shapes such as `(batch_size, 1)` will result in errors when a sequence-wide mask is required.

For further study, I recommend reviewing the TensorFlow documentation on tensor broadcasting and axis manipulation, specifically concerning tf.expand_dims. Furthermore, examining the Keras documentation on custom layers and training loops can provide additional clarity. These resources, combined with practical experimentation, are invaluable for effectively working with masks and tensor operations in Keras.
