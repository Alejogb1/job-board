The sigmoid activation function, while historically significant and conceptually simple, exhibits notable precision limitations in TensorFlow/Keras 2.3.1, particularly when dealing with large negative or positive inputs, often leading to saturation. These saturation issues fundamentally stem from the function's asymptotic behavior, where its output approaches 0 or 1 very rapidly as input magnitudes increase. This behavior, when combined with floating-point representation limits, can dramatically impact backpropagation and overall model performance.

Specifically, the sigmoid function is mathematically defined as:

σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))

The exponential term, e^(-x), dictates the behavior of the function. When 'x' is a large positive value, e^(-x) approaches zero, and σ(x) tends toward 1. Conversely, when 'x' is a large negative value, e^(-x) becomes very large, causing the denominator to be dominated by it, and σ(x) approaches zero. The issue lies in how these limits are approached by floating-point representation in computer systems. In TensorFlow/Keras 2.3.1, like in many systems, single-precision floating-point numbers (32-bit) are commonly employed for calculations. These numbers can only represent a limited range of values with a finite precision.

When the input 'x' becomes sufficiently large (both positive or negative), the intermediate calculation of e^(-x) or (1 + e^(-x)) can reach the limits of representable values in a 32-bit float. The resultant output of the sigmoid function, even before the division operation, can be rounded to 1.0 or 0.0 in the floating point format due to lack of the necessary bits. This introduces a phenomenon known as 'saturation'. Once an output saturates at 0 or 1, the derivative of the sigmoid function, used in backpropagation, becomes extremely small. The derivative is given by σ(x) * (1 - σ(x)). When σ(x) is 0 or 1, this gradient becomes almost zero, effectively stopping the flow of gradient signal from a layer to a previous one. This is known as the vanishing gradient problem, leading to poor learning. It severely impacts models that are deep, or have large input values. I’ve repeatedly observed that such model failures, due to sigmoid’s saturation, often surface when processing raw numerical input features without adequate normalization.

To further illustrate the saturation problem, consider a scenario with a neural network layer using the sigmoid activation function. Let's examine a few code examples using TensorFlow/Keras 2.3.1 and the underlying NumPy library. It is important to note that even though the Keras API is being used the underlying calculations are based on TensorFlow numerical precision.

**Example 1: Illustration of Saturation with a Large Positive Input**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Create a large positive input
large_positive_input = np.array([100.0], dtype=np.float32)

# Calculate sigmoid using numpy
numpy_sigmoid_output = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-large_positive_input))
print(f"NumPy Sigmoid Output: {numpy_sigmoid_output}")

# Create a Keras layer with sigmoid activation
sigmoid_layer = keras.layers.Activation('sigmoid')

# Calculate sigmoid using Keras
keras_sigmoid_output = sigmoid_layer(tf.convert_to_tensor(large_positive_input)).numpy()
print(f"Keras Sigmoid Output: {keras_sigmoid_output}")
```

In this example, we define a very large positive input. As you'll see, both NumPy and TensorFlow (Keras using the TensorFlow backend)  will compute a value that is essentially 1.0 due to the saturation of the sigmoid function. This demonstrates that even for a large but singular input the function saturates.

**Example 2: Illustration of Saturation with a Large Negative Input**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Create a large negative input
large_negative_input = np.array([-100.0], dtype=np.float32)

# Calculate sigmoid using numpy
numpy_sigmoid_output = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-large_negative_input))
print(f"NumPy Sigmoid Output: {numpy_sigmoid_output}")

# Create a Keras layer with sigmoid activation
sigmoid_layer = keras.layers.Activation('sigmoid')

# Calculate sigmoid using Keras
keras_sigmoid_output = sigmoid_layer(tf.convert_to_tensor(large_negative_input)).numpy()
print(f"Keras Sigmoid Output: {keras_sigmoid_output}")
```

Similar to Example 1, but with a large negative input. The output from both NumPy and Keras will be virtually 0, again demonstrating the saturation. This highlights that irrespective of the sign of the input, as its magnitude becomes large, the sigmoid function is pushed to its extreme limits and saturates. The fundamental problem lies in the finite representation of real numbers in floating point formats.

**Example 3: Impact of Saturation on Derivative**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Create a large positive input
large_positive_input = tf.constant([100.0], dtype=tf.float32)

# Create a Keras layer with sigmoid activation
sigmoid_layer = keras.layers.Activation('sigmoid')

# Calculate output and compute its gradient
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch(large_positive_input)
  output = sigmoid_layer(large_positive_input)
gradients = tape.gradient(output, large_positive_input)

print(f"Sigmoid Output: {output.numpy()}")
print(f"Gradient of Output w.r.t Input: {gradients.numpy()}")


# Create a large negative input
large_negative_input = tf.constant([-100.0], dtype=tf.float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch(large_negative_input)
  output = sigmoid_layer(large_negative_input)
gradients = tape.gradient(output, large_negative_input)

print(f"Sigmoid Output: {output.numpy()}")
print(f"Gradient of Output w.r.t Input: {gradients.numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates the impact of saturation on the gradient calculation, which is essential for backpropagation. Here we use TensorFlow’s automatic gradient calculation mechanism.  The resulting gradient will be extremely small for both large positive and negative inputs, meaning the updates propagated through this layer will be minuscule. In my experience this is the crux of the performance issue because a small update will barely impact the underlying weights.

In conclusion, the precision issues inherent in using the sigmoid activation function within TensorFlow/Keras 2.3.1, particularly the tendency to saturate for large input values, can significantly impede the training process of neural networks by causing vanishing gradients. These issues stem from fundamental limitations in floating-point representation and the asymptotic nature of the sigmoid function. When deploying models, it's crucial to consider these limitations, specifically while preprocessing data, where large variations in raw features can easily trigger sigmoid saturation and the associated gradient issues. The sigmoid function remains useful for outputs that require a binary representation, however, given the saturation issues alternatives should be strongly considered for internal hidden layers.

To gain a more in-depth understanding and find alternative activation functions, several resources are available. I recommend focusing on literature pertaining to numerical analysis of neural network activations,  along with works focusing on gradient behavior in deep learning. Consider academic publications from major machine learning conferences which focus on practical performance analysis. Finally, investigating the design decisions behind popular alternatives such as ReLU or Leaky ReLU is advisable. Understanding these approaches provides context on how such functions effectively avoid saturation and the vanishing gradient problems.
