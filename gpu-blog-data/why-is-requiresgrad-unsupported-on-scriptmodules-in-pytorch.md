The `requires_grad_` method is intentionally disabled on `ScriptModule` instances in PyTorch because it directly conflicts with the core design principles of TorchScript, a static, ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation framework. Specifically, TorchScript optimizes a computation graph for inference, assuming a fixed, differentiable structure. Introducing mutable attributes that alter gradient tracking during the module’s lifecycle undermines the very foundations of this optimization process. I've spent a significant amount of time dealing with issues arising from trying to mix eager-mode behaviors with traced or scripted models, and this particular restriction is a vital lesson learned.

The underlying issue stems from the different modes of operation within PyTorch: eager execution and TorchScript. In eager mode, computations are performed immediately, allowing for dynamic graph construction. This flexibility permits modifying attributes like `requires_grad` during runtime. However, TorchScript, used for deployment and enhanced performance, requires a static representation of the computation graph. It translates PyTorch code into an Intermediate Representation (IR), which is then optimized and compiled. The gradient tracking mechanism, which hinges on dynamically setting the `requires_grad` flag on tensors, is not compatible with the static nature of this IR.  `requires_grad_` being mutable on a ScriptModule implies the compiled graph could change during runtime which violates the core principle of static representation used in the TorchScript.

Essentially, TorchScript strives for predictability and determinism. When a ScriptModule is created, TorchScript traces or compiles the model, fixing the backward pass (i.e., gradient computation) based on the initial `requires_grad` attributes of its constituent tensors. Allowing subsequent modifications to the `requires_grad` flag through `requires_grad_` would invalidate the pre-computed backward pass, leading to incorrect gradient calculations, and render the compiled graph unreliable.

Consider this more concretely with a few examples to illustrate why `requires_grad_` is problematic.

**Example 1: Basic ScriptModule with a Linear Layer**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)


# Create a ScriptModule
scripted_module = torch.jit.script(MyModule())

# The following would throw an error.
# scripted_module.linear.weight.requires_grad_(False)

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
output = scripted_module(input_tensor)
# Trying to change requires_grad here won't work.
# print(output.requires_grad) # it'll be True if all original weights had grad, False otherwise


print("Scripted module weights require gradient:")
for param in scripted_module.parameters():
    print(param.requires_grad)

```

In this example, I've attempted to directly alter the `requires_grad` attribute of the weight tensor within a `ScriptModule` using `requires_grad_(False)`. This operation will trigger an error because TorchScript assumes the computation graph is immutable after being created. Even attempting to inspect `output.requires_grad` at a later time is not a valid way to determine which parameters require a gradient; the gradients are calculated in a pre-defined way, based on how they were set up *before* the scripting. The example illustrates that modifications to `requires_grad` post-scripting are explicitly prevented. The print loop further confirms that the weights are pre-defined to allow or not allow a gradient from the script execution point.

**Example 2: Attempting to Create a Script Function and modify `requires_grad`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.jit import script, Final

class ExampleModule(nn.Module):
    __constants__ = ["activation_param"]

    def __init__(self, activation_param: Final[float] = 2.0):
      super().__init__()
      self.activation_param = activation_param
      self.weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1))

    def forward(self, x:torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return torch.pow(x*self.weight, self.activation_param)

@script
def my_func(mod: ExampleModule, x:torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # The following would be illegal because it attempts to modify
    # a tracked parameter in a scripted setting.
    # mod.weight.requires_grad_(False)

    return mod(x)

model = ExampleModule()
input_tensor = torch.rand(1, dtype=torch.float)

result = my_func(model, input_tensor)

# Attempting to change requires_grad outside the traced portion will also fail to affect the gradient calculation
# It only impacts whether or not autograd tracks the value of the output.
# model.weight.requires_grad_(False) # Does not affect the computation path
# print(result.requires_grad) # will be True because the weight is True before scripting

print("Module weight requires gradient:")
print(model.weight.requires_grad)
```
This example extends the issue into a `torch.jit.script` function and a module. The scripted function `my_func` uses an `ExampleModule`, which attempts to modify the  `requires_grad` attribute. This operation is disallowed within the context of the scripted function. The commented-out lines demonstrate illegal operations within the scope of the function. Modification of `requires_grad` after script creation fails to influence the gradient calculation, further highlighting that the graph's structure is frozen at scripting time. The modification after the call simply impacts if autograd tracks the calculation's value, and not how the actual computational graph is set up.

**Example 3: Conditional Gradient Computation (Illustrative)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ConditionalModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(5, 2)
        self.use_gradient = False # a flag for illustrative purposes

    def forward(self, x):
         if self.use_gradient:
             return self.linear(x)
         else:
            return x * 2

# This *would* work in eager mode, but we wouldn't be able to script it
#  We would want to use `torch.jit.annotate`

# The following is not valid in a ScriptModule because it requires conditional gradients
# scripted_conditional = torch.jit.script(ConditionalModule())
# scripted_conditional.use_gradient = True
# input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 5)
# output = scripted_conditional(input_tensor)
# if output.requires_grad:
#     print("Output has a gradient, even though computation could have been a straight multiply")
# else:
#     print("Output has no gradient.")


class ConditionalModuleFixed(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x, use_gradient:bool):
         if use_gradient:
             return self.linear(x)
         else:
            return x * 2

scripted_conditional_fixed = torch.jit.script(ConditionalModuleFixed())

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 5)

output_grad = scripted_conditional_fixed(input_tensor, True)
output_nograd = scripted_conditional_fixed(input_tensor, False)

print("Output with gradient required:", output_grad.requires_grad)
print("Output with no gradient:", output_nograd.requires_grad)


```

This illustrative example aims to demonstrate the challenge of conditional gradient computation that would make `requires_grad_` difficult to support. The original `ConditionalModule` uses a boolean flag to change the computation, potentially impacting gradient calculation. This type of control flow creates difficulties because the tracing can only capture one of the two potential paths. The corrected `ConditionalModuleFixed`  shows one way to solve this via explicitly passing the control flow as an argument to the traced code.  This avoids the need to modify `requires_grad` at runtime. The fixed approach makes gradient tracking predictable and compatible with the static nature of TorchScript.

In summary, the core reason `requires_grad_` is unsupported in `ScriptModule` is to maintain the integrity of the pre-compiled computation graph that TorchScript requires. Attempting to modify the gradient tracking behavior of a scripted module post-creation violates the static optimization assumptions of TorchScript. This principle is fundamental to the performance gains TorchScript provides, albeit with constraints on dynamic modifications. In instances where such dynamic modifications are required, using either `torch.jit.annotate` for control flow and data structures, or sticking with eager mode operation are recommended.

For additional study on this and related topics, consult the official PyTorch documentation which provides comprehensive information on `torch.jit` and its intricacies, or consult a book such as “Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning” by Ian Pointer.  Additionally, consider researching best practices for TorchScript deployment and common pitfalls for static graph compilation. These resources will give more insights into why this restriction is in place and its implications for model development.
