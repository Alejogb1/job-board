The reliability of the `on_epoch_end` callback in Keras, or any training loop, often hinges on a nuanced understanding of how the training process and associated infrastructure are structured. I've encountered many seemingly intractable issues with this specific callback over the years while building complex, distributed training pipelines for large language models and image classification tasks; the behavior is not always deterministic as might be expected from surface-level documentation.

At the core of the issue is the asynchronous nature of training and the various points at which a training process might be interrupted or terminated. The `on_epoch_end` callback is, in theory, invoked *after* a complete iteration through the training dataset (an epoch) and before the next epoch begins. However, several conditions can prevent or disrupt its execution. The most frequent causes I’ve seen relate to premature termination, error handling within the training loop, and how data loading interacts with the callback.

Firstly, abrupt terminations due to user-initiated stops, system errors (like out-of-memory exceptions), or node failures in distributed environments can prevent the `on_epoch_end` callback from running. The training loop may be terminated before it completes the current epoch or even begins to execute the callback after finishing the current batch. This occurs especially when leveraging frameworks that rely on process pools and where clean shutdown handling is not properly implemented. In such cases, the callback does not trigger because the termination process bypasses the normal execution flow. This frequently occurs when using tools like `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`.

Secondly, exceptions thrown during the training process within a single epoch can also halt execution before reaching the end-of-epoch callback. If an exception is not handled within the loop or using a try-except block that correctly allows `on_epoch_end` to execute within its scope, the callback will simply not be invoked. I have seen cases where faulty custom loss functions or improperly formatted data result in exceptions that stop the training before callback invocation. These kinds of issues are particularly vexing when using customized data generators, where unexpected data formats or dimensions can cause runtime errors.

Thirdly, the interaction between data loading and training loop control flow can be subtle and problematic. For instance, if the data loader, particularly if it is generator-based, does not correctly signal end-of-data, it can lead to issues within the loop, creating a deadlock or premature exit that bypasses the intended callback. This is especially relevant when working with large datasets where the whole dataset is not loaded into memory at once.

To ensure reliability of `on_epoch_end`, several key strategies are useful. Comprehensive error handling, disciplined data handling, and ensuring that training loops exit as expected are all essential.

Consider the following code snippets, which illustrate common situations.

**Example 1: Basic Callback Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, log_file):
        super().__init__()
        self.log_file = log_file
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        with open(self.log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"Epoch {epoch + 1} end, loss: {logs['loss'] if logs else 'N/A'}\n")

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
dummy_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1000, 784))
dummy_labels = tf.random.normal(shape=(1000, 1))

log_file = "training_log.txt"
callbacks = [MyCallback(log_file)]
try:
    model.fit(dummy_data, dummy_labels, epochs=3, callbacks=callbacks, batch_size=32)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Training failed with exception: {e}")
```
This is the most basic implementation. It's assumed that `model.fit` will execute correctly without any runtime errors. Here, we are creating a simple model and feeding random data. We utilize the callback `MyCallback` to log the loss after every epoch. However, this will not function correctly if we were to intentionally throw an exception, or if `model.fit` encounters some unexpected error.

**Example 2: Error Handling within Training**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, log_file):
        super().__init__()
        self.log_file = log_file
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        with open(self.log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"Epoch {epoch + 1} end, loss: {logs['loss'] if logs else 'N/A'}\n")
            f.flush()

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
dummy_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1000, 784))
dummy_labels = tf.random.normal(shape=(1000, 1))
faulty_labels = tf.random.normal(shape=(1000,2))

log_file = "training_log.txt"
callbacks = [MyCallback(log_file)]
try:
    model.fit(dummy_data, dummy_labels, epochs=1, callbacks=callbacks, batch_size=32)
    try:
        model.fit(dummy_data, faulty_labels, epochs=1, callbacks=callbacks, batch_size=32) #Throws exception as labels do not conform to expected shape.
    except Exception as e:
         print(f"Inner Training failed with exception: {e}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Outer Training failed with exception: {e}")
```

This example introduces an intentional error by using a malformed label tensor. Because the error occurs within the inner `model.fit`, the outer exception handler doesn’t prevent the first successful fit from executing as intended and reaching `on_epoch_end`. Critically, even though an exception is raised by the inner model fitting attempt, the exception is caught and does not completely terminate the outer training process. If we did not wrap the inner fit call in a `try`-`except` block the program would stop before even executing the `on_epoch_end` callback of the first epoch. This example showcases the need for robust and thorough error handling.

**Example 3: Data Loading Issues**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class MyCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, log_file):
        super().__init__()
        self.log_file = log_file
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        with open(self.log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"Epoch {epoch + 1} end, loss: {logs['loss'] if logs else 'N/A'}\n")


class FaultyDataGenerator(tf.keras.utils.Sequence):
    def __init__(self, data_size, batch_size):
        self.data_size = data_size
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.index = 0

    def __len__(self):
      return self.data_size // self.batch_size

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        #Incorrectly returns different shape data after a few batches.
        if idx < 3:
          return tf.random.normal(shape=(self.batch_size, 784)), tf.random.normal(shape=(self.batch_size, 1))
        else:
          return tf.random.normal(shape=(self.batch_size, 784)), tf.random.normal(shape=(self.batch_size, 2))


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

log_file = "training_log.txt"
callbacks = [MyCallback(log_file)]

try:
  generator = FaultyDataGenerator(data_size=1000, batch_size=32)
  model.fit(generator, epochs=2, callbacks=callbacks)
except Exception as e:
   print(f"Training failed with exception: {e}")

```
This example demonstrates how a custom data generator can cause issues with the `on_epoch_end` callback. The `FaultyDataGenerator` class returns data with an incorrect shape after a few batches, leading to a runtime exception during training. If we did not include the outer try block, this error would have prematurely terminated the execution before triggering the end-of-epoch callback. A more robust data generator, should include checks to ensure data consistency during each batch.  This illustrates how an improperly implemented generator can disrupt training loop execution and prevent callback invocation.

For those encountering persistent issues with `on_epoch_end` reliability, reviewing detailed documentation within the Keras and TensorFlow source code is invaluable; pay particular attention to how the training loop is implemented at the low level. It's useful to trace the execution steps within your training code and identify where the errors occur. Deep diving into the Keras or TensorFlow source code can be incredibly helpful for understanding the intricacies of their training loop logic. Additionally, engaging with forums and communities dedicated to Keras and TensorFlow can provide insights from other developers who have faced similar challenges. Consider utilizing debugging techniques, such as setting breakpoints within the relevant parts of Keras source code or the training loop, to understand when and where the `on_epoch_end` call is made or circumvented. Thorough unit testing of custom callbacks and data loading logic should also be considered when deploying mission-critical training pipelines. Examining the implementation of similar callbacks and their usage within open-source machine learning projects, such as those in `tensorflow/models` or other similar GitHub repositories can often reveal best practices in the wild.
