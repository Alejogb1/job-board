The decision between CUDA and FPGA for specialized 3D graphics computation hinges primarily on the granularity of parallelism required and the flexibility needed for algorithmic evolution. My experience optimizing rendering pipelines for real-time simulations has shown that while both offer substantial acceleration over CPUs, their strengths cater to different computational patterns. CUDA, with its GPU-centric architecture, excels at data-parallel problems where the same instruction sequence is applied to numerous data points simultaneously. In contrast, FPGAs, leveraging reconfigurable logic, are ideal for algorithms with less regular, more fine-grained parallelism or those requiring custom data paths.

CUDA, leveraging the power of NVIDIA GPUs, provides a development environment that is relatively straightforward to utilize, especially with readily available libraries like OptiX for ray tracing and various shader languages for rasterization. GPUs are designed to execute the same instruction across thousands of threads, making them a natural fit for pixel processing and vertex transformation, which often involve large datasets where each element can be computed independently. Consider the task of rendering a triangle mesh: each vertex can be transformed, and each pixel can be colored concurrently without significant inter-dependency.

However, the inherent limitations of CUDA reside in its fixed architecture. GPUs are optimized for a specific set of operations, and modifying the hardware behavior is fundamentally impossible. While the programming model is flexible within these constraints, any significant departure from this mold, for example, implementing highly specialized data structures or algorithms with irregular data access patterns, will suffer significant performance penalties. Consequently, developing a specific algorithm with highly specialized, dynamic, computational paths could require significant effort and is not guaranteed to match the performance offered by a custom implementation.

On the other hand, FPGAs offer the capability to implement custom hardware tailored to the specific requirements of the 3D graphics computation. By synthesizing logic directly into the FPGA's reconfigurable fabric, one can construct dedicated processing elements optimized for any unique operation and fine-tune data access patterns. If we needed, for instance, an extremely fast bounding volume hierarchy traversal, an optimized design for that process can be synthesized with custom control logic. This capability to implement custom hardware, optimized to the specifics of the problem, constitutes their principal advantage, particularly when performance constraints demand maximum throughput for non-conventional algorithms.

The development process with FPGAs, however, is considerably more involved. It requires a deep understanding of hardware design, using languages like VHDL or Verilog, along with specialized tools for hardware synthesis and verification. The learning curve is steeper, and the overall design process tends to be significantly more complex and lengthy than with CUDA. This complexity stems from the need to explicitly manage data paths, timing, and memory access at a much lower level of abstraction. This level of control also grants the performance edge where CUDA implementations would be forced to compromise.

To illustrate these differences, let’s consider a few practical examples.

**Example 1: Vertex Shader Processing**

```c++
// CUDA C++ Kernel for vertex transformation
__global__ void vertexShaderKernel(float* vertices, float* transformedVertices, float* transformationMatrix) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; // Unique ID for the vertex
    float4 originalVertex = make_float4(vertices[i*3], vertices[i*3+1], vertices[i*3+2], 1.0f); // Load Vertex
    float4 transformedVertex = make_float4(0, 0, 0, 0);
    for(int r = 0; r<4; r++)
    {
        for(int c = 0; c<4; c++)
        {
            transformedVertex.x += originalVertex.x * transformationMatrix[r*4];
            transformedVertex.y += originalVertex.y * transformationMatrix[r*4+1];
            transformedVertex.z += originalVertex.z * transformationMatrix[r*4+2];
            transformedVertex.w += originalVertex.w * transformationMatrix[r*4+3];
        }
    }
    
    transformedVertices[i*3] = transformedVertex.x;
    transformedVertices[i*3+1] = transformedVertex.y;
    transformedVertices[i*3+2] = transformedVertex.z; // Write the transformed vertex
}
```

This CUDA kernel demonstrates a straightforward approach: each thread handles the transformation of a single vertex through matrix multiplication. The computation is highly parallelizable, and the GPU is perfectly suited for executing this code efficiently, utilizing hundreds or thousands of cores concurrently to transform massive vertex sets.

**Example 2: Custom Fragment Shader on FPGA**

```vhdl
-- VHDL module for a simple fragment shader with a non-standard function
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity fragment_shader is
    Port ( clk  : in  std_logic;
           reset : in std_logic;
           texCoord : in  std_logic_vector(15 downto 0); -- Texture coordinates
           colorOut : out std_logic_vector(23 downto 0));-- Output Color
end entity fragment_shader;

architecture behavioral of fragment_shader is
    signal internalColor : std_logic_vector(23 downto 0) := (others => '0');
    
    function custom_func (tex_coord : std_logic_vector(15 downto 0)) return std_logic_vector is
        variable result : std_logic_vector (23 downto 0);
    begin
        result := std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(to_integer(unsigned(tex_coord)) * 3 ,24));
        return result;
    end function custom_func;

begin
    process(clk, reset)
    begin
        if reset = '1' then
            internalColor <= (others => '0');
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
             internalColor <= custom_func(texCoord);
        end if;
        colorOut <= internalColor;
    end process;

end architecture behavioral;
```
This VHDL code implements a customized fragment shader logic using a clock-based design. A custom function, `custom_func`, is defined to perform a specialized texture-coordinate manipulation. This is a simple example, but it highlights the flexibility: the specific function can be adjusted to perform very specialized operations not typically available through standard shader hardware.  The custom logic is synthesized to perform this operation on every clock cycle on the hardware; achieving high performance by dedicating resources to a bespoke task.

**Example 3: Dynamic Object Culling**

```c++
// CUDA C++ kernel for object culling
__global__ void objectCullingKernel(AABB* boundingBoxes, bool* visibilityFlags, float4 frustumPlanes[], int numObjects) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (i >= numObjects) return; //Ensure not exceeding object bounds.
    AABB box = boundingBoxes[i];
    bool isVisible = true;

    for(int p=0; p < 6; p++)
    {
        float planeNormalX = frustumPlanes[p].x;
        float planeNormalY = frustumPlanes[p].y;
        float planeNormalZ = frustumPlanes[p].z;
        float planeDistance = frustumPlanes[p].w;

        float dmin = planeNormalX * box.minX + planeNormalY * box.minY + planeNormalZ * box.minZ;
        float dmax = planeNormalX * box.maxX + planeNormalY * box.maxY + planeNormalZ * box.maxZ;

        if(dmax < -planeDistance)
        {
            isVisible = false;
            break;
        }
    }
    visibilityFlags[i] = isVisible;
}
```

This kernel implements frustum culling, a process that determines if objects within a scene are inside the camera view. Each object bounding box is tested against the view frustum planes concurrently. The operation benefits from the data-parallelism available on CUDA; allowing a high object count to be rapidly culled. While feasible, this operation may not be performed as optimally on FPGA without carefully managing inter-object dependencies, making CUDA the preferable choice here.

In summary, CUDA is the appropriate choice when computations are highly regular and parallelizable with a relatively well-defined structure. The development environment is accessible, and performance can be very high with suitable algorithms. FPGAs, however, are best selected when maximum performance is required through customized computational logic, and the computational algorithm deviates significantly from that of a regular process. They allow for tailored hardware implementations, making them ideal for performance critical applications with bespoke processing needs. It is advisable to consider the algorithmic requirements and the desired level of performance before making this decision.

For further exploration of the trade-offs of these platforms, I recommend studying resources focusing on GPU architecture (such as those available from NVIDIA’s developer program), high-level synthesis tools (such as Vivado HLS or Intel oneAPI), and digital circuit design. Understanding the foundational capabilities of each platform’s hardware will clarify which is most suitable for a given type of computation. Examining practical case studies, particularly in areas such as real-time rendering and high-performance computing, is essential when determining which is the more effective solution.
