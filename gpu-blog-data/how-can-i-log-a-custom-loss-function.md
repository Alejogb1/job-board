In TensorFlow, custom loss functions often require specific logging beyond the default metrics provided during training. Tracking the behavior of such functions is critical for debugging, understanding model performance, and informing adjustments to hyperparameters. I’ve encountered scenarios where relying solely on aggregated loss values obscured granular issues, leading me to develop robust logging strategies. The key lies in leveraging TensorFlow’s capabilities to capture and visualize scalar values generated within the custom loss calculation.

Essentially, logging a custom loss function involves two fundamental steps: calculating the specific metrics you want to track *within* the function, and then making these metrics available to TensorFlow’s logging infrastructure during training. This can’t be accomplished simply by returning extra values from the loss function; those will be interpreted as part of the overall loss for backpropagation. Instead, we utilize `tf.summary` functionalities, specifically `tf.summary.scalar`, to register values for monitoring. I've found this approach provides a seamless integration with TensorBoard and other TensorFlow logging tools.

The first step involves creating the custom loss function, taking into account its intended use and metrics you'll want to log. Typically, loss functions are defined to accept two arguments: `y_true` and `y_pred`, representing ground truth and predicted values, respectively. Within this function, compute not only the overall loss, but also any internal metrics that might be valuable. For instance, consider a loss that penalizes outliers more heavily; you might want to log the number of data points considered outliers. This is done by using `tf.summary.scalar` inside a `tf.function` and within a context managed by the `tf.name_scope` function.

Here’s an example of a custom loss function which implements a Huber loss that logs the number of points beyond a delta threshold:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def custom_huber_loss(y_true, y_pred, delta=1.0):
  with tf.name_scope('huber_loss_logging'):
    abs_diff = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
    less_than_delta = tf.cast(abs_diff < delta, tf.float32)
    greater_than_delta = 1.0 - less_than_delta
    loss = less_than_delta * 0.5 * tf.square(abs_diff) + \
           greater_than_delta * delta * (abs_diff - 0.5 * delta)
    
    outlier_count = tf.reduce_sum(greater_than_delta)
    tf.summary.scalar('outlier_count', outlier_count)
    
    average_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss)
    tf.summary.scalar('average_huber_loss', average_loss)


  return average_loss
```

In this code, the `custom_huber_loss` function calculates the standard Huber loss.  Additionally, it computes `outlier_count`, representing the number of samples where the absolute difference exceeds the `delta` parameter. Crucially, I employ `tf.summary.scalar` to log this `outlier_count` along with the average Huber loss itself under a dedicated name scope. The `tf.name_scope` context ensures the logged metrics are grouped correctly in TensorBoard and facilitates a structured organization of the scalar values. This is crucial when using multiple custom metrics. The returned value of the function is the average Huber Loss used for backpropagation.

The second example showcases how to integrate this custom loss within a training loop using `tf.GradientTape` and a simple Keras model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple Keras model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Create a summary writer for logging
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs')

@tf.function
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = custom_huber_loss(y, y_pred)  # Apply custom loss
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

# Generate dummy data
x_train = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 1))
y_train = 2 * x_train + tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 1), stddev=0.5)

# Training loop
epochs = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
    with summary_writer.as_default():
        loss = train_step(x_train, y_train)
        tf.summary.scalar('epoch_loss', loss, step=epoch) #Log the overall loss as well
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy():.4f}')
```

Here, I’ve defined a rudimentary linear model and a training loop that utilizes our `custom_huber_loss`. Notably, within the `train_step` function, the custom loss is applied and used for the gradient calculation. Before the step is returned and before logging to TensorBoard at each epoch I open the file writer scope. I use `summary_writer.as_default` to route the scalar values created within the `custom_huber_loss` function to our summary writer. This step is essential to view logged information in TensorBoard. Additionally, I included the overall loss for the epoch as well. I have found that maintaining a clear separation of the total loss and internal values provides a thorough visualization of the system.

Finally, here's an example of logging values from a more complex custom loss that takes into consideration multiple outputs from the model. This time a model with two outputs is created, which are then logged in the custom loss function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple Keras model with 2 outputs
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, input_shape=(1,))
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Create a summary writer for logging
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs_complex')

@tf.function
def custom_complex_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  with tf.name_scope('complex_loss_logging'):
    output_1 = y_pred[:,0]
    output_2 = y_pred[:,1]

    loss_1 = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true-output_1))
    loss_2 = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true-output_2))

    total_loss = loss_1 + loss_2
    tf.summary.scalar('loss_output_1', loss_1)
    tf.summary.scalar('loss_output_2', loss_2)
    tf.summary.scalar('total_complex_loss',total_loss)
  return total_loss


@tf.function
def train_step_complex(x, y):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = custom_complex_loss(y,y_pred)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  return loss

# Generate dummy data
x_train = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 1))
y_train = 2 * x_train + tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 1), stddev=0.5)

# Training loop
epochs = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
    with summary_writer.as_default():
        loss = train_step_complex(x_train, y_train)
        tf.summary.scalar('epoch_complex_loss', loss, step=epoch)
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy():.4f}')

```

This final example mirrors the previous implementation but instead calculates the loss on two outputs generated by the model and individually logs each of those values. It demonstrates how to expand the previous approach to a slightly more complex scenario. It is again important to use a file writer and write within that scope.

In practice, you will want to view your logs using TensorBoard. To do this first start your tensorboard instance via the command line `tensorboard --logdir logs` if you used `logs` as the log directory. You can then access your log information in a web browser by navigating to the corresponding address, for example: http://localhost:6006/. Here you will be able to observe the scalar data logged by our custom loss functions.

For further exploration, the official TensorFlow documentation provides detailed information about `tf.summary` and `tf.GradientTape`. The TensorFlow tutorials on writing custom layers and models provide practical applications of these techniques. I also recommend delving into research papers focusing on loss function design, as this often highlights the need for specific logging for insightful analysis.
