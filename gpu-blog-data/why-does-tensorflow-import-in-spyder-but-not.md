TensorFlow's disparate behavior across Spyder and Jupyter Notebook environments often stems from inconsistencies in Python environment management and, specifically, the handling of virtual environments.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous projects, particularly those involving large-scale image processing and deep learning models, points to several potential root causes, all related to the distinct ways these IDEs manage their Python interpreters.

1. **Conflicting Python Installations and Virtual Environments:**  This is the most common culprit.  Spyder, depending on its installation method and system configuration, may be using a system-wide Python installation or a dedicated environment.  Conversely, Jupyter Notebook often relies on the kernel specified in the notebook's metadata, which may be pointing to a different Python installation or virtual environment altogether.  If these environments are not properly configured or contain differing TensorFlow versions or dependencies, import failures will occur in one or the other.

2. **Incorrect Kernel Selection in Jupyter Notebook:**  Jupyter Notebook allows the selection of different kernels (essentially, different Python interpreters). If the selected kernel within the notebook does not have TensorFlow installed, the import will fail.  This is particularly pertinent when working with multiple projects, each relying on a separate virtual environment.  Careless kernel selection is a frequent source of frustration.

3. **Missing Dependencies:** While less likely if the import works within Spyder, the possibility of missing or incompatible dependencies within the Jupyter Notebook environment cannot be dismissed. TensorFlow has extensive requirements, and a mismatch in versions between these dependencies (NumPy, CUDA, cuDNN, etc.) can lead to import errors.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Verifying TensorFlow Installation Within the Environment**

```python
import sys
import tensorflow as tf

print("Python version:", sys.version)
print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
print("TensorFlow location:", tf.__file__)
```

This simple code snippet provides crucial diagnostic information. The `sys.version` line reveals the Python version being used, enabling detection of version mismatches between environments.  `tf.__version__` confirms the TensorFlow version, highlighting potential version conflicts.  Most importantly, `tf.__file__` shows the exact location of the installed TensorFlow package.  Comparing this path between Spyder and Jupyter Notebook reveals if TensorFlow is indeed installed in the kernel used by Jupyter and if the paths point to the same installation.  Inconsistencies here strongly suggest an environmental mismatch.  During my work on a medical image classification project, this simple check revealed that Jupyter was using an older kernel without TensorFlow installed, even though Spyder successfully imported it.

**Example 2: Checking for Environment Variables:**

```python
import os

print(os.environ)
```

This command prints all environment variables.  While not directly related to TensorFlow's import, it can highlight environment discrepancies.  Specifically, variables like `PYTHONPATH`, `PATH`, and CUDA-related environment variables can influence where Python searches for packages and libraries. If these are set differently in the system used by Spyder and the kernel used by Jupyter, it can cause import failures.  I've personally encountered situations where setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` variable within the Jupyter Notebook solved import issues related to CUDA-enabled TensorFlow.


**Example 3:  Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment (using `venv`)**

```bash
python3 -m venv my_tensorflow_env
source my_tensorflow_env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
my_tensorflow_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install tensorflow
jupyter notebook
```

This sequence demonstrates the proper way to set up a virtual environment specifically for TensorFlow.  First, a new virtual environment named `my_tensorflow_env` is created using the `venv` module (the standard way to manage virtual environments in Python 3).  It's then activated, and TensorFlow is installed within this isolated environment.  Finally, Jupyter Notebook is launched, ensuring that it will use this environment's kernel (which should be selected within Jupyter).  This meticulously controlled environment avoids conflicts with other projects or system-wide installations.  Following this approach in one of my earlier projects, using a different virtual environment for each project, resolved similar issues I had been facing.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* The official TensorFlow documentation.
* Python's `venv` module documentation.
* Comprehensive guides on Python virtual environments (multiple sources exist).
* Documentation for your specific Jupyter Notebook distribution and Spyder installation.  The methods for managing kernels and interpreters will be specific to the implementation.



By systematically investigating these points and utilizing the provided code examples, you can effectively diagnose and rectify the TensorFlow import discrepancy between Spyder and Jupyter Notebook.  Remember to consistently use virtual environments and carefully manage your kernels to prevent such conflicts.  Thorough understanding of Python environment management is paramount for reliable deep learning development.
