The situation of encountering a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model saved across three files is not uncommon, particularly when dealing with frameworks that utilize separate files for model architecture, weights, and potentially other metadata.  My experience developing high-performance image recognition systems for a major medical imaging company frequently involved this type of model serialization.  The precise method for loading depends entirely on the framework used to initially save the model.  However, the underlying principle remains consistent:  accurate reconstruction of the model's architecture and population of its weights from the provided files.

**1. Understanding the File Types and Frameworks**

Before attempting to load the model, determining the framework and the role of each file is crucial.  Typical scenarios involve:

* **Configuration/Architecture File (.json, .yaml, .prototxt):**  This file usually describes the model's architecture—the layers, their types, hyperparameters, and connections.  Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Caffe often use variations of this approach.  The format dictates the parsing method required.

* **Weights File (.h5, .pth, .ckpt):** This file contains the numerical values representing the learned parameters of the network (weights and biases).  The format is specific to the framework.  Incorrect loading of weights can lead to runtime errors or incorrect predictions.

* **Metadata File (Optional, various formats):**  This might contain auxiliary information like training parameters, versioning details, or custom metadata specific to the model.  While not always essential for loading the model for inference, it's valuable for tracking model provenance and understanding its context.

**2. Loading Procedures**

The loading process hinges on the specific framework.  Below, I provide examples for TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, and a hypothetical framework 'ModelSaver' to illustrate diverse approaches.  Remember that error handling (try-except blocks) is essential in production environments, which I’ve omitted for brevity.

**2.1 TensorFlow/Keras Example**

In my work, I often encountered models saved using Keras's `model.save()` functionality, resulting in a single HDF5 file (.h5). However, separate saving might involve a JSON file for architecture and a separate HDF5 file for weights. This scenario necessitates a two-step process:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import json

# Load architecture
with open('model_architecture.json', 'r') as f:
    model_json = json.load(f)

model = tf.keras.models.model_from_json(model_json)

# Load weights
model.load_weights('model_weights.h5')

# Verify
model.summary()
```

This code first reconstructs the model architecture from the JSON file using `model_from_json()`.  Then, it loads the weights from the HDF5 file using `load_weights()`.  The `model.summary()` call is a crucial step for verification—it confirms the model's structure and the successful loading of weights.


**2.2 PyTorch Example**

PyTorch offers flexibility in saving models, often involving a `.pth` file containing both architecture and weights. However, a separate architecture definition might exist if using custom modules. Assume we have a separate architecture file, 'model_arch.py', and a weights file, 'model_weights.pth':

```python
import torch
import importlib

# Load architecture
arch_module = importlib.import_module('model_arch')
model_class = getattr(arch_module, 'MyModel') # Assuming the model class is named 'MyModel'
model = model_class()

# Load weights
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_weights.pth'))

# Verify (PyTorch doesn't have a direct summary equivalent to Keras)
print(model)
```

This PyTorch example differs significantly. It leverages `importlib` to dynamically load the model architecture from a separate Python file.  `load_state_dict()` is used to load the weights into the pre-initialized model. Printing the model instance offers some structural insight, though less comprehensive than Keras' `summary()`.


**2.3 Hypothetical 'ModelSaver' Framework Example**

Imagine a fictional framework, 'ModelSaver', that uses a custom binary format.  Assume three files: `model_config.ms`, `model_weights.ms`, and `model_metadata.ms`.  This situation demands a framework-specific loader:

```python
import modelsaver as ms # Hypothetical library

# Assume 'ModelSaver' has specific load functions
config = ms.load_config('model_config.ms')
weights = ms.load_weights('model_weights.ms')
metadata = ms.load_metadata('model_metadata.ms')

model = ms.build_model(config, weights, metadata)

# Hypothetical verification
print(ms.model_info(model))

```

This example demonstrates the adaptability needed.  The `ModelSaver` library (hypothetical) contains functions tailored to its custom file formats.  The `build_model()` function uses the loaded configuration, weights, and metadata to reconstruct the entire model instance. The `ms.model_info()` call is a placeholder for any verification functionality the hypothetical library might provide.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

Consult the official documentation for your specific deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe, etc.).  These are the most authoritative sources for proper model loading procedures.  Pay close attention to examples and tutorials demonstrating model saving and loading.  Thoroughly understand the structure and data types within your specific model files.  If the model's source code is available, review how the model is initially saved; this will offer the most precise understanding of the loading process.  Furthermore, search for relevant Stack Overflow questions and answers; they can often illuminate common pitfalls and offer alternative solutions.  Remember to always prioritize your framework's official documentation for the most up-to-date and correct information.
