The root cause of `torch.manual_seed(seed)` triggering a CUDA assertion error stems from a misunderstanding of how PyTorch manages random number generation across CPU and GPU devices. Specifically, `torch.manual_seed(seed)` only seeds the random number generator for the CPU. When subsequent operations requiring random numbers are executed on the GPU using CUDA, these operations will not be using a consistently seeded generator, potentially leading to non-deterministic behavior and ultimately, specific CUDA assertion errors. I have encountered this exact scenario multiple times during my work, particularly when porting models from CPU-based prototyping to GPU training environments, revealing subtle differences in expected behavior.

The crucial detail to grasp is that random number generation is not a single, global process in PyTorch. Each device (CPU, specific GPUs) has its own independent random number generator. When you call `torch.manual_seed(seed)`, you are essentially setting the initial state of the *CPU's* generator. If your code then allocates tensors to the GPU and performs operations that rely on random number generation on that GPU (e.g., initializing weights, applying dropout), and the GPU generator hasn't been seeded, the results will be unpredictable. CUDA can sometimes detect these inconsistencies, leading to assertion failures, typically during debugging or when specific algorithms behave unusually. These failures often indicate a conflict between expected behavior based on a seeded CPU execution and actual behavior on the GPU, with unseeded random number generation causing the deviation.

Let’s consider a simple example. Assume you want to initialize a layer with random weights. Using only `torch.manual_seed`, the initialization will be consistent across CPU runs, but not across GPU runs and not between CPU and GPU. The problem arises when the subsequent operations are unexpectedly inconsistent due to a lack of matching seed for GPU generation. The `torch.randn()` on the GPU has not been given any initial state, hence this source of non-determinism may cause conflicts. A simple dropout layer that uses randomness is another example where this issue would surface. This subtle source of error can cause frustrating discrepancies when debugging deep learning models. It is not uncommon for this error to be revealed only after a few layers of a model or in a less obvious module.

To properly address the issue, you must explicitly seed the GPU random number generator, too. You need to use `torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)` to ensure that the GPU's random number generator is initialized consistently. Ideally, you would set both the CPU and GPU seeds to the same value for deterministic operations across both devices. It is best practice to handle these device specific seeds at the beginning of a script, as well as any other forms of seeding needed (for libraries such as numpy or python’s random module). The seed must be set before any random operations are performed. Below is an example illustrating a common mistake and how to fix the seeding issue.

```python
# Example 1: Incorrectly seeding only the CPU
import torch
import numpy as np
import random

seed = 42
torch.manual_seed(seed)
# Note, the following lines are best practices for comprehensive determinism
np.random.seed(seed)
random.seed(seed)

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# This line will produce consistent random numbers across different CPU executions
cpu_tensor = torch.randn(3, 3)
print("CPU Tensor (only torch.manual_seed):\n", cpu_tensor)

# This line will produce inconsistent random numbers across different GPU executions
gpu_tensor = torch.randn(3, 3).to(device)
print("GPU Tensor (only torch.manual_seed):\n", gpu_tensor)
```

In this first example, the CPU tensor will be consistent across multiple runs, due to the `torch.manual_seed(seed)` call, but the GPU tensor will not be consistent, because `torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)` has not been called. This inconsistency could, in certain circumstances trigger the described CUDA error. The print statements will reveal how the tensors are different across runs when using the GPU.

The following example demonstrates a common fix, using `torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)`:
```python
# Example 2: Correctly seeding both CPU and GPU
import torch
import numpy as np
import random

seed = 42
torch.manual_seed(seed)
torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)
# Note, the following lines are best practices for comprehensive determinism
np.random.seed(seed)
random.seed(seed)

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# This line will produce consistent random numbers across different CPU executions
cpu_tensor = torch.randn(3, 3)
print("CPU Tensor (with torch.manual_seed):\n", cpu_tensor)

# This line will produce consistent random numbers across different GPU executions
gpu_tensor = torch.randn(3, 3).to(device)
print("GPU Tensor (with torch.cuda.manual_seed):\n", gpu_tensor)

```

In this second example, the GPU tensor is now consistent across multiple runs, which illustrates how to avoid such issues with random number generation. By explicitly seeding the GPU generator with `torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)`, all operations on the GPU that rely on random number generation will now be deterministic. The print statements will reveal how both tensors are now the same across runs. Note that comprehensive determinism often requires seeding for other libraries as well such as python's `random` module and `numpy`.

Finally, it is important to handle edge cases when multiple GPUs may be used in a project, as illustrated by the final example.
```python
# Example 3: Correctly seeding with multiple GPUs
import torch
import numpy as np
import random

seed = 42
torch.manual_seed(seed)
# Note, the following lines are best practices for comprehensive determinism
np.random.seed(seed)
random.seed(seed)

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

if device.type == "cuda":
    torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)
    # Handle multiple GPUs if using distributed training
    if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
        torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)

# This line will produce consistent random numbers across different CPU executions
cpu_tensor = torch.randn(3, 3)
print("CPU Tensor (with torch.manual_seed):\n", cpu_tensor)

# This line will produce consistent random numbers across different GPU executions
gpu_tensor = torch.randn(3, 3).to(device)
print("GPU Tensor (with torch.cuda.manual_seed):\n", gpu_tensor)
```

This final example demonstrates how to initialize multiple GPUs with `torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)`, and it is common practice to only use this seeding when CUDA devices are available. Without proper handling, if the code is run on a machine with multiple GPUs without distributed training capabilities, the result may still be inconsistent due to operations defaulting to different devices. In distributed training settings this will require more careful thought, since each process may need to be seeded individually in order to maintain consistency across devices.

For further information, I recommend reviewing PyTorch’s official documentation, particularly the sections on random number generation and reproducibility. The PyTorch tutorials and examples also provide valuable context. Additionally, resources like the NVIDIA developer forums, and community-driven platforms (such as this one) can often provide insights from other developers' experiences. Reading articles or blog posts about reproducible machine learning can also give a much broader perspective to the problem and more techniques to use. These resources helped me gain a more profound understanding of how PyTorch's random number generation functions and device management interact. The key takeaway is that achieving deterministic results in PyTorch, particularly in CUDA environments, demands careful management of seeds across both CPU and GPU devices.
