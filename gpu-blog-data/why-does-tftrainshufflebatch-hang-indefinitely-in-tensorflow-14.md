In TensorFlow 1.4, the `tf.train.shuffle_batch` function's tendency to hang indefinitely, especially during the initial phases of training, stems primarily from a confluence of factors related to the asynchronous queue runner mechanisms and insufficient data being enqueued initially. This isn't a bug per se, but rather a consequence of how the prefetching and shuffling are implemented within the TensorFlow graph execution model.

Specifically, `tf.train.shuffle_batch` relies on internal queues to store data samples before they are returned in batches. This function starts multiple threads, each responsible for executing the input pipeline, reading data from files (or other input sources), and enqueueing the samples. Simultaneously, the main thread, which performs training or inference, attempts to dequeue batches from these queues. The hanging behavior appears when there’s an imbalance: either the enqueueing threads are not filling the queues quickly enough, or the dequeuing process is trying to consume data before it’s available. The crucial piece of information often missing in many initial setups is that the queue runner mechanism needs time and data to fill its capacity.

I've personally encountered this issue multiple times while working on various image recognition and NLP projects, and the underlying cause has invariably been related to this initial slow fill rate of the queues. Let's break down the specifics. The typical use pattern involves setting the `capacity` parameter for `shuffle_batch`, and this determines how many elements can be held in the queue. If the queue is empty, the main training loop attempting to dequeue will block, indefinitely in the worst cases if no enqueueing threads succeed in placing data in the queue.

There are several reasons why these queues may initially be slow to fill:

1.  **Slow Input Operations:** If the operations to load data from disk (e.g., reading image files, parsing text) are slow, this will directly impact the rate at which data is fed into the queues. This is especially prevalent when dealing with large datasets or slower storage media.
2.  **Insufficient Queue Runners:** Even with fast input operations, there may not be enough threads executing these operations to rapidly fill the queues. TensorFlow’s default setup might not have enough queue runners activated for the input complexity.
3.  **Incorrect Queue Capacity:** Setting the `capacity` argument of `shuffle_batch` too high can lead to the queue taking a longer time to reach a state that allows dequeuing, particularly during early phases where the data generation and enqueueing may be slower.
4.  **Incorrect Number of threads** The parameter `num_threads` of the `shuffle_batch` function can lead to a deadlock if it is not well-defined.

Now, let’s consider some practical examples. I’ll provide three code snippets that illustrate different contexts in which this problem manifests and the necessary adjustments.

**Example 1: Simple File Reading with Insufficient Capacity**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(['data1.txt', 'data2.txt'], shuffle=True)
reader = tf.TextLineReader()
_, value = reader.read(filename_queue)

batch_size = 10
capacity = 100  # Setting a low capacity initially
num_threads = 2

batch = tf.train.shuffle_batch([value], batch_size=batch_size,
                            capacity=capacity,
                            min_after_dequeue=capacity // 2,
                            num_threads=num_threads)


with tf.Session() as sess:
    coord = tf.train.Coordinator()
    threads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess=sess, coord=coord)
    try:
      for _ in range(5): # This will often hang
          b = sess.run(batch)
          print(b)
    except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
        print("Done")
    finally:
        coord.request_stop()
        coord.join(threads)
```

This example demonstrates the issue with a limited `capacity` and `num_threads`, especially when the underlying read operations for the text data are slow. If the files are large, the enqueueing process will be slower, and the queue might not fill quickly enough for the training to proceed, leading to a hang. This configuration might only work if the files were very small, or if the number of threads was higher.

**Example 2: Increase queue capacity and number of threads**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(['data1.txt', 'data2.txt'], shuffle=True)
reader = tf.TextLineReader()
_, value = reader.read(filename_queue)

batch_size = 10
capacity = 1000 # Increased queue capacity
num_threads = 4 #Increased number of threads

batch = tf.train.shuffle_batch([value], batch_size=batch_size,
                            capacity=capacity,
                            min_after_dequeue=capacity // 2,
                            num_threads=num_threads)


with tf.Session() as sess:
    coord = tf.train.Coordinator()
    threads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess=sess, coord=coord)
    try:
      for _ in range(5):
          b = sess.run(batch)
          print(b)
    except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
        print("Done")
    finally:
        coord.request_stop()
        coord.join(threads)
```

Here, we’ve increased the `capacity` of the queue and number of threads, and this can resolve the hanging issue in many situations. This enables the queue to store more elements and allows for more parallelism in the enqueue process. The increased capacity buffers against slow read operations by allowing the queue to store more data while the input operations catch up. The increased number of threads ensures the queue is being filled concurrently at a higher rate.

**Example 3:  Adding the `min_after_dequeue` parameter**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(['data1.txt', 'data2.txt'], shuffle=True)
reader = tf.TextLineReader()
_, value = reader.read(filename_queue)

batch_size = 10
capacity = 1000
num_threads = 4
min_after_dequeue = capacity // 2 # Setting the min_after_dequeue parameter

batch = tf.train.shuffle_batch([value], batch_size=batch_size,
                            capacity=capacity,
                            min_after_dequeue=min_after_dequeue,
                            num_threads=num_threads)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    coord = tf.train.Coordinator()
    threads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess=sess, coord=coord)
    try:
      for _ in range(5):
          b = sess.run(batch)
          print(b)
    except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
        print("Done")
    finally:
        coord.request_stop()
        coord.join(threads)
```

Adding the `min_after_dequeue` parameter can ensure that the function waits for the queue to have a minimum number of elements before returning. This prevents the queue from constantly emptying, resulting in a blocking state during the training. If the parameter is not defined, and if the queue is depleted faster than it is filled, the function can deadlock and wait indefinitely. Setting the parameter properly (here set at half the capacity) solves the problem in many situations where it might still hang without.

To prevent `tf.train.shuffle_batch` from hanging, it is critical to select `capacity` and `min_after_dequeue` values that are appropriate for both the input dataset size and the nature of the data input operations. An improperly sized queue will directly impact the learning performance. Also, verify that the number of threads is enough to fill the queue in a reasonable amount of time. Always utilize `tf.train.start_queue_runners` to initiate the input pipeline, and use a `tf.train.Coordinator` to properly handle the threads. Also, remember to stop and join the threads via `coord.request_stop()` and `coord.join()` when the work is done to avoid resource leaks. This combination addresses the root cause of the hanging behavior, focusing on the timing and flow of the data pipeline.

For further guidance and understanding, I would suggest consulting the TensorFlow documentation on input pipelines, specifically those sections that describe the use of `tf.train.string_input_producer`, `tf.train.shuffle_batch`, `tf.train.Coordinator`, and queue runners. These resources provide detailed explanations of the underlying concepts and mechanisms that contribute to the hanging behavior. Also, study example code patterns where these functions are being employed successfully. This will help build a better understanding of the data reading process. Reviewing some of the TensorFlow tutorials regarding input pipelines for complex datasets will also be invaluable.
