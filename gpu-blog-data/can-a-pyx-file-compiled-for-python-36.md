The core issue when importing compiled Python extensions across different Python versions, particularly those built using Cython (.pyx), centers on binary compatibility and Python's internal ABI (Application Binary Interface). A compiled .pyx file, resulting in a .so (on Linux/macOS) or .pyd (on Windows) file, is not typically interchangeable across Python minor versions like 3.6 and 3.7 without careful consideration. I've personally faced this issue several times managing complex scientific computing pipelines, where dependencies can be tightly coupled to a specific Python build.

The compiled extension's ABI is intrinsically linked to the specific version of Python used during compilation. This ABI is not a formal, documented contract, but rather an implicit structure encompassing how Python objects, particularly C-level structures and function calling conventions, are represented and accessed internally. When a Python program imports the extension, it expects the extension to conform to its specific ABI. A mismatch in ABI, such as that between a 3.6-compiled extension and a 3.7 Python interpreter, can lead to crashes, import errors, or unpredictable behavior.

Significant changes can occur in Python's internal data structures and APIs between minor versions, meaning that a .so or .pyd file referencing addresses, object layout, or functions valid for 3.6 might be incorrect in a 3.7 environment. This discrepancy can affect how memory is allocated, how object references are managed, and ultimately, how the extension interacts with the Python runtime. While Python strives for forward and backward compatibility at the language level, this doesn't always extend to the compiled binary interfaces of extension modules. The CPython implementation, in particular, doesn’t guarantee ABI stability between minor versions.

It's also not just a Python version issue. The compiler and toolchain used also play a role. For example, building a .pyx file using a specific version of GCC might generate different machine code compared to a newer version, although the most critical aspect, as far as ABI compatibility, is the Python version. The operating system and its specific libraries also contribute, although these are less of a factor in the primary issue.

The primary problem arises from Python's internal C API. When using Cython (and other extension builders like `ctypes`), you're interacting with low-level structures and function calls defined by CPython. These details can shift between minor versions, making direct reuse unreliable. This is why projects often need separate builds for each Python version they support.

Let me illustrate this with a few examples that I've seen firsthand.

**Example 1: Basic Function Call**

Let's assume a simple Cython file, `my_module.pyx`, containing:

```cython
# my_module.pyx
def add(int a, int b):
    return a + b
```

We compile this for Python 3.6 (I'm providing commands as an example; the specific steps depend on your setup):

```bash
python3.6 -m pip install cython
python3.6 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Where `setup.py` is:

```python
# setup.py
from setuptools import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

setup(
    ext_modules = cythonize("my_module.pyx")
)
```

This generates a `my_module.so` (or `my_module.pyd`). Now, let's try to import this in Python 3.7:

```python
# Python 3.7 interpreter
import my_module

print(my_module.add(5, 3))
```

This import might work initially, or it could immediately fail with an import error or a segmentation fault. The likelihood of failure increases with the complexity of the Cython code due to the increased reliance on low-level structures. A simple integer addition might, by chance, be safe, especially if both versions have the same integer layout, but you should never rely on this.

**Example 2: Complex C Types**

Suppose we have a Cython file, `complex_module.pyx`, that uses some C-level structs:

```cython
# complex_module.pyx
cdef struct MyStruct:
    int x
    int y

def create_struct(int a, int b):
    cdef MyStruct s
    s.x = a
    s.y = b
    return s.x, s.y
```

Now, building this for Python 3.6, and then trying to use it in Python 3.7 will almost certainly cause problems. Struct layouts are among the things that are not guaranteed to be constant between Python versions. Accessing member variables like `s.x` in Python 3.7 using a compiled module from 3.6 might lead to incorrect memory reads.

```bash
python3.6 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
```python
# Python 3.7
import complex_module
print(complex_module.create_struct(10,20))
```
A failure here is very probable. The program will probably either crash or return garbage data.

**Example 3: Object Interaction**

Consider a more involved example with Python objects interacting within Cython:

```cython
# object_module.pyx
def process_list(list data):
  cdef int i
  cdef object item
  for i, item in enumerate(data):
    if item % 2 == 0:
      data[i] = item * 2
  return data
```
And again:
```bash
python3.6 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
```python
# Python 3.7 interpreter
import object_module
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(object_module.process_list(my_list))
```
Here, we are passing a Python list into the function, and the Cython interacts with it using Python’s internal object structures. As soon as we compile it against Python 3.6 and run it with 3.7, we risk memory corruption. The memory layout and how python objects are represented might not be the same, and accessing/modifying the list can lead to serious problems. This type of interaction is much more frequent in real-world usage.

The only reliable way to ensure cross-version compatibility is to compile the .pyx files separately for each Python version. This implies having different build environments or pipelines for each target version.

For ensuring reliable distribution of Python extension modules across multiple Python versions, I would suggest investigating these resources:

1.  **Python Packaging Documentation:** The official Python packaging guide provides excellent information on how to manage extension modules correctly, often highlighting the need for version-specific builds. Look at topics on wheels and package distribution.

2.  **Cython Documentation:** The Cython documentation contains specifics on building and distributing Cython extensions, including best practices for dealing with different Python versions. Check sections on compilation and building for specific architectures.

3. **`setuptools`:** This tool is foundational to building Python extensions and packages, providing directives on extension building and how to specify platform-specific resources. See its documentation for specific usage.

In summary, while it may seem convenient, attempting to import a .pyx file compiled for Python 3.6 into a 3.7 environment is not generally safe. The core problem is binary incompatibility due to variations in Python's internal ABI. The only robust approach is to rebuild the .pyx extension separately for each Python version you intend to support. Ignoring this can lead to inconsistent behavior, crashes, and debugging nightmares, as I’ve experienced firsthand on a few occasions during my development projects.
