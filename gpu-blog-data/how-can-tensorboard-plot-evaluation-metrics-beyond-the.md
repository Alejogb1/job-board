TensorBoard, by default, primarily displays training metrics as they evolve during model training, often showing a graph up to the final training iteration. Extending metric visualization to encompass post-training evaluation requires a deliberate shift in how data is logged and interpreted. I've personally navigated this challenge multiple times when auditing model performance after convergence, particularly in scenarios involving ensemble methods or re-evaluation on holdout sets. The core issue lies in distinguishing between metrics recorded *during* training and metrics computed *after* training concludes. TensorBoard interprets its log files sequentially; therefore, to plot post-training metrics, you must append these new evaluation events to the existing log data, typically under different names to avoid confusion.

The standard training loop, as implemented with frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, utilizes summary writers to log metrics at regular intervals. These writers associate scalar values with specific steps. TensorBoard reads these scalar events and uses the step value to plot the metrics over training time. When training finishes, the writer is usually closed. The crucial adjustment for post-training metrics lies in understanding that the step counter doesn’t automatically advance or reset outside of this training loop, and we will need to control the step numbering when writing these new evaluation metrics. Specifically, we must use a *new* step number—one that is logically sequential with the training steps—and *different* metric names so as to not unintentionally overwrite or conflate with the existing training plots.

Consider a situation where we want to evaluate the final trained model on a validation set. We would, after the training loop has finished, load the model, run the evaluation, and record these validation metrics to the existing TensorBoard log. If the training had 1000 steps, we should start our evaluation step counts, say, at 1001 to prevent overwriting. The goal is to append, not replace, to create a continuous visualization.

Here's an illustrative scenario using a hypothetical TensorFlow setup:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume model is already trained and loaded as 'model'

# Path where existing TensorBoard logs are stored
log_dir = "logs/my_model/"

# Number of steps during training (Assume 1000 for illustration)
training_steps = 1000

# Load the evaluation dataset
validation_data = np.random.rand(100, 10) # Replace with your actual data
validation_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100) # Replace with actual labels

# Define evaluation metrics.
def evaluate_model(model, data, labels):
    predictions = model(data)
    accuracy = np.mean(np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) == labels)
    return accuracy

# Compute metrics on the validation set.
validation_accuracy = evaluate_model(model, validation_data, validation_labels)

# Open the summary writer to continue logging from existing log directory.
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

# Define evaluation step number to be sequential with training steps.
evaluation_step = training_steps + 1

# Record validation performance metric using the evaluation step number and different naming convention.
with writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar('Validation_Accuracy', validation_accuracy, step=evaluation_step)
writer.flush()
writer.close()

print(f"Validation accuracy logged at step {evaluation_step}")
```

In this example, a `tf.summary.create_file_writer()` is used to append to the existing log directory. The `evaluation_step` is explicitly defined as one more than `training_steps`. The validation metric is logged with the tag 'Validation_Accuracy', ensuring separation from training metrics. This ensures that in TensorBoard, you will see plots for training metrics evolving over steps 0 to 1000 and then a discrete point for the validation accuracy at step 1001, extending the timeline of metric tracking beyond the confines of the training loop.

Next, consider a scenario where we perform *multiple* post-training evaluations, perhaps on different test splits or with different evaluation techniques. Here we would iterate through different evaluations while incrementing the step number for each log, to get a timeline of different evaluation metrics post-training. This demonstrates a more sophisticated usage, where several post-training analyses can be sequentially logged to TensorBoard:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assuming model is already trained and loaded.

log_dir = "logs/my_model/"
training_steps = 1000

# Mock evaluation data for demonstration
test_data_1 = np.random.rand(50, 10)
test_labels_1 = np.random.randint(0, 2, 50)
test_data_2 = np.random.rand(75, 10)
test_labels_2 = np.random.randint(0, 2, 75)

def evaluate_model(model, data, labels):
    predictions = model(data)
    accuracy = np.mean(np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) == labels)
    return accuracy

# Store the evaluation data and labels
eval_data = [(test_data_1, test_labels_1, "Test_Set_1_Accuracy"),
             (test_data_2, test_labels_2, "Test_Set_2_Accuracy")]

writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)
evaluation_step = training_steps + 1

with writer.as_default():
    for data, labels, metric_tag in eval_data:
        evaluation_accuracy = evaluate_model(model, data, labels)
        tf.summary.scalar(metric_tag, evaluation_accuracy, step=evaluation_step)
        evaluation_step += 1

writer.flush()
writer.close()

print("Multiple post training metrics logged")
```
In this adjusted approach, an array of evaluation datasets and tags is iterated through. Each evaluation set's metric is written to TensorBoard and the step counter increments by one, meaning each new evaluation is shown as a sequential data point in Tensorboard. The different tags allow for comparison of different evaluations.

Finally, imagine a case where we need to track an aggregate metric from multiple evaluation runs. For instance, during hyperparameter tuning, we may re-evaluate the same trained model multiple times over different iterations to get an average performance score. We would then calculate the mean metric after multiple model evaluations for the same step and log the single averaged performance. In the code below, I will demonstrate how this is done for 3 mock evaluations:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assuming model is trained and loaded.

log_dir = "logs/my_model/"
training_steps = 1000

# Mock data for demonstration
eval_data = [np.random.rand(50, 10) for _ in range(3)]
eval_labels = [np.random.randint(0, 2, 50) for _ in range(3)]

def evaluate_model(model, data, labels):
    predictions = model(data)
    accuracy = np.mean(np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) == labels)
    return accuracy

writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)
evaluation_step = training_steps + 1

accuracies = []
for i in range(len(eval_data)):
  current_accuracy = evaluate_model(model, eval_data[i], eval_labels[i])
  accuracies.append(current_accuracy)
averaged_accuracy = np.mean(accuracies)
with writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar("Average_Validation_Accuracy", averaged_accuracy, step=evaluation_step)
writer.flush()
writer.close()

print("Averaged post-training metric logged.")
```
Here, we see that the multiple evaluation metrics are stored in an intermediate array, and then averaged, before being logged to TensorBoard.

These examples demonstrate the flexibility in controlling step numbers and metric names during post-training evaluation.

For further study, I would advise exploring the official documentation of your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch) concerning TensorBoard logging and data serialization. Specifically, look into sections detailing `tf.summary` (TensorFlow) or `torch.utils.tensorboard` (PyTorch). Additionally, research topics related to experimental data management, such as the best practice in logging and organizing your results. Also, consider studying how you can extend this methodology to record more complex results, including histograms or images using TensorBoard. Mastering these techniques will greatly enhance your ability to both effectively monitor and interpret your model's performance, regardless of where you are within your experimentation pipeline.
