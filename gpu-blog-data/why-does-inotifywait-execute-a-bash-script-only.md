The behavior of `inotifywait` executing a bash script only on the first event stems from its default behavior concerning the `--format` option and the absence of explicit loop control within the script itself.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale monitoring systems has highlighted the importance of understanding `inotifywait`'s event handling mechanism, particularly when interacting with external scripts.  The tool doesn't inherently support continuous execution for multiple events; instead, it generates a single event description for each file system change and exits.  To achieve continuous monitoring, the script invoked must manage its own loop.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`inotifywait` is a powerful command-line utility, but it's a single-event notification tool.  It monitors specified file system events (create, modify, delete, etc.) and outputs a formatted string describing the detected event.  When invoked with a command such as `inotifywait -e modify /path/to/file -m /path/to/file`, where the `-m` flag indicates monitoring, `inotifywait` will continue to monitor the file indefinitely.  However, critically, if you pipe this output directly to a bash script (`inotifywait ... | ./myscript.sh`), the script only executes once, processing the *first* event description received.  Subsequent events will continue to be generated by `inotifywait`, but they won't be passed to the script.  The script's termination concludes the pipeline, breaking the connection between `inotifywait`'s continuous monitoring and the script's execution. This is not a flaw in `inotifywait`, but a consequence of how pipes and shell process handling function.

To remedy this, the bash script must implement its own loop, actively reading the `inotifywait` output until explicitly terminated.  This ensures the script processes each event generated, enabling continuous monitoring and response.  Furthermore, employing proper error handling within the script prevents premature termination due to unforeseen circumstances.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation (Single Execution):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script will only execute once.
echo "Event received: $1"  #Attempt to process first argument
```

In this example, `myscript.sh` is executed by `inotifywait` for the first event that it produces. The `$1` variable might contain part of the output of `inotifywait`, but after this initial execution, the script exits and the pipe is broken.  The subsequent events are lost.


**Example 2: Correct Implementation (Continuous Monitoring with `while` loop):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while read -r line; do
  echo "Event received: $line"
  # Process the event information contained in $line.
  #  For instance, parse the line using awk or cut to extract relevant data (file path, event type).
  # Add error handling here (e.g., check for specific error codes).
done
```

This script, when used with `inotifywait -e modify /path/to/file -m /path/to/file | ./myscript.sh`, reads from the standard input indefinitely, handling each event line from `inotifywait`.  The `-r` option to `read` prevents backslash escapes from being interpreted, improving the script's robustness when handling potentially complex `inotifywait` output.

**Example 3: Correct Implementation with enhanced error handling and event filtering:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while read -r line; do
  # Extract relevant data using awk for robustness.
  event=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $NF}') #Extract event type
  file=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $1}')  #Extract file path

  if [[ "$event" == "MODIFY" ]]; then #Process only modify events
    echo "File modified: $file"
    #Process the file, maybe backup, trigger other actions
    # Implement robust error handling here - check return codes of external commands.
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error processing file $file. Continuing..."
    fi
  else
    echo "Event ignored: $event on $file"
  fi
done
```

This improved example demonstrates event filtering and error handling.  It uses `awk` to parse the `inotifywait` output more reliably extracting the event type and file path. The condition only processes modify events, and the check `$?` ensures that any action taken on the modified file is handled correctly, preventing a single failure from stopping the entire monitoring process.  It gracefully handles other events, logging them to the console but not triggering further action.  This makes the script more resilient and easier to debug in production.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the `inotifywait` man page for detailed information on options and output formatting.  Thoroughly understand shell scripting concepts, particularly input/output redirection, and piping. Refer to the `awk` man page to efficiently parse the output of `inotifywait`. Explore bash's built-in error handling mechanisms using return codes and conditional statements. Studying system administration guides on monitoring and logging practices is crucial.  Familiarity with the underlying Linux file system events and the `inotify` subsystem will greatly enhance your understanding.
