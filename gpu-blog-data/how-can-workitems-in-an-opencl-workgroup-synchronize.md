Workgroup synchronization in OpenCL without explicit barriers or memory-based synchronization hinges on exploiting the inherent properties of workgroup execution and leveraging the predictable behavior of built-in functions.  My experience optimizing computationally intensive ray tracing kernels taught me that this approach, while less intuitive than barrier synchronization, can yield significant performance gains in specific scenarios by avoiding potentially costly memory transactions and barrier operations.  Crucially, this technique is only viable when the synchronization requirements are tightly coupled with the data dependencies within the workgroup.

The core principle is to structure the kernel such that the dependencies between work-items inherently dictate the order of execution.  We can leverage predictable execution patterns to ensure that data produced by one work-item is available before it's consumed by another, obviating the need for explicit synchronization mechanisms.  This necessitates a careful analysis of the algorithm's data flow and a restructuring of the kernel's logic to align with this data-driven synchronization.


**1.  Explanation:**

The illusion of synchronization without barriers or memory fences is achieved by carefully designing the workgroup's task allocation and data flow.  Rather than relying on explicit synchronization primitives, the synchronization emerges organically from the data dependencies within the kernel.  Consider a scenario where each work-item processes a section of a larger dataset, and the output of one work-item is the input for the next.  If the algorithm's structure ensures that the necessary data is always available before it's accessed, then the work-items implicitly synchronize, although the order of execution within the workgroup might not be strictly sequential.  This implicit synchronization relies on the compiler's optimization capabilities and the underlying hardware's execution model.  It's critical to understand that this isn't a true replacement for barriers in all cases; it works best when the dependencies are strict and predictable.  Furthermore, this approach is inherently limited to intra-workgroup synchronization.  Inter-workgroup communication requires explicit mechanisms.

**2.  Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Prefix Sum (without atomics or barriers):**

This example demonstrates a prefix sum calculation within a workgroup.  The algorithm leverages a hierarchical approach, combining partial sums iteratively.  No barriers are employed because the data dependencies naturally impose synchronization.  Note that this is a simplification; in a real implementation, careful consideration of workgroup size and data alignment is crucial.

```c++
__kernel void prefixSum(__global float *input, __global float *output, const int N) {
  int gid = get_global_id(0);
  int lid = get_local_id(0);
  int lsize = get_local_size(0);

  __local float localData[256]; // Assuming workgroup size <= 256

  localData[lid] = input[gid];
  barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE); //Local Barrier - this is okay as its a local barrier, but the aim is to reduce these.

  for (int s = 1; s < lsize; s *= 2) {
    if (lid >= s) {
      localData[lid] += localData[lid - s];
    }
    barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE); //Local barrier.
  }

  output[gid] = localData[lid];
}
```


**Improved Example 1 - Reduced Barrier Usage:**


```c++
__kernel void prefixSumOptimized(__global float *input, __global float *output, const int N) {
    int gid = get_global_id(0);
    int lid = get_local_id(0);
    int lsize = get_local_size(0);
    int i;

    __local float localData[256];
    localData[lid] = input[gid];

    for (i = 1; i < lsize; i <<= 1) {
        if(lid >= i){
            localData[lid] += localData[lid-i];
        }
       //The barrier is removed here, synchronization is implied through the data dependency
    }
    output[gid] = localData[lid];
}
```

This revised example shows an attempt at removing local barriers entirely. The data dependency inherent in the algorithm dictates that the additions are performed in a sequential fashion (within the loop). The compiler is free to optimize the execution flow with predictable and deterministic outcomes. However, this removal should be undertaken cautiously and tested rigorously, especially with varying hardware.

**Example 2:  Simple Reduction (without atomics or barriers):**

A reduction operation can be performed with a similar approach.  Each work-item processes a section, and subsequent work-items accumulate the results.  Careful planning ensures that partial sums are only combined when all necessary values have been generated.


```c++
__kernel void reduce(__global float *input, __global float *output, const int N) {
  int gid = get_global_id(0);
  int lid = get_local_id(0);
  int lsize = get_local_size(0);

  __local float localSum[256]; // Assuming workgroup size <= 256

  localSum[lid] = input[gid];
  barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE);

  for (int i = lsize / 2; i > 0; i >>= 1) {
    if (lid < i) {
      localSum[lid] += localSum[lid + i];
    }
    barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE);
  }

  if (lid == 0) {
    output[get_group_id(0)] = localSum[0];
  }
}
```

Again,  similar optimization techniques used in Example 1, leveraging data dependencies and potentially eliminating local barriers, can be attempted. This heavily relies on compiler optimization and a well-understood hardware architecture.

**Example 3:  Rasterization-like processing:**

In a rasterization-like scenario, each work item handles a single pixel or a small tile.  If the algorithm only requires data from its immediate neighbors, implicit synchronization can sometimes be used. If one pixel's output depends on the result of its neighbors, appropriate design ensures that those are calculated before that particular pixel, obviating the need for a direct synchronization call.



```c++
__kernel void rasterize(__global float4 *inputImage,__global float4 *outputImage,const int width, const int height) {
   int gid = get_global_id(0);
   int lid = get_local_id(0);
   int lsize = get_local_size(0);
   int x = gid % width;
   int y = gid / width;

   //Simple example, assuming neighbor dependencies are handled by data flow.
   if(x > 0 && y > 0)
   {
       outputImage[gid] = inputImage[gid] + inputImage[gid-1] + inputImage[gid - width];
   }
   else {
       outputImage[gid] = inputImage[gid];
   }
}

```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The OpenCL specification, particularly sections on workgroup execution and memory models.  A comprehensive text on parallel algorithm design.  A good compiler optimization guide focused on OpenCL.  Advanced OpenCL programming texts covering performance optimization strategies and low-level details of OpenCL execution.  Finally, detailed documentation for your target OpenCL hardware platform will be invaluable in understanding its specific limitations and optimization opportunities concerning workgroup execution.
