TensorFlow 2.0's removal of the `tf.contrib` module necessitates direct replacements for formerly convenient functions. Specifically, `tf.contrib.layers.apply_regularization`, often employed to add weight decay terms to a loss function, requires a manual implementation within the TensorFlow 2.0 paradigm. The core challenge lies in adapting to the Eager Execution and modular design of the newer framework. I faced this exact issue during a project migrating a legacy image recognition model, and found a solution that leverages `tf.keras.layers` and manual loss calculations.

**The Problem: `tf.contrib.layers.apply_regularization` in Context**

In TensorFlow 1.x, `tf.contrib.layers.apply_regularization` provided a streamlined method for applying L1 or L2 regularization to specified trainable variables. This function accepted a regularization function (e.g., `tf.contrib.layers.l2_regularizer`) and a list of variables and conveniently added the calculated regularization terms to a running total. The resulting scalar value, representing the total regularization loss, could then be combined with the task-specific loss. Its primary benefit was automating the iteration through weights and application of regularization terms.

TensorFlow 2.0, however, encourages a more explicit approach, requiring users to iterate through the model's weights and compute the regularization loss themselves. This offers a greater degree of control and transparency, aligning with the framework's general philosophy.

**Solution Approach: Manual Regularization Implementation**

The migration primarily entails three steps: 1) defining a regularization function, 2) accessing the modelâ€™s trainable variables, and 3) calculating and summing the individual regularization terms. The `tf.keras` API facilitates accessing variables, while `tf.math` provides the required mathematical operations. The solution revolves around extracting weight tensors from each layer (or desired layers) and applying the regularizing penalty before summation.

Let's illustrate this process with code examples:

**Example 1: Implementing L2 Regularization with a Basic Model**

Assume we have a simple `tf.keras.Sequential` model. We can calculate and apply L2 regularization as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def l2_regularizer(lambda_val):
  """L2 regularization function."""
  def regularizer(weight):
    return lambda_val * tf.nn.l2_loss(weight)
  return regularizer

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform')
])

lambda_value = 0.01  # Regularization strength
regularization_loss = tf.constant(0.0)

for layer in model.layers:
  if hasattr(layer, 'kernel'): # Check if the layer has weights
      regularization_loss += l2_regularizer(lambda_value)(layer.kernel)

# Example of loss usage, assuming we have cross entropy loss named 'cross_entropy'
cross_entropy = tf.constant(2.34) # dummy loss
total_loss = cross_entropy + regularization_loss

print(f"Total Loss with L2 Regularization: {total_loss.numpy()}")
```

In this snippet, I've defined a custom `l2_regularizer` that takes a `lambda_val` controlling the strength. Then, for each layer in the model, I iterate through them using `.layers`. Importantly, I use `hasattr(layer, 'kernel')` to ensure we target layers with trainable weights, specifically checking for the 'kernel' attribute of each layer, indicating a weight matrix. If present, the L2 regularization is computed, contributing to the overall `regularization_loss`. I then demonstrate the combination with a placeholder `cross_entropy` term.

**Example 2: Selective Regularization**

Often, we don't want to regularize *all* weights. The following example illustrates selective regularization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def l2_regularizer(lambda_val):
  """L2 regularization function."""
  def regularizer(weight):
      return lambda_val * tf.nn.l2_loss(weight)
  return regularizer


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1), kernel_initializer='he_normal'),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform')
])

lambda_value = 0.001
regularization_loss = tf.constant(0.0)

layers_to_regularize = ['dense', 'conv2d'] # Lower case names for layer.name

for layer in model.layers:
    if layer.name.lower() in layers_to_regularize and hasattr(layer, 'kernel'):
        regularization_loss += l2_regularizer(lambda_value)(layer.kernel)


cross_entropy = tf.constant(2.34) # dummy loss
total_loss = cross_entropy + regularization_loss
print(f"Total Loss with selective L2: {total_loss.numpy()}")
```

Here, I introduce a `layers_to_regularize` list. The iteration logic is altered to include a conditional statement, checking if the lowercase version of the `layer.name` is present in our selection list and if the kernel attribute exists before applying the L2 regularization. This allows for targeted application, which is often desired for specific weight matrices in different types of layers. Notice that `layer.name` provides access to the layer's internal name.

**Example 3: L1 Regularization**

Implementing L1 regularization is equally straightforward, requiring the use of `tf.math.reduce_sum(tf.math.abs(weight))`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def l1_regularizer(lambda_val):
  """L1 regularization function."""
  def regularizer(weight):
    return lambda_val * tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(weight))
  return regularizer

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform')
])

lambda_value = 0.005
regularization_loss = tf.constant(0.0)


for layer in model.layers:
    if hasattr(layer, 'kernel'):
        regularization_loss += l1_regularizer(lambda_value)(layer.kernel)

cross_entropy = tf.constant(2.34) # dummy loss
total_loss = cross_entropy + regularization_loss

print(f"Total Loss with L1: {total_loss.numpy()}")
```

This code snippet mirrors the L2 regularization example but replaces `tf.nn.l2_loss` with a `tf.math.reduce_sum(tf.math.abs(weight))` to calculate the L1 norm, showcasing its easy adaptability.

**Resource Recommendations**

For understanding TensorFlow 2.0's new conventions, the official TensorFlow website documentation offers comprehensive guides and tutorials. Particularly, the sections covering `tf.keras.layers`, `tf.math` and custom training loops are very relevant.

Furthermore, several excellent books on machine learning with TensorFlow 2.0 are available. These typically offer more in-depth explanations and practical examples related to training neural networks. Specifically, look for material covering custom training loops and regularization implementation as integral parts of model development.

Finally, exploring public code repositories on platforms such as GitHub, where others have implemented similar models using TensorFlow 2.0 can prove invaluable. Look for projects that explicitly address regularization within their training routines to gain a variety of perspectives.

**Conclusion**

Migrating from `tf.contrib.layers.apply_regularization` to TensorFlow 2.0 requires an explicit implementation that loops through the model's variables, applies the desired regularization method (L1, L2, or potentially a custom one) to specific weights, and sums the results to produce an overall regularization loss. This approach promotes a better understanding of the underlying processes and provides flexibility. The `tf.keras` API simplifies the process of accessing model weights and provides a foundation for implementing custom training and loss functions, which I found essential during my projects.
