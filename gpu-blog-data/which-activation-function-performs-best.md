The optimal activation function is fundamentally context-dependent, a fact I've learned repeatedly throughout years of neural network development for image recognition and natural language processing tasks.  There's no single "best" function; the superior choice hinges on the specific architecture, dataset characteristics, and desired network behavior.  My experience has shown that prioritizing a thorough understanding of the properties of each candidate function over blind benchmarking is far more productive.

**1.  Explanation of Relevant Activation Functions and Their Properties:**

Several activation functions have proven their utility in different scenarios.  A nuanced understanding of their mathematical properties, computational cost, and gradient behavior is crucial for making an informed decision.  I'll focus on three prominent examples: Sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent).

* **Sigmoid:**  Defined as σ(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)), the sigmoid function outputs values between 0 and 1, often interpreted as probabilities.  While it was historically popular, it suffers from the vanishing gradient problem, particularly in deep networks.  The gradients become extremely small during backpropagation in saturated regions (near 0 and 1), hindering effective weight updates.  Furthermore, its output is not zero-centered, which can slow down training in some architectures.

* **ReLU:**  Defined as ReLU(x) = max(0, x), the ReLU function is significantly simpler computationally.  It outputs the input directly if positive and 0 otherwise.  ReLU alleviates the vanishing gradient problem to a large extent, as the gradient is a constant 1 for positive inputs.  However, it suffers from the "dying ReLU" problem – neurons can become inactive if their weights are updated such that the input is always negative, effectively preventing them from contributing to the network's learning.

* **tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent):**  Defined as tanh(x) = (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / (exp(x) + exp(-x)), the tanh function outputs values between -1 and 1, offering a zero-centered output. This zero-centered property can lead to faster convergence during training compared to sigmoid.  Similar to sigmoid, however, it can still suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, though to a lesser degree than sigmoid.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate the implementation and application of these activation functions in Python using NumPy.  These examples are simplified for illustrative purposes and don't include comprehensive error handling or optimization strategies used in production-level code.

**Example 1: Sigmoid Activation**

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
  """
  Sigmoid activation function.

  Args:
    x: Input array (NumPy array).

  Returns:
    Output array after applying the sigmoid function.
  """
  return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Example usage
input_array = np.array([-1, 0, 1, 2])
output_array = sigmoid(input_array)
print(output_array)
```

This code defines the sigmoid function and demonstrates its usage with a sample input array.  Note the reliance on NumPy's efficient array operations for vectorized computation, crucial for performance in larger neural networks.

**Example 2: ReLU Activation**

```python
import numpy as np

def relu(x):
  """
  ReLU activation function.

  Args:
    x: Input array (NumPy array).

  Returns:
    Output array after applying the ReLU function.
  """
  return np.maximum(0, x)

# Example usage
input_array = np.array([-1, 0, 1, 2])
output_array = relu(input_array)
print(output_array)
```

This code is similarly structured, highlighting the conciseness of the ReLU implementation.  The `np.maximum` function efficiently handles element-wise comparisons.

**Example 3: tanh Activation**

```python
import numpy as np

def tanh_activation(x):
  """
  tanh activation function.

  Args:
    x: Input array (NumPy array).

  Returns:
    Output array after applying the tanh function.
  """
  return np.tanh(x)

# Example usage
input_array = np.array([-1, 0, 1, 2])
output_array = tanh_activation(input_array)
print(output_array)
```

This code showcases the straightforward implementation of the tanh function using NumPy's built-in `tanh` function.  This leverages optimized underlying libraries for speed and efficiency.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend studying established textbooks on neural networks and deep learning.  These resources often include detailed mathematical derivations and comprehensive comparisons of various activation functions.  Exploring academic papers focusing on activation function selection and its impact on specific network architectures is also highly valuable.  Finally, thorough engagement with well-documented open-source deep learning frameworks will provide practical experience in implementing and experimenting with different activation functions.  Pay close attention to the documentation provided by these frameworks to understand the nuances of their implementations and potential performance implications.  This hands-on experience will solidify your understanding far more effectively than solely theoretical study.  Remember that experimentation and careful analysis of results are critical for mastering this aspect of neural network design.
