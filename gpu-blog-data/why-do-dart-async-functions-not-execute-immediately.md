The core reason Dart's async functions do not execute immediately is their inherent design around non-blocking, asynchronous operations. Unlike synchronous functions which execute sequentially, blocking the thread until completion, async functions in Dart facilitate concurrent execution without tying up the main execution thread. This is achieved via the `Future` type and the event loop, which manage the execution flow of asynchronous code. I've witnessed this firsthand countless times while building complex UIs in Flutter and backend services using server-side Dart, often encountering subtle timing issues that stem from misunderstanding this crucial behavior.

Async functions, denoted by the `async` keyword, fundamentally return a `Future`. This `Future` object represents the *eventual* result of the asynchronous operation, not the immediate result. When an async function is invoked, it begins executing its synchronous code. However, when it encounters an asynchronous operation, such as an I/O operation (network request, file system interaction), a timer, or a delay, it yields control back to the event loop. The function is then *paused*, with its execution context preserved, waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete. Upon completion, the event loop resumes the async function at the point where it yielded. This is the fundamental mechanism of Dart’s non-blocking asynchronous behavior. It is not a process of immediate execution and returning a value; it’s a deferred execution coupled with the management of a possible value via the Future.

To illustrate, consider a synchronous function:

```dart
int synchronousFunction(int input) {
  print("Synchronous operation started");
  int result = input * 2;
  print("Synchronous operation completed with result: $result");
  return result;
}

void main() {
  print("Before synchronous call");
  int syncResult = synchronousFunction(5);
  print("After synchronous call, result: $syncResult");
}
```

This will print, in order, “Before synchronous call”, “Synchronous operation started”, “Synchronous operation completed with result: 10”, and “After synchronous call, result: 10”. The execution flow is straightforward, each line executes in sequence. The synchronous function execution completes before main continues, and it blocks the main thread while doing so.

Contrast this to an async function:

```dart
Future<int> asynchronousFunction(int input) async {
  print("Asynchronous operation started");
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate an async task
  int result = input * 2;
  print("Asynchronous operation completed with result: $result");
  return result;
}

void main() async {
    print("Before asynchronous call");
    int asyncResult = await asynchronousFunction(5);
    print("After asynchronous call, result: $asyncResult");
}
```

Here, the output will be different.  First, “Before asynchronous call” is printed. Then, “Asynchronous operation started” is printed within `asynchronousFunction`. However, the `await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));` suspends the `asynchronousFunction`, yielding control back to `main`. Importantly, execution in `main` stops because of the `await` keyword. While `asynchronousFunction` is suspended for 2 seconds, the code in `main` does not block waiting for the result because of the nature of asynchronous programming and the `Future` management. After those 2 seconds, control is passed back into `asynchronousFunction`, and it proceeds to complete, printing “Asynchronous operation completed with result: 10”. Finally, control returns to `main` where it resumes and prints “After asynchronous call, result: 10”.

The difference arises from `async`'s inherent behavior with the event loop. The `await` keyword in both the function and in the `main` method where the function is called serves as the point where the asynchronous function can yield and the control goes to the event loop. It pauses the async function and lets other code execute. Without `await`, the function would begin and then execute synchronously up to an asynchronous operation point, after which the function execution and further lines would continue.

Another critical aspect is the treatment of the return value. In the second example, `asynchronousFunction` returns a `Future<int>`. The `await` in `main` is crucial; it instructs the program to wait for this `Future` to complete and then extract the integer value from the `Future`. If I had simply called `asynchronousFunction(5)` without `await` in main:

```dart
void main() {
  print("Before asynchronous call");
  Future<int> asyncResultFuture = asynchronousFunction(5);
  print("After asynchronous call, Future object: $asyncResultFuture");
}
```

The output would first be “Before asynchronous call”. Then, “Asynchronous operation started” would be printed. Then we would see “After asynchronous call, Future object: Instance of ‘Future<int>’”.  The crucial aspect is that `asynchronousFunction(5)` returns immediately with the `Future` object, without waiting for the asynchronous part of the `asynchronousFunction` to complete. The `print("After asynchronous call, Future object: $asyncResultFuture")` statement executes before the result from the `asynchronousFunction` is available. This is how non-blocking works, the execution can move on without waiting for the result of the function. If I attempted to access the value within the Future object at this point without `await`, I would not get the expected integer result because the asynchronous operation has not yet finished. If we wanted to actually retrieve the value of the `Future`, we would need to use `await` or `.then`, which are two ways of interacting with asynchronous operations.

This behavior is deliberate and necessary for building responsive and performant applications, especially when working with I/O-bound tasks. Without it, the Dart application would block each time it encountered an asynchronous operation, leading to a frustrating user experience, or a significant bottleneck in a server application. I often use these mechanisms to process multiple network calls in parallel without blocking UI updates.

For further understanding, I recommend reviewing resources covering the Dart event loop, Futures, and async/await syntax. The official Dart language documentation is an excellent starting point, particularly the sections on asynchronous programming and concurrency. Various blog posts and articles on medium or the official dart website provide practical examples and deeper theoretical understanding of asynchronous operations. Additionally, the book “Effective Dart” provides guidance for better practices when working with async code. Finally, studying existing Flutter and server-side Dart projects also provides valuable exposure and hands-on experience. Understanding why and how async functions in Dart do not execute immediately is crucial for building robust and performant applications using the language.
