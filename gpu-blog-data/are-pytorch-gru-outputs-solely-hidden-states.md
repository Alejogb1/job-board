The assertion that PyTorch GRU outputs are solely hidden states is an oversimplification.  While the hidden state is the primary output frequently used, the GRU cell architecture inherently produces more than just this single tensor.  My experience working on sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing, specifically machine translation tasks, has highlighted the crucial role of understanding the nuanced output structure of the GRU.  A complete understanding necessitates recognizing both the hidden state and the potential for accessing other internal computations.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) processes sequential data by maintaining an internal hidden state, which encapsulates information from preceding time steps.  This hidden state is updated recursively at each time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state.  The core update mechanism involves three gates:  the update gate (z<sub>t</sub>), the reset gate (r<sub>t</sub>), and a candidate hidden state (h̃<sub>t</sub>).  The equations governing these computations are as follows:

* **Reset Gate:** r<sub>t</sub> = σ(W<sub>r</sub>x<sub>t</sub> + U<sub>r</sub>h<sub>t-1</sub> + b<sub>r</sub>)
* **Update Gate:** z<sub>t</sub> = σ(W<sub>z</sub>x<sub>t</sub> + U<sub>z</sub>h<sub>t-1</sub> + b<sub>z</sub>)
* **Candidate Hidden State:** h̃<sub>t</sub> = tanh(W<sub>h</sub>x<sub>t</sub> + U<sub>h</sub>(r<sub>t</sub> ⊙ h<sub>t-1</sub>) + b<sub>h</sub>)
* **Hidden State Update:** h<sub>t</sub> = (1 - z<sub>t</sub>) ⊙ h<sub>t-1</sub> + z<sub>t</sub> ⊙ h̃<sub>t</sub>

Where:

* x<sub>t</sub> is the input at time step t.
* h<sub>t-1</sub> is the hidden state at time step t-1.
* W<sub>r</sub>, W<sub>z</sub>, W<sub>h</sub> are weight matrices for the input.
* U<sub>r</sub>, U<sub>z</sub>, U<sub>h</sub> are weight matrices for the previous hidden state.
* b<sub>r</sub>, b<sub>z</sub>, b<sub>h</sub> are bias vectors.
* σ is the sigmoid activation function.
* ⊙ represents the element-wise product.

PyTorch's `GRU` implementation provides access to the final hidden state (h<sub>t</sub>) directly.  However, it's crucial to note that the intermediate computations – specifically, r<sub>t</sub>, z<sub>t</sub>, and h̃<sub>t</sub> – are not directly exposed through the standard `forward` pass.  While not readily available, understanding their role allows for a deeper comprehension of the network's internal decision-making process and can be instrumental in debugging or customizing the GRU's behavior.  Depending on the specific application, these intermediate values might offer valuable insights.  For instance, analyzing the update gate (z<sub>t</sub>) can reveal how much information from the previous hidden state is retained versus being overwritten by the new input.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Accessing the Final Hidden State**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input sequence (batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
input_seq = torch.randn(32, 10, 50)

# GRU layer
gru = nn.GRU(input_size=50, hidden_size=100, batch_first=True)

# Forward pass
output, h_n = gru(input_seq)

# Output shape: (batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)  # torch.Size([32, 10, 100])

# h_n shape: (num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)
print("Hidden state shape:", h_n.shape) # torch.Size([1, 32, 100])

# Accessing the final hidden state
final_hidden_state = h_n[-1]
print("Final hidden state shape:", final_hidden_state.shape) # torch.Size([32, 100])
```

This example demonstrates the standard usage, obtaining the final hidden state `h_n`.  Note that `h_n` is a tuple containing the hidden state for each layer.  Since we have a single-layer GRU, we access the last element.

**Example 2:  Custom GRU Module for Intermediate Access (Illustrative)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomGRU(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(CustomGRU, self).__init__()
        self.gru = nn.GRU(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)

    def forward(self, x):
        output, h_n = self.gru(x)
        return output, h_n, self.gru.weight_ih_l0, self.gru.weight_hh_l0 #Example weights


#Input sequence remains the same
custom_gru = CustomGRU(input_size=50, hidden_size=100)
output, h_n, ih_weights, hh_weights = custom_gru(input_seq)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
print("Hidden state shape:", h_n.shape)
print("Input-Hidden weight shape:", ih_weights.shape)
print("Hidden-Hidden weight shape:", hh_weights.shape)

```
This example illustrates how one might (though it's generally not recommended due to potential for errors in larger models) gain access to internal weights, showcasing the complexity beyond the direct hidden state output.  Note: Directly accessing internal weights is generally discouraged unless for specific debugging or model analysis purposes due to potential for unintended modification.

**Example 3:  Utilizing the Output for Further Processing**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assuming a classification task
input_seq = torch.randn(32, 10, 50)
gru = nn.GRU(input_size=50, hidden_size=100, batch_first=True)
output, h_n = gru(input_seq)

#Using the last timestep of the full output sequence instead of just the final hidden state
last_output_timestep = output[:,-1,:] # [Batch_size, Hidden_Size]

# Linear layer for classification
linear_layer = nn.Linear(100, 10)  # 10 output classes
predictions = linear_layer(last_output_timestep)

# ... further processing and loss calculation ...
```
This shows the full output tensor can be directly used instead of only the final hidden state.  Often, utilizing the full output sequence may be necessary, especially in scenarios like sequence labeling where each timestep needs a prediction.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I suggest consulting the official PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on recurrent neural networks and the `nn.GRU` module.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of the mathematical foundations of recurrent neural networks, as presented in standard machine learning textbooks, is beneficial. Finally, reviewing research papers detailing applications of GRUs in similar contexts to your own problem will offer valuable practical insights.  Examining the source code of related projects on platforms like GitHub can also illuminate implementation details.
