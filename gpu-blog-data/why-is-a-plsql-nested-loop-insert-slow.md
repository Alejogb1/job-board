The performance bottleneck in nested loop inserts within PL/SQL in Oracle 12c, and indeed across many Oracle versions, typically stems from the implicit context switching and individual statement parsing inherent in the approach.  My experience troubleshooting similar performance issues across numerous large-scale Oracle projects has consistently highlighted this as the primary culprit. While the seemingly straightforward nature of nested loops belies the underlying complexity, the database's reaction to each individual insert statement within the inner loop proves the performance drag.  This response will detail the issue and demonstrate alternative approaches for improved efficiency.

**1. Detailed Explanation:**

A nested loop insert in PL/SQL operates by iterating through an outer loop, and for each iteration, it executes another loop that inserts rows into a table.  The critical flaw lies in the transactional handling and execution plan generation.  Each insert statement within the inner loop is treated as an independent operation by the Oracle optimizer. This means that for each row inserted, the optimizer needs to:

* **Parse the SQL statement:**  The database must analyze the `INSERT` statement, determine the execution plan, and compile it. This process, though optimized, is still time-consuming, especially when repeated thousands or millions of times.
* **Context switching:**  The database needs to switch between the PL/SQL environment and the SQL environment for each insert, incurring overhead.
* **Commit/Rollback overhead:**  Depending on the transaction management strategy, frequent commits or rollbacks within the inner loop can further amplify the performance degradation.  While autocommit is generally not recommended in such scenarios, the frequency of implicit commits within each insert operation contributes significantly to the issue.
* **Log file writes:**  Each insert generates redo log entries, increasing I/O pressure on the database system. The cumulative effect of numerous individual log writes is a substantial performance penalty.
* **Buffer cache contention:**  Frequent database operations can lead to contention on the shared buffer cache, further slowing down the entire process.

This cumulative overhead vastly outweighs the perceived simplicity of the nested loop approach, especially when dealing with large datasets. The optimal strategy focuses on minimizing these individual operations by batching the inserts.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Nested Loop Insert**

```sql
DECLARE
  TYPE num_table IS TABLE OF NUMBER INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
  outer_loop num_table;
  inner_loop num_table;
BEGIN
  -- Populate outer_loop and inner_loop with data (simulated here)
  outer_loop(1) := 10;
  outer_loop(2) := 20;
  FOR i IN 1..outer_loop.COUNT LOOP
    FOR j IN 1..inner_loop.COUNT LOOP
      INSERT INTO my_table (id, value) VALUES (outer_loop(i) * j, j);
      COMMIT; --Illustrative - Avoid frequent commits!
    END LOOP;
  END LOOP;
END;
/
```

This example demonstrates the problematic approach.  The nested loops, combined with frequent commits, exemplify the performance pitfalls described above. Each `INSERT` statement incurs the overhead of parsing, context switching, and logging.

**Example 2: Improved Performance using `FORALL` Statement**

```sql
DECLARE
  TYPE num_table IS TABLE OF NUMBER INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
  outer_loop num_table;
  inner_loop num_table;
  my_data my_table%ROWTYPE;
  data_bulk my_table%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
  -- Populate outer_loop and inner_loop with data (simulated here)
  outer_loop(1) := 10;
  outer_loop(2) := 20;

  FOR i IN 1..outer_loop.COUNT LOOP
    FOR j IN 1..inner_loop.COUNT LOOP
       my_data.id := outer_loop(i) * j;
       my_data.value := j;
       data_bulk := my_data;
       INSERT INTO data_bulk values my_data;
    END LOOP;
  END LOOP;
  COMMIT;
END;
/
```

This example uses the `FORALL` statement, enabling the batch insertion of data into the target table.  This dramatically reduces the overhead associated with individual statement parsing and context switching.  The `FORALL` statement executes a single optimized SQL statement for multiple inserts, enhancing performance significantly.


**Example 3:  Using a single `INSERT ... SELECT` statement (Most Efficient)**

```sql
DECLARE
  TYPE num_table IS TABLE OF NUMBER INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
  outer_loop num_table;
  inner_loop num_table;
BEGIN
  -- Populate outer_loop and inner_loop with data (simulated)
  outer_loop(1) := 10;
  outer_loop(2) := 20;

  INSERT INTO my_table (id, value)
  SELECT o.val * i.val, i.val
  FROM (SELECT COLUMN_VALUE val FROM TABLE(outer_loop)) o,
       (SELECT COLUMN_VALUE val FROM TABLE(inner_loop)) i;

  COMMIT;
END;
/
```

This approach is generally the most efficient. It avoids explicit looping entirely, leveraging the database's inherent ability to perform bulk operations. The `INSERT ... SELECT` statement constructs the necessary data using a `SELECT` statement and inserts it in a single operation, eliminating the overhead of individual `INSERT` statements in PL/SQL.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of PL/SQL optimization and efficient data manipulation techniques, I would recommend reviewing the Oracle documentation focusing on PL/SQL performance tuning.  Specifically, studying the use of bulk data processing techniques, like `FORALL`, `BULK COLLECT`, and `PIPE ROW` methods, is crucial.  Additionally, researching the capabilities of the Oracle optimizer and how to effectively leverage its features is highly beneficial. Finally, exploring advanced techniques like materialized views and parallel processing, depending on the data volume and table design, may significantly improve performance in scenarios involving extensive data insertions.  Mastering these concepts will allow you to build robust and performant database applications.
