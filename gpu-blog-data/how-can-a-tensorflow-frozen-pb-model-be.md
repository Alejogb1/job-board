The direct conversion of a TensorFlow frozen `.pb` model to a Keras model isn't straightforward;  a frozen graph represents a computation graph stripped of variable definitions, making direct import impossible.  My experience in deploying models for large-scale image processing highlighted this limitation repeatedly.  What one *can* do, however, is reconstruct a Keras model that mirrors the functionality of the frozen `.pb` graph through careful analysis and reconstruction.  This process involves understanding the graph's structure, identifying layers and their parameters, and then replicating this within the Keras framework.  It is crucial to note that this is not an automatic process and requires a degree of reverse engineering.

**1. Understanding the Frozen Graph:**

The first step involves examining the frozen `.pb` file.  Tools like Netron provide a visual representation of the graph, allowing for identification of layers (operations) and their connections.  This graphical visualization allows one to trace the data flow through the model, identifying input and output tensors, and the sequence of operations.  Manually inspecting the graph reveals the types of layers used (convolutional, dense, pooling, etc.), their hyperparameters (kernel size, number of filters, activation functions), and their connectivity.  This detailed understanding is critical to accurately reconstruct the Keras equivalent.  During a project involving a pre-trained object detection model, I found Netron indispensable in deciphering the complex graph structure.

**2.  Reconstructing the Keras Model:**

With a thorough understanding of the `.pb` graph's architecture, the next stage involves creating a corresponding Keras model.  This necessitates utilizing the Keras `Sequential` or `Model` API, depending on the graph's complexity. For simple models, the `Sequential` API offers a straightforward approach.  Complex models, often exhibiting branching or multiple input/output points, require the more flexible `Model` API.  Both methods require carefully defining each layer's parameters to match the frozen graph's layers.  The weights and biases extracted from the `.pb` graph must then be loaded into the corresponding Keras layers.  This loading process typically leverages TensorFlow's `tf.compat.v1.import_graph_def` function (ensure compatibility with your TensorFlow version) to extract the weights and biases.

**3. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with three scenarios representing different complexities.

**Example 1: Simple Sequential Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Assume 'graph_def' contains the imported graph definition from the .pb file
# and 'weights' contains extracted weights (obtained through separate processing)

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1), weights=weights[0]),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', weights=weights[1])
])

# Verify the model architecture against the .pb graph visualization
model.summary()

# Save the reconstructed Keras model
model.save('reconstructed_model.h5')
```

This example demonstrates reconstructing a simple convolutional neural network (CNN).  The `weights` variable (placeholder here) would hold the weight matrices and bias vectors extracted from the frozen graph.  The crucial aspect is aligning the layer types, parameters (filters, kernel size, activation functions), and input/output shapes with the original graph.

**Example 2: Model with Multiple Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (Assume graph_def and weights are loaded as in Example 1) ...

input1 = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
input2 = keras.Input(shape=(10,))

x = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input1)
x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = keras.layers.Flatten()(x)

y = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input2)

merged = keras.layers.concatenate([x, y])

output = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged)

model = keras.Model(inputs=[input1, input2], outputs=output)

# ... (weight loading and saving as before) ...
```

This demonstrates handling multiple inputs.  The Keras `Model` API allows defining multiple input tensors and merging them within the network.  Again, meticulous mapping to the original graph is paramount.  During a project involving multi-modal data, this approach was necessary to successfully recreate the frozen model in Keras.


**Example 3: Handling Custom Layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (Assume graph_def and weights are loaded) ...

# Define a custom layer mirroring a custom operation in the .pb graph
class CustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        # ... (Initialize parameters based on .pb graph analysis) ...

    def call(self, inputs):
        # ... (Implement the custom operation) ...
        return outputs

# ... (Use CustomLayer in the Keras model definition) ...

model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... other layers ...
    CustomLayer(),
    # ... other layers ...
])

# ... (weight loading and saving) ...
```

This example addresses the challenges of custom operations present in some frozen graphs.  Understanding the functionality of the custom operation (often requiring detailed examination of the `.pb` graph) is crucial for creating a matching Keras layer.  I encountered this situation while working with a model incorporating a proprietary normalization layer.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on `tf.compat.v1.import_graph_def` and the Keras API, are essential.  Understanding the TensorFlow graph structure and the different Keras layer APIs is crucial. A good understanding of  graph visualization tools and  weight extraction techniques will prove beneficial.


In conclusion, converting a TensorFlow frozen `.pb` model to a Keras model is not a direct process. It necessitates a thorough understanding of the frozen graph's architecture and careful reconstruction within the Keras framework.  The level of effort varies considerably depending on the model's complexity and the presence of custom operations. The accuracy of the reconstruction critically depends on the precision of analyzing and mapping the `.pb` graph to the Keras model.
