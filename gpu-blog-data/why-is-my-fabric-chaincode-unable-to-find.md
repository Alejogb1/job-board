My experience with Hyperledger Fabric suggests that when a chaincode fails to locate endorsing peers, the root cause frequently lies in a mismatch between the peer discovery configuration and the actual network topology. Specifically, a chaincode invoked by a client needs to determine which peers it can contact for endorsement based on the channel it’s operating in and the policies defined within that channel’s configuration block. If the chaincode’s connection profile, or the peer’s configuration, is not correctly aligned with the network's structure, this can manifest as an inability to find appropriate endorsers. This problem is not often about the chaincode itself but the environment in which it is trying to operate.

The core issue stems from the Fabric network’s reliance on a combination of channel configurations and peer local configurations to establish communication pathways. When a client sends a transaction proposal invoking a chaincode, the SDK, typically utilizing a connection profile, determines which peers are expected to endorse the transaction. This determination is based on the endorsement policy of the specific chaincode and the peer’s membership within the channel. If the peer specified in the SDK connection profile is not recognized as an endorser for the chaincode due to membership or channel-specific configurations, the chaincode will essentially be unable to find a valid endorsing peer. The chaincode itself is passive; it's the infrastructure and the configuration around it that facilitates interaction.

One critical aspect is the peer’s local configuration, particularly the `core.yaml` file. This file dictates which channels a peer has joined and its membership within an organization. The `peer.localMspid` and `peer.mspConfigPath` parameters define its identity, which must correspond to an entry in the channel’s membership configuration. A frequent error is an incorrect `peer.mspConfigPath`, which results in the peer being unable to present a valid identity when contacted for endorsement. If the path is wrong or the MSP configuration is corrupted, the peer will not be identified as a valid member of the channel, preventing chaincode endorsements.

Another common pitfall arises from incorrect channel definitions and associated policies. The channel configuration block, stored in the ledger, includes the membership and endorsement policies governing the channel. These policies specify which organizations, and thus which peers, are authorized to endorse transactions for different chaincodes. If the chaincode's endorsement policy requires endorsement by a set of organizations that are not included in the connection profile or if the peer initiating the transaction is not part of a valid endorsing organization, the endorsement process will fail. Furthermore, it's not sufficient to merely add a peer to a channel; the organization’s MSP must also be correctly included in the channel’s configuration block, and this needs to be aligned with what the endorsing peers’ config files expects.

The client application also plays a crucial role. The application's connection profile dictates how the client connects to the network. A misconfigured profile, such as an incorrect peer address, an incorrect MSP identifier, or referencing peers that are not part of the channel's endorsers, will prevent the SDK from identifying valid endorsing peers. For example, the connection profile may specify peers from a different organization, or it may use outdated address information after peers have been restarted or reconfigured. Consequently, the application fails to connect to peers authorized to endorse the chaincode's execution and fails to discover the correct peers.

Let's examine some common scenarios through code examples.

**Code Example 1: Incorrect Peer Address in Connection Profile**

This example demonstrates a scenario where the connection profile lists an incorrect address for a peer, preventing it from being discovered by the client application. Assume that there is a Fabric setup where a peer named `peer0.org1.example.com` has its gRPC service running at `peer0.org1.example.com:7051`. The connection profile might contain something like this:

```json
{
    "peers": {
        "peer0.org1.example.com": {
             "url": "grpcs://peer0.org1.example.com:7052",
             "tlsCACerts": {
                "path": "./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt"
             },
              "grpcOptions": {
                "ssl-target-name-override": "peer0.org1.example.com"
              }
        }
     }
}
```

In this scenario, the connection profile specifies port 7052 for `peer0.org1.example.com`, when in fact the peer is listening on 7051. The client application will attempt to connect to the peer at the wrong address, resulting in a failure to discover the correct endorsers for the invoked chaincode.  The connection will fail before it can even make a transaction proposal. The error messages in the client application will indicate a connection refusal or a failure to establish gRPC communication, which is not explicitly an endorsement error but is the underlying cause. This highlights how critical accurate networking information is.

**Code Example 2: Incorrect MSP ID in the Connection Profile**

In this example, a common error is specifying the incorrect MSP ID for the organization in the connection profile. The MSP ID is a vital parameter that ensures that the client operates using the correct identity within the network and, therefore, can interact with peers of the right organization. The connection profile might look like this:

```json
{
    "client": {
       "organization": "Org2MSP",
       "credentialStore": {
            "path": "./tmp/msp/keystore",
            "cryptoStore": {
                "path": "./tmp/msp"
             }
       }
    },
    "organizations": {
         "Org1MSP": {
             "mspid": "Org1MSP",
                "peers": ["peer0.org1.example.com"]
        },
        "Org2MSP": {
                "mspid": "Org2MSP",
                 "peers": ["peer0.org2.example.com"]
        }
    }
}
```

Here, the client is configured to use `Org2MSP` identity while the intention might be to interact with a chaincode endorsed by members of `Org1MSP`.  If the channel's endorsement policy requires signatures from peers belonging to `Org1MSP` and the client attempts to invoke the chaincode using `Org2MSP` identity, the client won't find any valid endorsers even if `peer0.org2.example.com` exists and is operational. Because the MSP doesn't match, the proposal is not sent. The SDK will filter out the peer based on the MSP configuration and prevent any proposal being sent to that peer, leading to a failure to find an endorsing peer. The problem is not with the peers but that they are being approached with the wrong identity.

**Code Example 3: Peer Not Joined to Required Channel**

This scenario deals with a more direct configuration problem with the peer. Consider a situation where you are using the Fabric Node SDK, and while you’ve configured your profile correctly, the peer itself is not joined to the intended channel. The peer configuration might appear correct, but the underlying peer’s operational state is not aligned with the client’s expectations. In this case, when a transaction is invoked with the node SDK, you'd might see:

```javascript
const channel = client.getChannel('mychannel');
const request = {
    chaincodeId: 'mychaincode',
    fcn: 'query',
    args: ['arg1']
};

// Attempt to send the transaction proposal
const proposalResponses = await channel.sendTransactionProposal(request);
// Check if any proposal responses succeeded
if(!proposalResponses || proposalResponses.length === 0)
{
   console.error("No endorsing peer was found")
   return
}
```

If `peer0.org1.example.com` (specified in the connection profile) is specified as an endorser, but the peer had not been joined to `mychannel`, the `channel.sendTransactionProposal(request)` function may return empty response arrays. This is because while the client SDK believes the peer should be available for endorsements, the peer itself is not operational within the required channel context. It may be operational within a different channel, but for the client's current request, it's effectively invisible to the chaincode endorsement process. The error message is often generic – failing to find an endorser - without pointing directly to the fact that the peer is not joined to a channel. Examining the peer logs is then the next necessary step.

When facing "endorsing peer not found" issues, several strategies are useful. First, rigorously verify the connection profile against the network configuration. Specifically, ensure that peer addresses, MSP IDs, and channel names are accurate. Second, validate the peer’s configuration. This includes the correct MSP configuration path and the list of channels the peer has joined. Use the `peer channel list` command to ensure the peer is a member of the required channel. Third, meticulously examine the channel’s configuration block using tools like `configtxlator` to understand the defined endorsement policies for the chaincode. The policy definition will state which organizations’ signatures are required.

For further understanding, consult the Hyperledger Fabric documentation, particularly the sections on network configuration, MSP setup, channel configuration, and peer operations. The documentation on building client applications with the SDK also offers valuable insight into how profiles are loaded and used for transaction invocation. Lastly, the Fabric troubleshooting guide is a helpful resource when diagnosing and resolving complex configuration related issues. By systematically addressing these areas, the root cause of chaincode endorsement failures can usually be identified and resolved.
