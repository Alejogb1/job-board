The "OutOfRangeError: End of sequence" encountered during TensorFlow training on Google Cloud ML Engine (GCP-ML Engine) when utilizing TFRecords stems fundamentally from an exhaustion of the data within the TFRecord dataset being fed to the model.  This isn't merely a matter of insufficient data volume; rather, it arises from a mismatch between the dataset's actual size and the training configuration, often manifesting as an incorrect specification of the dataset's length or an improper handling of the input pipeline.  My experience resolving this across numerous large-scale projects on GCP-ML Engine highlights the critical need for precise dataset size estimation and meticulous input pipeline design.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The error originates within TensorFlow's input pipeline.  When using `tf.data.TFRecordDataset`, the dataset is treated as a sequence.  The training loop iterates through this sequence to fetch batches of data.  If the training loop attempts to access an element beyond the last element of the sequence – essentially, trying to read past the end of the file(s) – the `OutOfRangeError` is raised. This discrepancy often manifests due to one or more of the following:

* **Incorrect `num_epochs`:**  This parameter in the training configuration specifies the number of times the entire dataset should be iterated over.  An incorrectly high value will lead to the error, as the loop attempts to iterate beyond the available data.
* **Dataset size mismatch:** The actual number of records within the TFRecord files might be smaller than expected or estimated during the pipeline design phase. This can result from data preprocessing errors, inconsistencies during the TFRecord creation, or simply an incorrect calculation of the total number of records.
* **Faulty input pipeline:** A poorly designed input pipeline can cause unexpected behavior. Issues such as inefficient shuffling, incorrect batching sizes, or improper use of prefetching can inadvertently lead to attempting to access beyond the available data, even with the correct `num_epochs`.
* **Parallelism issues:** When using multiple workers in distributed training, improper coordination of data access can cause one worker to prematurely reach the end of the dataset while others haven't, triggering the error on that specific worker.

Addressing the `OutOfRangeError` necessitates a thorough examination of these four areas.  The solution generally involves refining the data pipeline, verifying the dataset size, and adjusting training parameters accordingly.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correctly handling epochs and dataset size**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming 'train_data.tfrecord' contains the data
dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset('train_data.tfrecord')

# Determine the number of records - Crucial step often overlooked
num_records = sum(1 for _ in tf.data.TFRecordDataset('train_data.tfrecord'))

# Define the batch size
batch_size = 32

# Define the number of epochs – calculated from total record count
num_epochs = 3

# Create a pipeline with correct parameters
dataset = dataset.repeat(num_epochs).shuffle(buffer_size=num_records).batch(batch_size)

# Iterate through the dataset – no OutOfRangeError expected here
for batch in dataset:
    # Process batch
    pass

```

This example demonstrates the importance of accurately determining the number of records in the `TFRecord` file. The `num_epochs` is set based on this count, preventing attempts to access data beyond the file's limit. The `shuffle` operation utilizes the entire dataset's buffer size, enhancing randomization without leading to indexing errors.

**Example 2: Handling potentially variable-sized datasets:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(['train_data_part1.tfrecord', 'train_data_part2.tfrecord'])
dataset = dataset.interleave(lambda x: tf.data.TFRecordDataset(x), cycle_length=2, block_length=1)

# ... (rest of the pipeline as above)

```

Here, we handle the possibility of having the dataset split across multiple `TFRecord` files. Using `interleave` enables a more robust approach for handling datasets where the exact number of records across the files may not be known a priori. The `cycle_length` and `block_length` values need to be tuned based on your dataset.

**Example 3: Implementing a robust input pipeline with error handling:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def process_record(record):
    # ... (parse record features) ...
    return features

dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset('train_data.tfrecord')
dataset = dataset.map(process_record)
dataset = dataset.batch(32, drop_remainder=True) # Drop any incomplete batches
dataset = dataset.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

try:
    for batch in dataset:
        # Process batch
        pass
except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError as e:
    print(f"Caught OutOfRangeError: {e}")
    # Handle the error gracefully – e.g., log, stop training, etc.

```

This example incorporates a `try-except` block to catch the `OutOfRangeError`. This allows for graceful handling of the exception instead of an abrupt crash, a crucial feature for production-level training.  `drop_remainder=True` prevents partial batches, potentially causing indexing problems, while `prefetch` optimizes pipeline performance.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation regarding `tf.data`, particularly focusing on the creation, manipulation, and optimization of `TFRecordDatasets`. The TensorFlow tutorials focusing on distributed training and data input pipelines are also invaluable. Additionally, reviewing articles and blog posts on best practices for large-scale TensorFlow training on GCP-ML Engine would prove beneficial. Carefully examining error logs generated during training sessions on GCP-ML Engine is crucial for pinpointing the source of the problem.  Thorough testing of the dataset creation pipeline and its interaction with your chosen training parameters should prevent such errors before deployment to a larger scale.  Finally, understanding the intricacies of the `tf.data` API, along with the nuances of distributed training frameworks within TensorFlow, is vital to avoiding such pipeline issues.
