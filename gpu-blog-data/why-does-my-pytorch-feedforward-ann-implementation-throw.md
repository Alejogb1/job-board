The root cause of a "RuntimeError: element 0 of tensors does not require grad..." in a PyTorch feedforward ANN, particularly one triggered by varying input data, stems from a mismatch between computational graph construction and autograd tracking of tensors within that graph. Specifically, if a tensor, which is intended to have gradient tracking enabled, loses this property before reaching the loss function, the backward pass will fail because derivatives cannot be computed for a non-grad tensor. I've personally debugged this issue numerous times in my work on neural network implementations, often finding that it is a subtle consequence of tensor manipulation before the backpropagation step.

The core principle here is that PyTorch's autograd mechanism, essential for training neural networks, constructs a dynamic computational graph based on operations performed on tensors with `requires_grad=True`. This flag signals to PyTorch that these tensors participate in gradient computation during the backpropagation phase. Operations on these tensors, in turn, also result in tensors that require gradients if at least one input tensor requires a gradient. When an operation involves a tensor that does not require a gradient, the resulting tensor often defaults to not requiring a gradient. If a tensor intended for backpropagation loses its gradient tracking, the autograd engine cannot traverse back through the computational graph because it cannot obtain gradients required for parameter updates. The "element 0 of tensors" in the error message specifically references the first element of the input tensor passed to the loss function, indicating this is where the gradient tracking fails.

Variations in input data can exacerbate this problem because certain conditions in processing your data can inadvertently drop `requires_grad=True` flags. These conditions often result from common tensor operations and conversion types, not from errors within the actual neural network architecture itself. For example, if I’ve had a tensor that required gradients, performed an indexing operation with that tensor, and used the indexing result, the result of this indexing operation may default to not tracking gradients, unless specifically told to do so with `.clone().detach()`. This is especially problematic if the indexing is a conditional operation that's input-dependent. Similarly, in-place operations like `+=` or `*=`, while efficient, can also alter existing tensors and sometimes remove the autograd property of a tensor.

Furthermore, it’s important to understand that converting a tensor to a Numpy array, using `.item()`, or using methods that move tensors between CPU and GPU (`.cpu()` and `.cuda()`) can often lead to detached tensors that do not require gradients when converted back to tensors. The issue is typically not within the network itself but in how the input data are prepared before entering the network and how the network’s output is handled before reaching the loss calculation. Let’s consider three specific scenarios with code examples to illustrate this.

**Example 1: Errant Indexing**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleANN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleANN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 5
output_size = 1

model = SimpleANN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

input_data = torch.randn(1, input_size, requires_grad=True)
# Input dependent indexing, this can detach gradients
index = torch.randint(0, 2, (1,1), dtype=torch.long)
truncated_data = input_data[:,index.squeeze()]

# Corrected: Cloned and detached tensor with autograd
# truncated_data = input_data[:,index.squeeze()].clone().detach().requires_grad_(True)

output = model(truncated_data)
target = torch.randn(1, output_size, requires_grad=True)
loss = loss_fn(output, target)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward() # This will throw error
optimizer.step()
```

In this example, the indexing operation using the variable index creates `truncated_data` that does not retain the gradient requirement. Even if `input_data` had `requires_grad=True`, the indexing with an integer index tensor often detaches the gradient. Using `clone().detach().requires_grad_(True)` is crucial here to prevent the error.

**Example 2: NumPy Conversion**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

class SimpleANN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleANN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 5
output_size = 1

model = SimpleANN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

input_data = torch.randn(1, input_size, requires_grad=True)
output_np = model(input_data).detach().numpy()

# Incorrect, converting back removes gradients
output = torch.from_numpy(output_np)
# Corrected re-creating tensor with gradients
# output = model(input_data)

target = torch.randn(1, output_size, requires_grad=True)
loss = loss_fn(output, target)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

In this snippet, converting the output to a NumPy array using `.numpy()` and then back to a PyTorch tensor using `torch.from_numpy()` effectively breaks the gradient flow. When you convert to numpy, the tensor loses its associated graph and thus, the gradient tracking is lost.  The correct approach is to keep the tensor in the PyTorch domain until the loss function computation or perform `requires_grad_(True)` after conversion.

**Example 3: In-place Operations**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleANN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleANN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        # Incorrect in place operation, this detaches grad
        x += 0.1 
        # Correct: non inplace version
        #x = x + 0.1
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 5
output_size = 1

model = SimpleANN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

input_data = torch.randn(1, input_size, requires_grad=True)
output = model(input_data)
target = torch.randn(1, output_size, requires_grad=True)
loss = loss_fn(output, target)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

Here, the in-place addition `x += 0.1` alters the tensor, potentially disrupting its gradient tracking. When dealing with a tensor that requires gradients, in-place operations should be avoided when the resulting tensor will be needed for gradient computation. A non-in-place addition `x = x + 0.1` will correctly maintain gradient tracking.

To effectively debug this specific PyTorch error, I would recommend focusing on the data flow between the point where the input data is created and the point where the loss function is evaluated. Pay particular attention to tensor indexing operations, conversions between PyTorch tensors and NumPy arrays, and usage of in-place tensor operations. Consult the PyTorch documentation on autograd, specifically regarding the `requires_grad` flag and its implications, and the documentation on tensor creation and manipulation operations. Several excellent online tutorials offer thorough explanations of the autograd system and should be consulted as well. By carefully managing tensor properties and tracking their gradient requirements, this error can be avoided.
