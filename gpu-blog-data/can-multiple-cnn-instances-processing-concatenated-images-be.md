The efficacy of using multiple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process concatenated images prior to a dense layer in Keras hinges critically on the nature of the image data and the intended application.  My experience optimizing image classification models for satellite imagery reveals that while conceptually feasible, this architecture necessitates careful consideration of several factors to avoid performance degradation or redundancy.  Direct concatenation without appropriate feature engineering often results in a high-dimensional feature space that can overwhelm the subsequent dense layer, leading to overfitting and computational inefficiencies.

**1. Explanation:**

The fundamental idea is to leverage the specialized processing capabilities of multiple CNNs, each potentially tuned to extract different features from the concatenated image.  For example, one CNN might focus on texture analysis, while another might specialize in edge detection.  These individually extracted features are then concatenated and fed into a dense layer for classification or regression.  However, this approach only yields benefits if each CNN extracts truly independent and informative features. If the CNNs extract overlapping or redundant information, the concatenated feature vector becomes unnecessarily large, increasing computational cost and potentially hindering generalization.

This architecture contrasts with a single, larger CNN processing the entire concatenated image. A single CNN, with sufficient depth and complexity, could potentially learn all the necessary features from the concatenated input.  The advantage of using multiple CNNs lies in the potential for parallel processing and the possibility of leveraging pre-trained models tailored to specific aspects of the image.  This modularity can also simplify model development and debugging.  However, careful consideration must be given to the choice of CNN architectures, the concatenation strategy, and the dimensions of the dense layer to avoid the pitfalls mentioned earlier.

The success depends heavily on feature engineering.  If the concatenated images represent distinct but related visual information, partitioning the processing across multiple specialized CNNs might be advantageous.  However, if the information is highly correlated, a single CNN is likely to be more efficient and yield better results.  The optimal approach involves extensive experimentation and analysis of the data.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Concatenation with Independent CNNs:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, concatenate, Input

# Define input shape (assuming grayscale images)
input_shape = (128, 128, 1)

# Define CNN 1
input_cnn1 = Input(shape=input_shape)
cnn1 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_cnn1)
cnn1 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(cnn1)
cnn1 = Flatten()(cnn1)

# Define CNN 2
input_cnn2 = Input(shape=input_shape)
cnn2 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_cnn2)
cnn2 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(cnn2)
cnn2 = Flatten()(cnn2)

# Concatenate features
merged = concatenate([cnn1, cnn2])

# Dense layer
dense = Dense(128, activation='relu')(merged)
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(dense) # Example: 10 classes

# Create model
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_cnn1, input_cnn2], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Model summary for inspection
model.summary()
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward concatenation of features from two independent CNNs.  Each CNN processes a separate input image (presumably part of the concatenated image).  The flattened outputs are then joined before feeding into the dense layers.  The model requires two inputs.  Note the use of `concatenate` to combine feature vectors.


**Example 2: Shared Convolutional Layers followed by specialized branches:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, concatenate, Input

input_shape = (128, 128, 1)
input_img = Input(shape=(128, 128, 2)) #Input of concatenated image (2 channels)

#Shared layers
shared_conv = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_img)
shared_conv = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(shared_conv)

#Branch 1
branch1 = Conv2D(16,(3,3), activation='relu')(shared_conv)
branch1 = Flatten()(branch1)

#Branch 2
branch2 = Conv2D(16,(3,3), activation='relu')(shared_conv)
branch2 = Flatten()(branch2)


merged = concatenate([branch1, branch2])
dense = Dense(128, activation='relu')(merged)
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(dense)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_img, outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()

```

This exemplifies a more sophisticated approach where initial convolutional layers are shared, extracting general features, followed by specialized branches.  This reduces redundancy and computational cost compared to Example 1.  Note that the input is a single concatenated image with two channels.


**Example 3:  Handling Different Input Sizes with Reshaping:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, concatenate, Input, Reshape

#Define CNN1 input
input_shape1 = (64, 64, 1)
input_cnn1 = Input(shape=input_shape1)
cnn1 = Conv2D(32,(3,3), activation='relu')(input_cnn1)
cnn1 = MaxPooling2D((2,2))(cnn1)
cnn1 = Flatten()(cnn1)


#Define CNN2 input
input_shape2 = (128, 128, 1)
input_cnn2 = Input(shape=input_shape2)
cnn2 = Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu')(input_cnn2)
cnn2 = MaxPooling2D((2,2))(cnn2)
cnn2 = Flatten()(cnn2)

#Concatenation with handling different shapes
merged = concatenate([cnn1, cnn2])

#Dense layer
dense = Dense(128, activation='relu')(merged)
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(dense)

model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_cnn1, input_cnn2], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

This example addresses the scenario where the input images to the individual CNNs have different dimensions.  Note the different input shapes for `input_cnn1` and `input_cnn2`.  Careful consideration of feature map dimensions is crucial to ensure compatibility during concatenation.  This method often requires reshaping or padding to achieve alignment.

In conclusion, while using multiple CNN instances with concatenated images is a valid approach, it’s not inherently superior to using a single, well-designed CNN.  The optimal architecture depends significantly on the characteristics of the data and the problem being solved.  Through careful consideration of feature engineering and architectural choices, as illustrated by the examples, one can harness the potential benefits of this approach, avoiding the pitfalls of redundancy and computational overhead.  Rigorous experimentation and performance evaluation are paramount to determining the efficacy of this strategy for any given application.
