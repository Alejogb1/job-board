The fundamental advantage of successive TensorFlow training over a single training iteration stems from the inherent limitations of gradient descent optimization algorithms and the stochastic nature of data used in machine learning.  A single training pass, while computationally cheaper, often results in suboptimal model parameters, failing to adequately explore the loss landscape and leading to poor generalization on unseen data.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects consistently demonstrated this limitation.  Successive training allows for iterative refinement of model weights, leading to improved performance and reduced risk of converging to local minima.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core concept revolves around the iterative nature of gradient descent.  Gradient descent algorithms, fundamental to TensorFlow's training process, aim to minimize the loss function by iteratively adjusting model parameters based on the gradient of the loss with respect to those parameters.  A single training iteration provides only a single update to these parameters, based on a limited view of the entire dataset (often a mini-batch).  This limited view can lead to inaccurate gradient estimations, potentially moving the parameters in a direction that does not genuinely reduce the loss across the entire dataset.

Furthermore, the stochastic nature of mini-batch gradient descent introduces noise into the gradient calculation.  Each mini-batch presents a slightly different statistical representation of the data, leading to noisy gradient estimations.  A single iteration, being influenced by this inherent noise, can produce a significant deviation from the true optimal direction of parameter update.  Successive iterations, however, allow for averaging out this noise.  The repeated updates, each informed by a different mini-batch, gradually lead to a more accurate estimate of the true gradient direction, guiding the parameters towards a better minimum of the loss function.

The phenomenon of getting stuck in local minima also necessitates successive training.  The loss landscape of many machine learning models is complex and highly non-convex, potentially containing numerous local minima.  A single training iteration might inadvertently converge to a suboptimal local minimum.  By continuing the training process through successive iterations, the model has a greater opportunity to escape such local minima and explore the loss landscape more thoroughly, ultimately reaching a more globally optimal solution.  My experience with recurrent neural networks for time series forecasting underscored this fact – early stopping without sufficient epochs invariably led to poor predictive performance.

Finally,  regularization techniques, such as weight decay or dropout, often require multiple training iterations to demonstrate their effectiveness. These techniques introduce penalties into the loss function, pushing the model towards simpler and more generalizable solutions.  Their impact is cumulative, with successive iterations gradually shaping the model's parameters towards better generalization, which is often not observable in a single iteration.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Linear Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 2*X + 1 + 0.1*np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Define model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')

# Single iteration training
model.fit(X, y, epochs=1, verbose=0)
print("Single Iteration Weights:", model.get_weights())

# Successive iteration training
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)
print("Successive Iteration Weights:", model.get_weights())
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the difference in model weights after a single training iteration versus 100 iterations.  The successive training will yield weights closer to the true underlying relationship between X and y, minimizing the mean squared error (MSE). The single iteration will likely have significantly larger error due to the stochastic nature of the gradient updates.

**Example 2:  MNIST Digit Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Single Epoch Training
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1, verbose=0)
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print("Single Epoch Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Multiple Epoch Training
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print("Multiple Epoch Accuracy:", accuracy)

```

*Commentary:* This example showcases the impact of successive training on a more complex model.  The single epoch training will demonstrate a relatively low accuracy due to the insufficient exploration of the loss landscape and the impact of random weight initialization. Successive epochs will lead to significant improvement in accuracy as the model learns the underlying features of the MNIST dataset. The dropout layer's effectiveness is also apparent only after multiple training epochs.


**Example 3:  Custom Loss Function with Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define custom loss function with L2 regularization
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    mse = tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
    l2_reg = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(model.weights[0])) # L2 on weights of first layer
    return mse + 0.01 * l2_reg #Regularization strength adjusted

# ... Data generation and model definition as in Example 1 ...

# Compile model with custom loss
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss)

# Single iteration training
model.fit(X, y, epochs=1, verbose=0)
print("Single Iteration Loss:", model.evaluate(X,y,verbose=0)[0])

# Successive iteration training
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)
print("Successive Iteration Loss:", model.evaluate(X,y,verbose=0)[0])

```

*Commentary:* This highlights the importance of successive training when using custom loss functions and regularization. The regularization term in the loss function requires multiple iterations to effectively influence the model's weights and prevent overfitting.  A single iteration will show limited impact of the regularization, whereas successive training would demonstrate the effect on model complexity and generalization.
