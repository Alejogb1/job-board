TensorFlow 2.0's `CuDNNLSTM` layer is inherently tied to NVIDIA's CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN), hence its name.  This means it requires a compatible NVIDIA GPU for operation.  Attempting to utilize it on a CPU-only system will result in a runtime error, irrespective of whether the inference process is involved. There is no direct equivalent like a "CuDNNCompatibleLSTM" for CPU execution within TensorFlow's core API.  This stems from the fundamental architectural differences between how cuDNN optimizes LSTM computations on GPUs versus the CPU-bound approaches TensorFlow employs.  My experience working on large-scale NLP projects for several years has consistently reinforced this limitation.

**1. Explanation of the Underlying Issue:**

The performance advantage of `CuDNNLSTM` hinges on cuDNN's highly optimized kernels designed for parallel processing on NVIDIA GPUs.  These kernels leverage the massively parallel architecture of GPUs to significantly accelerate the computationally intensive matrix multiplications and other operations intrinsic to LSTM cells.  In contrast, CPUs rely on a fundamentally different architecture with fewer cores and limited parallel processing capabilities.  While TensorFlow does offer CPU-based LSTM implementations (using the standard `LSTM` layer), these are not optimized to the same degree as cuDNN's GPU-specific kernels.  Attempting to force `CuDNNLSTM` onto a CPU ignores this core architectural disparity. The library will fail to find the necessary CUDA runtime environment, resulting in an error.  This is not a matter of configuration or a missing flag; it's a direct consequence of the layer's design and dependencies.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

To illustrate this, consider these three code snippets, each attempting a different (and ultimately unsuccessful) approach to running `CuDNNLSTM` on a CPU:

**Example 1:  Direct Use on CPU**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(1000, 64, input_length=10),
    tf.keras.layers.CuDNNLSTM(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# This will fail if no CUDA-compatible GPU is available.
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

This straightforward example demonstrates the immediate problem.  If a CUDA-capable GPU is not detected, the `model.fit()` call will raise an error, typically indicating a missing CUDA runtime or incompatible hardware.  This error manifests even during inference, as the model's weights cannot be loaded without the GPU support that `CuDNNLSTM` necessitates.

**Example 2:  Attempting Device Placement (Unsuccessful)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Embedding(1000, 64, input_length=10),
        tf.keras.layers.CuDNNLSTM(64),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

This example tries to explicitly force the model onto the CPU using `tf.device('/CPU:0')`.  However, this will also fail. The `CuDNNLSTM` layer itself is not designed to operate on the CPU, regardless of device placement directives. The error will likely be the same as in Example 1, indicating the core incompatibility. My experience suggests that explicit device placement does not override the inherent CUDA dependency of `CuDNNLSTM`.

**Example 3:  Switching to Standard LSTM (Successful)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(1000, 64, input_length=10),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64), # Replaced CuDNNLSTM with standard LSTM
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

This final example showcases the correct approach.  By replacing `CuDNNLSTM` with the standard `LSTM` layer, the model becomes compatible with CPU execution.  While the performance might be lower compared to the GPU-accelerated `CuDNNLSTM`, it will execute without errors. This is the only viable solution for CPU-based inference.  During my work on resource-constrained projects, I routinely utilized this strategy to ensure compatibility across various hardware configurations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's LSTM implementations and their underlying mechanisms, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on layers and performance optimization.  Additionally, a comprehensive text on deep learning, covering recurrent neural networks and their implementation details, would prove highly beneficial.  Finally, exploring the cuDNN documentation itself provides valuable insights into the GPU-specific optimizations employed.  These resources provide a more nuanced comprehension of the fundamental differences and thereby clarify the inherent limitations addressed in the original question.
