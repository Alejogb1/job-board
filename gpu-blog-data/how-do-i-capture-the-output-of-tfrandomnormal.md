The `tf.random.normal()` function in TensorFlow, while inherently generating random values, does not inherently produce output that can be directly "captured" in the sense of saving it as a static, reproducible sequence. Each call generates new, independent samples based on the specified parameters. Understanding this inherent randomness is paramount to correctly handling its output in a model building or analysis context. What one typically aims to achieve is either 1) to utilize the sampled values within a computation, 2) to control and reproduce these random sequences, or 3) to inspect the general statistical properties of many independently sampled sequences. I’ll address each of these use cases.

First, the most common usage pattern for `tf.random.normal()` is to incorporate its output directly into the construction of a TensorFlow graph, the core of a TensorFlow model. For instance, during the initialization of weights in a neural network, random values are frequently sampled, shaped and then assigned as trainable parameters of the model. In such a context, there is no need to explicitly save the output of `tf.random.normal()` for later use; it serves its purpose by providing the initial random values that are then changed through gradient descent during training.

However, there are instances where the values generated by `tf.random.normal()` might require inspection or reproduction. In these situations, the standard approach does not involve “capturing” the output, as the output is only materialised when the computational graph is evaluated. The goal is rather to make the generation process reproducible. This is achieved by leveraging the concept of random number generator seeds. Setting a specific seed prior to calling `tf.random.normal()` will ensure that the random sequence will be the same each time you execute that specific section of the code. This feature is critical for reproducible research, consistent experimentation, and debugging.

To use `tf.random.normal()`, and more broadly, any of the TensorFlow random number generators, in a reproducible manner, there are two primary approaches. The first and most commonly used is to rely on the “global seed” of the graph. Prior to executing any TensorFlow operations involving random number generation, you set the global seed via `tf.random.set_seed(seed_value)`. Any operations that occur after that call that are stochastic will be reproducible provided that no other global seed call takes place before their execution. Critically, TensorFlow does not guarantee intersession reproducibility if the global seed approach is used.

The second, more robust approach, uses `tf.random.Generator`. This approach provides better control and enables reproducibility even across multiple sessions. This method involves creating an instance of the `tf.random.Generator` class with a specific seed and then using the instance methods, like `.normal()` to generate your random samples. This is my usual methodology as I have found it provides more fine-grained control over my experiments.

Let’s look at code examples to illustrate these ideas:

**Example 1: Global Seed for Reproducibility**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Set the global seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# Generate random values
random_tensor_1 = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 3))
random_tensor_2 = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 3))

#Print the random tensors.
print("First Tensor:\n",random_tensor_1)
print("\nSecond Tensor:\n",random_tensor_2)

# Run again, notice they are the same
tf.random.set_seed(42)
random_tensor_3 = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 3))
random_tensor_4 = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 3))

print("\nFirst Tensor again:\n",random_tensor_3)
print("\nSecond Tensor again:\n",random_tensor_4)
```

This example demonstrates the usage of `tf.random.set_seed()`. When the script is run, the `random_tensor_1` and `random_tensor_2` will be different from each other, and the second time you see `random_tensor_3` and `random_tensor_4` are the same as `random_tensor_1` and `random_tensor_2`. This shows that setting the seed ensures that calling `tf.random.normal()` produces the same random values each time.

**Example 2: `tf.random.Generator` for Enhanced Control**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a random number generator with a specific seed
generator = tf.random.Generator.from_seed(123)

# Generate random values using the generator instance
random_tensor_5 = generator.normal(shape=(2, 3))
random_tensor_6 = generator.normal(shape=(2, 3))

#Print the random tensors.
print("First Tensor:\n",random_tensor_5)
print("\nSecond Tensor:\n",random_tensor_6)


# Create another random number generator with the same seed
generator2 = tf.random.Generator.from_seed(123)
random_tensor_7 = generator2.normal(shape=(2, 3))
random_tensor_8 = generator2.normal(shape=(2, 3))

print("\nFirst Tensor again:\n",random_tensor_7)
print("\nSecond Tensor again:\n",random_tensor_8)
```

Here, instead of relying on a global seed, an instance of `tf.random.Generator` is created and used for sampling. Critically, by creating multiple `tf.random.Generator` instances with the same seed, the same random numbers will be generated. In practice, I usually initialise a random number generator for each module of my code, and I also pass this generator instance as an argument to any functions that need to make use of stochastic operations.

**Example 3: Inspecting the distribution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set seed for reproducible example
tf.random.set_seed(42)
generator = tf.random.Generator.from_seed(42)

#Generate a large number of samples
samples = generator.normal(shape=(10000,))

# convert to a numpy array for visualisation
samples_np = samples.numpy()

#Plot the histogram of the distribution.
plt.hist(samples_np, bins=50, alpha=0.75)
plt.title("Histogram of tf.random.normal() output")
plt.xlabel("Value")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```

In this example, we use `tf.random.normal()` to generate a substantial quantity of samples from a normal distribution, which is then visualised. By using this technique we can check that the sampled values are distributed in a way that is consistent with what we would expect. The use of `tf.random.set_seed()` ensures we can reproduce the same plot. This methodology is useful when debugging the random behaviour of complex systems. The `.numpy()` function is employed here to convert the `tf.Tensor` object to a NumPy array to make it compatible with the plotting functionality.

To further enhance your understanding and practice with TensorFlow random number generation, I strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow API documentation focusing on `tf.random`. Also, exploring tutorials and examples that explain how to use the different random number generation tools, with special attention paid to the difference between the “global seed” approach and the “Generator” approach. Furthermore, books dedicated to TensorFlow and Deep Learning provide theoretical and practical guidance on when to use specific initialisation strategies. I find that working through code examples from the official guides for TensorFlow is usually an effective way to learn. Finally, experiment with setting seeds, generating distributions, and visualising output to deepen your understanding of the functionality and the underlying mechanisms of TensorFlow's random number generation.
