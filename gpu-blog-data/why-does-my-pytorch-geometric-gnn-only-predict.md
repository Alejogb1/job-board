GNN model outputs in PyTorch Geometric often collapse to a single prediction when a crucial aspect of the final classification or regression layer is misconfigured. My experience, spanning several large graph analysis projects at a research lab focused on social network behavior modeling, indicates this typically originates from insufficient output dimensionality in the model’s final layers. The core problem isn't necessarily the GNN architecture, which usually learns robust representations, but the way these representations are mapped to prediction space.

The root cause often lies in the *linear projection layer* following the final GNN convolution. Typically, you intend for the model to output a vector of probabilities corresponding to each class if it is a classification task, or the corresponding numerical value for a regression task. If this projection layer produces an output with only a single element, regardless of the input features it receives, then the model will always predict the same value (or a single-element vector), rendering the learning and feature propagation of the GNN layers ineffective. Specifically, this often happens when the *out_channels* parameter of the final Linear layer isn't properly specified to match the number of desired outputs.

To diagnose and correct this, begin by inspecting the output shape of your final projection layer. PyTorch Geometric typically uses standard PyTorch layers, like `torch.nn.Linear`. If your task is classification and you have *N* classes, your final layer should produce a vector of size *N*, after which you might apply a `softmax` operation, or pass it to CrossEntropy Loss (which handles both steps). Similarly, for regression, you’ll typically want a single output (though multi-output regressions are possible). This is achieved through the *out_features* parameter of the Linear layer. Misconfiguring it to ‘1’ in a multi-class classification problem would be where we would see this behavior. I’ve personally run into this issue countless times during rapid prototyping, primarily due to copy-pasting code segments without adjusting dimensionalities.

Here are three code examples illustrating the problem and its solutions.

**Example 1: Incorrect Output Dimension**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

class SimpleGCN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, num_classes):
        super(SimpleGCN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.lin = nn.Linear(hidden_channels, 1) # INCORRECT: Should be num_classes

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.lin(x)
        return x

# Example usage
num_nodes = 10
num_node_features = 5
num_classes = 3 # Expected classes
hidden_dimension = 16

edge_index = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
                           [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]], dtype=torch.long)
node_features = torch.randn(num_nodes, num_node_features)

model = SimpleGCN(num_node_features, hidden_dimension, num_classes)
output = model(node_features, edge_index)
print("Output shape:", output.shape) # Output: torch.Size([10, 1]) instead of [10,3]
```

In this first example, the final `nn.Linear` layer is set to output a single channel (`out_features=1`). Although the earlier GCN layers learn node-level representations, the final projection collapses them to a single value per node. Consequently, if a `softmax` function is applied to this vector or if it is directly passed to `CrossEntropyLoss`, all nodes will effectively receive the same predicted label (or value, in case of regression), defeating the purpose of using a GNN. The model does not learn to differentiate between nodes with different labels. The output shape will be `(num_nodes, 1)` instead of what was intended.

**Example 2: Correct Output Dimension for Classification**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

class CorrectGCN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, num_classes):
        super(CorrectGCN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.lin = nn.Linear(hidden_channels, num_classes) # CORRECT

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.lin(x)
        return x

# Example Usage (Same Data as Before)
num_nodes = 10
num_node_features = 5
num_classes = 3
hidden_dimension = 16

edge_index = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
                           [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]], dtype=torch.long)
node_features = torch.randn(num_nodes, num_node_features)

model = CorrectGCN(num_node_features, hidden_dimension, num_classes)
output = model(node_features, edge_index)
print("Output shape:", output.shape) # Output: torch.Size([10, 3])
```

In this corrected version, the `nn.Linear` layer now produces `num_classes` outputs. The model will now output a vector for each node corresponding to its predicted class probabilities, ready to be used for multi-class classification tasks. The output shape will now be `(num_nodes, num_classes)`, providing the flexibility required for learning.  The `num_classes` variable, passed to the model’s initialization, dynamically sets the size of the final output vector to match the classification task at hand.

**Example 3: Correct Output Dimension for Regression**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

class RegressionGCN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels):
        super(RegressionGCN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.lin = nn.Linear(hidden_channels, 1)  # CORRECT for regression

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.lin(x)
        return x

# Example Usage
num_nodes = 10
num_node_features = 5
hidden_dimension = 16

edge_index = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
                           [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]], dtype=torch.long)
node_features = torch.randn(num_nodes, num_node_features)

model = RegressionGCN(num_node_features, hidden_dimension)
output = model(node_features, edge_index)
print("Output shape:", output.shape) # Output: torch.Size([10, 1])
```

This final example illustrates a regression scenario.  The final `nn.Linear` layer is configured to produce a single output (`out_features=1`). For regression, this behavior is expected since we often want to predict a single numerical value for each node. Note that if a multi-output regression is desired, the output layer would need to be adjusted appropriately. If the model was used with a classification objective (e.g. CrossEntropyLoss), a similar problem as Example 1 would occur.  It is critical to ensure that your output dimensionality matches your learning objective.

Beyond this primary problem, other potential but less common causes for such a single-label output could involve the *loss function* or the *training data*. If your loss function is improperly configured, for example, using `nn.L1Loss` for a multi-class classification instead of `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, or if your training labels are all identical, the model may not receive the necessary gradient signal to learn the distinctions between the classes. The loss function should be appropriate to the task, and the training data needs diversity.

For further exploration, I recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation, specifically concerning `torch.nn.Linear` and the various loss functions within the `torch.nn` module. Additionally, a good understanding of the underlying mathematical principles of convolution, especially the parameterization of linear projection layers, is beneficial. Researching best practices in PyTorch Geometric, particularly concerning the initialization of the last layer and training data preparation, should provide the tools to troubleshoot the problem. Furthermore, scrutinizing the shape of outputs after each major operation in the model (like convolutions and projections) will allow you to pinpoint issues quicker.
