Within TensorFlow, accessing element-wise gradients of a tensor requires meticulous interaction with `tf.GradientTape`. The core challenge is that `GradientTape` automatically tracks operations, enabling differentiation with respect to trainable `tf.Variable` objects, not arbitrary tensors. Therefore, to obtain gradients for a specific tensor element, I need to explicitly watch the tensor using `tape.watch()`. This nuanced approach avoids tracking gradients for the entire computation graph, improving performance and memory usage in scenarios with complex computations.

My experience building a custom neural network component for image segmentation demonstrated the significance of this precise control. I needed to calculate gradients of a feature map with respect to a specific input pixel to understand its influence. Simply using `tape.gradient(my_feature_map, my_input)` was insufficient, it provided the gradients of the entire map concerning the input. Instead, I needed a gradient of a specific feature map element concerning a specific input element. This was the context where I discovered the importance of `tape.watch()`, which allowed me to watch the feature map as a constant, and consequently calculate the gradients of the individual elements I needed to analyze.

Let's begin with a fundamental illustration: calculating the gradient of a single scalar within a larger tensor. Assume we have a tensor, `x`, and we aim to find the gradient of the element at index `[1, 2]` relative to itself. Because we're differentiating with respect to a tensor element and not a `tf.Variable`, the tensor itself needs to be explicitly watched by the `GradientTape`. In this scenario, the gradient should be a tensor of the same shape as x with a 1 at `x[1, 2]` and zeros elsewhere.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])
target_index = [1, 2]

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x)  # Watch 'x' as a constant.
    target_element = x[target_index[0], target_index[1]]  # Obtain our target element.

gradients = tape.gradient(target_element, x) # Obtain gradients relative to the target element.

print("Tensor x:")
print(x.numpy())
print("\nGradients of x w.r.t. element at index [1, 2]:")
print(gradients.numpy())

# Expected Output
# Tensor x:
# [[1. 2. 3.]
# [4. 5. 6.]
# [7. 8. 9.]]
#
# Gradients of x w.r.t. element at index [1, 2]:
# [[0. 0. 0.]
# [0. 0. 1.]
# [0. 0. 0.]]

```

In this example, `tape.watch(x)` informs the `GradientTape` to track the operations involving `x` so the gradient can be computed. The `tape.gradient` then computes the partial derivative of `target_element` with respect to each element of `x`, which results in a tensor with 1 at the target index and zero at every other location. Without `tape.watch(x)`, TensorFlow would not track `x` and the result would be None.

Next, let's analyze a more complex case involving a matrix multiplication. Suppose I want to investigate the gradients of an intermediate result. Specifically, I'm calculating `z = tf.matmul(x,y)` and want to know the gradient of `z[0, 0]` relative to matrix `x`. This requires watching the `x` tensor, and accessing the element at `z[0,0]` after computation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
target_index = [0, 0]

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x)
    z = tf.matmul(x, y)
    target_element = z[target_index[0], target_index[1]]

gradients = tape.gradient(target_element, x)

print("Tensor x:")
print(x.numpy())
print("\nTensor y:")
print(y.numpy())
print("\nTensor z = matmul(x, y):")
print(z.numpy())
print("\nGradients of x w.r.t. element z[0, 0]:")
print(gradients.numpy())

# Expected Output
# Tensor x:
# [[1. 2.]
# [3. 4.]]
#
# Tensor y:
# [[5. 6.]
# [7. 8.]]
#
# Tensor z = matmul(x, y):
# [[19. 22.]
# [43. 50.]]
#
# Gradients of x w.r.t. element z[0, 0]:
# [[5. 7.]
# [0. 0.]]

```

Here the `matmul` operation is a function `f(x,y)`, and we are calculating `partial(f(x,y)[0,0])/partial(x)`. The result is a matrix of same shape as x where each element is equal to the respective derivative of `z[0,0]` wrt to element of `x`.

Finally, let's explore the case where an operation is applied to a tensor before obtaining the target element, like applying a `tf.reduce_sum` operation, and investigate the effect it has on calculating the gradients. In my experience, this approach of watching a tensor before subsequent operations is useful when investigating the effect of a transformation on gradients. Assume, for example, that I am calculating a sum and want to see how this affects the gradient of an arbitrary tensor element with respect to the summed tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
target_index = [1, 0]

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch(x)
  reduced_x = tf.reduce_sum(x)
  target_element = reduced_x

gradients = tape.gradient(target_element, x)

print("Tensor x:")
print(x.numpy())
print("\nReduced Tensor = sum(x):")
print(reduced_x.numpy())
print("\nGradients of x w.r.t. the summed tensor:")
print(gradients.numpy())

# Expected Output
# Tensor x:
# [[1. 2. 3.]
# [4. 5. 6.]]
#
# Reduced Tensor = sum(x):
# 21.0
#
# Gradients of x w.r.t. the summed tensor:
# [[1. 1. 1.]
# [1. 1. 1.]]

```
In this case, the result showcases a key aspect of `GradientTape` behavior. Because the target element is a scalar after the `reduce_sum` operation, the gradient of that scalar with respect to tensor `x` is `1.0` for every element of `x`. This is because every element of `x` contributes equally to the sum. This shows how a `reduce_sum` operation affects the overall gradient calculation when considering an individual element relative to the original tensor.

In summary, calculating element-wise tensor gradients involves careful use of `tape.watch()` combined with `tape.gradient()`. The key idea is to explicitly tell the `GradientTape` to treat your target tensor as a constant in order to calculate the gradient relative to each specific element. The process includes three key steps: 1) define the tensors and the desired element, 2) use `tape.watch()` to track the target tensor, and 3) calculate gradients by using the `tape.gradient()` function which then provides the gradients of the selected element with respect to the input tensor.

For further study on this subject, I would suggest reviewing TensorFlow's official documentation focusing on `tf.GradientTape`. Furthermore, consult resources that delve into automatic differentiation and computational graphs, which provide valuable context on how TensorFlow computes gradients. Finally, I recommend examining examples in the TensorFlow examples repository, particularly the code that implements custom layers and operations, for more practical insight into the use of `GradientTape` in complex scenarios. Through deliberate experimentation and study, one can master the process of computing accurate, specific, and performant tensor element gradients with GradientTape.
