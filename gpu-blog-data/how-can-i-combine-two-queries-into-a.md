The core challenge in combining two distinct `SELECT` queries without `UNION` hinges on leveraging the underlying data structure and relational properties.  Directly joining the results necessitates a shared attribute or a logical relationship between the datasets.  A straightforward `UNION` obscures this underlying relationship; avoiding it demands a deeper understanding of how the data is organized.  My experience working with complex data warehousing projects for over a decade has underscored the importance of this principle, often requiring intricate restructuring to avoid the performance overhead associated with `UNION` operations on large datasets.

**1. Explanation:**

The most effective strategy to consolidate two separate queries into a single subquery, excluding `UNION`, relies on either a `JOIN` operation, a conditional `CASE` statement within a single `SELECT`, or a clever manipulation of `WHERE` clauses, depending on the specific relationship between the data involved.

A `JOIN` is applicable when both queries select from tables that share a common column.  The nature of the join (inner, left, right, full outer) depends on the desired outcome, dictating whether to include matching rows only (inner) or also rows from one table that lack matches in the other (outer joins).

The `CASE` statement provides flexibility when the queries target different columns within the same table, or when combining results requires conditional logic based on data values.  In such cases, the `CASE` statement acts as a conditional aggregator, consolidating different selection criteria within a single query.

Manipulating `WHERE` clauses proves useful when the queries differ solely in their selection criteria. This method works by building a more complex, composite `WHERE` clause encompassing both conditions.  However, this approach is limited to situations where the queries share a common base table and the conditionals can be logically combined.

Choosing the appropriate method depends entirely on the structure and relationship between the datasets targeted by the original queries. Careful analysis of the schemas and the desired output is crucial before implementing any of these techniques.  Incorrectly applied `JOIN` conditions can lead to Cartesian products or incorrect data aggregation, while flawed `CASE` statements can produce unexpected results or require additional handling of `NULL` values.  Improperly constructed `WHERE` clauses can lead to unintended filtering of data.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Using JOIN**

Let's say we have two queries: one retrieving customer information and another retrieving their corresponding order totals.  Assuming both tables, `customers` and `orders`, share a `customer_id` column:

Original Queries:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, name, email FROM customers;
SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_total) AS total_spent FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;
```

Combined Query using JOIN:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.name, 
    c.email, 
    COALESCE(SUM(o.order_total), 0) AS total_spent
FROM 
    customers c
LEFT JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.name, c.email;
```

This `LEFT JOIN` ensures all customer information is included, even if they haven't placed any orders (in which case `total_spent` will be 0 due to `COALESCE`).  An `INNER JOIN` would exclude customers without orders.


**Example 2: Using CASE**

Suppose we have a single table, `products`, with columns `product_name`, `category`, and `price`, and we want to retrieve the total value of products in two separate categories: 'Electronics' and 'Clothing'.

Original Queries:

```sql
SELECT SUM(price) AS electronics_total FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics';
SELECT SUM(price) AS clothing_total FROM products WHERE category = 'Clothing';
```

Combined Query using CASE:

```sql
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN category = 'Electronics' THEN price ELSE 0 END) AS electronics_total,
    SUM(CASE WHEN category = 'Clothing' THEN price ELSE 0 END) AS clothing_total
FROM products;
```

This `CASE` statement conditionally sums the price based on the product category, achieving the same result as the two original queries in a single statement.

**Example 3: Using WHERE with logical operators**

Consider a table `users` with columns `user_id`, `username`, and `status`. We want to select users with `status` 'active' and users with `username` starting with 'J'.

Original Queries:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE 'J%';
```

Combined Query with WHERE clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active' OR username LIKE 'J%';
```

This utilizes the `OR` operator within the `WHERE` clause to combine both selection criteria into a single query.  The `AND` operator could be used if both conditions must be met simultaneously.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting a comprehensive SQL textbook, focusing on chapters detailing `JOIN` operations, subqueries, and conditional statements.  A deeper understanding of relational algebra and database normalization principles is also highly beneficial.  Thorough documentation for your specific database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) is invaluable for understanding any system-specific syntax or optimization strategies.  Finally, practicing with diverse datasets and progressively complex queries will greatly enhance your ability to efficiently combine queries without relying on `UNION`.
