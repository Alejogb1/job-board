Symfony's handling of the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) for AJAX requests is fundamentally tied to the browser's inherent security mechanisms, rather than being a feature explicitly implemented within the framework itself.  My experience working on numerous high-security web applications built with Symfony has consistently shown that the framework provides a robust environment for *following* SOP, but doesn't override or circumvent it.  This means developers bear the responsibility of ensuring their AJAX requests adhere to the policy to avoid Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Same-Origin Policy is a crucial browser security feature designed to prevent malicious scripts from one origin (a combination of protocol, domain, and port) from accessing data from a different origin.  Symfony doesn't directly manage this policy; instead, it facilitates the process of making AJAX requests that conform to it.  When a Symfony application sends an AJAX request, the underlying browser handles the SOP check. If the request's origin matches the target's origin, the browser allows the request; otherwise, it's blocked, and the request fails.

Symfony's role lies in providing tools and structures to perform AJAX requests effectively.  Its built-in features, such as the `HttpFoundation` component and its integration with JavaScript frameworks like jQuery or native Fetch API, allow for concise and well-structured AJAX calls. However, the responsibility of managing the origin aspects remains with the developer. They must ensure that the URLs used in AJAX requests originate from the same protocol, domain, and port as the target server.  Failing to do so results in a CORS error, typically signaled by a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header mismatch.

Addressing CORS violations requires configuration on the *server-side*, specifically on the server receiving the AJAX request. This is often handled by configuring the webserver (like Apache or Nginx) or using middleware (in the case of Symfony) to explicitly allow requests originating from specific domains.  This is distinct from Symfony's core functionality and usually involves configuring headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, etc.  Symfony itself doesn't inherently add these headers unless specifically configured.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how to make AJAX requests in Symfony, emphasizing the importance of adhering to SOP.  Note that these examples do not handle CORS explicitly; they simply demonstrate how to execute AJAX requests within the Symfony framework. Handling CORS requires server-side configuration, as discussed above.

**Example 1: Using jQuery (within a Symfony Twig template):**

```javascript
<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $.ajax({
      url: "{{ path('my_ajax_route') }}", // This route must be on the same origin
      type: "GET",
      success: function(response) {
        // Handle successful response
        console.log(response);
      },
      error: function(xhr, status, error) {
        // Handle errors, including CORS errors
        console.error("AJAX request failed: " + error);
      }
    });
  });
</script>
```

This snippet demonstrates a basic AJAX request using jQuery.  The crucial aspect here is the `url` parameter, which should point to a route defined within the same Symfony application.  If this URL points to a different origin, the browser will block the request due to SOP.

**Example 2: Using Fetch API (within a Symfony Twig template):**

```javascript
<script>
  fetch('{{ path('my_ajax_route') }}') //This route must be on the same origin
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      // Handle the JSON response
      console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      // Handle errors, including CORS errors
      console.error('Error:', error);
    });
</script>
```

This example showcases the use of the modern Fetch API. Similar to jQuery, the URL must originate from the same application to avoid SOP violations. The `catch` block handles potential errors, including CORS-related issues.

**Example 3:  Symfony Controller handling an AJAX request:**

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

class AjaxController extends AbstractController
{
    #[Route('/ajax', name: 'my_ajax_route', methods: ['GET'])]
    public function ajaxAction(Request $request): JsonResponse
    {
        $data = ['message' => 'This is an AJAX response'];
        return new JsonResponse($data);
    }
}
```

This controller demonstrates a simple route specifically designed to handle AJAX requests.  The `JsonResponse` object ensures the response is appropriately formatted for AJAX consumption.  This code doesn't handle CORS; it's the responsibility of the webserver or middleware to handle that aspect.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of AJAX, I recommend consulting the official documentation of your chosen JavaScript framework (jQuery, Fetch API, etc.). For a comprehensive grasp of CORS, delve into the relevant sections of the HTTP specification and web server configuration documentation.  Finally, exploring security best practices specific to web application development will provide valuable insights into mitigating potential vulnerabilities related to cross-origin requests.  Understanding how to properly configure webserver headers and utilizing Symfony's security features are crucial components to consider.  Reviewing the Symfony documentation on security will also be very helpful.
