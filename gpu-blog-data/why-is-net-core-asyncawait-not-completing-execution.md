In my experience, a frequent cause of .NET Core asynchronous operations failing to complete, even when employing `async`/`await`, stems from improper handling of the asynchronous flow itself, particularly in situations involving blocking operations or mismanaged task lifecycles. Simply adding `async` to a method signature and awaiting operations does not guarantee the asynchronous workflow will propagate correctly if the underlying implementation is synchronous or if task continuations are not handled properly.

The core principle behind `async`/`await` is syntactic sugar built upon the `Task` and `Task<T>` classes. When an `async` method encounters an `await` expression, the compiler generates code that asynchronously suspends execution of that method, returning control to the caller. This mechanism is not automatic magic; it requires that the awaited operation itself returns a `Task` that properly signals completion (or failure). The problem emerges when this awaited `Task` never transitions to a completed state because it is executing synchronous code, or if the overall asynchronous chain gets broken. If a blocking operation occurs within a supposedly asynchronous task, it effectively prevents the task from ever signalling completion. This issue is frequently disguised by the lack of an immediately obvious crash, leading to the method hanging indefinitely. The code appears correct but the expected behaviour never materializes.

Let me illustrate this with several scenarios I've encountered, where seemingly correct async/await code failed due to underlying synchronous behaviour, improper task chaining, and context related deadlocks.

**Scenario 1: Blocking operations within an async method**

Consider this initial code snippet, meant to read data from a file:

```csharp
public async Task<string> ReadFileContentsAsync(string filePath)
{
   Console.WriteLine("ReadFileContentsAsync started");
   using (var reader = new StreamReader(filePath))
    {
      // Synchronous operation lurking here
      string contents = reader.ReadToEnd();
      Console.WriteLine("ReadFileContentsAsync finished");
      return contents;
    }
}
```

This code, on the surface, appears to use `async`. The `ReadFileContentsAsync` method is marked `async Task<string>`. However, `StreamReader.ReadToEnd()` is a synchronous blocking operation. This effectively ties up the thread on which the method is executing, preventing it from being released back to the thread pool, and thus the asynchronous operation will never truly relinquish control. The problem arises from the fact that `async` allows a method to return to its caller while awaiting, but if it is held up by a synchronous call, that ability does not translate into an asynchronous flow.

A corrected version would use the async counterpart of `ReadToEnd()`, `ReadToEndAsync()`:

```csharp
public async Task<string> ReadFileContentsAsync(string filePath)
{
  Console.WriteLine("ReadFileContentsAsync started");
    using (var reader = new StreamReader(filePath))
    {
       string contents = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
      Console.WriteLine("ReadFileContentsAsync finished");
      return contents;
    }
}
```

Here, the `await reader.ReadToEndAsync()` allows the `ReadFileContentsAsync` method to suspend execution, yielding control to the caller, and the underlying I/O operation occurs asynchronously. The task returned by `ReadToEndAsync()` signals completion (or failure), and the execution of `ReadFileContentsAsync` is resumed.

**Scenario 2: Forgetting to Await a Task**

The following code illustrates an issue stemming from improperly chaining asynchronous operations:

```csharp
public async Task ProcessDataAsync(List<string> files)
{
  Console.WriteLine("ProcessDataAsync Started");
    foreach (var file in files)
    {
      //The results are being discarded!
       ReadFileContentsAsync(file);
    }
  Console.WriteLine("ProcessDataAsync Finished");
}
```

The `ProcessDataAsync` method intends to read content from multiple files. It calls `ReadFileContentsAsync` in a loop. However, the task returned by `ReadFileContentsAsync` is not awaited. Therefore, the `foreach` loop proceeds without waiting for each read operation to finish. `ProcessDataAsync` immediately hits "ProcessDataAsync Finished" and returns, potentially before any files have been read. The asynchronous operations will be executing, but their completion is not tied to the overall `ProcessDataAsync` method.

The corrected version will `await` each task to ensure that the read operations have completed before moving to the next.

```csharp
public async Task ProcessDataAsync(List<string> files)
{
    Console.WriteLine("ProcessDataAsync Started");
    foreach (var file in files)
    {
      await ReadFileContentsAsync(file);
    }
    Console.WriteLine("ProcessDataAsync Finished");
}
```

By adding the `await`, we ensure `ProcessDataAsync` waits for the completion of `ReadFileContentsAsync` for each file, effectively creating the intended asynchronous workflow, where all read operations happen sequentially within the larger asynchronous context.

**Scenario 3: Context Capture and Deadlocks**

In certain scenarios, especially within UI frameworks or legacy contexts, the captured synchronization context may lead to deadlocks if misused within an async operation. Consider this (incorrect) code:

```csharp
public async Task<string> ExecuteWithContextAsync()
{
   Console.WriteLine("ExecuteWithContextAsync Started");
  // Simulate a long running async operation
    await Task.Delay(1000);

    // Try to perform a synchronous operation that REQUIRES the UI thread
    // In this case, imagine we are accessing an UI element (e.g. setting the title of a form).
    // This will cause a DEADLOCK because the captured context (UI thread) is trying to complete
    // the async operation while it's being blocked by the synchronous work being done here
    string result = await Task.Run(() => GetUIString());

     Console.WriteLine("ExecuteWithContextAsync Finished");
    return result;
}

private string GetUIString()
{
    // Fictional method that requires running on the original context
    // e.g. window.Title = "some title";
    return "Some UI text";
}

```

In UI frameworks, methods often need to interact with the UI thread. `async` methods, by default, capture the current synchronization context (often the UI thread). When `Task.Run` is used as an escape hatch to perform synchronous operations that must happen on the UI thread, this captured context can lead to a deadlock. The `Task.Run` work item is queued to the thread pool, but the context it needs to return to will never become available.

One effective approach to circumvent this issue is to use `.ConfigureAwait(false)` when awaiting `Task` objects that are unrelated to the context. This prevents the async method from attempting to resume on the original captured context. The corrected version becomes:

```csharp
public async Task<string> ExecuteWithContextAsync()
{
  Console.WriteLine("ExecuteWithContextAsync Started");
    // Simulate a long running async operation
    await Task.Delay(1000).ConfigureAwait(false);

    // The context is released now and the work item can return on any thread
    string result = await Task.Run(() => GetUIString()).ConfigureAwait(false);
     Console.WriteLine("ExecuteWithContextAsync Finished");
    return result;
}

private string GetUIString()
{
    // Fictional method that requires running on the original context
    // e.g. window.Title = "some title";
    return "Some UI text";
}
```
By adding `.ConfigureAwait(false)`, I'm instructing the runtime to not attempt to resume execution on the captured context, removing the condition for a deadlock. This allows execution to continue on any threadpool thread and resolve successfully. It should be noted that this should not be done if operations must happen on the original context after the `await` statement.

In summary, `async`/`await` alone does not guarantee asynchronous execution; the underlying implementation must also be asynchronous. It is imperative to avoid blocking operations within asynchronous contexts, ensure all tasks are correctly awaited, and be mindful of the synchronization context when executing code that may have context dependencies.
