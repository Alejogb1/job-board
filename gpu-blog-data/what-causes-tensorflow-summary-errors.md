TensorFlow summary errors typically stem from mismatches between the graph being executed and the summary operations defined within it.  My experience troubleshooting these issues over several large-scale machine learning projects has consistently pointed to a few root causes: incorrect variable scoping, inconsistent session management, and improper use of `tf.summary` API calls. These errors manifest in various ways, from cryptic messages about unavailable tensors to seemingly random failures during the writing process.  Let's examine these causes and their associated solutions.


**1. Incorrect Variable Scoping:**

TensorFlow's variable scoping mechanism is crucial for organizing and managing variables within a computational graph.  Summary operations, which record metrics during training, need to reference the variables they intend to monitor.  If the scope of a summary operation doesn't match the scope of the variable it attempts to access, a `NotFoundError` is often the result.  This occurs because TensorFlow searches for the specified tensor within the specified scope, and if the variable resides in a different scope, it cannot be found.

For instance, if a variable `my_variable` is defined within a scope named `model`, attempting to summarize it outside that scope will fail.  This issue is often exacerbated in complex models with nested scopes or dynamically created variables.  Careful attention to naming conventions and consistent use of `tf.name_scope` or `tf.variable_scope` is essential.


**Code Example 1: Incorrect Scoping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.name_scope('model'):
    my_variable = tf.Variable(0.0, name='my_variable')
    # Correct usage within the same scope
    tf.summary.scalar('my_variable/value', my_variable)

# Incorrect usage outside the scope
tf.summary.scalar('my_variable/value_incorrect', my_variable) # This will likely fail

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # ... further training code ...
    writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs', sess.graph)
    # ... summary writing code ...
    writer.close()
```

In this example, the second `tf.summary.scalar` call is likely to produce an error because `my_variable` is not directly accessible outside the 'model' scope. The correct method, shown in the first summary call, directly addresses this by ensuring the summary operation exists within the same scope as the variable.


**2. Inconsistent Session Management:**

TensorFlow's session handles the execution of the computational graph.  Summary operations are part of this graph, and therefore require an active and properly initialized session to operate.  Errors frequently arise from improperly managing sessions, such as failing to initialize variables or closing the session prematurely before writing summaries.  Additionally, trying to write summaries from a session that has already been closed will, naturally, lead to failure.  Always ensure the session is active and the variables are initialized before executing summary operations.

**Code Example 2: Session Management Issues**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

my_variable = tf.Variable(0.0)
tf.summary.scalar('my_variable', my_variable)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Incorrect: Missing variable initialization
    writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs', sess.graph)
    summary = tf.summary.merge_all()
    # ... Attempting to run summary operation without initialization will fail
    sess.run(summary)
    writer.close()

# Correct approach:
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs', sess.graph)
    summary = tf.summary.merge_all()
    # ...Now running this will be successful...
    summary_result = sess.run(summary)
    writer.add_summary(summary_result, 0)
    writer.close()
```

This example illustrates the necessity of initializing variables (`tf.global_variables_initializer()`) before attempting to run summary operations. Failure to do so will result in an error, indicating the absence of the required tensor in the session. The corrected version shows the appropriate sequence.

**3. Improper Use of `tf.summary` API:**

The `tf.summary` API offers several functions for recording various types of data (scalars, histograms, images, etc.).  Errors can occur due to incorrect usage of these functions â€“ providing incompatible data types, omitting necessary arguments, or failing to merge summaries correctly.  For instance, attempting to summarize a tensor with an incorrect data type (e.g., a string tensor for a scalar summary) will result in a type error.  Similarly, neglecting to use `tf.summary.merge_all()` to consolidate all summary operations into a single op before writing will prevent summaries from being recorded.

**Code Example 3: Incorrect Summary Usage**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

my_variable = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) #A tensor, not a scalar

#Incorrect - Trying to summarize a tensor as a scalar
tf.summary.scalar('my_tensor', my_variable)  #This will fail

#Correct approach - Use tf.summary.histogram for tensors
tf.summary.histogram('my_tensor', my_variable)

# Merge all summaries before writing
merged_summary_op = tf.summary.merge_all()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs', sess.graph)
    summary = sess.run(merged_summary_op)
    writer.add_summary(summary, 0)
    writer.close()

```

This exemplifies the importance of choosing the correct summary function based on the data type.  Attempting to use `tf.summary.scalar` for a tensor will lead to an error.  The corrected version utilizes `tf.summary.histogram`, which is appropriate for this scenario.  The use of `tf.summary.merge_all()` ensures all summaries are combined for efficient writing.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on variable scoping, session management, and the `tf.summary` API, provide invaluable guidance.  Additionally,  exploring the error messages themselves is crucial; they often provide specific details pinpointing the source of the problem.  A well-structured debugging approach involving print statements to check tensor shapes and values at various points in the graph can be very effective.  Finally, searching relevant Stack Overflow questions and answers can yield solutions to specific problems.  Careful review of the TensorFlow API reference helps understand the function parameters and expected inputs for each function. These sources, combined with a methodical debugging strategy, will effectively resolve most TensorFlow summary errors.
