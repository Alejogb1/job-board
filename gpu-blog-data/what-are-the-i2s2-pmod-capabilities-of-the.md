The NEXSYS A7 board, employing the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, presents a flexible architecture for audio processing and digital signal interfacing, particularly through its PMOD (Peripheral Module) connectors. These connectors, when configured for I2S (Inter-IC Sound) communication, unlock the potential for high-fidelity audio input and output, though their capabilities require careful consideration of hardware limitations and the underlying FPGA resources. Based on my experience developing embedded audio systems, the I2S2 PMOD on the NEXSYS A7 isn't inherently a dedicated I2S peripheral; it relies on configurable FPGA logic and general-purpose I/O (GPIO). This distinction impacts how users implement and leverage the interface.

Firstly, understanding the term 'I2S2 PMOD' is crucial. There isn't a discrete, dedicated I2S peripheral labeled as "I2S2" on the NEXSYS A7. Instead, this term usually refers to one of the PMOD connectors being configured via user-defined FPGA logic to emulate an I2S interface. The '2' likely distinguishes this I2S implementation from another, if present, or from other potential I2S peripherals on a more complex system. I’ve often found that a lack of clarity in the documentation leads to user confusion here. A user essentially needs to create the I2S controller using the available FPGA resources. This means defining signals like Bit Clock (BCLK), Word Select (WS), and Serial Data (SD) on specific PMOD pins and developing the logic to manage data transfer according to the I2S protocol.

The I2S protocol is a serial, synchronous communication interface primarily used for transmitting digital audio data. It requires three primary signals: BCLK for synchronizing data, WS to designate the active audio channel (left or right), and SD for the actual audio samples. The NEXSYS A7, lacking a dedicated I2S hardware controller, necessitates that these signals are driven by FPGA logic. This provides maximum flexibility in implementation but requires careful consideration of timing, sample rate, and bit resolution. Furthermore, bidirectional I2S, which could include a master data line and a slave data line, can be accomplished with additional configuration. In my work, I've commonly employed Verilog or VHDL to design these custom I2S controllers.

The maximum achievable sample rate and bit depth using the I2S2 PMOD depend greatly on the specific FPGA resources allocated, the clock frequency, and overall design complexity. While technically, high sample rates like 192 kHz at 24-bit are feasible, practical limitations often necessitate compromises. It's important to consider the logic resource usage, clocking stability, and the performance of any subsequent audio processing pipeline on the FPGA.

Now let’s look at some code examples. The first example shows basic Verilog code to define the PMOD pins and generate a basic I2S clock:

```verilog
module i2s_basic_clock (
    input  clk,      // System clock
    output bclk,     // Bit clock
    output ws       // Word select
);

parameter CLK_FREQ   = 100000000; // Clock Frequency 100MHz
parameter SAMPLE_RATE  = 48000;  // Sample Rate 48kHz

reg [31:0] counter_bclk;
reg bclk_reg;

reg ws_reg;
parameter BITS_PER_SAMPLE = 16;

localparam BCLK_PERIOD = (CLK_FREQ / (SAMPLE_RATE * BITS_PER_SAMPLE*2)) -1;

assign bclk = bclk_reg;
assign ws = ws_reg;


always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (counter_bclk >= BCLK_PERIOD) begin
        counter_bclk <= 0;
        bclk_reg <= ~bclk_reg;

    end else begin
        counter_bclk <= counter_bclk + 1;
    end

end

always @(posedge clk) begin
	if(counter_bclk == 0)
		ws_reg <= ~ws_reg;
end


endmodule
```

This rudimentary code generates a bit clock (bclk) at a specified frequency and a word select (ws). It’s vital to calculate `BCLK_PERIOD` accurately based on the system clock and the desired sample rate. In my own past projects, miscalculation here was a common cause of I2S data misalignment. This simple code only provides the timing signals. A proper I2S controller would also require the management of the SD pin based on the generated timing.

Next, let’s consider an example that includes a simple data generation to push audio to the SD pin:

```verilog
module i2s_tx (
    input  clk,      // System clock
    input reset,
    output bclk,     // Bit clock
    output ws,       // Word select
    output sd        // Serial data
);

parameter CLK_FREQ   = 100000000;
parameter SAMPLE_RATE  = 48000;
parameter BITS_PER_SAMPLE = 16;

reg [31:0] counter_bclk;
reg bclk_reg;

reg ws_reg;


localparam BCLK_PERIOD = (CLK_FREQ / (SAMPLE_RATE * BITS_PER_SAMPLE*2)) - 1;


reg [BITS_PER_SAMPLE-1:0] audio_data;
reg [3:0] state;
reg [4:0] bit_counter;

assign bclk = bclk_reg;
assign ws = ws_reg;
assign sd = audio_data[BITS_PER_SAMPLE-1];

localparam IDLE = 0;
localparam SEND_DATA = 1;
localparam WAIT_END = 2;



always @(posedge clk) begin
    if(reset) begin
		counter_bclk <= 0;
		bclk_reg <= 0;
    	ws_reg <= 0;
    	state <= IDLE;
    	bit_counter <=0;
    end else begin
		 if (counter_bclk >= BCLK_PERIOD) begin
        	counter_bclk <= 0;
        	bclk_reg <= ~bclk_reg;

    	end else begin
        	counter_bclk <= counter_bclk + 1;
    	end
    	
    	
    	if(counter_bclk == 0)
			ws_reg <= ~ws_reg;
			
		
		case(state)
			IDLE : begin
				if(ws_reg) begin //Start when left channel is active
					state <= SEND_DATA;
					bit_counter <=0;
					audio_data <= $random; // Generate random audio sample
				end
			end
			
			SEND_DATA: begin
				if(bit_counter < BITS_PER_SAMPLE-1) begin
					bit_counter <= bit_counter + 1;
					audio_data <= {audio_data[BITS_PER_SAMPLE-2:0], 1'b0}; // Shift left
				end else begin
					state <= WAIT_END;
				end
			end
			
			WAIT_END: begin
				if(~ws_reg)
					state <= IDLE;
			end
		endcase
	end

end

endmodule
```

This example enhances the previous one by generating a pseudorandom audio data stream and sending it out through the `sd` pin. It introduces the concept of a state machine to manage data transmission in accordance with the BCLK and WS. I’ve seen numerous cases where users overlook the proper handling of data shifts in I2S, leading to distorted audio signals. In real systems, this `audio_data` line would be fed by some form of analog to digital converter, memory source, or a digital synthesis unit.

Finally, let's briefly demonstrate how one might connect this to the PMOD pins in a top-level design:

```verilog
module top_level (
    input  clk,      // System clock
    input reset,
	
	output  pmod_bclk,
	output  pmod_ws,
	output  pmod_sd
);

  wire bclk_internal;
  wire ws_internal;
  wire sd_internal;

  i2s_tx i2s_instance (
    .clk(clk),
    .reset(reset),
    .bclk(bclk_internal),
    .ws(ws_internal),
	 .sd(sd_internal)
  );

  assign pmod_bclk = bclk_internal;
  assign pmod_ws = ws_internal;
  assign pmod_sd = sd_internal;

endmodule

```
This very basic top-level module instantiates the `i2s_tx` module and directly connects the internal I2S signals to the `pmod_*` outputs. In a real application, `pmod_bclk`, `pmod_ws`, and `pmod_sd` would need to be constrained in the FPGA constraints file to match the desired PMOD pin. I've observed many new users struggle to map their desired internal signals to the actual hardware, a crucial step that is often overlooked.

For further learning, I recommend exploring resources covering digital audio protocols, specifically I2S, and FPGA-based design. Consider texts focused on digital signal processing and advanced FPGA design techniques. Additionally, examining Xilinx's Vivado documentation for resource management will be invaluable. These materials will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the concepts introduced and enable you to implement more robust and complex audio interfaces utilizing the NEXYS A7 board.
