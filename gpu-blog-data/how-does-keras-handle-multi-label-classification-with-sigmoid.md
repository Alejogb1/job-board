The core mechanism of multi-label classification in Keras when employing sigmoid activation functions lies in the independent prediction of each label’s probability, a departure from the mutually exclusive nature of softmax output in multi-class scenarios. This means each neuron in the final dense layer of the model, when activated by a sigmoid, outputs a value between 0 and 1, representing the predicted probability of that specific label being present, irrespective of the predictions for other labels. This is crucial as one instance can belong to multiple classes simultaneously. My experience working on image tagging projects, where an image could contain several objects, underscored the importance of this independent probability approach.

When building a model in Keras for multi-label tasks, the final layer will typically be a dense layer with a number of neurons equal to the number of labels, each employing the sigmoid activation. Subsequently, a binary cross-entropy loss function, specifically designed to handle multiple independent binary classifications, is utilized. The crucial difference from multi-class classification with softmax is that each label's output is treated as an independent Bernoulli trial, where the prediction evaluates the likelihood of that particular label being active. Training such a model involves iteratively adjusting weights through backpropagation, seeking to minimize the overall binary cross-entropy loss.

The key to understanding this setup is to perceive it as a set of independent binary classification problems, rather than a single multi-class problem. This distinction directly impacts how you should evaluate performance and interpret your model. Instead of accuracy metrics focused on single correct classes, appropriate metrics often include precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC), calculated individually for each label, or macro-averaged across all labels.

Here are three practical examples demonstrating how to implement multi-label classification in Keras, incorporating this independent probability prediction principle:

**Example 1: Basic Sequential Model**

This example illustrates a straightforward multi-label classifier for a textual data scenario, where the input is a sequence of tokenized words, and the target output consists of several tags.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, GlobalAveragePooling1D, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import numpy as np

# Dummy data
num_samples = 1000
max_vocab = 1000
embedding_dim = 64
sequence_length = 20
num_labels = 5

X = np.random.randint(0, max_vocab, size=(num_samples, sequence_length))
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(num_samples, num_labels)) # Binary labels

model = Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=max_vocab, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=sequence_length),
    GlobalAveragePooling1D(), # Reduce sequence to single vector
    Dense(num_labels, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X, y, epochs=2, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
print(model.evaluate(X, y))
```

This code creates a model with an embedding layer, followed by global average pooling to transform the variable-length sequence into a fixed-size representation, and finally, a dense output layer with sigmoid activations for multi-label predictions. Crucially, the binary cross-entropy loss ensures the independent probabilities for each label are optimized during training. The evaluation metric 'accuracy' will be calculated for each individual label. Note: metrics like F1-score are often better suited for multilabel tasks and are not included here to retain focus on explaining the sigmoid and loss function.

**Example 2: Functional API with Multiple Inputs**

This example showcases a more complex scenario using Keras’ functional API where the input is comprised of two data sources. This demonstrates that regardless of the model's internal structure, the sigmoid-based final layer maintains its independent output mechanism.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, Concatenate, Embedding
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import numpy as np

# Dummy data
num_samples = 1000
vocab1_size = 500
vocab2_size = 200
embedding1_dim = 32
embedding2_dim = 16
input1_length = 10
input2_length = 5
num_labels = 3

input1 = np.random.randint(0, vocab1_size, size=(num_samples, input1_length))
input2 = np.random.randint(0, vocab2_size, size=(num_samples, input2_length))
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(num_samples, num_labels))

input_1 = Input(shape=(input1_length,))
input_2 = Input(shape=(input2_length,))

embedding1 = Embedding(input_dim=vocab1_size, output_dim=embedding1_dim, input_length=input1_length)(input_1)
embedding2 = Embedding(input_dim=vocab2_size, output_dim=embedding2_dim, input_length=input2_length)(input_2)

pooled1 = tf.reduce_mean(embedding1, axis=1) # Simple average
pooled2 = tf.reduce_mean(embedding2, axis=1)

merged = Concatenate()([pooled1, pooled2])

output_layer = Dense(num_labels, activation='sigmoid')(merged)

model = Model(inputs=[input_1, input_2], outputs=output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit([input1, input2], labels, epochs=2, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
print(model.evaluate([input1, input2], labels))
```

Here, the model takes two separate input sources, processes them through embeddings, averages their representations, and then concatenates before the final dense layer with sigmoid activation. The core principle of independent predictions per label remains the same. The functional API offers greater flexibility in handling more complex input or processing pathways.

**Example 3: Custom Evaluation Metrics and Thresholding**

This example illustrates how to use a custom metric with a threshold for determining the presence of each label in the context of a sigmoid output. This highlights that a predicted probability is usually converted into a hard 0 or 1 prediction via a threshold, not always directly the 0.5 assumed in training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

# Dummy Data
num_samples = 1000
input_dim = 20
num_labels = 4
X = np.random.rand(num_samples, input_dim)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(num_samples, num_labels))

#Define custom metric with threshold
def threshold_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, threshold=0.5):
    y_pred_thresholded = K.cast(K.greater(y_pred, threshold), dtype='float32')
    return K.mean(K.equal(y_true, y_pred_thresholded), axis=-1)

# Model Definition
inputs = Input(shape=(input_dim,))
outputs = Dense(num_labels, activation='sigmoid')(inputs)
model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=[threshold_accuracy])
model.fit(X, y, epochs=2, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
print(model.evaluate(X, y))
```

This code demonstrates the incorporation of a custom threshold accuracy metric which takes the predicted probabilities from the sigmoid outputs and applies a threshold to convert them into binary predictions. This is closer to the common interpretation of multi-label prediction in practice, where a probability over the threshold will trigger the presence of a label. The standard 'accuracy' metric in Keras computes accuracy by considering the probabilities directly, and not via an implicit threshold at 0.5.

In summary, Keras facilitates multi-label classification using sigmoid activation in the final layer by enabling independent probabilistic predictions for each label, optimized by binary cross-entropy loss. The examples illustrate its implementation across various model architectures and highlight the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation metrics and employing a threshold on predicted probabilities to obtain binary multi-label predictions. Further in-depth exploration of multi-label classification can be gained from textbooks and online resources covering machine learning and neural networks. Specifically, resources focusing on advanced evaluation metrics for multilabel classification, and practical implementations in TensorFlow and Keras are useful. Additionally, publications outlining best practices in data preparation and model architecture selection for these kinds of problems will offer further clarity.
