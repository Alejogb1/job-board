The common "no valid OpenPGP data found" error when using `gpg` on a Raspberry Pi 4, despite seemingly correct operations, often stems from subtle variations in system configuration, particularly related to trust settings and keyrings, that may not be immediately obvious. My experience, having provisioned numerous Pi devices for secure data transmission and signing, reveals this issue rarely originates from fundamental GnuPG malfunctions, but rather from the specifics of the environment within which `gpg` operates. This requires a methodical troubleshooting approach.

The underlying principle is that `gpg` verifies the validity of encrypted or signed data by comparing it against trusted public keys stored in its keyring. This keyring, a collection of keys, is not a static entity. It can be affected by several factors including user permissions, the presence of multiple keyrings, and the way the system has been initialized. On a Raspberry Pi, particularly those with frequently reimaged operating systems, it's easy to encounter situations where the expected keyrings are either missing, have incorrect permissions, or contain incomplete or expired information.

The error itself doesn't necessarily indicate a problem with the data *per se*. Instead, it signifies that `gpg` cannot find a public key in its *currently accessible* keyring that corresponds to the private key that generated the signature, or the public key that is used to encrypt the message. When decrypting, `gpg` needs the corresponding private key; when verifying a signature, `gpg` needs the public key used to create that signature, located in a keyring that is both accessible and contains correct and unexpired key material. Incorrect or missing keyrings are the most frequent cause, followed by keyrings that are corrupt, incomplete or that contain expired or revoked keys.

Here's a breakdown of common scenarios and how to address them, drawn from my own problem solving:

First, check which keyrings `gpg` is referencing. On most Linux distributions, including Raspberry Pi OS, the primary keyrings are located under the user’s `~/.gnupg/` directory, particularly the `pubring.kbx` for public keys and `secring.kbx` for private keys. However, system-wide keyrings, usually found in `/etc/gnupg/`, can also play a role. When encountering "no valid OpenPGP data", I almost always begin by verifying these directories exist, are not corrupt, and have correct read permissions for the user executing the `gpg` command. Permissions issues can especially arise when running gpg commands as a user different from whom the keyring was created.

The following code example illustrates how to list the keys present in a keyring:

```bash
# Example 1: Listing keys in the default keyring
gpg --list-keys

# Example 1 Commentary: This command displays all the keys within the default keyring used by the current user.
# If this produces no output or indicates an error, the keyring is likely the source of the issue.
# Also review output for revoked or expired keys which may cause issues with verification
```

If the keyring seems to be missing or empty after verifying, the second crucial step is to import the required public keys. This is where many users encounter difficulties, believing that simply copying a `.asc` file to the Pi makes it available to `gpg`. It needs to be explicitly imported into the keyring using the `gpg --import` command. A common mistake involves trying to use `cat` or similar to pipe the keys into `gpg`. `gpg` expects a file argument rather than data piped to standard input. The incorrect method will almost certainly generate errors and not import the keys into the keychain.

The code example below shows how to correctly import a public key:

```bash
# Example 2: Importing a public key from a file
gpg --import public_key.asc

# Example 2 Commentary: This command reads the public key from the specified 'public_key.asc' file
# and adds it to the user’s default keyring. Ensure that the filename is correct and that
# permissions are set to read from the specified location. The command may ask for a pin entry.
```

Once the keys are imported, I always re-verify their presence using the first command `gpg --list-keys`. The command's output should show the imported key, and it's crucial to double check the key IDs and fingerprints to ensure the correct key has been imported. This is also a good point to review the key material for expiration or other signs of potential issues.

Another common issue arises if you're interacting with a GnuPG version or system that has an incompatible keyring format. The older `pubring.gpg` and `secring.gpg` files have been superseded by the `pubring.kbx` and `secring.kbx` formats. In most recent GnuPG versions, and within the Raspberry Pi environment I often work in, these older formats are automatically upgraded, but in legacy scenarios it is worth considering.

If public keys are properly imported, but verification or decryption still fail, the next most probable cause is that the correct private key is either not available, or is protected with the incorrect password or passphrase. The private key needs to be present in the keyring associated with the user who is attempting to decrypt or sign. If the key was created on a different system, it must be exported in the correct format from the originating system and then imported to the current Pi system. Password prompts should be expected during operations that use private key material.

Here's an example of how to verify that the associated private key is indeed available. This uses the `gpg --list-secret-keys` command:

```bash
# Example 3: Listing secret keys to verify their presence
gpg --list-secret-keys

# Example 3 Commentary: This command lists secret keys present in the user's default keyring.
# The output should indicate the presence of the corresponding private key matching the public key
# if all keyrings have been correctly populated. Check that there is both a 'sec' and a 'uid' entry for each required key.
# Absence of 'sec' entry indicates that there is not a private key for the associated public key.
```

In addition to these command-line checks, I find it helpful to consider the operational context. Are operations conducted via a script? Does that script correctly set user contexts? Are there configuration files under the `/etc/gnupg/` that might override the user’s local keyring? These are all possibilities which can lead to the error message being seen.

Finally, I would like to recommend some resources that I frequently turn to for in-depth information on OpenPGP and GnuPG. The official GnuPG manual offers comprehensive information and command line options. The "Applied Cryptography" book by Bruce Schneier provides a deep understanding of cryptographic principles, crucial to proper GnuPG implementation. A local search of your Linux distribution's user manual for "gpg" will often point to specific versions and local paths that must be adhered to. I advise thorough review of these resources if the troubleshooting steps I have outlined do not resolve the issue.

In summary, the "no valid OpenPGP data" error, while initially perplexing, usually points to a keyring configuration issue, rather than a fault with the GnuPG software. A structured approach, verifying keyring existence, importing necessary keys correctly, and accounting for potential permissions issues or alternative system wide keyrings will typically pinpoint the root cause. Careful review of both local and system wide keyrings is advised, and reviewing the output of the commands described should lead to a resolution.
