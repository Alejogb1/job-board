The deprecation of `tf.estimator` APIs, including `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier`, stems directly from TensorFlow's evolution towards a more flexible and composable approach to building machine learning models. Having spent considerable time building and maintaining TensorFlow pipelines over the past five years, I've witnessed this transition firsthand and understand the rationale behind it. The move away from `tf.estimator` is not arbitrary; it represents a strategic shift towards more granular control and better integration with modern TensorFlow features.

The core issue is that `tf.estimator`, while initially designed to streamline model development, proved to be somewhat rigid in its abstraction. The predefined model architectures and training loops offered convenience but limited the extent to which developers could customize and optimize specific parts of the model lifecycle.  As TensorFlow evolved, particularly with the advent of `tf.keras` and the more explicit function-based API in TensorFlow 2.x, `tf.estimator` became increasingly less relevant. The flexibility, customizability, and tight integration with the eager execution and graph functionality of modern TensorFlow were simply not natively present in the older `tf.estimator` structure.

Essentially, `tf.estimator` implemented a ‘black box’ approach to model creation. You provided features and labels, and it handled the details of graph construction, session management, and training loop orchestration. This limited the ability to perform intricate operations like complex custom loss functions, sophisticated regularization schemes, or custom training strategies.  Furthermore, integrating `tf.estimator` with more recent advancements, like multi-GPU training and distributed computing frameworks, involved considerable effort and often resulted in less than optimal performance. The maintenance burden also became more significant as developers increasingly needed to extend the estimator's capabilities to accommodate advancements in the TensorFlow ecosystem.

The shift towards `tf.keras` as the core model building API resolves these issues by promoting a modular and declarative style. `tf.keras` models are built by explicitly assembling layers which are easily customized.  Training loops, loss functions, and metrics become integral parts of the model construction process using gradient tapes, rather than being hidden behind the abstraction of the `Estimator`. This allows much greater control and debugging capability. Consequently, the functions previously performed by `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier` can now be directly expressed using a `tf.keras.Sequential` model, together with explicit definition of the loss and optimization process.

To illustrate this, let’s consider replacing the functionality of `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier`. The following three code examples will progressively show how it's implemented with `tf.keras`.

**Example 1: Basic DNN Classifier using `tf.keras.Sequential`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), # Input layer (assuming 10 features)
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),                     # Hidden layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')                  # Output layer (binary classification)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])


# Dummy Data Example: For brevity, this uses random tensors
features = tf.random.normal(shape=(100,10)) # Example with 10 features, 100 samples
labels = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100,1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32) # Binary labels

# Train the model
model.fit(features, labels, epochs=10)

```

This first example demonstrates the core replacement for a simple `DNNClassifier`. The `tf.keras.Sequential` model encapsulates a stack of dense layers. The ‘input_shape’ is crucial on the first dense layer, indicating the expected dimension of each feature vector.  We use `binary_crossentropy` for our binary classification problem, and the Adam optimizer.  We compile the model, then simulate training data by using random tensors, finally calling the fit method with a fixed number of epochs.  The result is a model trained using similar logic to a `DNNClassifier`.

**Example 2: Adding Custom Loss Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define custom loss function
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    # Example: Weighted loss where misclassifying positive is 5x more important
    weight = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true,1), 5.0, 1.0)
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred) * weight)


# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model with the custom loss
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=custom_loss,
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy Data Example: For brevity, this uses random tensors
features = tf.random.normal(shape=(100,10))
labels = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100,1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)


# Train the model
model.fit(features, labels, epochs=10)
```

This example highlights one of the key advantages of using `tf.keras` directly: the ability to incorporate custom loss functions. We define a custom loss `custom_loss` using TensorFlow functions. This is simply impossible with a basic `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier` without significant and sometimes convoluted workarounds. Here, we've added a weighted component that penalizes misclassifying positive samples more severely which demonstrates the expressivity `tf.keras` provides. The rest of the structure remains similar to Example 1, except we replace the basic `binary_crossentropy` with our new loss function during model compilation.

**Example 3: Custom Training Loop with Gradient Tape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Define optimizer, loss, and metrics.
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()
metric_fn = tf.keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()


#Custom training step function
@tf.function
def train_step(features, labels):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(features, training=True)
    loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  metric_fn.update_state(labels, predictions)
  return loss, metric_fn.result()

# Dummy Data Example: For brevity, this uses random tensors
features = tf.random.normal(shape=(100,10))
labels = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100,1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)


# Training Loop
epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
  epoch_loss, epoch_accuracy = train_step(features, labels)
  print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {epoch_loss.numpy():.4f}, Accuracy: {epoch_accuracy.numpy():.4f}')
  metric_fn.reset_state()
```

This final example takes us into completely custom training. Here, we utilize `tf.GradientTape` to explicitly calculate the gradients, and apply them using the optimizer. This bypasses the `model.fit` method, offering full control over the training process, enabling complex techniques such as gradient clipping, specific data augmentations inside the training loop, and more.   This degree of control over backpropagation is completely inaccessible using `tf.estimator` and showcases the flexibility of `tf.keras` combined with manual gradient calculations. The `tf.function` decorator improves the speed of this training loop.

In essence, `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier` is unavailable because it is a less flexible abstraction. The development of `tf.keras` and the increased emphasis on graph mode execution allows for highly flexible model building using a combination of layers, custom loss functions, and training loops. As I encountered this in numerous real-world projects, I found the transition to be not just necessary, but also beneficial for optimizing performance and expanding model design possibilities.

For further exploration into this topic, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the guides on `tf.keras` and custom training loops. Consider also exploring the TensorFlow tutorials that illustrate model building, training, and deployment. The TensorFlow Probability documentation offers valuable material regarding integrating probabilistic reasoning into your models. Finally, various textbooks and online courses focused on applied machine learning often contain sections that detail these more modern approaches to model building and provide examples that make the transition from abstract to concrete.
