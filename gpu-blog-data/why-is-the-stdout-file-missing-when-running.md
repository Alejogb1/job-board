When executing a Singularity container under Slurm, the frequently encountered absence of the standard output (stdout) file stems directly from how Slurm manages process input and output streams when combined with Singularity's isolation mechanisms. Slurm's job management system typically redirects stdout and standard error (stderr) to specified files or pipes for each submitted task. However, Singularity, in its default configurations, creates its own isolated namespace and mounts the host’s file system at `/`. This behavior, in combination with Slurm's redirection, can disrupt the intended flow of output. I’ve personally wrestled with this issue multiple times during high-throughput genomic analysis workflows.

The core problem arises from a combination of factors. Firstly, Slurm's job submission script typically includes directives like `-o` and `-e` to specify the output and error file paths, respectively. These paths are interpreted within the environment of the Slurm job scheduler, before the Singularity container is even invoked. When Singularity then launches the container, it does so within a new process namespace. Crucially, the redirection of stdout and stderr established by Slurm on the host is not automatically passed into the container's namespace. Singularity's default behavior is to inherit the parent process’s stdio streams when the `--contain` or similar flag is not used, but this is often not compatible with the Slurm environment setup. Therefore, if the host job is told to write to, for example, `job.out`, and then the Singularity process uses a new process namespace, this host `job.out` file may not be directly visible and writable from inside the container. This is because, by default, the containerized process may be unaware of or unable to access the redirections set by the host job environment.

Secondly, when using the `--contain` or equivalent flags that create an explicit container environment with a new process namespace, Singularity severs the linkage with the host stdio. The container's standard output then defaults to standard streams within the container, not the Slurm-managed files set outside the container. If the containerized application within this environment does not explicitly write to the expected output path, the output is lost or redirected to the internal stdio of the container which is usually not easily accessible after the job terminates.

To illustrate, consider a straightforward example involving a simple echo command inside a Singularity container that writes to stdout. Without any adjustments to Slurm or Singularity, the output might be missing.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -o job.out
#SBATCH -e job.err
#SBATCH --partition=my_partition
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1

module load singularity/3.8.5 # or equivalent
singularity exec my_container.sif echo "Hello from container"
```

In this setup, `job.out` may remain empty because the echo command's output goes to the container's default stdout. This is not propagated back to the redirection set by Slurm, as the default stdio streams are not inherited in a fully contained process namespace. This is a very common scenario where the user might be expecting the text "Hello from container" to show up in `job.out` but it does not.

Here's a slightly modified example, still demonstrating the problem, but with a basic python script that writes to stdout:

```python
# my_script.py
print("This is a python script inside the container")
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -o job.out
#SBATCH -e job.err
#SBATCH --partition=my_partition
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1

module load singularity/3.8.5 # or equivalent
singularity exec my_container.sif python my_script.py
```

In this case, executing the script using `python my_script.py` will generate output, but again it will not appear in the Slurm `job.out` file. The container environment, not being aware of the host-provided file redirection, writes to its own default stdout which is lost.

To correctly capture the output, one should explicitly redirect the standard output within the container to the file designated by Slurm. This can be achieved by passing the redirection information as part of the command inside the container. This involves extracting the Slurm's job environment variables and using them in the singularity command. A more verbose example demonstrates the method to resolve the problem:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -o job.out
#SBATCH -e job.err
#SBATCH --partition=my_partition
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1

module load singularity/3.8.5 # or equivalent

OUTPUT_FILE=$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR/job.out
ERROR_FILE=$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR/job.err

singularity exec my_container.sif sh -c "echo 'Hello from container' > $OUTPUT_FILE 2> $ERROR_FILE"

```

Here, the crucial change involves explicitly using the Slurm environment variables, `$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR`, to specify the target output file. The `sh -c` command provides a shell environment inside the container, allowing redirection using the `>` operator. This captures the `echo` command's standard output inside the container and sends it to the `job.out` file which is located on the shared file system, resolving the issue. Similarly, `2>` redirects standard error to the correct error file. Importantly, you may need to pass the full path to the output file in cases when the working directory of the container is different from the `SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR`.

Alternatively, for more complex pipelines, the redirection could be managed by passing a dedicated wrapper script. This approach enhances maintainability and clarity. The principle, however, remains the same, you must explicitly manage redirection from within the container environment using the paths available within the Slurm environment.

To summarize, the absence of the stdout file when using Singularity under Slurm is primarily due to the isolation provided by containers which does not always honor the file redirection established by the Slurm environment on the host. To remedy this, either the containerized program must be instructed to write to the correct locations using shell redirection or through explicit file handling within the application or through wrapper scripts that implement these behaviors.

For further understanding of these topics, I suggest reviewing the official documentation for Slurm and Singularity. The documentation detailing the environment variables exported by Slurm during job submission is especially important. Reading through the Singularity documentation focused on container execution, namespaces, and how they handle file systems and I/O is highly recommended. Additionally, practical guides often provided by HPC centers can offer specific examples tailored to those working environments. Examining tutorials or examples that deal with workflow management systems (like Snakemake) using Singularity and Slurm will also provide helpful insights.
