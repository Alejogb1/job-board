The root cause of unexpected results when exporting CUDA functions from a DLL using `__declspec(dllexport` often stems from a mismatch between the device context used when the function is compiled for the DLL and the context available when the DLL is loaded and the function is called. This is a subtle issue often overlooked in simple CUDA examples that compile and run within a single project context. I encountered this problem extensively during a previous project involving a computationally intensive physics simulation where core numerical routines had to be packaged into a separate DLL for cross-platform compatibility.

The issue arises because CUDA’s runtime library manages device contexts. A device context represents a connection to a specific CUDA-enabled GPU. When a CUDA application initializes (either an executable or a library), it typically creates a device context, or it might use an existing one if already present in the process. The CUDA runtime library utilizes this context to execute kernels on the device. When a DLL containing CUDA functions is compiled and exported, its compilation process generates a CUDA device context internally associated with the DLL. This internal context is not automatically transferred to the application or library that loads and calls the function exported from the DLL. Instead, if the calling code does not configure the CUDA context appropriately, the DLL may attempt to execute the kernel within its pre-initialized context, which may not be accessible or compatible with the current GPU, leading to undefined behavior, or data corruption. The situation is further complicated if the loading application also initializes CUDA, because both contexts, in the application and in the dll, are isolated, and data transfers between them is not guaranteed, because device pointers are per-device.

The `__declspec(dllexport)` simply tells the compiler to export the function symbol so that the DLL can be linked to by another application. It does not ensure correct management of CUDA contexts across DLL boundaries. Without careful coordination, the calling application's context and the DLL's implicit context remain separate, leading to problems when the kernel is launched. The device pointer allocation in the dll, which is a simple int on the cpu memory, is not valid in the context of the application, thus leading to failures, or worse, to corrupt memory if they happen to have the same value.

To illustrate this, consider a simplified scenario where a DLL exports a function that adds two vectors together on the GPU. This is a very basic CUDA operation, but is sufficient for this analysis.

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation**

This example demonstrates the scenario causing the issue. I assume a setup with CUDA installed and configured.

```cpp
// dll_functions.cu (Compiled as a DLL)
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(float* a, float* b, float* c, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

extern "C" {
    __declspec(dllexport) void addVectors(float* a, float* b, float* c, int size) {
        int threadsPerBlock = 256;
        int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

        vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(a, b, c, size);

        cudaError_t error = cudaGetLastError();
         if (error != cudaSuccess){
             printf("CUDA kernel launch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(error));
         }
        cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    }
}

```

```cpp
// main.cpp (executable that uses the dll)
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <vector>

// Prototype for the DLL function
extern "C" void addVectors(float* a, float* b, float* c, int size);

int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    std::vector<float> h_a(size, 1.0f);
    std::vector<float> h_b(size, 2.0f);
    std::vector<float> h_c(size, 0.0f);

    float* d_a;
    float* d_b;
    float* d_c;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, size * sizeof(float));

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a.data(), size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b.data(), size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    addVectors(d_a, d_b, d_c, size);

    cudaMemcpy(h_c.data(), d_c, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);

    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if(h_c[i] != 3.0f){
           std::cout << "Error at " << i << ": Result is " << h_c[i] << std::endl;
           return 1;
        }
    }
    std::cout << "Vector addition successful!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the `addVectors` function, exported from the DLL, is called from the main application. The CUDA memory is allocated and populated in main. The DLL function uses those device pointers, but when executed, because the DLL uses its own cuda context, this operation will probably fail. Running this program will, most likely, show that the vector addition has not happened as expected, or that the kernel launch itself failed.

**Example 2: Corrected Implementation with Context Handling**

The key is to ensure that the device context is set up in the main application, and the DLL code will only execute within the context already established by the application. We don't initialize the device in the dll. The dll will simply receive the device pointers and operate on them.

```cpp
// dll_functions.cu (Compiled as a DLL)
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(float* a, float* b, float* c, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

extern "C" {
    __declspec(dllexport) void addVectors(float* a, float* b, float* c, int size) {
        int threadsPerBlock = 256;
        int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

        vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(a, b, c, size);

        cudaError_t error = cudaGetLastError();
         if (error != cudaSuccess){
             printf("CUDA kernel launch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(error));
         }
        cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    }
}
```

```cpp
// main.cpp (executable that uses the dll)
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <vector>

// Prototype for the DLL function
extern "C" void addVectors(float* a, float* b, float* c, int size);

int main() {
     int device = 0;
    cudaSetDevice(device);

    int size = 1024;
    std::vector<float> h_a(size, 1.0f);
    std::vector<float> h_b(size, 2.0f);
    std::vector<float> h_c(size, 0.0f);

    float* d_a;
    float* d_b;
    float* d_c;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, size * sizeof(float));

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a.data(), size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b.data(), size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    addVectors(d_a, d_b, d_c, size);

    cudaMemcpy(h_c.data(), d_c, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);

    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if(h_c[i] != 3.0f){
           std::cout << "Error at " << i << ": Result is " << h_c[i] << std::endl;
           return 1;
        }
    }
    std::cout << "Vector addition successful!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```

In this corrected implementation, the main application establishes a CUDA device context using `cudaSetDevice(device)`. The exported function now operates within that context established by the application. It’s important to emphasize, the main application is responsible for managing the context. The DLL only processes data on the GPU.

**Example 3: Advanced Context Handling**

In more complex scenarios, the application may need to perform advanced context management, such as having the DLL operate on different CUDA devices or having the DLL control the device selection. In such cases, the device context information can be passed as a parameter to the function in the DLL or set using explicit API calls using `cudaSetDevice`. A more advanced example of such case follows.

```cpp
// dll_functions.cu (Compiled as a DLL)
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(float* a, float* b, float* c, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

extern "C" {
    __declspec(dllexport) void addVectorsOnDevice(int device, float* a, float* b, float* c, int size) {

        cudaError_t error = cudaSetDevice(device);

        if (error != cudaSuccess){
           printf("Error setting device %i: %s\n",device, cudaGetErrorString(error));
           return;
         }

        int threadsPerBlock = 256;
        int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

        vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(a, b, c, size);

        error = cudaGetLastError();
         if (error != cudaSuccess){
             printf("CUDA kernel launch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(error));
         }

        cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    }
}
```

```cpp
// main.cpp (executable that uses the dll)
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <vector>

// Prototype for the DLL function
extern "C" void addVectorsOnDevice(int device, float* a, float* b, float* c, int size);

int main() {
    int device = 0;
    cudaSetDevice(device);

    int size = 1024;
    std::vector<float> h_a(size, 1.0f);
    std::vector<float> h_b(size, 2.0f);
    std::vector<float> h_c(size, 0.0f);

    float* d_a;
    float* d_b;
    float* d_c;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, size * sizeof(float));

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a.data(), size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b.data(), size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    addVectorsOnDevice(device, d_a, d_b, d_c, size);

    cudaMemcpy(h_c.data(), d_c, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);

    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if(h_c[i] != 3.0f){
           std::cout << "Error at " << i << ": Result is " << h_c[i] << std::endl;
           return 1;
        }
    }
    std::cout << "Vector addition successful!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this third example, the main program still initializes a device context, but the dll receives the id of the device to use. This is important to allow flexibility to switch between GPUs in the system, or to execute computations on different GPUs in a system with multiple CUDA enabled GPUs.

In conclusion, exporting CUDA functions from a DLL using `__declspec(dllexport)` requires careful consideration of CUDA device context management. It is not enough to simply mark the functions for export. The application loading the DLL must ensure that a valid CUDA device context is set before executing any CUDA kernel calls originating from the DLL.

For further study of CUDA programming I recommend reviewing the NVIDIA CUDA documentation. There are also several valuable books covering GPU computing and CUDA programming fundamentals. Understanding the subtle nuances of device contexts is critical for developing robust and reliable CUDA applications in DLLs or other multi-module environments. There are also courses on parallel and GPU programming available on several platforms which also can be very useful to grasp all the concepts.
