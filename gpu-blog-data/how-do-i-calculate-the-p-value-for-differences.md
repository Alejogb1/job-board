The core challenge in calculating p-values for inter-group differences within rows lies in the inherent dependency structure of the data.  Standard statistical tests, like independent samples t-tests, assume independence between observations; this assumption is violated when comparing groups within the same row, as these groups are inherently correlated.  My experience working on longitudinal clinical trial data underscored this issue repeatedly. Ignoring this correlation leads to inflated Type I error rates – falsely concluding a significant difference exists when none does. To accurately assess significance, we need methods that account for this within-row correlation.

Several approaches exist, each with its own strengths and limitations.  The choice depends heavily on the nature of the data and the specific research question.  I've found that the most robust and frequently applicable solutions involve either generalized estimating equations (GEEs) or mixed-effects models.  However, for simpler scenarios, permutation tests offer a computationally straightforward alternative.

**1.  Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs):**

GEEs are particularly valuable when dealing with correlated data where the correlation structure isn't explicitly modeled. They estimate regression coefficients while accounting for the within-row correlation using a working correlation matrix.  This matrix specifies the assumed correlation structure – often exchangeable (all correlations within a row are equal), independent (no correlation), or autoregressive (correlation decays with distance between groups within a row).  The choice of working correlation matrix influences the efficiency of the estimate, though it doesn't affect the consistency of the coefficient estimates under mild conditions.  The p-value is then derived from the Wald test or a robust sandwich estimator of the variance, providing more accurate inferences than ignoring the correlation.

**Code Example 1 (R):**

```R
# Sample data:  Assume 'data' is a data frame with columns:
#   rowID: Unique identifier for each row
#   group: Group indicator (e.g., treatment/control)
#   value: Measurement of interest

library(geepack)

# Specify the working correlation structure (exchangeable in this example)
model <- geeglm(value ~ group, id = rowID, data = data, corstr = "exchangeable")

# Display the model summary, including p-values for the group effect
summary(model)
```

This code utilizes the `geeglm` function from the `geepack` package in R. The `id` argument specifies the grouping variable representing each row, and `corstr` defines the working correlation structure. The `summary` function provides the coefficient estimates, standard errors, and p-values associated with the group effect.  Crucially, the p-values generated here are adjusted for the within-row correlation.


**2. Mixed-Effects Models:**

Mixed-effects models, specifically linear mixed-effects (LME) models, explicitly model the correlation between observations within rows. They partition the variance into within-row (random effects) and between-row (fixed effects) components.  This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the data's variability.  The fixed effects capture the differences between groups, while the random effects capture the within-row correlation.  The p-value for the group difference is obtained from the significance test of the fixed effect coefficients.  Selecting an appropriate random effects structure (e.g., random intercepts, random slopes) is critical for accurate inference.

**Code Example 2 (R):**

```R
library(lme4)

# Model with random intercepts for each row
model <- lmer(value ~ group + (1|rowID), data = data)

# Display the model summary, including p-values for the group effect
summary(model)
```

This code uses `lmer` from the `lme4` package. The `(1|rowID)` term specifies a random intercept for each `rowID`, accounting for the correlation between observations within a row.  The `summary` function provides the p-values for the fixed effect of `group`, reflecting the adjusted inference for the correlated data.  More complex random effects structures, like random slopes, could be incorporated if the group effect varies across rows.


**3. Permutation Tests:**

Permutation tests provide a non-parametric approach to calculating p-values, especially useful when assumptions of normality or homogeneity of variances are violated.  The method involves repeatedly permuting the group labels within each row and recalculating the test statistic (e.g., the difference in means between groups).  The p-value is then estimated as the proportion of permuted test statistics that are as extreme or more extreme than the observed test statistic.  While computationally intensive for large datasets, permutation tests are robust and easily adaptable to different test statistics.


**Code Example 3 (Python):**

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import permutations

def permutation_test(data, group_col, value_col, num_permutations=10000):
    """Performs a permutation test for differences between groups within rows."""
    num_rows = len(data[group_col].unique())
    observed_diff = data.groupby(group_col)[value_col].mean().diff().iloc[1] #Example test stat
    permuted_diffs = []
    for _ in range(num_permutations):
        permuted_data = data.copy()
        for i in range(num_rows):
            row_data = permuted_data[permuted_data[group_col] == i]
            np.random.shuffle(row_data[group_col].values)
            permuted_data.loc[row_data.index,group_col] = row_data[group_col].values

        permuted_diff = permuted_data.groupby(group_col)[value_col].mean().diff().iloc[1]
        permuted_diffs.append(permuted_diff)

    p_value = np.mean(np.abs(permuted_diffs) >= np.abs(observed_diff))
    return p_value

# Example usage (replace with your actual data)
# Assuming your data is in a pandas DataFrame called 'df'
# with columns 'rowID', 'group', and 'value'.
p_val = permutation_test(df,'group','value')
print(f"P-value: {p_val}")
```

This Python code demonstrates a permutation test. The function randomly shuffles the group labels within each row and recomputes the difference in means. The p-value is the proportion of permuted differences exceeding the observed difference.  Note the computational expense – increasing `num_permutations` improves accuracy but slows execution.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration, consult texts on advanced statistical modeling, specifically those covering generalized linear models, mixed-effects models, and resampling methods.  Materials on longitudinal data analysis will be especially beneficial.  Consider also reviewing documentation for statistical software packages like R and SAS, focusing on their functions for handling correlated data.  Finally, investigating publications dealing with your specific field of research (e.g., clinical trials, ecological studies) will often reveal common approaches to handling similar within-row correlation challenges. Remember always to carefully consider the assumptions of any chosen method and interpret the results within that context.
