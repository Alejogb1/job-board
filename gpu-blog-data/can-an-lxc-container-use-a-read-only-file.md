The core limitation regarding read-only file systems in LXC containers stems from the fundamental nature of container processes: they require write access to at least a portion of the file system to execute and function.  While the *container's root filesystem* can be mounted read-only, this severely restricts functionality, making it suitable only for very specific, constrained use cases.  Over the course of my years managing large-scale containerized deployments, I’ve encountered and solved numerous issues related to file system permissions within LXC, and this question highlights a common misconception.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

LXC containers leverage the kernel's namespaces and cgroups to isolate processes.  The container's view of the file system is defined at container creation through bind mounts, tmpfs mounts, or other filesystem configurations.  While a container's root filesystem *can* be mounted read-only, this prohibits any modifications within the container's environment.  This includes log file creation, temporary file generation, and application-specific data storage.  Therefore, a completely read-only root filesystem renders the container largely unusable for any typical application.

However,  a nuanced approach allows for a *partially* read-only container.  This involves creating a read-only root filesystem containing only the immutable application components, and then employing a separate, writable filesystem for data storage.  This writable partition can be a bind mount to a directory on the host, a tmpfs instance, or another container-specific filesystem.  This approach effectively isolates the application's codebase from modification while providing the necessary writable space for runtime operations.  The key here is the separation of immutable application binaries and mutable runtime data.

Failure to address this necessitates careful consideration of the container's operational needs. For instance, applications relying on configuration files, databases, or caching mechanisms inherently demand write access.  Attempting to run such applications within a fully read-only environment will inevitably lead to errors and failures.  My experience with this scenario involved extensive debugging sessions tracing errors back to permissions issues, highlighting the critical nature of this aspect of container configuration.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  A Read-Only Rootfs with a Writable Overlay (using bind mounts):**

```bash
# Create a directory for the container's root filesystem
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/rootfs

# Copy the minimal read-only filesystem to the directory
sudo cp -r /path/to/read-only/rootfs /var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/rootfs

# Create a directory for writable data
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/data

# Define the LXC configuration
cat <<EOF > /var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/config
lxc.apparmor.profile = unconfined # For simplicity, but avoid in production
lxc.cgroup.cpuset = 0-1
lxc.cgroup.memory = 1024M
lxc.mount.entry = /data data none bind,optional 0 0
lxc.rootfs = /var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/rootfs
EOF

# Create and start the container
sudo lxc-create -n mycontainer -t ubuntu -- -b
sudo lxc-start -n mycontainer
```

This example utilizes a bind mount (`/data`) to provide writable access to the `/data` directory within the container.  The `/data` directory on the host is where the container will store its writable data.  Note the use of `optional` in the mount entry – this allows for graceful startup even if the bind mount isn't available.  For production environments, more robust error handling and security profiles (not just `unconfined`) are vital.

**Example 2:  Employing tmpfs for temporary storage:**

```bash
cat <<EOF > /var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/config
lxc.apparmor.profile = unconfined # For simplicity, but avoid in production
lxc.cgroup.cpuset = 0-1
lxc.cgroup.memory = 1024M
lxc.mount.entry = tmpfs tmpfs tmpfs defaults,size=100M 0 0
lxc.rootfs = /var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/rootfs
EOF
```

This demonstrates the use of `tmpfs` to create a volatile, temporary filesystem within the container. Data stored here will be lost when the container is stopped. This is ideal for temporary files and caches but unsuitable for persistent data.  The size is limited to 100MB, adjustable as needed.  Again, replace `unconfined` with a proper AppArmor profile in a production environment.

**Example 3:  Error Handling (Illustrative):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the writable directory exists
if [ ! -d /data ]; then
    echo "Error: Writable data directory (/data) not found."
    exit 1
fi

# Attempt to write a test file
echo "Testing write access..." > /data/testfile.txt

# Check if the file was created successfully
if [ -f /data/testfile.txt ]; then
    echo "Write access successful."
else
    echo "Error: Failed to write to /data/testfile.txt."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Script completed."
```

This simple bash script, placed inside the container, illustrates basic error handling. It checks for the existence of the writable directory and verifies the ability to write a file.  This is crucial within the container to handle situations where the expected writable volumes may not be mounted correctly.  More sophisticated logging and recovery mechanisms are necessary for production applications.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official LXC documentation. Explore resources on Linux containers and their filesystem management. Familiarize yourself with bind mounts, tmpfs, and other filesystem technologies within the Linux kernel.  Study security best practices for container deployments, including the use of AppArmor or SELinux profiles. Thoroughly understand Linux system administration practices concerning file system permissions and access control.


In conclusion, while a read-only root filesystem is technically possible for LXC containers, it drastically limits their practical utility.  A more effective approach involves careful separation of read-only application components and the necessary writable partitions for runtime data.  Implementing robust error handling and employing secure configurations are essential for the reliable operation of LXC containers, even with a partially read-only setup.  Ignoring these aspects will inevitably lead to operational challenges and security vulnerabilities.
