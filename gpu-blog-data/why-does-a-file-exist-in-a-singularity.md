The discrepancy between a file's apparent presence within a Singularity container and the "No such file or directory" error encountered during execution stems fundamentally from the container's layered filesystem and the nuances of how paths are resolved within its environment.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in high-performance computing environments underscores the importance of carefully examining the container's build process and runtime execution context.  The problem rarely lies in the file's actual existence within the image, but rather in its accessibility during the execution phase.

**1.  Explanation of the Issue:**

Singularity containers leverage a layered filesystem approach, typically using SquashFS or similar technologies.  This creates an efficient, read-only base layer upon which subsequent layers (potentially read-write) are stacked. During the container's build phase, files are added to these layers.  However, the runtime environment operates under a specific set of mount points and permissions.  The "No such file" error emerges when the runtime environment cannot locate the file within its accessible file system hierarchy, despite the file's presence in one of the underlying read-only layers.

This often occurs due to several contributing factors:

* **Incorrect Paths:**  The most common reason is an incorrect path specified within the script or executable running inside the container.  Hardcoded paths relative to the host machine will certainly fail. Paths must be relative to the container's root filesystem (`/`).

* **Bind Mounts:** If the user attempts to access files using bind mounts from the host system, issues can arise from incorrect mount point specifications or permissions conflicts between the host and the container.

* **Layer Ordering and Visibility:** The layering of the filesystem matters.  If a file exists in a lower, read-only layer, but an upper layer (potentially a read-write bind mount) shadows it, the file will be effectively invisible to the application running within the container.  The container's filesystem structure might differ from expectations derived from direct inspection of the underlying image file using tools like `singularity inspect`.

* **Permissions:** Although less frequent, permission issues can prevent access even if the path is correctly specified.  The user running the application within the container might lack the necessary permissions to read the file, even if the file exists within a seemingly accessible layer.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate common scenarios leading to this error and how to resolve them.  I've drawn on my experiences developing Singularity recipes for large-scale bioinformatics pipelines, where meticulous path management is crucial.

**Example 1: Incorrect Path Specification**

```bash
# Singularity recipe (Singularityfile)
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest

%post
  apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends wget
  wget -O /data/my_file.txt https://www.example.com/my_file.txt

%runscript
  cat /data/my_file.txt # Correct path
```

In this example, `/data/my_file.txt` is correctly specified relative to the container's root.  Attempting to use `/home/user/data/my_file.txt` (a host path) would fail.  I've learned to consistently use absolute paths within the container's filesystem when building Singularity recipes.

**Example 2:  Bind Mount Conflicts**

```bash
# Executing the container
singularity exec -B /path/to/host/data:/data my_container.sif cat /data/my_file.txt
```

Here, `/path/to/host/data` on the host is bound to `/data` within the container.  This example would fail if `/path/to/host/data` either doesn't exist, doesn't contain `my_file.txt`, or has permission restrictions preventing the container from accessing it.  My past experiences show this approach is error-prone unless carefully managed.  Mismatches in file permissions between host and container are particularly difficult to diagnose.

**Example 3:  Addressing Layer Ordering**

This example demonstrates how a higher layer could obscure a file in a lower layer.  A more robust approach is necessary to handle potential conflicts between layers and ensure the desired file is accessible.


```bash
# Singularityfile (Illustrative, simplified)
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest

%files
    my_file.txt /data/ # In base layer

%runscript
  mkdir -p /data/subdir
  echo "This is another file" > /data/subdir/another_file.txt # In a higher layer

  #Attempting to access my_file.txt is risky in this structure, depending on how Singularity handles layer merging.  Explicit copy might be safer
  cp /data/my_file.txt /data/subdir/backup_my_file.txt  # safer approach


  cat /data/subdir/backup_my_file.txt
```

In this simplified example, `my_file.txt` might be overshadowed depending on how the Singularity runtime handles layer ordering and visibility. The last line of the %runscript demonstrates a method to avoid such conflicts; explicitly copying the file from a lower layer to the top level. This is a general pattern I've found effective in avoiding such complexities.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of Singularity's filesystem management, I recommend consulting the official Singularity documentation.  Furthermore, thoroughly reviewing the documentation on file systems like SquashFS will prove beneficial.  Understanding containerization concepts beyond Singularity, such as Docker's layered filesystem, also provides valuable context.  Finally, debugging tools tailored for Linux systems will be indispensable for tracking down issues within the container's runtime environment.
