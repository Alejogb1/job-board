TensorFlow's custom training loops, unlike the high-level APIs like `model.fit()`, explicitly manage the gradient calculation and variable update process.  The crucial detail often overlooked is that the implicit update mechanism relies entirely on the `tf.GradientTape` context manager and the subsequent application of an optimizer's `apply_gradients` method. There's no magic; the framework provides the tools, but the user retains full responsibility for orchestrating the update.  In my experience working on large-scale image recognition models, mastering this nuance was vital for optimizing performance and debugging complex training scenarios.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A custom training loop in TensorFlow necessitates a step-by-step approach to model training.  Firstly, a `tf.GradientTape` context is established.  Within this context, the forward pass of the model is executed, generating the model's predictions.  Critically, this context records all operations involving trainable variables, allowing for automatic differentiation.  Secondly, the loss function is calculated based on these predictions and the ground truth data.  Thirdly, the `gradientTape.gradient()` method computes the gradients of the loss with respect to the trainable variables, leveraging the recorded operations within the `tf.GradientTape` context.  Finally, an optimizer (like Adam, SGD, etc.) is used to apply these calculated gradients.  The optimizer's `apply_gradients` method updates the model's trainable variables based on the computed gradients and its internal optimization algorithm.

The implicitness comes from the fact that TensorFlow, through `tf.GradientTape`, automatically handles the derivation of gradients; the user doesn't manually compute derivatives. However, the *application* of these gradients to update the variables is explicitly handled by the user through the optimizer's `apply_gradients` call.  The training loop dictates the frequency and manner in which this update happens.  This contrasts with the higher-level APIs which abstract this entire process.  Therefore, the implicit part is gradient calculation, while variable update remains explicit.  Misunderstanding this distinction can lead to subtle errors, such as forgetting to reset the gradient tape or incorrectly managing variable scopes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Custom Training Loop**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])

# Define optimizer and loss
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Training loop
epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x_train) # x_train is your training data
        loss = loss_fn(y_train, predictions) # y_train are your labels
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

This example showcases the fundamental structure.  The `GradientTape` context automatically tracks gradients, and `optimizer.apply_gradients` updates the model's weights.  Note the crucial pairing of gradients and variables using `zip`. Incorrect pairing leads to erroneous updates.  In my past projects, this was a frequent source of debugging.

**Example 2: Handling Multiple Losses**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (model, optimizer, losses defined as before) ...

for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions1 = model1(x_train)
        loss1 = loss_fn1(y_train1, predictions1)
        predictions2 = model2(x_train)
        loss2 = loss_fn2(y_train2, predictions2)
        total_loss = loss1 + loss2 #Combining Multiple Losses

    gradients = tape.gradient(total_loss, model1.trainable_variables + model2.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model1.trainable_variables + model2.trainable_variables))
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Total Loss: {total_loss.numpy()}")

```

This demonstrates handling multiple losses and models. The gradients are computed with respect to the combined loss, and `apply_gradients` updates variables from both models simultaneously. This approach requires careful management of variable scopes to avoid unintended interactions between the model parameters. During a project involving multi-task learning, this approach proved very effective.

**Example 3:  Gradient Clipping for Stability**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (model, optimizer, loss defined as before) ...

for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x_train)
        loss = loss_fn(y_train, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    # Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients
    clipped_gradients = [tf.clip_by_norm(grad, 1.0) for grad in gradients]
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(clipped_gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

This example incorporates gradient clipping, a common technique to stabilize training, particularly in recurrent neural networks.  Clipping prevents excessively large gradients from disrupting the training process.  I've found this invaluable in scenarios with unstable gradients, greatly improving model stability and convergence.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on custom training loops and gradient tape.  Furthermore, thorough exploration of the source code for various optimizers within TensorFlow provides invaluable insight into the update mechanisms.  Finally, reviewing research papers on optimization algorithms and their practical application in deep learning is highly beneficial.  These resources offer a nuanced understanding exceeding the scope of this response.  Understanding the interplay between auto-differentiation and optimizer algorithms is key to mastering this area.  The official documentation and the TensorFlow source code are invaluable in resolving subtle issues that frequently arise in custom training loop implementations.
