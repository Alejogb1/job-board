Applying a Keras model to a symbolic tensor within TensorFlow 2.0 can indeed lead to memory leaks, particularly under specific circumstances.  My experience troubleshooting memory issues in large-scale image processing pipelines highlighted this subtle but crucial point.  The root cause stems from the interaction between Keras' eager execution and the graph-building nature of symbolic tensors, especially when coupled with operations that aren't properly managed within the TensorFlow computational graph.

**1. Explanation of the Memory Leak Mechanism:**

The fundamental issue lies in the way TensorFlow manages memory.  While eager execution offers a more Pythonic experience, it doesn't automatically release resources held by operations that are not explicitly finalized.  When a Keras model, built for eager execution, interacts with a symbolic tensor (typically created using `tf.Variable` or related functions within a `tf.function` context),  a hidden dependency is created.  This dependency ties the model's internal computational graph to the symbolic tensor's lifetime.  Crucially, if the symbolic tensor is not explicitly dereferenced or the operations using it are not included within a `tf.function`'s scope for proper graph optimization, the associated memory allocated for intermediate tensors and computational nodes remains in use, preventing garbage collection. This is exacerbated when dealing with large tensors or repeated applications of the model, potentially leading to substantial memory growth over time.  The issue is not inherently within Keras itself, but rather a consequence of how eager execution and the TensorFlow runtime manage resource allocation and deallocation within the context of symbolic computation.

In simpler terms: Keras works well with immediately-evaluated data.  However, when you feed it a "future promise" of data (the symbolic tensor), the promise itself, and any incomplete calculations from the model's internal operations, may persist unexpectedly in memory until the program's end, or a deliberate cleanup.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Potential Memory Leak Scenario**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])  # Simple Keras model

x_symbolic = tf.Variable(np.random.rand(1000, 10)) # Large symbolic tensor

for i in range(1000):
    y = model(x_symbolic) # Applying the model to the symbolic tensor

# Memory leak likely here.  y is computed, but the intermediate tensors related to x_symbolic and the model's internal calculations may not be released.
```

In this example, the loop repeatedly applies the model to the `x_symbolic` tensor.  Each iteration creates a new computation graph, but the older graphs and associated tensors are not explicitly released, likely causing a gradual memory increase.

**Example 2:  Mitigation with tf.function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])

x_symbolic = tf.Variable(np.random.rand(1000, 10))

@tf.function
def apply_model(input_tensor):
  return model(input_tensor)

for i in range(1000):
  y = apply_model(x_symbolic)  # Applying the model within tf.function

#Improved memory management: tf.function compiles the loop into a graph, allowing for better optimization and resource cleanup.
```

By encapsulating the model application within `tf.function`, we allow TensorFlow to optimize the computation graph. This often leads to better memory management, as TensorFlow can perform more efficient resource allocation and deallocation during execution.  Intermediate tensors are handled within the graph's lifecycle and will generally be released more readily after the `tf.function` completes.

**Example 3: Explicit Deletion and Context Managers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import gc

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])

x_symbolic = tf.Variable(np.random.rand(1000, 10))

for i in range(1000):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:  #Example usage within a gradient calculation context
      y = model(x_symbolic)
      # ... further calculations using y ...
  del y #Explicitly deleting the tensor y
  gc.collect() # Trigger garbage collection (use cautiously).


del x_symbolic #Explicitly delete the symbolic tensor after use

gc.collect() # Trigger garbage collection.
```

This example demonstrates more aggressive memory management.  We explicitly delete the tensor `y` after each iteration and use `gc.collect()` to encourage garbage collection.  While effective, overuse of `gc.collect()` can lead to performance issues, so use it judiciously.  Critically, the symbolic tensor `x_symbolic` is also explicitly deleted after use.   The inclusion of `tf.GradientTape` is demonstrative of scenarios often associated with backpropagation, which are particularly vulnerable to memory leaks if not handled correctly.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend carefully reviewing the TensorFlow documentation on eager execution, `tf.function`, and resource management.  A deep understanding of the TensorFlow runtime and its memory handling mechanisms is crucial for effective troubleshooting. Pay close attention to the lifecycle of tensors within your code and strive for explicit control over their creation and destruction. The official TensorFlow tutorials provide valuable examples demonstrating best practices for avoiding memory leaks in various scenarios.   Explore advanced debugging techniques, including memory profiling tools, to identify memory consumption patterns within your application.  Finally, leveraging Python's built-in garbage collection mechanisms, while mindful of potential performance implications, can be advantageous.  The emphasis should be on structured code design that minimizes lingering dependencies and maximizes resource cleanup.
