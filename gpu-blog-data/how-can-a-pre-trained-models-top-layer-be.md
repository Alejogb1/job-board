Transfer learning, specifically repurposing pre-trained models, frequently necessitates manipulating the model architecture, often by removing the classification layer. TensorFlow's `load_model`, while designed primarily for reinstating complete saved models, provides the means to achieve this manipulation. The loaded model, treated as a functional API model, allows access to its layers, which can then be used to construct a new architecture. I've employed this method across various projects, ranging from image classification using VGG16 to text summarization employing pre-trained transformer networks, thus understanding the nuances of its effective implementation.

Fundamentally, when you use `tf.keras.models.load_model()` you're loading a *model object*, not merely the weights. This model object possesses a `layers` attribute which contains a list of all the model's constituent layers. Each layer, in turn, has a `name` attribute. Thus, by identifying the name of the terminal layer, typically the classification layer with a softmax or sigmoid activation, we can slice the loaded model effectively. Constructing a new model on top of this slice forms the basis of the new transfer learning model.

The process hinges on extracting the *outputs* of the penultimate layer in the pre-trained model. This output becomes the *input* of a custom-defined top layer which reflects the new task's specifics. Instead of retraining the entire model (which would be computationally expensive), only the newly constructed top layer and potentially the last few layers of the pre-trained model are typically retrained. This process optimizes computational resource use, allowing rapid development across a variety of tasks.

**Code Example 1: Simple Image Classification using VGG16**

Consider a scenario where VGG16 was trained on ImageNet, but the goal is to classify a new dataset with fewer classes. The following demonstrates how to remove the VGG16's original classification layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load the pre-trained VGG16 model
base_model = tf.keras.applications.VGG16(include_top=True, weights='imagenet')

# Identify the name of the final layer
last_layer_name = base_model.layers[-1].name # Typically 'predictions'

# Create a new model, extracting everything except the final layer
intermediate_model = models.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=base_model.get_layer(last_layer_name).output)

# Freeze the layers of the intermediate model. This stops it from being trained.
for layer in intermediate_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False


# Add a new classification layer.
x = intermediate_model.output
x = layers.Flatten()(x) #Flattening to a fully connected layer is common.
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')(x) #Assume the new task has 5 classes

# Create the new model.
model = models.Model(inputs=intermediate_model.input, outputs=predictions)

model.summary()
```

Here, `VGG16` is loaded with its pre-trained weights. The name of the last layer is programmatically determined, in this case likely 'predictions.' A new model, `intermediate_model`, is defined with the output of this penultimate layer; all layers up to this point are incorporated. The `intermediate_model` layers are frozen to preserve the trained weights. Then, additional dense layers are added on top of the extracted features to form a new classification head.

**Code Example 2:  Transfer Learning with an Arbitrary Saved Model.**

The method is not restricted to keras application models. Assume a saved, custom model with an explicit terminal layer name is available. Here is how one can process this model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

# Mock Model Construction (imagine it was loaded from disk with load_model)
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,10,3))
x = layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', padding='same')(input_tensor)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2))(x)
x = layers.Flatten()(x)
x = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
output_tensor = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='final_output')(x)
base_model = models.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)


# Define the name of the terminal layer
last_layer_name = 'final_output'

# Create a new model up to the terminal layer
intermediate_model = models.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=base_model.get_layer(last_layer_name).input)


# Freeze intermediate layer weights
for layer in intermediate_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False


# Add a new classification layer.
x = intermediate_model.output
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')(x)

# Create the final model.
model = models.Model(inputs=intermediate_model.input, outputs=predictions)

model.summary()

```

This example illustrates using a constructed base_model in the absence of a loaded one from disk. Note that the key is in knowing the name of the terminal layer, which in this case was set explicitly via the `name='final_output'` argument. The subsequent steps mimic Example 1, demonstrating the technique's versatility.

**Code Example 3: Handling the Output of A Transformer Model**

Transformers often output large vectors. Imagine that we have a text embedding model, the details of which are unimportant for this discussion. In the case where a final output layer needs to be replaced, the previous method still works, albeit with a slightly different usage of the output from the intermediate model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Imagine this is your pre-trained model loaded from disk
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(100,))
x = layers.Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=256)(input_tensor)
x = layers.LSTM(128, return_sequences = True)(x)
x = layers.LSTM(128)(x)
output_tensor = layers.Dense(200, activation='relu', name="final_output")(x)
base_model = models.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)

# Define the name of the terminal layer
last_layer_name = 'final_output'

# Create a new model up to the terminal layer
intermediate_model = models.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=base_model.get_layer(last_layer_name).input)

# Freeze the layers of the intermediate model
for layer in intermediate_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False


# Add a new classification layer.
x = intermediate_model.output
x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')(x) #New 3 class classification


# Create the final model.
model = models.Model(inputs=intermediate_model.input, outputs=predictions)


model.summary()

```

Here the main difference lies in the assumed input and output, a vector output of dimension 200 (instead of a flattened array of dimension from an image). Still the central idea of creating an `intermediate_model` using `model.get_layer(...).output` remains consistent. Regardless of the architecture of the `base_model`, this approach facilitates extracting the relevant features for a transfer learning task.

**Resource Recommendations**

Several valuable resources are available for further study. Consider exploring textbooks specializing in deep learning that cover the principles of transfer learning and fine-tuning. Research papers on specific pre-trained architectures, such as VGG, ResNet, or BERT, will deepen understanding of their design and suitability for diverse applications. Additionally, tutorials and documentation relating to the TensorFlow API can significantly improve implementation proficiency.

In summary, the `load_model` function in TensorFlow enables the powerful technique of model layer extraction via the construction of functional API models. By identifying the output of a specified layer and creating a new model leveraging these intermediate features, one can efficiently adapt pre-trained models to new problems. The provided code examples demonstrate that this method is applicable to various architectures and data types by focusing on the core idea of slicing the pre-trained model at the right place and attaching a custom head. Proper knowledge of the model architecture is however essential for the success of the process.
