The absence of `cupti64_100.dll` from your Anaconda environment almost certainly indicates a missing or improperly configured CUDA toolkit installation.  This DLL is a crucial component of the NVIDIA CUDA Profiler, essential for profiling and performance analysis of CUDA applications.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across diverse HPC and deep learning projects, this problem consistently stems from an incomplete or mismatched CUDA installation relative to the NVIDIA driver and cuDNN libraries.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Anaconda, while a powerful package manager, doesn't directly manage NVIDIA CUDA components.  CUDA is a separate software development kit (SDK) provided by NVIDIA for GPU programming.  `cupti64_100.dll` is specifically part of the CUDA Profiling Tools Interface (CUPTI), which allows applications to gather detailed performance metrics during execution.  When this DLL is missing, it implies that the CUDA toolkit installation, either within your system or within the scope of your Anaconda environment, is incomplete or its path isn't correctly configured in your system's environment variables.

Several factors can contribute to this issue:

* **Missing CUDA Toolkit Installation:**  The most straightforward reason is simply that the CUDA toolkit isn't installed on your system.  Anaconda packages requiring CUDA functionality will fail to operate without it.
* **Incorrect CUDA Version:**  The version number "100" in `cupti64_100.dll` indicates CUDA toolkit version 10.x.  If you've installed a different CUDA version (e.g., 11.x or 12.x), or if your Anaconda environment's CUDA-related packages expect a different version, the DLL will be absent.
* **Mismatched Driver Version:**  The NVIDIA driver version installed on your system must be compatible with the CUDA toolkit version.  Incompatibility can lead to DLL conflicts and prevent `cupti64_100.dll` from being loaded correctly.
* **Incorrect Environment Variables:**  Windows, in particular, relies on environment variables to locate DLLs. If the system's `PATH` variable doesn't include the directory containing `cupti64_100.dll`, your applications won't find it.  Similar issues apply to other environment variables related to CUDA.
* **Conflicting Anaconda Environments:** If you have multiple Anaconda environments, and one has a correctly installed CUDA toolkit while another doesn't, the issue might be isolated to the environment lacking the necessary CUDA components.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following code examples demonstrate scenarios where the missing DLL becomes problematic.  The examples are intentionally simplified to highlight the core issue.  Note that proper error handling would be included in production-level code.

**Example 1:  Illustrating the impact on CUDA profiling.**

```python
import cupy as cp
import time

# Simple CUDA kernel
kernel = cp.RawKernel(r'''
  extern "C" __global__
  void my_kernel(float* x, float* y, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        y[i] = x[i] * 2.0f;
    }
  }
''', 'my_kernel')

# Data allocation and execution (error will occur if cupti64_100.dll is missing)
x = cp.arange(1024, dtype=cp.float32)
y = cp.zeros_like(x)
start = time.time()
kernel((1,), (1024,), (x, y, 1024))
end = time.time()
print(f"Kernel execution time: {end - start:.6f} seconds")


# Profiling Attempt (This will fail without CUPTI)
# cp.cuda.profiler.start()  # This line will fail if CUPTI is not found.
# kernel((1,), (1024,), (x, y, 1024))
# cp.cuda.profiler.stop()
```

This code demonstrates a simple CUDA kernel execution. The commented-out section shows an attempt to profile the kernel using CuPy's profiling tools, which will fail due to the missing `cupti64_100.dll`.

**Example 2:  Illustrating the impact on a PyTorch application (using CUDA).**

```python
import torch

# Check for CUDA availability (Might return False if CUDA is improperly configured)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("CUDA is available.")
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000).to(device)  # Move data to GPU
    # Perform computations on the GPU
else:
    print("CUDA is not available.")
```

This PyTorch example checks for CUDA availability. If `cupti64_100.dll` (and thus the CUDA toolkit) is incorrectly installed or configured, `torch.cuda.is_available()` might return `False` even if a compatible NVIDIA GPU is present.

**Example 3:  Illustrating a potential path issue in a custom C++ CUDA application (simplified).**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

int main() {
  // ... CUDA code ...

  // Example of potential failure if CUDA path is incorrect.
  cudaEvent_t start, stop;
  cudaEventCreate(&start);
  cudaEventCreate(&stop);
  // ... CUDA kernel execution ...
  cudaEventRecord(stop, 0);

  float milliseconds = 0;
  cudaEventElapsedTime(&milliseconds, start, stop);

  // ... rest of CUDA code ...
  return 0;
}
```

This simplified C++ example shows a potential error point. If the CUDA libraries are not properly linked (directly or through environment variables), errors will likely arise during runtime.  The `cudaEvent` functions demonstrate a common area where CUDA profiling is utilized, which hinges on the CUPTI components.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the official NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation.  Pay close attention to the system requirements, installation instructions, and troubleshooting sections specific to your operating system.  Review your Anaconda environment's package list to confirm that all CUDA-related packages are installed correctly.   Thoroughly examine your system's environment variables, paying particular attention to those related to CUDA's installation path.  Verify the compatibility of your NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit version. If you're working within a larger computational cluster, contact your system administrator for assistance.  Understanding the intricacies of CUDA toolkit installation and its interplay with various package managers (like Anaconda) and operating systems is key to resolving this type of problem efficiently.  Precise error messages generated by your code and the system are critical in diagnosing the root cause more accurately.
