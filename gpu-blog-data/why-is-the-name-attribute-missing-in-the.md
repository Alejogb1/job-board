The absence of a 'name' attribute directly influencing the neural style transfer algorithm stems from its core objective: manipulating image *content* and *style*, not managing named computational units within a network. My experience designing and implementing style transfer systems, particularly while optimizing for edge deployment on constrained hardware, has highlighted this critical distinction. Essentially, style transfer relies on processing image representations to achieve a visual aesthetic transfer, a function distinct from the modular, named layers or nodes typically associated with named attributes in model building frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Neural style transfer, at its heart, is an optimization problem performed on the *activations* of convolutional neural networks. These activations, representing the features learned by the network, are manipulated through a loss function. This loss function quantifies the difference between the *content* of a source image and the *style* of a target image, guiding the algorithm to generate a synthesized image that balances both. The manipulation primarily occurs at the tensor level, dealing with feature maps and not with named elements of a neural network’s architecture. Names in the context of neural networks are crucial for layer identification, parameter organization during training, and model debugging; however, style transfer is not engaging with these operations in the same way traditional training does. We are extracting and comparing information from these representations, not modifying them within a backpropagation learning loop tied to particular named entities.

The process generally involves three main images: a content image (the source), a style image (the target aesthetic), and an initially random or content-initialized output image, which is progressively updated. The content loss compares the feature maps of the content image with the feature maps of the output image in the higher layers of a pre-trained convolutional neural network. This aims to ensure the output image retains the content structure of the source. The style loss, on the other hand, compares the Gram matrices of the feature maps of the style image with those of the output image at different network layers. These Gram matrices capture the correlation of features, effectively representing style. The optimizer attempts to minimize a weighted sum of both loss functions, the results of which form the output image which has content from one image with style from another. At no point is the algorithm concerned with the names assigned to these layers or nodes, rather their activations and the relationships between them.

Therefore, the 'name' attribute, frequently used to reference network layers in model building and manipulation, becomes irrelevant during style transfer optimization. The focus is on the transformation of activations, not on the alteration of the underlying network architecture or its internal components identified by names.

Here are some examples demonstrating this in practice using a simplified framework:

**Example 1: Extracting Feature Maps (No Name Dependencies)**

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume a simplified CNN with feature maps for demonstration
class SimpleCNN:
    def __init__(self):
        self.layers = [
          np.random.rand(64, 28, 28), # Simulated feature map of a layer
          np.random.rand(128, 14, 14), # Another simulated feature map
          np.random.rand(256, 7, 7)  # Another layer
        ]

    def forward(self, input_image):
      # In reality forward pass does convolution etc..
        return self.layers

def extract_features(image, model, layer_indices):
  feature_maps = model.forward(image)
  relevant_features = [feature_maps[i] for i in layer_indices]
  return relevant_features

# Simulating images
content_image = np.random.rand(224, 224, 3)
style_image = np.random.rand(224, 224, 3)

# Initializing a model
model = SimpleCNN()

# Extract features from specified indices
content_features = extract_features(content_image, model, [1])
style_features = extract_features(style_image, model, [0, 2])

print(f"Content Feature Shape: {content_features[0].shape}")
print(f"Style Feature 1 Shape: {style_features[0].shape}")
print(f"Style Feature 2 Shape: {style_features[1].shape}")

# Notice that in the feature extraction process, we only concern ourself
# with the index of the layer, no name of a layer is required, the indices
# simply allow us to reference feature maps from specific layers in our network.
```

This code simulates the feature extraction process in style transfer using a basic CNN. I have used `layer_indices` to select specific feature maps. Note that it relies solely on the positional indices of the layer outputs and does not require or leverage any layer names. The algorithm deals with the numerical tensors representing the feature maps, disregarding any names that could be associated with the actual network components. This lack of name dependencies is a consistent pattern in the practical implementation of style transfer.

**Example 2: Computing Style Loss Using Gram Matrices (No Name Dependencies)**

```python
import numpy as np

def gram_matrix(feature_map):
    # Reshape the feature map to [channel, height * width]
    channel_count, height, width = feature_map.shape
    feature_map_reshaped = feature_map.reshape(channel_count, height * width)
    # Compute the Gram matrix by multiplying with its transpose
    gram = np.dot(feature_map_reshaped, feature_map_reshaped.T)
    return gram

def style_loss(style_features, generated_features):
  total_loss = 0
  for style_feature, gen_feature in zip(style_features, generated_features):
      style_gram = gram_matrix(style_feature)
      gen_gram = gram_matrix(gen_feature)
      loss = np.sum((style_gram - gen_gram) ** 2)
      total_loss += loss
  return total_loss

# We will use style_features that where computed in example 1
# Let's make a placeholder for what the output featuremaps might look like

output_featuremap_layer0 = np.random.rand(64, 28, 28)
output_featuremap_layer2 = np.random.rand(256, 7, 7)

output_features = [output_featuremap_layer0, output_featuremap_layer2]


# Compute the style loss
style_loss_value = style_loss(style_features, output_features)
print(f"Style Loss: {style_loss_value}")

#Again, the style loss calculation is performed on tensors representing feature maps,
# and there is no dependence on layer names. It is concerned with the manipulation
# of data in a numerical format, the underlying architecture is not changed in any
# way.
```

In this example, the Gram matrix and style loss are computed for feature maps. The `gram_matrix` function receives a feature map tensor as input. The style loss calculation operates directly on these numerical matrices, which were derived from feature maps identified by numerical indices in Example 1, rather than a string name. The style loss is computed by comparing Gram matrices and the differences are used to guide optimization.

**Example 3: Content Loss (No Name Dependencies)**

```python
import numpy as np

def content_loss(content_features, generated_features):
    total_loss = 0
    for content_feature, gen_feature in zip(content_features, generated_features):
       loss = np.sum((gen_feature-content_feature)**2)
       total_loss +=loss
    return total_loss

# We will reuse the content features that were computed in example 1
# Lets create a placeholder for what the output featuremaps might look like
output_featuremap_layer1 = np.random.rand(128, 14, 14)
output_content_features = [output_featuremap_layer1]

content_loss_value = content_loss(content_features, output_content_features)
print(f"Content Loss: {content_loss_value}")

# Here, the content loss is based on the difference between the feature maps
# It is a sum of squared error. There is no mention of layer names, because it is
# not relevant to the process of comparing featuremaps.
```

This example calculates content loss, similarly working directly with the feature map tensors of the content and generated image. The loss is computed using a simple sum of squared differences, and no layer name is involved. The algorithm works with the data extracted from these layers, rather than modifying or identifying the layers themselves by any naming convention.

For further study, I would suggest focusing on resources that explore convolutional neural networks in detail. A general resource on deep learning, focusing on computer vision, would be beneficial for understanding the theoretical foundations. Specific papers on style transfer, particularly those by Gatys et al., provide key insights into the mechanics of the algorithm. Exploration of libraries used in deep learning such as TensorFlow or PyTorch can also help demonstrate a real world implementation and further explain the topic. Furthermore, a deep dive into optimization algorithms and loss functions is recommended as these are fundamental concepts involved in style transfer algorithms. Understanding the mathematical representation of image feature maps and how they are manipulated is paramount. The absence of a 'name' attribute in neural style transfer is a direct consequence of the algorithm’s purpose and method; it primarily deals with manipulation of features, not structural changes to the model, nor does it engage in the model building and training process in a conventional way, making the naming convention redundant.
