TensorFlow's slicing capabilities, while powerful, differ from NumPy's in their handling of strides.  Directly replicating NumPy's `array[::step]` syntax isn't available in the same intuitive manner. However, leveraging TensorFlow's tensor manipulation functions, specifically `tf.gather` and `tf.range`, allows for efficient extraction of values at fixed intervals.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines for autonomous vehicle projects highlighted the importance of efficient data slicing, leading me to develop the techniques described below.

**1. Understanding the Core Difference**

NumPy's slicing employs a concise syntax that directly modifies the underlying view of the array.  TensorFlow, being a computational graph framework, generally operates on a more declarative level. Instead of directly modifying a view, TensorFlow tensors are treated as immutable objects.  Thus, slicing necessitates generating indices and then selecting elements based on those indices. This approach is more computationally explicit but provides finer control, particularly when dealing with operations within a graph.

**2. Implementing Fixed-Step Slicing with `tf.gather` and `tf.range`**

The most straightforward method involves generating a sequence of indices using `tf.range` and then employing `tf.gather` to extract the corresponding elements from the TensorFlow tensor.

**Code Example 1: Basic Fixed-Step Slicing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor
tensor = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100])

# Define the step size
step = 3

# Generate indices
indices = tf.range(0, tf.shape(tensor)[0], step)

# Gather elements using indices
sliced_tensor = tf.gather(tensor, indices)

# Print the result
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(sliced_tensor)) # Output: [10 40 70]
```

This code first defines a sample tensor.  Then, `tf.range(0, tf.shape(tensor)[0], step)` generates a tensor containing indices [0, 3, 6, 9], representing the positions of elements to be extracted with a step of 3.  Finally, `tf.gather` uses these indices to select the corresponding values from the original tensor, resulting in the desired sliced tensor.  The use of `tf.compat.v1.Session()` is for compatibility reasons; in modern TensorFlow, eager execution handles this automatically.


**Code Example 2: Handling Multi-Dimensional Tensors**

Slicing multi-dimensional tensors requires careful index manipulation.  We can extend the previous approach to handle higher-dimensional cases.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a multi-dimensional tensor
tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])

# Define the step size for the first dimension
step = 2

# Generate indices for the first dimension
indices = tf.range(0, tf.shape(tensor)[0], step)

# Gather along the first dimension
sliced_tensor = tf.gather(tensor, indices)

# Print the result
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(sliced_tensor)) # Output: [[ 1  2  3] [ 7  8  9]]
```

Here, we define a 2D tensor. The `tf.range` function generates indices for the first dimension only, effectively selecting rows at the specified interval. The `tf.gather` function then extracts those rows, leaving the second dimension untouched.  This demonstrates the flexibility of `tf.gather` in handling different dimensions.  For more complex slicing across multiple dimensions, advanced indexing techniques with `tf.reshape` and other tensor manipulation functions might be necessary.


**Code Example 3:  Slicing with Negative Steps**

While `tf.range` inherently supports only positive steps, we can simulate negative stepping by reversing the tensor and then applying the positive stepping method.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor
tensor = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100])

# Define the negative step size
step = -3

# Reverse the tensor
reversed_tensor = tf.reverse(tensor, [0])

# Calculate the positive step size for reversed tensor
positive_step = -step

# Generate indices for the reversed tensor
indices = tf.range(0, tf.shape(reversed_tensor)[0], positive_step)

# Gather elements from the reversed tensor
sliced_tensor = tf.gather(reversed_tensor, indices)

# Reverse the sliced tensor to restore original order
sliced_tensor = tf.reverse(sliced_tensor, [0])

# Print the result
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(sliced_tensor)) # Output: [100, 70, 40, 10]
```

This example shows a more sophisticated approach to handle negative steps.  The tensor is reversed to allow positive indexing with `tf.range`, the slicing is performed, and the resulting slice is then reversed back to the original order. This approach showcases the flexibility of TensorFlow's operations in adapting to various slicing scenarios.  Note that this method might be slightly less efficient than using positive steps directly.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further understanding of TensorFlow's tensor manipulation capabilities, I recommend thoroughly reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on tensor manipulation functions, particularly `tf.gather`, `tf.range`, and `tf.slice`. Additionally, studying resources on advanced indexing techniques within TensorFlow will provide a deeper understanding of manipulating tensors beyond the basic slicing examples provided.  Examining examples related to tensor reshaping and broadcasting will prove invaluable in more complex slicing operations involving multiple dimensions and advanced index manipulations.  Finally, exploring TensorFlow's dataset APIs, especially `tf.data.Dataset`, might offer more optimized ways to handle data slicing within larger data processing workflows.  These resources will offer a comprehensive overview of TensorFlow's capabilities in this domain.
