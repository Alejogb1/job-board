In my experience, a primary cause for TensorBoard not displaying all expected runs stems from inconsistencies in the event file saving process, often exacerbated by misunderstandings of how TensorBoard identifies and groups logs. Specifically, TensorBoard relies on parsing TensorFlow event files (.tfevents) located within specified log directories. If these files are not written correctly or are placed in locations TensorBoard is not actively monitoring, then the corresponding runs will not appear. It's not a failure of TensorBoard itself, but rather a misconfiguration of the logging system or its interaction with TensorBoard.

When initiating a training or evaluation process involving TensorFlow, one generally uses a `tf.summary.FileWriter` object (or its higher-level counterpart, like `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard`). This FileWriter is responsible for writing summary data (scalars, histograms, images, etc.) to the .tfevents file. The directory specified when creating the FileWriter determines where these files are stored. TensorBoard, in turn, is launched pointing to this or its parent directory. If the path specified when launching TensorBoard doesn't align with the actual storage locations of the .tfevents files, or if multiple, separate log folders are created without a single encompassing parent, then data visualization becomes incomplete.

Another critical aspect is the FileWriterâ€™s usage within a training loop. If the FileWriter object is redefined or overwritten in each training iteration rather than being opened once and reused for the entire training process, the previously written data might be unintentionally overwritten, resulting in only the most recent data being accessible to TensorBoard. Similarly, if multiple processes simultaneously write to the same event file, data corruption or loss is likely to occur and potentially result in absent runs. The timing of writing the data also matters; TensorBoard scans the directories periodically, so data written after TensorBoard has initialized, and not through an active FileWriter, might not be immediately visible, and may require a TensorBoard refresh or a restart to appear.

Furthermore, consider the situation where different runs are associated with different subdirectories underneath a common root. TensorBoard might require specific instructions, such as specifying the parent directory or utilizing TensorBoard's `logdir` argument with sub-directory structures to view them all. TensorBoard, by default, will often only monitor the specified directory, or immediately adjacent subdirectories. If the directory structure is nested more deeply, some runs might be overlooked.

The naming conventions for the directories or the event files can also lead to display problems. If a given directory contains more than one event file, or if the event files are inadvertently named to be excluded by the parsing logic in TensorBoard, it could contribute to only a subset of data being visualized.

Here are illustrative code examples showcasing common mistakes and their solutions:

**Example 1: Incorrect FileWriter Initialization in Training Loop**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os

log_dir = "logs/incorrect_log"
if not os.path.exists(log_dir):
    os.makedirs(log_dir)

# Simulate a simple training process
for step in range(10):
    # Incorrect: FileWriter is redefined in each step
    writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)
    with writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', np.random.rand(), step=step)
```

In this example, within each iteration, a new `FileWriter` is created and immediately discarded. Each `tf.summary.scalar` call only writes within the scope of the context manager, essentially overwriting the previous steps' log with each iteration. If TensorBoard was pointed to `logs/incorrect_log`, it would only display a single value for the "loss" tag. The solution is to create the `FileWriter` only once before the loop starts.

**Example 2: Correct FileWriter Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os

log_dir = "logs/correct_log"
if not os.path.exists(log_dir):
    os.makedirs(log_dir)

# Correct: FileWriter is created before the loop
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

# Simulate training
for step in range(10):
    with writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', np.random.rand(), step=step)

writer.close() # it's a good practice to close the writer at the end
```

Here, the `FileWriter` object is instantiated only once before the loop, which then consistently streams the summary data within each iteration to the same file. TensorBoard, when pointed to `logs/correct_log`, will correctly display the evolution of the "loss" tag over all 10 steps.

**Example 3: TensorBoard not showing logs for nested subdirectories**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os

main_log_dir = "logs/multiple_runs"
run1_log_dir = os.path.join(main_log_dir, 'run1')
run2_log_dir = os.path.join(main_log_dir, 'run2')

if not os.path.exists(run1_log_dir):
    os.makedirs(run1_log_dir)

if not os.path.exists(run2_log_dir):
    os.makedirs(run2_log_dir)

# Simulate Run 1
writer1 = tf.summary.create_file_writer(run1_log_dir)
for step in range(5):
    with writer1.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss_run1', np.random.rand(), step=step)

writer1.close()

# Simulate Run 2
writer2 = tf.summary.create_file_writer(run2_log_dir)
for step in range(5):
    with writer2.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss_run2', np.random.rand(), step=step)
writer2.close()
```

When starting TensorBoard with `tensorboard --logdir logs/multiple_runs`, it might not show 'run1' and 'run2' directly. Instead, either use the `--logdir` argument to point specifically to run1 or run2 or use subdirectories as described below to show all runs at once. In case the subdirectories need to be included from the parent directory, which in this case would be `logs/multiple_runs`, the `--logdir` argument could be used like this: `tensorboard --logdir logs/multiple_runs --logdir_spec "run1:run1,run2:run2"`. This way, the individual runs can be properly visualized within TensorBoard. Alternatively, each sub-directory can have a specific logdir tag as in `tensorboard --logdir logs/multiple_runs/run1 --logdir_spec run1:run1` and `tensorboard --logdir logs/multiple_runs/run2 --logdir_spec run2:run2` if the intent is to start multiple tensorboards, each for one subdirectory.

In conclusion, the non-appearance of runs in TensorBoard stems primarily from issues related to FileWriter instantiation, data persistence, directory structure misconfigurations and the command line arguments used to launch TensorBoard. Ensuring that FileWriters are used correctly, that data is being written to accessible locations, and that the correct logdir specification is passed to TensorBoard is crucial for proper visualization of training or evaluation runs.

For further information, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation sections on `tf.summary`, `tf.summary.create_file_writer`, and `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard`. The TensorBoard guide included within the TensorFlow documentation is also invaluable. Additionally, examining relevant examples within the official TensorFlow GitHub repository is a good resource for understanding best practices. Finally, reviewing Stack Overflow discussions tagged with `tensorflow` and `tensorboard` can provide helpful insights from the broader community and help to resolve specific problems.
