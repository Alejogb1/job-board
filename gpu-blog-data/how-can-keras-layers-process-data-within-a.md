In Keras, layers process data within a batch primarily through vectorized operations, enabling efficient computation on GPUs and CPUs. The core idea is that a layer’s internal calculations aren't typically done on each individual input sample one at a time; instead, they are performed simultaneously across all samples within the batch. This parallelization is crucial for performance, especially when working with large datasets and complex models.

To understand this better, consider a simple `Dense` layer. When you feed a batch of input data to this layer, let’s say a batch of 32 images with 784 pixels each (after flattening), the input tensor will have the shape (32, 784). This is not a single sample of 784 features, but a batch of 32 such samples. The `Dense` layer multiplies this input tensor by its weight matrix and adds a bias term, resulting in an output tensor with a shape (32, `units`). The “`units`” parameter refers to the output dimension for each sample, which is the number of neurons in that dense layer. This multiplication and addition are not done sample-by-sample; it’s done as a single tensor operation. This is how Keras layers leverage vectorized computation for speed.

The same concept extends to all other Keras layers. Convolutional layers, for instance, perform their convolutions across all images within a batch simultaneously. The filter (or kernel) is applied to each sample’s data within a batch. The output, however, will retain the batch dimension, ensuring each element in the output corresponds to an element in the input batch. Pooling layers likewise, apply their operations to all samples in the batch in parallel. This batch-wise processing principle also applies to recurrent layers like LSTM and GRU; even though the recurrent computation unfolds through the time steps, these operations are done concurrently for every sequence in the input batch.

Now, let's examine how specific operations are applied within different layer types.

**Code Example 1: Dense Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Example input batch of 10 samples, each with 5 features
input_data = np.random.rand(10, 5).astype(np.float32)

# Defining a Dense layer with 3 units
dense_layer = keras.layers.Dense(units=3, activation='relu')

# Passing the input batch through the layer
output_data = dense_layer(input_data)

# Print the output shape
print(f"Input Shape: {input_data.shape}")
print(f"Output Shape: {output_data.shape}")

# Retrieve the weight and bias matrices and print their shapes
weights = dense_layer.kernel
bias = dense_layer.bias
print(f"Weights Shape: {weights.shape}")
print(f"Bias Shape: {bias.shape}")
```

In this example, we define a `Dense` layer with 3 units. When the input data of shape `(10, 5)` is passed through this layer, the output has a shape of `(10, 3)`. This means that the matrix multiplication (`input_data` * `weights`) and bias addition are done concurrently for all 10 samples, and the output provides three activation values for each sample. The weights tensor shape corresponds to the `input_shape` and `units` and the bias shape corresponds to the `units`, which in this example translates to `(5,3)` and `(3)` respectively. This showcases the batch-wise computation: every input sample in the batch is processed simultaneously.

**Code Example 2: Convolutional Layer (Conv2D)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Example input batch of 4 images, each with dimensions (28, 28, 3)
input_data = np.random.rand(4, 28, 28, 3).astype(np.float32)

# Defining a Conv2D layer with 16 filters, kernel size 3, and ReLU activation
conv_layer = keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu')

# Passing the input batch through the layer
output_data = conv_layer(input_data)

# Print the output shape
print(f"Input Shape: {input_data.shape}")
print(f"Output Shape: {output_data.shape}")
# Retrieve the filter weights and print their shape
filter_weights = conv_layer.kernel
print(f"Filter weights Shape: {filter_weights.shape}")

```

Here, we examine a `Conv2D` layer. The input batch consists of 4 images, each of size (28, 28, 3). The `Conv2D` layer with 16 filters and a kernel size of (3, 3) applies the filters across every image in the batch. Notice that the output has a shape of `(4, 26, 26, 16)`. The batch size remains unchanged, and each input image within the batch is convolved with 16 filters. Every filter within the `conv_layer` is applied to each image within the batch separately and each one produces one feature map. This batch operation demonstrates the vectorized approach in convolutional layers. Filter weights have shape corresponding to `(kernel_size_x, kernel_size_y, input_channels, filters)`, which in this example translates to `(3,3,3,16)`.

**Code Example 3: Recurrent Layer (LSTM)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Example input batch of 2 sequences, each with 10 time steps and 8 features
input_data = np.random.rand(2, 10, 8).astype(np.float32)

# Defining a LSTM layer with 32 units
lstm_layer = keras.layers.LSTM(units=32)

# Passing the input batch through the layer
output_data = lstm_layer(input_data)

# Print the output shape
print(f"Input Shape: {input_data.shape}")
print(f"Output Shape: {output_data.shape}")

#If you need to return the output for each time step use return_sequences=True in initialization:
lstm_layer_seq = keras.layers.LSTM(units=32, return_sequences=True)
output_data_seq = lstm_layer_seq(input_data)
print(f"Sequential output shape: {output_data_seq.shape}")

```

In this final example, we utilize an `LSTM` layer. The input is a batch of 2 sequences, where each sequence consists of 10 time steps and 8 features. The output of the `LSTM` layer is a tensor of shape `(2, 32)`, where the final hidden state for each sequence within the batch is captured. It’s crucial to note that while the LSTM internally processes sequences step by step, it does this for all sequences in the batch at the same time. When the `return_sequences` flag is set to true during initialization, the output will contain the hidden state for every time step of each sequence, which in this example is a shape of `(2,10,32)`. This parallel processing is another instance of the batch-wise nature of Keras layers.

In essence, these examples illustrate that Keras layers, regardless of their specific function, exploit vectorized operations to process data within a batch. This is achieved by performing computations across the entire batch as a single, efficient operation instead of individually processing each sample. This batch-centric processing method is a cornerstone of Keras and significantly contributes to the framework's speed and efficiency, especially when leveraging GPUs.

For further understanding, I recommend exploring resources that provide detailed explanations of vectorization in deep learning. Texts discussing the implementation of different layer types from the ground up can be highly insightful. Additionally, delving into books covering the math behind deep learning, specifically focusing on matrix operations and how they are used in different architectures will further enhance understanding. Furthermore, focusing on understanding data flow in the Tensorflow graph, specifically during training, can clarify how operations are applied and grouped in batches. Finally, studying the source code of relevant keras layers in TensorFlow is an excellent method to further refine understanding.
