TensorFlow import errors in Python 3.6 frequently stem from incompatibility between the TensorFlow version and the underlying Python installation, particularly concerning the presence or absence of specific system-level dependencies like CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration.  My experience debugging these issues over the years, primarily during the development of a large-scale image recognition system, has highlighted the crucial role of environment management in mitigating these problems.  Simply put, a clean, well-defined environment is paramount.

**1.  Explanation of TensorFlow Import Errors in Python 3.6**

The core problem revolves around the intricate dependencies within the TensorFlow ecosystem. TensorFlow, particularly earlier versions, displayed considerable sensitivity to mismatched versions of Python, NumPy, and supporting libraries. Python 3.6, while a relatively stable release, fell within a transitional period where TensorFlow's support for various features and hardware configurations evolved rapidly.  Attempting to install TensorFlow without carefully considering these dependencies often results in cryptic `ImportError` messages. These errors may point towards missing modules, conflicts between different versions of the same library, or even issues related to the underlying operating system's support for TensorFlow's acceleration capabilities (CUDA/cuDNN).  Furthermore, improper installation methods, such as globally installing TensorFlow using `pip install tensorflow` without considering virtual environments, can exacerbate these conflicts, creating a cascade of dependency problems across your entire Python installation.

A common manifestation is an error message along the lines of  `ImportError: No module named 'tensorflow'` or a more complex error detailing a missing or incompatible dependency within the TensorFlow package itself.  This often indicates that the TensorFlow wheel file you've downloaded is not correctly aligned with the configuration of your Python environment.  The problem is compounded by the fact that TensorFlow's build process for various platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and configurations (CPU only, CUDA enabled) generates distinct wheel files, and downloading the wrong one guarantees failure.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate best practices to circumvent TensorFlow import issues within Python 3.6, emphasizing the importance of virtual environments and precise installation instructions.

**Example 1: Utilizing Virtual Environments with `venv` and pip**

This is the recommended approach for managing dependencies and preventing conflicts.

```python
# Create a virtual environment
python3.6 -m venv tf_env

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source tf_env/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
tf_env\Scripts\activate

# Install TensorFlow (CPU only)
pip install tensorflow

# Verify installation
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

This code snippet first creates a virtual environment using `venv`, a standard Python module.  Activating this environment isolates TensorFlow's dependencies from the global Python installation.  The `pip install tensorflow` command installs the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, which is the safest option in case you don't have compatible GPU hardware and drivers.  Finally, verification through a simple Python script confirms the successful installation and displays the TensorFlow version.

**Example 2: Installing TensorFlow with GPU support (CUDA/cuDNN)**

This example assumes you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU and CUDA Toolkit installed.

```python
# (Assuming virtual environment is already created and activated as in Example 1)
# Install CUDA-compatible TensorFlow
pip install tensorflow-gpu

# Verify installation and check for GPU support
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__); print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
```

Installing `tensorflow-gpu` attempts to install the GPU-accelerated version.  However, prior to execution, ensure that the CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN are installed and properly configured.  The crucial verification step here utilizes `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` which will return a list of available GPUs if the installation is successful and TensorFlow correctly detects your GPU. An empty list indicates a problem with either CUDA/cuDNN installation or their configuration.


**Example 3: Specifying TensorFlow Version (Conda)**

While `venv` is preferred, `conda` provides another robust solution for managing environments, especially helpful when dealing with more complex dependencies.

```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n tf_env python=3.6

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate tf_env

# Install TensorFlow (specify version if needed)
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow=2.10.0 # Replace with desired version

# Verify installation
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```
This example showcases the use of `conda`, a powerful package manager for Python.  The crucial aspect here is specifying the TensorFlow version explicitly using `tensorflow=2.10.0`.   Always consult the TensorFlow documentation to find the compatible version for your Python 3.6 and hardware configuration.  Using a specific version eliminates potential ambiguities caused by pip's automated dependency resolution.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation is indispensable.  Familiarize yourself with the installation guides, particularly the sections covering different operating systems and hardware setups.  The Python documentation itself is crucial for understanding virtual environments and package management.  Finally, detailed understanding of CUDA and cuDNN is essential if you aim to leverage GPU acceleration; refer to their respective documentation for detailed installation and configuration instructions.  Consult these resources thoroughly to select the TensorFlow version best-suited for your system.  Addressing the intricacies of dependency management will resolve most TensorFlow import errors.
