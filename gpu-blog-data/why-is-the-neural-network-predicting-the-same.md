The consistent prediction of identical probabilities across all input rows in a neural network almost invariably points to a problem within the network's architecture, training process, or data preprocessing.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous deep learning projects, including a large-scale fraud detection system and a medical image classification pipeline, this symptom usually stems from a lack of sufficient gradient flow, leading to the network effectively "freezing" in a state where weights are not being updated effectively.

**1.  Explanation:  Gradient Vanishing and Weight Stagnation**

The most common culprit behind uniform probability predictions is the phenomenon of gradient vanishing or exploding.  In networks with many layers, particularly those using sigmoid or tanh activation functions, the gradients calculated during backpropagation can become extremely small or extremely large.  During the training process, the network updates its weights based on the calculated gradients.  If the gradients consistently approach zero, the weight updates become negligible, effectively halting the learning process.  The network then settles into a state where its output is largely independent of the input, frequently resulting in identical predictions across all data points. This can manifest as consistently predicting the same class probability or an average probability across all classes.  This isn't necessarily a problem of underfitting, though it presents similarly; rather, it’s a consequence of the optimization algorithm failing to escape a suboptimal region in the weight space.  The network isn't learning to differentiate between inputs; its weights aren't adjusted to reflect any meaningful differences between them.  This contrasts sharply with overfitting, where the network memorizes training data and thus performs poorly on unseen data – here, the network fails to learn anything of the training data at all.

Another crucial factor to consider is data scaling.  If your input features are on vastly different scales, the network may struggle to learn effectively.  Large-scale features can dominate the gradient calculations, dwarfing the influence of smaller-scale features and contributing to poor weight updates. This can lead to the same stagnation problem as gradient vanishing.

Finally, it's imperative to inspect the network architecture itself.  An excessively deep network with inappropriate activation functions may inherently hinder gradient flow. Similarly, a network that is too narrow (has too few neurons in its hidden layers) may lack the capacity to model the complex relationships in your data, again leading to the observed symptom.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate potential sources of the problem and possible solutions.  Note that these are simplified illustrative examples; real-world scenarios often involve more complex data preprocessing and network architectures.

**Example 1: Gradient Vanishing with Sigmoid Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple neural network with sigmoid activation
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='sigmoid'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

#Compile the model with a typical optimizer, loss and metric.
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate synthetic data - this is crucial to demonstrate the effect
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Train the model - note the potential for issues with limited data and sigmoid activation
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Predict probabilities – you might observe consistent probability predictions here.
predictions = model.predict(np.random.rand(10, 10))
print(predictions)
```

Commentary: This example uses sigmoid activation functions in multiple layers, making it prone to gradient vanishing, especially with limited training data.  The consistent output probabilities likely indicate that the network failed to learn effectively due to this phenomenon.  Switching to ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) or similar activation functions would likely improve performance.


**Example 2:  Impact of Data Scaling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Generate data with vastly different scales
X_train = np.concatenate((np.random.rand(100, 5), np.random.rand(100, 5) * 1000), axis=1)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Scale the data using MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Define a simple neural network (ReLU activation to avoid vanishing gradient in this example)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

predictions = model.predict(scaler.transform(np.random.rand(10, 10)))
print(predictions)
```

Commentary:  This example demonstrates the importance of data scaling. The unscaled data has features with vastly different ranges, hindering effective learning.  Using `MinMaxScaler` (or similar techniques like standardization) ensures that all features contribute equally to the learning process, mitigating potential issues arising from disproportionate feature scales.


**Example 3:  Implementing Batch Normalization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a neural network with batch normalization
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(), #Adding Batch Normalization
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(), #Adding Batch Normalization
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Generate synthetic data
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

predictions = model.predict(np.random.rand(10, 10))
print(predictions)
```

Commentary:  This example incorporates batch normalization layers.  Batch normalization helps stabilize the learning process by normalizing the activations of each layer, mitigating the effects of gradient vanishing and exploding.  Including batch normalization layers, especially in deeper networks, is a crucial technique for addressing issues of gradient flow and improving training stability.
