The most common cause of tabs failing to render within a Dijit `TabContainer`, and all content panes appearing simultaneously, stems from improperly managing the lifecycle and rendering sequence of the Dijit widgets, specifically regarding their placement within the Document Object Model (DOM) and the timing of their instantiation. I've observed this repeatedly when initially working with Dojo's Dijit framework, particularly in dynamic single-page application setups. These issues usually boil down to Dojo's reliance on specific DOM structures and widget lifecycle events being triggered in the correct order.

A `TabContainer` operates by managing the visibility of its child `ContentPane` widgets, using tabs as controls for switching between them. For tabs to appear and function correctly, the `TabContainer` and all its associated `ContentPane` children must be properly initialized and attached to the DOM before Dijit is instructed to render them. If this sequence is disrupted, either because the widgets are not part of the document tree when rendering is attempted, or they are configured incorrectly, the tabs and associated logic will not initialize correctly, resulting in the behavior you described. Essentially, the `TabContainer` fails to locate its associated panes, leaving them all visible.

Let's analyze specific scenarios with corresponding code examples to illustrate how this problem manifests and can be corrected.

**Scenario 1: Premature Instantiation**

Often, the root cause is instantiating `ContentPane` widgets *before* their parent `TabContainer` exists within the DOM. Dijit relies on the `dojo/dom-construct` and similar mechanisms to place the widget’s visual representation within the document, a process linked to the `startup()` method on the Dijit widgets. If this method executes on the `ContentPane` before it’s a child of the `TabContainer`, the internal logic for tab selection and visibility will not function correctly.

```javascript
require([
    "dijit/layout/TabContainer",
    "dijit/layout/ContentPane",
    "dojo/domReady!",
    "dojo/dom-construct"
], function(TabContainer, ContentPane, domReady, domConstruct) {

    // Incorrect Approach: ContentPane created before TabContainer
    var pane1 = new ContentPane({
        title: "Pane One",
        content: "Content for Pane One."
    });

    var pane2 = new ContentPane({
        title: "Pane Two",
        content: "Content for Pane Two."
    });

    var tabContainer = new TabContainer({
        style: "width: 300px; height: 200px;"
    }, "tabContainerDiv"); // Assumes <div id="tabContainerDiv"></div> exists

    tabContainer.addChild(pane1);
    tabContainer.addChild(pane2);

    tabContainer.startup(); // Incorrectly positioned startup() call
});
```

In this flawed example, the `ContentPane` instances (`pane1` and `pane2`) are created and their `startup()` methods are implicitly called by their constructors, before they are added as children of the `TabContainer`, and before the `TabContainer` has been placed in the document and started. This causes each `ContentPane` to initialize itself independently from the `TabContainer`'s mechanism and not participate in the tabbed interface, resulting in them all being visible. Further, the `tabContainer.startup()` call here is also in the wrong position because the panes will not be a part of the tree when the Dijit looks for them.

**Scenario 2: Incorrect DOM Placement**

Another frequent issue arises from adding the `TabContainer` to the DOM using methods other than `dojo/dom-construct`, which may not trigger the correct Dijit lifecycle events. This can cause the child panes to be added correctly, but the `TabContainer` still fails to initialize properly. The `startup()` method relies on the Dijit tree being consistent within the DOM to properly register all child components.

```javascript
require([
    "dijit/layout/TabContainer",
    "dijit/layout/ContentPane",
    "dojo/dom",
    "dojo/dom-construct",
    "dojo/domReady!"
], function(TabContainer, ContentPane, dom, domConstruct, domReady) {

    var tabContainer = new TabContainer({
        style: "width: 300px; height: 200px;"
    });

     var pane1 = new ContentPane({
        title: "Pane One",
        content: "Content for Pane One."
    });

    var pane2 = new ContentPane({
        title: "Pane Two",
        content: "Content for Pane Two."
    });

    tabContainer.addChild(pane1);
    tabContainer.addChild(pane2);

    // Incorrect Approach: Appending to the DOM using dom.byId()
    var targetNode = dom.byId("tabContainerDiv"); // Assumes <div id="tabContainerDiv"></div> exists
    targetNode.appendChild(tabContainer.domNode);

    tabContainer.startup(); // Startup called after dom insertion, but not by Dijit
});
```

Here, even though the `TabContainer` and its child `ContentPane` instances are created correctly, manually appending `tabContainer.domNode` to the target DOM element bypasses Dijit's standard DOM management, where it controls the placement. Dijit doesn't know that you’ve appended it manually. Therefore, the `TabContainer` and the children's startup sequence is not properly handled by Dijit which leads to the same issues with tab visibility and control.  This breaks the lifecycle of the widgets.

**Scenario 3: Correct Usage with `dojo/dom-construct` and Proper Timing**

The recommended approach involves creating the `TabContainer` programmatically and adding it to the DOM using `dojo/dom-construct`, then adding the `ContentPane` instances as children, and finally calling `startup()` once all components are in place. Dijit expects the full widget tree to be present when `startup()` is called for the first time, ensuring the Dijit framework manages its layout and rendering completely and correctly.

```javascript
require([
    "dijit/layout/TabContainer",
    "dijit/layout/ContentPane",
    "dojo/dom",
    "dojo/dom-construct",
    "dojo/domReady!"
], function(TabContainer, ContentPane, dom, domConstruct, domReady) {

    var tabContainer = new TabContainer({
        style: "width: 300px; height: 200px;"
    });


    var pane1 = new ContentPane({
        title: "Pane One",
        content: "Content for Pane One."
    });

    var pane2 = new ContentPane({
        title: "Pane Two",
        content: "Content for Pane Two."
    });


    tabContainer.addChild(pane1);
    tabContainer.addChild(pane2);


    // Correct approach: Create in the DOM, then add panes, then start
    domConstruct.place(tabContainer.domNode, "tabContainerDiv");

    tabContainer.startup();
});

```

In this correct example, the `TabContainer` is instantiated, the children are added, then it is placed into the correct document location utilizing `dojo/dom-construct`, followed by a call to its `startup()` method. By ensuring the `TabContainer` is a part of the DOM *before* the `startup()` method is invoked, and that the placement is managed by Dijit, the tabs render correctly, and only the active pane becomes visible. This also allows Dijit to properly manage the lifecycle of the widget and all of its descendants.

**Resource Recommendations**

When working with Dijit, refer to the official Dojo documentation on Dijit widgets. Pay close attention to sections covering the `startup()` method, lifecycle events, and the correct usage of DOM manipulation with `dojo/dom-construct`. The documentation provides detailed explanations and examples for each Dijit widget, making it a valuable resource for avoiding issues and understanding the expected usage patterns. Study the component's constructor arguments, specifically how children are attached and initialized as this will prove incredibly helpful. It is also beneficial to work through small examples to see how lifecycle events such as `postCreate` and `startup` function to properly construct the layout of a Dijit application. Finally, explore the Dijit testing framework, as its tests often demonstrate correct usage patterns. Debugging by exploring the Dijit hierarchy in your application's developer tools console, inspecting DOM structure, and using browser-based debuggers is incredibly helpful to understand the current state of widgets.
