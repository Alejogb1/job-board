The distribution of abundant numbers, those where the sum of their proper divisors exceeds the number itself, is irregular and not easily characterized by a closed-form formula.  My experience working on number-theoretic algorithms for large-scale data processing has shown that efficient computation requires a careful balance between algorithmic complexity and memory management.  Directly counting abundant numbers up to N via brute-force checking of divisors for each integer is computationally expensive, scaling poorly with increasing N.  Therefore, optimized approaches utilizing sieving or pre-computation are crucial.

**1.  Explanation:**

The naive approach to finding the count of abundant numbers up to N involves iterating through each number from 1 to N and calculating the sum of its proper divisors. If this sum exceeds the number itself, the number is abundant, and a counter is incremented.  This method's time complexity is O(N√N), arising from the divisor sum calculation.  Each number's divisors are checked up to its square root, and this is repeated N times. This is computationally infeasible for large values of N.

A more efficient approach involves pre-computing the sum of divisors for all numbers up to N. This can be done using a sieve-like method. We initialize an array `sum_of_divisors` of size N+1, initially filled with zeros.  Then, for each integer `i` from 1 to N, we iterate through its multiples `j = 2i, 3i, 4i…` up to N, adding `i` to `sum_of_divisors[j]`.  This ensures that each divisor of a number contributes to its sum. Finally, we iterate through `sum_of_divisors`, counting the instances where `sum_of_divisors[i] - i > i` (the sum of proper divisors exceeds the number itself).  This sieving technique reduces the time complexity to O(N log N), a significant improvement.  Furthermore, employing efficient data structures like bitsets can offer additional performance gains for extremely large values of N.  Memory usage, however, becomes a limiting factor in this optimized approach.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Naive Approach (Inefficient for large N)**

```python
def count_abundant_naive(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(12, n + 1): #Start from 12, the smallest abundant number
        sum_div = 0
        for j in range(1, i):
            if i % j == 0:
                sum_div += j
        if sum_div > i:
            count += 1
    return count

#Example usage (will be slow for large n):
n = 1000
print(f"Number of abundant numbers up to {n}: {count_abundant_naive(n)}")
```

This demonstrates the straightforward but inefficient approach.  The nested loops directly implement the divisor sum calculation, leading to the O(N√N) complexity.


**Example 2:  Sieve-based Approach (More Efficient)**

```python
def count_abundant_sieve(n):
    sum_of_divisors = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(2 * i, n + 1, i):
            sum_of_divisors[j] += i
    count = 0
    for i in range(12, n + 1):
        if sum_of_divisors[i] - i > i:
            count += 1
    return count

#Example usage:
n = 10000
print(f"Number of abundant numbers up to {n}: {count_abundant_sieve(n)}")

```

This utilizes a sieve to pre-compute the sum of divisors, resulting in the improved O(N log N) complexity.  Note that this code still iterates through the `sum_of_divisors` array, but this single iteration dominates over the nested loops in the naive approach.


**Example 3: Optimized Sieve with Bitset (for extremely large N, memory constrained)**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int countAbundantOptimized(int n) {
    std::vector<bool> isAbundant(n + 1, false);
    std::vector<long long> sumDivisors(n + 1, 0);

    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (long long j = 2 * i; j <= n; j += i) {
            sumDivisors[j] += i;
        }
    }

    for (int i = 12; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (sumDivisors[i] > 2 * i) {
            isAbundant[i] = true;
        }
    }

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 12; i <= n; i++) {
        if (isAbundant[i]) count++;
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n = 100000; //Example usage for larger n.  Memory usage becomes significant
    std::cout << "Number of abundant numbers up to " << n << ": " << countAbundantOptimized(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ example showcases the use of a `std::vector<bool>` which is often implemented as a bitset, offering memory efficiency compared to a `std::vector<int>` or similar. This is particularly advantageous when dealing with extremely large values of N, where memory usage can become the dominant constraint.  The algorithmic complexity remains O(N log N), but memory management is further optimized.
