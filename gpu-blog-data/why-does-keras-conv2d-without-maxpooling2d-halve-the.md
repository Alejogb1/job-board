The reduction in output shape of a Keras `Conv2D` layer without subsequent `MaxPooling2D` is fundamentally due to the convolution operation's inherent spatial downsampling effect when the stride parameter exceeds one, or when padding is not sufficient to counteract the reduction caused by the filter's size.  My experience debugging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across numerous projects – ranging from image classification to object detection – has highlighted this behavior as a frequent source of confusion for newcomers. Let's clarify this with precise explanations and illustrative examples.

**1.  Convolutional Operation and Spatial Dimensions:**

The core of the `Conv2D` layer is the convolution operation itself. This operation involves sliding a kernel (filter) across the input feature map.  The kernel, of size `(kernel_size, kernel_size)`, performs element-wise multiplication with the corresponding input region and sums the results to produce a single output value. The output value's location in the output feature map corresponds to the center of the kernel's position on the input.

The crucial aspect affecting the output shape is the *stride*.  The stride determines how many pixels the kernel moves horizontally and vertically after each convolution operation. A stride of 1 implies the kernel moves one pixel at a time, resulting in an output of similar dimensions (accounting for padding). However, a stride greater than 1 leads to a direct downsampling of the output feature map.

Furthermore, padding plays a critical role. Padding adds extra rows and columns of zeros around the input feature map's edges. This padding can mitigate the reduction in output dimensions caused by the convolution and/or stride. 'Same' padding ensures the output has the same spatial dimensions as the input (assuming a stride of 1), whereas 'valid' padding uses no padding, leading to a smaller output.

If the stride is greater than 1 and padding is 'valid', the output will be significantly smaller than the input.  The formula for calculating the output shape (`h`, `w`) for a Conv2D layer with input shape (`H`, `W`), kernel size `k`, stride `s`, and padding `p` is approximately:

`h = floor((H + 2p - k) / s) + 1`
`w = floor((W + 2p - k) / s) + 1`

Where `floor()` denotes the floor function (rounding down to the nearest integer). This formula reveals that if `s > 1` and `p` is small or zero (valid padding), the output dimensions will be smaller than the input.  This is precisely why, in the absence of MaxPooling, you observe a halving (or other reduction) of the output shape—the stride and kernel size are implicitly downsampling the spatial dimensions.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with Keras code examples, focusing on the influence of stride and padding.

**Example 1:  Stride > 1, Valid Padding (Halving effect)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), strides=(2, 2), padding='valid', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
])

input_shape = (64, 64, 3)
output_shape = model.predict(tf.zeros((1,)+input_shape)).shape
print(f"Input shape: {input_shape}, Output shape: {output_shape}")
```

This example demonstrates the halving effect.  A stride of (2,2) and `valid` padding will approximately halve the input height and width. The output will be (31, 31, 32), which is approximately half of the input.  The slight discrepancy comes from the floor function in the dimension calculation.

**Example 2: Stride = 1, Same Padding (Preserving Shape)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
])

input_shape = (64, 64, 3)
output_shape = model.predict(tf.zeros((1,)+input_shape)).shape
print(f"Input shape: {input_shape}, Output shape: {output_shape}")
```

Here, using a stride of 1 and 'same' padding, the output shape will be (64, 64, 32), preserving the spatial dimensions of the input.  The output depth, 32, reflects the number of filters used in the convolution.

**Example 3: Large Kernel and Valid Padding (Significant Reduction)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (7, 7), strides=(1, 1), padding='valid', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
])

input_shape = (64, 64, 3)
output_shape = model.predict(tf.zeros((1,)+input_shape)).shape
print(f"Input shape: {input_shape}, Output shape: {output_shape}")
```

This example shows that even with a stride of 1, a large kernel size coupled with `valid` padding will significantly reduce the output dimensions. The output will be (58, 58, 32), illustrating that the kernel size itself imposes a spatial reduction.  Note that the reduction is not exactly a halving, but a considerable decrease.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official Keras documentation, introductory texts on deep learning (particularly chapters on convolutional neural networks), and specialized literature on image processing and signal processing.  Understanding the mathematical underpinnings of convolution is invaluable. Examining source code of established CNN implementations can also be enlightening.  Pay close attention to the parameters of convolutional layers and experiment with different configurations to solidify your comprehension.  The core concept of stride and padding's interaction with kernel size is key to mastering the behavior of `Conv2D` layers.
