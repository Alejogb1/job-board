The crux of computing input gradients in a Keras ANN lies in understanding that the model's inherent forward pass implicitly defines the computational graph.  Directly accessing gradients with respect to input features requires leveraging automatic differentiation capabilities, specifically through the use of Keras' `GradientTape` functionality, coupled with a precise understanding of the model's architecture and the desired gradient computation scope.  My experience working on large-scale anomaly detection systems heavily relied on this technique for generating saliency maps and visualizing feature contributions.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Keras, built upon TensorFlow, offers a straightforward method for gradient computation.  The `tf.GradientTape` context manager records operations performed within its scope.  Crucially, this allows us to compute gradients not only with respect to model weights (the standard backpropagation scenario), but also with respect to any tensor within that scope, including the model's input.  This is achieved by specifying the `watch` argument within the `GradientTape`'s context, explicitly telling it to track gradients for the specified tensor(s).  Subsequently, the `gradient()` method, called on the tape after the forward pass, yields the gradient tensors.  The key here is maintaining a clear understanding of the model's output and which input features are of interest for gradient calculation.  Incorrectly specifying the `watch` argument or failing to properly structure the computation within the tape's scope will result in incorrect or undefined gradients.

The process typically involves:

1. **Defining the model:**  Instantiating a Keras sequential or functional model.
2. **Creating a `GradientTape`:**  Initializing the tape with `persistent=True` (if gradients with respect to multiple outputs are needed) to allow multiple gradient computations from a single forward pass.
3. **Watching the inputs:** Using the `watch` method to tell the tape to track gradients concerning the input tensor.
4. **Performing the forward pass:**  Passing the input data through the model.
5. **Computing the gradients:**  Using the tape's `gradient()` method to compute the gradients with respect to the watched input, using the model's output as the target for differentiation.
6. **Handling the gradients:**  Interpreting and utilizing the computed gradients; for example, visualizing them as saliency maps or incorporating them into a gradient-based optimization algorithm for the input features themselves.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Sequential Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Input data
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 10)

# Gradient Tape context
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(input_data)  # Watch the input data
    output = model(input_data)

# Compute gradients
input_gradients = tape.gradient(output, input_data)

print(input_gradients)
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward gradient computation for a simple sequential model.  The `tape.watch(input_data)` line is crucial for tracking the input tensor's gradients.  The resulting `input_gradients` tensor represents the gradient of the model's output with respect to each input feature.

**Example 2: Functional Model with Multiple Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a functional model with two inputs
input_a = tf.keras.Input(shape=(5,))
input_b = tf.keras.Input(shape=(5,))

x = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([input_a, input_b])
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=output)

# Input data
input_data_a = np.random.rand(1, 5)
input_data_b = np.random.rand(1, 5)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch([input_data_a, input_data_b])
    output = model([input_data_a, input_data_b])

gradients = tape.gradient(output, [input_data_a, input_data_b])

print(gradients)
```

This example extends the concept to a functional model with multiple inputs.  Note that `tape.watch` now accepts a list, allowing for gradient computation with respect to both input tensors.  The resulting `gradients` will be a list of gradient tensors, one for each input.


**Example 3: Handling Custom Layers and Loss Functions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Custom layer
class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.sin(inputs)

# Define a model with a custom layer
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Input data and custom loss
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 10)
target = np.array([[0.5]])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(input_data)
    output = model(input_data)
    loss = tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(target, output)

input_gradients = tape.gradient(loss, input_data)

print(input_gradients)
```

This example demonstrates the flexibility of `GradientTape` by integrating it with a custom layer and loss function.  The gradient computation remains consistent; the tape records the operations, including those from the custom layer, allowing for accurate gradient calculation with respect to the input based on the defined loss.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation offers comprehensive details on automatic differentiation and `GradientTape`.  Exploring resources dedicated to deep learning with TensorFlow and its lower-level functionalities will prove highly beneficial.  Furthermore, studying texts focusing on the mathematical foundations of backpropagation and automatic differentiation provides a strong theoretical basis for understanding these techniques.  Reviewing research papers on gradient-based optimization methods and their applications in neural networks will also enhance your comprehension.
