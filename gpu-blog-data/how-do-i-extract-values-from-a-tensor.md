Tensor manipulation, particularly value extraction using `argmax`, hinges on understanding the underlying data structure and the function's behavior across different dimensions.  My experience optimizing deep learning models has frequently demanded precise control over tensor indexing, and `argmax` has been a central component.  It's crucial to remember that `argmax` doesn't directly return values; instead, it yields the *indices* of the maximum values along a specified axis.  Subsequently, these indices are used to retrieve the corresponding values from the original tensor.  Failure to grasp this distinction often leads to incorrect results.

**1. A Clear Explanation:**

The `argmax` function, available in most tensor libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch), identifies the index of the maximum element along a specified dimension of a tensor.  The function's signature typically includes the `axis` argument which dictates the dimension along which the maximum is searched.  If no axis is specified, the operation is performed across the flattened tensor.  The output is a tensor of indices, one for each slice along the specified axis.  To obtain the actual maximum values, you then need to use these indices to index the original tensor. This process necessitates careful consideration of tensor shapes and broadcasting rules.

Consider a 2D tensor representing image pixel intensities. Applying `argmax` along the axis 0 (rows) would return the index of the row with the maximum value across all columns for each column. Applying `argmax` along axis 1 (columns) would return the index of the column with the maximum value across all rows for each row.  In higher dimensional tensors, this concept extends naturally; each slice along the specified axis is independently processed.

Handling edge cases, such as tensors containing NaN values or ties in maximum values, is critical. Different libraries might handle these scenarios differently.  Always consult the specific documentation for your tensor library to understand how it manages these cases.  For example, some implementations may return the first occurrence of the maximum value in the case of a tie.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: NumPy with a 2D Array**

```python
import numpy as np

tensor = np.array([[1, 5, 2],
                  [8, 3, 9],
                  [4, 7, 6]])

max_indices = np.argmax(tensor, axis=1)  #Finds max index along each row
print(f"Indices of maximum values along axis 1: {max_indices}")

max_values = tensor[np.arange(tensor.shape[0]), max_indices]
print(f"Maximum values along axis 1: {max_values}")


max_indices_axis0 = np.argmax(tensor, axis=0) #Finds max index along each column
print(f"Indices of maximum values along axis 0: {max_indices_axis0}")

max_values_axis0 = tensor[max_indices_axis0, np.arange(tensor.shape[1])]
print(f"Maximum values along axis 0: {max_values_axis0}")

```

This example showcases the fundamental use of `argmax` in NumPy.  The `axis` parameter controls the dimension along which the maximum is sought.  Critically, accessing the maximum *values* requires advanced indexing using `np.arange` to create the correct index array for each row or column.  This is essential for proper broadcasting.

**Example 2: TensorFlow with a 3D Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
                     [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])

max_indices = tf.argmax(tensor, axis=2) #Finds max index along the last axis (depth)
print(f"Indices of maximum values along axis 2: {max_indices}")

max_values = tf.gather_nd(tensor, tf.stack([tf.range(tf.shape(tensor)[0]), tf.range(tf.shape(tensor)[1]), max_indices], axis=-1))
print(f"Maximum values along axis 2: {max_values}")

```

This TensorFlow example expands on the 2D case. The use of `tf.gather_nd` is crucial for handling higher-dimensional tensors.  `tf.stack` constructs the correct multi-dimensional indices necessary to retrieve the maximum values efficiently. Note that direct indexing like in NumPy is less intuitive and often requires more complex indexing operations in TensorFlow for higher-dimensional tensors.


**Example 3: PyTorch with Handling of Ties**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 5, 5], [8, 3, 9], [4, 7, 6]])

max_indices = torch.argmax(tensor, dim=1) #Finds max index along each row. Note the use of 'dim' instead of 'axis'
print(f"Indices of maximum values along dimension 1: {max_indices}")

max_values = tensor[torch.arange(tensor.shape[0]), max_indices]
print(f"Maximum values along dimension 1: {max_values}")


#Illustrating tie handling - PyTorch returns the first occurrence.
tensor_ties = torch.tensor([[1, 5, 5], [8, 3, 9], [4, 7, 7]])
max_indices_ties = torch.argmax(tensor_ties, dim=1)
print(f"Indices of maximum values along dimension 1 (with ties): {max_indices_ties}")
max_values_ties = tensor_ties[torch.arange(tensor_ties.shape[0]), max_indices_ties]
print(f"Maximum values along dimension 1 (with ties): {max_values_ties}")
```

This PyTorch example highlights the similarity to NumPy's approach.  However, it also explicitly demonstrates how PyTorch handles ties in maximum values. The example uses `dim` instead of `axis` which is the common practice in PyTorch.   The output clearly shows that only the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value is returned in the case of ties.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official documentation for NumPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are invaluable resources. Each library's documentation provides detailed explanations of tensor manipulation functions, including `argmax`, along with illustrative examples and explanations of edge cases.  Furthermore, dedicated books on deep learning and tensor computation offer comprehensive discussions of tensor operations and their practical applications in machine learning.  Consider exploring introductory materials on linear algebra and its relationship to tensor manipulations for a deeper theoretical understanding.  Finally, searching for specific error messages encountered during the implementation process within online communities dedicated to these libraries can often lead to rapid solutions to specific problems.
