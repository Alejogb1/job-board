The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) in the loss during TensorFlow Keras model training invariably signifies an issue within the computation that results in an undefined numerical result. This often arises from operations like dividing by zero, taking the logarithm of a non-positive number, or encountering overly large or small values that exceed the floating-point representation’s capacity. Over the years, I've encountered this problem repeatedly in diverse project contexts, from image classification to sequential data modeling. Debugging this can be frustrating, however, a systematic approach focusing on the underlying causes usually leads to a resolution.

Specifically, a NaN loss is not a problem within the optimization process itself but rather a precursor indicating unstable computations. Here's an elaborated breakdown of the common underlying issues, followed by code examples and suggestions:

**1. Numerical Instability:**

   The core issue typically stems from operations involving numbers that are very close to zero or, conversely, exceedingly large. Consider the logarithm operation within a categorical cross-entropy loss. If the probability output from the model becomes exactly zero (or so close that it's indistinguishable from zero for the floating-point representation), the logarithm evaluates to negative infinity. This immediately introduces a NaN through the multiplication with other numeric values. Similarly, the Softmax function, often used in classification tasks, can produce near-zero values if one particular class dominates the others, leading to numerical instability. Exponential functions can also cause overflow or underflow if the inputs are large or small respectively. Gradient calculations, involving derivatives of these functions, then inherit these problematic values. This situation intensifies with the use of mixed-precision training if not properly handled since the float16 type has less dynamic range, and a slightly underflowed or overflowed float32 number would still be representable as an approximate float32, but becomes underflowed/overflowed in float16.

**2. Data Preprocessing Issues:**

   Incorrectly normalized or un-normalized data can also contribute to NaN loss. If, for instance, your input data has a massive range of values, this could lead to very large activations in the network layers, resulting in overflow during computations. An important but often overlooked case is when the input data itself might contain NaN or infinite values which propagate across all downstream operations. Any kind of numerical value that is ill-defined during training will create NaN output.

**3. Improper Network Architecture and Hyperparameters:**

   Certain choices in network architecture, such as using ReLU activation without input normalization, can make the network more susceptible to numerical instability. ReLU’s output can become very large and with very aggressive learning rate, it's possible to get exploding gradient problems. Similarly, a very high learning rate, though it can sometimes speed up training, can also easily cause the weights to diverge and lead to NaN loss. Poor initialization of network weights, for instance, using a constant or uniform initialization with a very large range, can result in large activations and gradients and eventually a NaN loss. Improper clipping can also propagate to NaN value when the parameters are still exploding. Regularization term set to too large can also cause the model to explode and lead to NaN output.

**4. Implementation Bugs:**

   Occasionally, NaN loss can originate from subtle implementation errors, such as incorrect gradient calculation formulas, or a misunderstanding of the underlying function. When using customized loss or training loops, there are higher chances of making those mistakes, leading to the issues.

Let's delve into some code examples:

**Example 1: Logarithm of Zero**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss_with_log(y_true, y_pred):
    # Hypothetical scenario: a model producing probabilities
    epsilon = 1e-7 # Small number to prevent taking log of zero
    y_pred_clipped = tf.clip_by_value(y_pred, epsilon, 1.0) # Clipping to avoid 0 values
    loss = -tf.reduce_mean(y_true * tf.math.log(y_pred_clipped) + (1 - y_true) * tf.math.log(1 - y_pred_clipped))
    return loss


# Simulation of the issue
y_true_example = tf.constant([1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0])
y_pred_problematic = tf.constant([0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0])  # Values that can create NaN
y_pred_okay = tf.constant([0.1, 0.9, 0.99, 0.01]) # Prevent issues

loss_problem = custom_loss_with_log(y_true_example, y_pred_problematic) # Produces NaN
loss_okay = custom_loss_with_log(y_true_example, y_pred_okay)
print("Problematic Loss: ", loss_problem)
print("Okay Loss: ", loss_okay)

```
*Commentary:* This snippet demonstrates a custom loss function where the `tf.math.log` function can result in NaN if `y_pred` is 0. I added a small constant and clipped the predicted probabilities to avoid such cases in production scenarios. This is one way of preventing taking the logarithm of zero. Even better would be adding the epsilon within the formula of calculating cross entropy. This example highlights the importance of numerical stability in custom loss functions.

**Example 2: Unscaled Input Data with ReLU**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model_unscaled = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model_scaled = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

unscaled_input = np.array([[1000.0], [-1000.0], [10000.0], [-10000.0]], dtype=np.float32) # Large range
scaled_input = np.array([[-1.0], [-0.5], [0.5], [1.0]], dtype=np.float32) # Reasonable range

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01) # Set a large learning rate to exaggerate the problem

model_unscaled.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')
model_scaled.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

history_unscaled = model_unscaled.fit(unscaled_input, unscaled_input, epochs=5, verbose=0)
history_scaled = model_scaled.fit(scaled_input, scaled_input, epochs=5, verbose=0)

print("Unscaled Loss: ", history_unscaled.history['loss']) # likely shows NaN
print("Scaled Loss:", history_scaled.history['loss']) # better values

```

*Commentary:* In this example, the `model_unscaled` is trained with unscaled input that can lead to exploding activations and weights especially with ReLU activations and Adam optimizer set with aggressive learning rate. Meanwhile, the `model_scaled` is trained with input data scaled to a reasonable range and thus produces a much stable training and loss. In practice, it is important to ensure appropriate data normalization before providing input to neural networks. This can be a common source of NaN when input data has very large range. This example underscores the importance of preprocessing to get the model parameters within the valid range.

**Example 3: Gradient Clipping (or the lack thereof) and Mixed Precision Training**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])

x = tf.random.normal((10,1)) # Simulating Input
y = tf.random.normal((10,1))

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')


# Without gradient Clipping
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    output = model(x)
    loss = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(y, output)
grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
print("Loss Without Clipping:", loss) # Might be NaN


# Gradient Clipping
optimizer_with_clip = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
model2 = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model2.compile(optimizer=optimizer_with_clip, loss='mse')
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  output = model2(x)
  loss = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(y,output)
grads = tape.gradient(loss, model2.trainable_variables)
grads_clipped = [tf.clip_by_value(grad, -1.0, 1.0) for grad in grads] # Clip Gradients
optimizer_with_clip.apply_gradients(zip(grads_clipped, model2.trainable_variables))
print("Loss With Clipping:", loss)


# Mixed Precision Training (Not run in this example, just demonstration of use)
# from tensorflow.keras import mixed_precision
# policy = mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
# mixed_precision.set_global_policy(policy)
# optimizer_mixed_precision = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
# model_mixed_precision = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
#   tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, dtype='float32')])
# model_mixed_precision.compile(optimizer=optimizer_mixed_precision, loss='mse')
# with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
#     output = model_mixed_precision(x)
#     loss = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(y,output)
#    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model_mixed_precision.trainable_variables)
# optimizer_mixed_precision.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model_mixed_precision.trainable_variables))

```

*Commentary:* Here, we observe gradient clipping in action. When we don’t clip gradients, we risk having very large values in the gradient, which then leads to numerical instabilities in model parameters and finally NaN values. It also showcases in the commentary on how to potentially implement mixed-precision training. In practice, having this on can also sometimes lead to NaN loss when using the mixed_float16 policy. These can be resolved by either appropriately clipping gradient when using mixed precision training or using the float32 type where it's necessary in the model. These examples highlight the importance of carefully managing the computation with gradients and making sure the computation is within a reasonable numerical range.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend exploring resources that discuss numerical methods in machine learning, particularly in the context of neural networks. Look for materials covering gradient descent optimization techniques, including Adam and other adaptive methods. In addition, study the floating point representation in the machine and limitations of those representations. Papers discussing the issues of mixed-precision training and techniques for avoiding numeric instabilities are also invaluable. Focus on documents that describe the inner workings of Tensorflow rather than simply tutorials. These provide more insight into numerical computations.
