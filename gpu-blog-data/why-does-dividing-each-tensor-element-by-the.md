Numerical instability is the primary culprit behind the failure to achieve a sum of exactly one when normalizing a tensor by its sum.  This isn't a theoretical shortcoming of the normalization process itself, but rather a consequence of the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic.  My experience working on large-scale data processing pipelines for image recognition highlighted this issue repeatedly, particularly when dealing with tensors containing a wide range of magnitudes.

**1. Explanation:**

Floating-point numbers, the foundation of numerical computation in most programming languages and hardware, are approximations of real numbers. They lack the precision to represent all real numbers exactly.  This limitation leads to rounding errors, which accumulate during calculations. In the context of tensor normalization, these errors, seemingly insignificant individually, compound when performing numerous divisions. Consider a tensor with elements close to zero and others with large magnitudes.  The small elements, after division, might round down to zero, whereas large elements, while scaled down, might still retain some fractional part due to the limited precision.  This discrepancy results in a final sum deviating from unity.  Further, the order of operations, particularly in parallel computing environments, can subtly influence the accumulated rounding errors, leading to non-deterministic results.  Therefore, the observed deviation from unity is not a bug in the normalization procedure, but a direct consequence of the finite precision of floating-point representation.

Another contributing factor, less common but still relevant, is the presence of `NaN` (Not a Number) or `Inf` (Infinity) values within the tensor. If the initial sum calculation encounters such values, the result might be undefined, propagating errors throughout the normalization process.  Robust pre-processing to handle potential outliers and invalid data is crucial for reliable normalization.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Python with NumPy**

```python
import numpy as np

tensor = np.array([1e10, 1e-10, 2, 3])
tensor_sum = np.sum(tensor)
normalized_tensor = tensor / tensor_sum
print(f"Sum of normalized tensor: {np.sum(normalized_tensor)}")
```

This example demonstrates the issue clearly.  The large disparity between elements (`1e10` and `1e-10`) exacerbates the rounding errors. The `numpy` library, while optimized, does not eliminate the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic. The output will show a sum very close to 1, but almost certainly not exactly 1.


**Example 2: Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# or
import torch

tensor = tf.constant([1e10, 1e-10, 2, 3], dtype=tf.float64)
# or
tensor = torch.tensor([1e10, 1e-10, 2, 3], dtype=torch.float64)

tensor_sum = tf.reduce_sum(tensor)
# or
tensor_sum = torch.sum(tensor)

normalized_tensor = tensor / tensor_sum
print(f"Sum of normalized tensor: {tf.reduce_sum(normalized_tensor).numpy()}")
# or
print(f"Sum of normalized tensor: {torch.sum(normalized_tensor).item()}")

```

This code showcases the problem using TensorFlow or PyTorch, popular deep learning frameworks.  Using `float64` (double precision) instead of `float32` (single precision) might improve accuracy but will not eliminate the error entirely. The use of higher precision, however, increases computational cost.  Observe that the output, despite being closer to 1 than in the previous example due to the higher precision, will likely still not be exactly 1.


**Example 3:  Handling Potential `NaN` or `Inf` Values**

```python
import numpy as np

tensor = np.array([1e10, np.nan, 2, 3])

#Pre-processing step to handle NaN values
mask = np.isnan(tensor)
tensor[mask] = 0

tensor_sum = np.sum(tensor)

if tensor_sum == 0:
  print("Sum is zero; cannot normalize.")
else:
  normalized_tensor = tensor / tensor_sum
  print(f"Sum of normalized tensor: {np.sum(normalized_tensor)}")
```

This example incorporates error handling. It first identifies and replaces `NaN` values (a common cause of unexpected behavior in numerical computations) with 0.  Then, it checks if the sum is zero to prevent division by zero. This step is crucial for robustness.  While this mitigates one source of potential errors, it does not eliminate the underlying floating-point arithmetic limitations affecting the final sum.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic:**  A detailed technical standard describing floating-point number representation and arithmetic.  Understanding this standard is critical for grasping the fundamental limitations of floating-point computation.
* **Numerical Analysis Textbooks:** These provide in-depth coverage of numerical methods, error analysis, and techniques for mitigating numerical instability.
* **Advanced Linear Algebra Textbooks:** Focus on the intricacies of matrix and tensor operations, including considerations related to numerical stability.



In conclusion, while the intuitive approach of dividing each element of a tensor by its sum aims for normalization to a unit sum, the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic prevent achieving this exactly.  Implementing robust error handling, using higher-precision floating-point types when feasible, and understanding the principles of numerical analysis are essential for dealing with this limitation effectively in practical applications.  The examples provided illustrate this behavior and suggest strategies for mitigating its effects, highlighting the importance of considering numerical stability throughout the development process.
