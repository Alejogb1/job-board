In reinforcement learning, specifically with Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and their variants like Parameterized DQNs (PDQNs) and Multi-Policy DQNs (MPDQNs), directly inverting gradients during backpropagation is not a typical objective or methodology for training the network. However, the phrase "inverting gradients" likely refers to techniques used to explore the policy space more effectively, counter gradient vanishing or explosion, or modify learning dynamics. For the context of PDQN and MPDQN in TensorFlow 2.7, which I have implemented and debugged extensively in the past, I will interpret "inverting gradients" as a means to achieve these, which can involve strategies such as gradient clipping, reversing gradient sign in specific scenarios, or using an alternative update rule that indirectly achieves the effect of what might be considered an 'inverted' learning direction within certain boundaries.

Let's consider a common situation: a PDQN or MPDQN agent learning in an environment where the reward signal is sparse. We can interpret "inverting gradients" as a strategy to encourage exploration by, for example, penalizing certain actions that have led to negative outcomes more strongly than the default gradient-based update.

**Core Explanation**

With PDQN, the network learns parameterized action policies conditioned on the state, effectively outputting action parameters that are then used to construct actions via a known action function (e.g., parameters for a Gaussian distribution). MPDQN extends this by learning *multiple* policy parameters, each potentially optimal for different sub-regions of the state space or different reward criteria. The updates to these parameterizations rely on gradients derived from the temporal difference error—how much the current Q-value deviates from the target Q-value.

Typically, the gradient is calculated with respect to the network's weights and biases, guiding the parameters to minimize the loss function and align the Q-values with observed returns. “Inverting gradients,” in the sense we're exploring, would therefore involve altering this standard update, specifically related to the policy parameters, not simply changing the sign of the whole gradient tensor. It's not about a global 'reverse' update but more about strategic adjustment, such as the sign.

One method to achieve an "inverted" gradient effect (in the context of incentivizing under-explored regions) is by implementing a form of *gradient reversal* based on the sign of TD errors, specifically for policy parameter updates, this can be combined with a magnitude control mechanism. For instance, if a specific parameterized action consistently yields a negative TD error, instead of updating the policy to make it *less* likely (the natural effect of minimizing loss), we might briefly reverse the policy gradient for that specific action parameter, making it *more* likely, encouraging exploration in a previously deemed negative direction.

Another approach that achieves a similar effect can be achieved through clipping. Specifically for MPDQN where multiple parameterizations are being evaluated at once, we might want to reduce the influence of parameter sets that are showing very negative TD errors. This also has a form of 'gradient reversal' albeit indirectly by limiting the degree of update for these parameters.

**Code Example 1: Sign-based Gradient Reversal for Policy Parameters**

The below TensorFlow code illustrates a custom loss function that incorporates a sign-based gradient reversal technique for the policy parameters of a PDQN:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomPDQNLoss(tf.keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, gradient_reversal_factor=0.1, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.gradient_reversal_factor = gradient_reversal_factor

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        q_values, policy_params = y_pred # unpack network output into Q-values and policy parameters
        td_error = y_true - q_values # td_error
        
        # compute regular q-value loss 
        q_loss = tf.keras.losses.Huber()(y_true, q_values)

        # Gradient reversal for policy parameters
        policy_gradients = tf.gradients(q_loss, policy_params)[0] #get gradient w.r.t policy parameter.
        
        # use the gradient sign of the TD error to determine whether or not to reverse the gradient
        policy_gradients_reversed = tf.where(tf.sign(td_error) < 0, - policy_gradients * self.gradient_reversal_factor , policy_gradients)

        # The modified gradient will be applied at the optimizer level
        policy_params.assign_sub(policy_gradients_reversed)
        
        return q_loss

# Example Usage
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
pdqn_model = ... # Assume an already instantiated PDQN model
loss_func = CustomPDQNLoss()
@tf.function
def train_step(states, actions, rewards, next_states, done):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        q_values_pred , policy_params_pred  = pdqn_model(states)
        
        # Simplified target Q-value calculation 
        next_q_values,_ = pdqn_model(next_states)
        target_q_values = rewards + (1-done)*0.99*tf.reduce_max(next_q_values,axis=1)
            
        loss = loss_func(tf.stop_gradient(target_q_values), (q_values_pred, policy_params_pred))

  trainable_vars = pdqn_model.trainable_variables
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_vars)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, trainable_vars))


```
This code defines a custom loss function. If the TD error is negative, it flips the sign of the gradient of the policy parameters and multiplies by a `gradient_reversal_factor`. This encourages actions that, according to the standard learning direction, lead to low reward. This is an important caveat, this implementation in particular assumes the actions in the batch have a 1-1 relationship to the policy parameters (which is usually not the case), and it is also crucial that the policy parameters are available directly from the model, and not hidden in some intermediate layer. It shows the concept and will require adaption based on specific model structure.

**Code Example 2: Selective Clipping for Multi-Policy Parameters in MPDQN**
This example demonstrates a modified update for the policy parameters in MPDQN. Policy parameters with high negative TD error will experience a reduced update magnitude.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomMPDQNLoss(tf.keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, clip_threshold=-1, **kwargs):
      super().__init__(**kwargs)
      self.clip_threshold = clip_threshold

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        q_values, policy_params = y_pred # unpack network output into Q-values and policy parameters
        td_error = y_true - q_values # td_error

        q_loss = tf.keras.losses.Huber()(y_true, q_values)

        # Gradient manipulation for each set of policy parameters
        policy_gradients = tf.gradients(q_loss, policy_params)[0]
        
        # apply selective clipping based on TD error magnitude.
        
        clipped_grads = tf.where(tf.greater(td_error, self.clip_threshold),policy_gradients, tf.zeros_like(policy_gradients))
        
        policy_params.assign_sub(clipped_grads)
        
        return q_loss

# Example Usage
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
mpdqn_model = ... # Assume an already instantiated MPDQN model with multiple policy output heads
loss_func = CustomMPDQNLoss(clip_threshold=-1)
@tf.function
def train_step(states, actions, rewards, next_states, done):
   with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        q_values_pred, policy_params_pred  = mpdqn_model(states)
        
        next_q_values,_ = mpdqn_model(next_states)
        target_q_values = rewards + (1-done)*0.99*tf.reduce_max(next_q_values,axis=1)

        loss = loss_func(tf.stop_gradient(target_q_values), (q_values_pred, policy_params_pred))

   trainable_vars = mpdqn_model.trainable_variables
   gradients = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_vars)
   optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, trainable_vars))

```
This code selectively clips the gradient updates for policy parameters based on the TD error magnitude. If the TD error is above a certain threshold, we allow the gradients to follow their natural descent, but if the TD error is negative (and below the threshold) the gradients are nulled out for that particular set of parameters. This indirect control helps to reduce the effect of poorly-performing parameters and therefore helps exploration by encouraging better performing policy parameters.

**Code Example 3: Alternative Update Rule based on a "Pseudo-Inverse"**
This is a more complex approach that explores a pseudo-inverse concept, not directly inverting the gradient. In a realistic setting, calculating a true inverse for a large policy parameter tensor is computationally very challenging, but a simplified surrogate can be used. This version implements a "modified gradient descent" where it uses a simple modified version of policy parameter to apply the gradient, rather than relying solely on the derivative of the model itself.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomPDQNLossAlt(tf.keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, pseudo_inverse_factor=0.1, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.pseudo_inverse_factor = pseudo_inverse_factor

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        q_values, policy_params = y_pred # unpack network output into Q-values and policy parameters
        td_error = y_true - q_values # td_error
        q_loss = tf.keras.losses.Huber()(y_true, q_values)
        policy_gradients = tf.gradients(q_loss, policy_params)[0]

        # Create a surrogate of the policy parameter
        modified_policy_params = policy_params * (1 + (self.pseudo_inverse_factor*tf.sign(td_error)))

        # Apply gradients using the modified parameters instead of direct gradient
        policy_params.assign_sub(modified_policy_params * policy_gradients)

        return q_loss

# Example Usage
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
pdqn_model = ... # Assume an already instantiated PDQN model
loss_func = CustomPDQNLossAlt()
@tf.function
def train_step(states, actions, rewards, next_states, done):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        q_values_pred , policy_params_pred  = pdqn_model(states)
        
        next_q_values,_ = pdqn_model(next_states)
        target_q_values = rewards + (1-done)*0.99*tf.reduce_max(next_q_values,axis=1)
            
        loss = loss_func(tf.stop_gradient(target_q_values), (q_values_pred, policy_params_pred))

  trainable_vars = pdqn_model.trainable_variables
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_vars)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, trainable_vars))
```
This example modifies the direct gradient update by incorporating a pseudo-inverse factor to influence the update magnitude and indirectly affect direction, based on the sign of the TD-error. This approach requires further experimentation to optimize the factor.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of PDQN and MPDQN architectures, I recommend researching academic papers that introduce these algorithms, usually found on repositories such as ArXiv or within journal publications focused on machine learning or reinforcement learning. Standard TensorFlow tutorials for DQN implementation can offer a baseline for implementing basic gradient calculations and update steps, which can then be modified to create customized updates. Further exploration into papers relating to exploration strategies in sparse reward environments should provide useful context. It's also essential to understand the concept of Temporal Difference (TD) learning, since the TD error plays a central role in all the examples provided.
Finally, remember to extensively test any such modifications by running controlled experiments to understand whether the technique indeed leads to better policy.
