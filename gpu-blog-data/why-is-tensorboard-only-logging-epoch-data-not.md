Often, when encountering a scenario where TensorBoard primarily logs epoch-level data and not detailed per-batch training and validation metrics, the issue stems from how training and validation loops are instrumented with TensorFlow's summary writers and, crucially, the frequency at which summaries are flushed to disk. I've personally encountered this several times while developing bespoke model training pipelines; it's a classic oversight that can obscure detailed model behavior.

The root cause lies in the inherent nature of `tf.summary.FileWriter` or its equivalent context manager-based summary writing APIs. Summary data—including metrics like loss and accuracy—is initially buffered in memory. While we dutifully record these metrics within each training step (or batch), unless explicitly forced, this buffer won't flush its content to the log directory on disk until the next epoch boundary or when explicitly closed. This is a design choice in TensorFlow aimed at optimizing I/O operations. The frequent, potentially small, write operations associated with per-batch logging can become a performance bottleneck, particularly during high-throughput training scenarios.

When TensorBoard scans the log directory, it only visualizes data that has already been written to disk. Consequently, if we're recording per-batch data but only flushing during epoch end, the logs only reflect the aggregated, or typically, the average metrics of the full epoch. Therefore, TensorBoard essentially interprets this as a single data point per epoch, thereby losing the granularity of per-batch updates. It appears as if we are merely logging epoch data when in reality, the per-batch information is being buffered but never flushed to disk at the right frequency for TensorBoard's visibility.

To demonstrate this, consider a basic training loop constructed using TensorFlow's eager execution mode. Initially, a naive implementation might look something like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple model (replace with your actual model)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
])

# Dummy data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10).astype(np.float32)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100).astype(np.int32)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((X, y)).batch(32)

# Optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)

# Metrics
train_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='train_accuracy')
val_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='val_accuracy')

# Summary writer
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/basic_example')

epochs = 2

for epoch in range(epochs):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}")
    with summary_writer.as_default():
      for batch, (x_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(dataset):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            y_pred = model(x_batch)
            loss = loss_fn(y_batch, y_pred)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

        train_accuracy.update_state(y_batch, y_pred)
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=batch)
        tf.summary.scalar('accuracy', train_accuracy.result(), step=batch)

    # Reset after each epoch (only logs epoch average)
    tf.summary.scalar('epoch_accuracy', train_accuracy.result(), step=epoch)
    train_accuracy.reset_states()

    print(f"  Training Accuracy: {train_accuracy.result()}")
```

In this first example, we record loss and accuracy for *each batch*, however, since we are only flushing the summary at the end of each epoch through `summary_writer.flush()` (which is implicitly done when using the context manager `with summary_writer.as_default()`),  only the *aggregated* result or the last computed value within an epoch is made available for TensorBoard. We can also note that the `epoch_accuracy` is logged separately at epoch-level granularity. TensorBoard would essentially display the average loss and final accuracy value for each epoch, obscuring the progress and fluctuations seen within the epoch itself.

To rectify this and record the per-batch progress, one approach involves manually flushing the summary writer after each batch. While this is effective, it can be less efficient due to frequent disk writes. Here's a modified version showcasing how to force a flush operation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Model definition (same as before)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
])

# Dummy data (same as before)
X = np.random.rand(100, 10).astype(np.float32)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100).astype(np.int32)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((X, y)).batch(32)

# Optimizer, loss, metrics (same as before)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
train_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='train_accuracy')
val_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='val_accuracy')

# Summary writer
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/flush_example')

epochs = 2

for epoch in range(epochs):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}")
    for batch, (x_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(dataset):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            y_pred = model(x_batch)
            loss = loss_fn(y_batch, y_pred)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

        train_accuracy.update_state(y_batch, y_pred)
        with summary_writer.as_default():
          tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=batch)
          tf.summary.scalar('accuracy', train_accuracy.result(), step=batch)
        summary_writer.flush() #Manually flush after each batch

    # Reset after each epoch (only logs epoch average)
    with summary_writer.as_default():
      tf.summary.scalar('epoch_accuracy', train_accuracy.result(), step=epoch)
    train_accuracy.reset_states()
    print(f"  Training Accuracy: {train_accuracy.result()}")

```

By including `summary_writer.flush()` after each batch, we force the buffered metrics to be written to disk, allowing TensorBoard to display per-batch data correctly. This ensures we can monitor detailed training progress within an epoch. However, as stated, this might not be the most efficient method.

A more practical approach involves utilizing a configurable frequency for flushing the buffer. For example, we could flush after a certain number of batches (e.g., every 10 or 100 batches), a method that balances granularity and I/O overhead. This can be implemented using a simple counter, as shown in the following example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Model definition (same as before)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
])

# Dummy data (same as before)
X = np.random.rand(100, 10).astype(np.float32)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100).astype(np.int32)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((X, y)).batch(32)

# Optimizer, loss, metrics (same as before)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
train_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='train_accuracy')
val_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='val_accuracy')

# Summary writer
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/frequency_example')

epochs = 2
log_frequency = 10  # Flush every 10 batches
batch_count = 0

for epoch in range(epochs):
  print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}")
  for batch, (x_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(dataset):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            y_pred = model(x_batch)
            loss = loss_fn(y_batch, y_pred)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

        train_accuracy.update_state(y_batch, y_pred)

        batch_count +=1
        if batch_count % log_frequency == 0:
           with summary_writer.as_default():
            tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=batch)
            tf.summary.scalar('accuracy', train_accuracy.result(), step=batch)
           summary_writer.flush() # Flush every log_frequency

  with summary_writer.as_default():
      tf.summary.scalar('epoch_accuracy', train_accuracy.result(), step=epoch)
  train_accuracy.reset_states()
  print(f"  Training Accuracy: {train_accuracy.result()}")
```

In this refined example, the summaries are flushed only every `log_frequency` batches, thus, providing a good balance between detailed monitoring via TensorBoard and minimizing performance costs related to I/O.

To further enhance and diagnose these situations, I recommend reviewing TensorFlow’s official documentation on the `tf.summary` module and `tf.summary.FileWriter`. Specifically, pay close attention to the section outlining the flush mechanism. Furthermore, consider exploring tutorials on custom training loops provided by TensorFlow, which demonstrate proper usage of these components. Reading through discussions on GitHub related to similar issues in TensorFlow or TensorBoard can also be invaluable. Lastly, understanding the underlying mechanics of file I/O operations and the role of buffering in data processing can further illuminate the challenges and solutions.
