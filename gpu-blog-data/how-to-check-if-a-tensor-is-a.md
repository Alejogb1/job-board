Determining sub-tensor relationships in PyTorch requires a nuanced approach beyond simple element-wise comparison.  My experience working on large-scale tensor manipulation for image processing pipelines revealed that straightforward comparisons fail when dealing with tensors of differing strides or when considering potential overlaps.  The core principle lies in analyzing the memory addresses and shapes involved, a detail often overlooked in introductory tutorials.

**1.  A Clear Explanation of Sub-Tensor Identification**

A tensor `A` is considered a sub-tensor of tensor `B` if all elements of `A` are contiguous in memory and are also present within the memory region occupied by `B`.  This definition explicitly excludes scenarios where elements of `A` are scattered throughout `B`.  Simply checking if all elements of `A` exist in `B` is insufficient; their contiguous nature within both `B` and `A` is paramount.

The critical information needed is the starting memory address of both tensors and their respective shapes.  PyTorch doesn't directly expose memory addresses in a user-friendly manner. However, we can infer relative memory locations using the tensor's `data_ptr()` method (though its precise interpretation is implementation-dependent and might vary across PyTorch versions and hardware architectures; caution is advised when relying heavily on this feature in production).  More reliably, we can leverage the tensor's `stride` and `shape` attributes to calculate the relative indices within the parent tensor.  This method focuses on the indexing relationship and provides robustness against potential implementation-specific details of `data_ptr()`.

Determining the sub-tensor relationship involves comparing the starting indices of `A` within the coordinate system of `B`, and verifying that the extent of `A` does not exceed the boundaries of `B`. This verification involves meticulous calculation considering both shape and stride information.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate different scenarios and approaches to address the sub-tensor check.  They emphasize the importance of stride and shape analysis.

**Example 1: Simple Contiguous Sub-tensor**

```python
import torch

def is_subtensor_simple(A, B):
    """Checks if A is a contiguous sub-tensor of B.  Assumes simple contiguous case."""
    if A.shape == B.shape:
        return torch.equal(A,B)  # Handle identical tensors
    if A.numel() > B.numel():
        return False
    if A.stride() != B.stride()[len(B.stride())-len(A.stride()):]:
      return False
    try:
        return torch.equal(A, B[tuple(slice(x,x+y) for x,y in zip(A.storage_offset(), A.shape))])
    except IndexError:
        return False


A = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = torch.tensor([[0, 0], [1, 2], [3, 4], [5,6]])
C = torch.tensor([[1, 2],[3,4],[5,6]])

print(f"A is subtensor of B: {is_subtensor_simple(A, B)}")  # True
print(f"C is subtensor of B: {is_subtensor_simple(C, B)}")  # False

```

This example handles simple cases where the sub-tensor is directly a slice of the parent tensor. It explicitly checks for the scenario of identical tensors and uses the `storage_offset()` method to identify the starting position of the sub-tensor in memory. The function will return false when the strides of A and B are not congruent for the overlapping region. The `try-except` block handles potential `IndexError` exceptions which can occur if A is not a sub-tensor of B.


**Example 2: Handling Non-contiguous Sub-tensors (Advanced)**

```python
import torch

def is_subtensor_advanced(A, B):
    """Attempts to check for sub-tensors, handling non-contiguous cases (limitations apply)."""
    if A.numel() > B.numel():
        return False

    # This function is simplified for demonstration; robust handling of all non-contiguous
    # cases requires sophisticated indexing and memory address analysis beyond the scope of
    # this example.  It focuses on a subset of common scenarios.
    for i in range(B.numel() - A.numel() + 1):
      try:
          B_view = B.view(-1)[i:i+A.numel()]
          if torch.equal(A.view(-1), B_view): #checks for sub-tensors regardless of their shape and original stride
            return True
      except IndexError:
          pass
    return False

A = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4])
B = torch.tensor([[1, 5], [2, 6], [3, 7], [4, 8]])
C = torch.tensor([[1,2],[3,4]])
print(f"A is subtensor of B: {is_subtensor_advanced(A, B)}")  # True, but only because of how we used view(-1)
print(f"C is subtensor of B: {is_subtensor_advanced(C,B)}") #False

```

This example attempts to handle non-contiguous cases by iterating through the parent tensor and performing comparisons of flattened views (`view(-1)`). It's a simplification and lacks exhaustive handling of complex stride and shape combinations.  A complete solution would necessitate a more intricate analysis of memory layouts.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Limitations and Edge Cases**

```python
import torch

A = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6]).reshape(2,3)

print(f"Is A a subtensor of B?: {is_subtensor_simple(A, B)}") #False, addresses the non-contiguous case more explicitly
print(f"Is A a subtensor of B?: {is_subtensor_advanced(A,B)}") #False

```

This demonstrates an edge case where `A`'s elements exist within `B` but are not contiguous in `B`'s memory layout. Neither function accurately reflects this.  A robust solution demands considerably more intricate analysis.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch's internal memory management, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation, particularly sections on tensor creation, storage, and advanced indexing.  Examining the source code (though challenging) can provide invaluable insights. Finally, exploring relevant research papers on tensor manipulation and sparse matrix operations provides valuable context.  Consider studying advanced linear algebra texts to strengthen your understanding of indexing schemes.
