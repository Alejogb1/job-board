Early GPU integration with CPUs was largely characterized by a lack of direct, high-bandwidth interconnects, relying instead on slower, more generalized system buses.  My experience working on the  'Titanfall' project at a major semiconductor firm in the late 1990s highlighted this architectural limitation.  We were pushing the boundaries of real-time 3D rendering, and the bottleneck wasn't the GPU's raw processing power, but rather the agonizingly slow transfer of data between the CPU and the specialized graphics processing unit.

This stemmed from the fundamental architectural differences. CPUs, designed for general-purpose computation, prioritize instruction-level parallelism and complex branching logic. GPUs, conversely, excelled at massively parallel processing of relatively simple instructions, ideally suited for the repetitive calculations involved in rendering graphics.  Early integration strategies therefore prioritized compatibility over speed, utilizing existing system bus architectures like PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) or AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port).

1. **PCI-based Integration:** This was the dominant approach in the early days.  GPUs were treated as peripheral devices, communicating with the CPU over the system bus. Data transfer was handled through memory-mapped I/O, where specific memory addresses were assigned to GPU registers and memory. This method inherently suffered from low bandwidth, limited by the shared system bus also used by other peripherals like hard drives and network cards.  The bus's relatively slow speed and contention from other devices resulted in significant performance limitations, especially when dealing with the large textures and geometry data characteristic of 3D rendering.


```c++
//Illustrative example of PCI-based communication (simplified)
//Assumes memory-mapped I/O and driver-level handling of PCI transactions

// CPU side (simplified)
unsigned int* gpu_memory = (unsigned int*)0x80000000; // Example memory address
*gpu_memory = 0x12345678; // Send data to GPU

// GPU side (simplified, conceptually illustrative)
unsigned int received_data = *gpu_memory; // Receive data from CPU
//Process data...
```

This example dramatically simplifies the reality of PCI communication, omitting crucial details such as driver interactions, bus arbitration, and error handling.  However, it illustrates the fundamental principle of using shared memory space for inter-device communication. The slow transfer speeds often necessitated extensive data compression and clever algorithmic optimizations on both the CPU and GPU side to mitigate the bottleneck.


2. **AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port):** Recognizing the limitations of PCI, AGP was introduced as a dedicated bus for graphics cards.  It offered significant improvements in bandwidth compared to PCI, utilizing a point-to-point connection between the CPU and GPU.  This reduced bus contention and improved data transfer speeds.  However, AGP still relied on memory-mapped I/O, and bandwidth, while better than PCI, was still a limiting factor for demanding applications.


```c
//Illustrative example of AGP-based communication (simplified)
//Still uses memory-mapped I/O, but with improved bus bandwidth

//CPU side (simplified)
//Direct memory access (DMA) operations were more common with AGP
//than with PCI, but still conceptually similar to memory-mapped I/O.
void* agp_memory = agp_get_memory(0x1000); //Simplified function to allocate AGP memory
memcpy(agp_memory, cpu_data, data_size); //Copy data to AGP memory.

//GPU side (simplified)
//Access and process data from agp_memory
// Processing...
```

Again, this is a highly simplified representation.  Real-world AGP communication involved intricate driver interaction to manage memory allocation, data transfer, and synchronization between the CPU and GPU. This improved over PCI in terms of bandwidth, but shared memory still formed the basis for communication.


3. **Early attempts at dedicated memory controllers:**  While not direct CPU-GPU integration in the same sense as later architectures, some high-end systems experimented with dedicated memory controllers on the GPU itself. This allowed the GPU access to its own dedicated RAM, reducing reliance on the system RAM and the system bus for data transfer.  This provided a degree of improved performance, but the method of transferring data to and from the dedicated GPU memory was still limited. This was often handled using  DMA (Direct Memory Access) through the system bus to reduce CPU involvement, but still suffered the bandwidth limitations inherent in the bus architecture.


```assembly
;Illustrative example - Assembly code for a DMA transfer (highly simplified)

; CPU side (conceptual)
mov eax, [GPU_MEMORY_ADDRESS] ;GPU Memory Address
mov ebx, [CPU_DATA_ADDRESS]  ;CPU Data Address
mov ecx, [DATA_SIZE]        ;Data size
mov edx, 1                  ;DMA channel 1 (example)
int 0x80                    ;Software interrupt to initiate DMA transfer

; GPU side (conceptual) - DMA controller handles the transfer
; The GPU would then access data from its dedicated memory
```

This assembly example presents a conceptual overview of a DMA transfer. In reality, handling a DMA transfer requires careful consideration of memory mapping, interrupt handling, and synchronization between CPU and DMA controller. The underlying limitations of the bus connecting the CPU to the DMA controller remain even with this enhanced approach.


In summary, early GPU-CPU integration strategies were largely constrained by the available interconnect technologies.  PCI provided a universally compatible but slow solution, while AGP offered a significant improvement, but still faced bandwidth constraints.  Rudimentary forms of dedicated GPU memory improved matters, but relied on DMA and still faced the same fundamental challenges with bus technology.  Only with the advent of more sophisticated interconnects, such as PCI Express and later technologies, did direct, high-bandwidth communication between CPUs and GPUs become a reality, allowing for the powerful integrated graphics solutions commonplace today.  Furthermore, understanding the limitations of shared memory and the architectural differences between CPUs and GPUs was, and continues to be, vital for efficient system design and programming.
