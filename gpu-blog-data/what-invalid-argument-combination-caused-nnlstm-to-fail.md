The most common cause of `nn.LSTM()` failure stems from a mismatch between the input tensor's dimensions and the expected input shape dictated by the LSTM's `input_size`, `hidden_size`, and batch size.  This often manifests as a `RuntimeError` concerning tensor dimensions during the forward pass.  In my experience troubleshooting recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTMs,  this dimensional incompatibility consistently surfaced as the primary culprit, outweighing issues with gradients or weight initialization.  Let's examine the correct input format and illustrate potential failure points through examples.

**1. Understanding the `nn.LSTM()` Input Shape**

The `torch.nn.LSTM()` layer expects a tensor of shape `(seq_len, batch_size, input_size)`. Let's break this down:

* `seq_len`:  Represents the length of the input sequence. For a sequence of 10 words, `seq_len` would be 10.
* `batch_size`:  The number of independent sequences processed in parallel. A batch size of 32 means the LSTM processes 32 sequences simultaneously.
* `input_size`: The dimensionality of the input features at each time step.  If each word is represented by a 50-dimensional embedding, `input_size` would be 50.

Furthermore, the `hidden_size` parameter determines the dimensionality of the hidden state and cell state vectors within the LSTM. This is a hyperparameter chosen during model design and doesn't directly relate to input shape mismatches, although its incompatibility with the `input_size` during model construction might cause less obvious errors. The initial hidden and cell states (`h0`, `c0`) are usually tensors of shape `(num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)`.  `num_layers` defines the number of LSTM layers stacked, and `num_directions` is 1 for a unidirectional LSTM and 2 for a bidirectional one.


**2. Code Examples and Failure Analysis**

Let's explore three scenarios demonstrating invalid argument combinations and how to correct them. I've personally encountered each of these during my work on sentiment analysis and time series prediction projects.


**Example 1: Incorrect `input_size`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Incorrect input_size
lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=50, hidden_size=100, num_layers=1, batch_first=False)
input_seq = torch.randn(10, 32, 25) # Input size mismatch: 25 instead of 50

output, (hn, cn) = lstm(input_seq)
```

This code will raise a `RuntimeError` because `input_seq` has an `input_size` of 25, while the LSTM expects 50.  The error message will explicitly mention a dimension mismatch.  The correction involves ensuring the input tensor's third dimension matches the `input_size` specified during LSTM instantiation.


**Example 2: Incorrect `batch_size`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=50, hidden_size=100, num_layers=1, batch_first=False)
input_seq = torch.randn(10, 16, 50) # Batch size mismatch: 16 instead of 32 if defined in hidden/cell states

h0 = torch.randn(1, 32, 100) # 32 is the correct batch size
c0 = torch.randn(1, 32, 100)
output, (hn, cn) = lstm(input_seq, (h0, c0))
```

This example highlights a potential mismatch between the implicit batch size in the input sequence and that explicitly stated in the initial hidden and cell states `h0` and `c0`. If `h0` and `c0` are defined correctly the error here is the sequence's `batch_size`.  In this case, the input sequence has a batch size of 16, while the initial hidden and cell states expect a batch size of 32.  The solution is to match the `batch_size` in the input tensor to the `batch_size` defined in `h0` and `c0` , or adjust `h0` and `c0`.  The  `batch_first=False` argument implies that the batch size is the second dimension. If `batch_first=True` were used, the batch size would be the first dimension.


**Example 3: Incorrect sequence length and forgetting to define initial states**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=50, hidden_size=100, num_layers=2, bidirectional=True, batch_first=True)
input_seq = torch.randn(32, 10, 50) # Correct input size and batch size

output, (hn, cn) = lstm(input_seq) # Missing initial states for multiple layers
```

This example demonstrates a common oversight: failing to provide initial hidden and cell states (`h0`, `c0`) when using multiple LSTM layers or bidirectional LSTMs.  While the input shape is correct, the LSTM's internal workings require properly initialized hidden states for each layer and direction.  When using multiple layers or bidirectional configurations,  `h0` and `c0` should have dimensions  `(num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)`.  The correction involves constructing these tensors appropriately. Note that in this example `batch_first=True` has been used, hence the batch size is the first dimension.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

To deepen your understanding of recurrent neural networks and LSTMs, I strongly recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation.  Furthermore, review relevant chapters from established deep learning textbooks focusing on sequence modeling and RNN architectures.  A thorough grasp of linear algebra and calculus is also beneficial for comprehending the underlying mathematical principles.  Working through practical tutorials and implementing LSTMs on various datasets will solidify your understanding and provide invaluable hands-on experience. Finally, actively engaging with online forums and communities dedicated to deep learning, specifically those that address PyTorch implementations, is exceptionally helpful for troubleshooting specific issues and learning from the experience of other developers.
