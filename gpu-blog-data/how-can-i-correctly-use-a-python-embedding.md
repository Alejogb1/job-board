The discrepancy between a Keras embedding layer's reported output shape and what `torchsummary` reveals for a similarly defined PyTorch embedding layer often arises from the distinct nature of how these libraries handle model shape inference. Keras implicitly considers the batch dimension during layer construction, whereas PyTorch, by design, operates on tensors with explicitly provided batch dimensions. When `torchsummary` analyzes a PyTorch model, it requires an explicit input tensor with a batch dimension to propagate through the layers and deduce output shapes. This crucial difference causes confusion when one expects the `torchsummary` output for a PyTorch embedding to mimic Keras' reporting.

To elucidate this, consider a basic sequence processing task. Imagine I am working on a sentiment analysis project. In Keras, one might define an embedding layer and pass input sequences directly. Keras automatically adds the batch size to the shape. In PyTorch, the embedding layer operates strictly on index tensors, and the batch dimension is not implied. Without explicit handling, `torchsummary` sees only the input dimension defined by the embedding vocabulary and cannot deduce the output shape for a batched input. The result is often a misleading shape output from `torchsummary`, typically only showing the embedding dimensionality and not the sequence length.

I frequently encounter this situation and have developed a reliable method to accurately display a PyTorch embedding's output shape using `torchsummary`. The key is to provide a sample input with a batch dimension to `torchsummary`. This input must adhere to the expected tensor structure that would be passed to the embedding layer during training. It's not about altering the layer itself but providing the correct context for `torchsummary`'s analysis. This approach forces the framework to understand how input tensors with a batch size interact with the layer during forward propagation.

Here are three examples illustrating common scenarios, along with how to properly use `torchsummary` to gain insights:

**Example 1: Basic Embedding Layer for a Fixed Sequence Length**

In this example, we have a sequence of fixed length, like each sentence from a dataset with maximum words.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchsummary import summary

class EmbeddingModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
        super(EmbeddingModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.embedding(x)

# Define parameters
vocab_size = 1000
embedding_dim = 128
sequence_length = 20
batch_size = 32

# Instantiate model
model = EmbeddingModel(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

# Create dummy input tensor with batch dimension
input_tensor = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (batch_size, sequence_length))

# Use torchsummary with the dummy tensor
summary(model, input_size=input_tensor.shape)
```

*Commentary:* Here we construct a `nn.Embedding` layer. A crucial step is to construct `input_tensor`. `torch.randint` simulates integer sequence inputs for a batch of 32 sequences each with a length of 20. By passing this `input_tensor.shape` as input, `torchsummary` now accurately shows the output shape as `[32, 20, 128]`, representing the batch size, sequence length, and embedding dimensionality respectively. Without this, `torchsummary` would misleadingly report something akin to `[20, 128]`, neglecting batch dimension.

**Example 2: Embedding Layer with Variable Sequence Lengths using Padding**

In a more realistic scenario, input sequences have variable lengths. We will have zero-padded sequences.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchsummary import summary
import torch.nn.utils.rnn as rnn_utils

class EmbeddingModelWithPadding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
        super(EmbeddingModelWithPadding, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, padding_idx=0)


    def forward(self, x, lengths):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        return x

# Define parameters
vocab_size = 1000
embedding_dim = 128
max_sequence_length = 30
batch_size = 32

# Instantiate model
model = EmbeddingModelWithPadding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

# Create dummy input with padding, and lengths for each sequence
lengths = torch.randint(5,max_sequence_length,(batch_size,))
input_tensor = torch.zeros((batch_size, max_sequence_length),dtype=torch.long)

for batch_i, length in enumerate(lengths):
    input_tensor[batch_i,:length] = torch.randint(1, vocab_size, (length,),dtype=torch.long)


# Use torchsummary with the dummy tensor
summary(model, input_size=[input_tensor.shape, lengths.shape])
```
*Commentary:* Here we define `padding_idx=0` in the embedding layer. The input now utilizes zero-padding. `torch.randint` generates an array of sequence lengths. We build a zeroed tensor `input_tensor`. Then for each sequence, we fill in randomly generated integers, making sure to respect the specified sequence lengths. This mimics the variability of real input sequence lengths. By passing both input and sequence lengths, `torchsummary` still captures the embedding output correctly, and understands that padding occurs. The reported output shape is `[32, 30, 128]`.

**Example 3: Embedding Layer within a More Complex Model**

Often the embedding layer will not be the entire model, but instead a component of a model.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchsummary import summary

class ComplexModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size):
        super(ComplexModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 2)


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        _,(h_n,c_n) = self.lstm(x)
        x = h_n[-1,:,:]
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Define parameters
vocab_size = 1000
embedding_dim = 128
sequence_length = 20
hidden_size = 64
batch_size = 32

# Instantiate model
model = ComplexModel(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size)

# Create dummy input tensor with batch dimension
input_tensor = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (batch_size, sequence_length))

# Use torchsummary with the dummy tensor
summary(model, input_size=input_tensor.shape)
```

*Commentary:* This example places the embedding layer inside an LSTM model, followed by a linear layer. `torchsummary` now gives a complete view of the architecture, showing how the embedding output flows into subsequent layers. It illustrates that the embedding layer still outputs `[32, 20, 128]`, as before, demonstrating that the practice is consistent in more involved models. The output shape of the entire model is `[32, 2]` as expected from the linear layer.

In summary, to correctly use a PyTorch embedding layer with `torchsummary`, providing a dummy input with the proper batch dimension is crucial. Ignoring this often results in inaccurate shape representation of the embedding output from `torchsummary`, especially when dealing with sequential data. This approach isn't specific to the `nn.Embedding` layer. The same technique should be used when analyzing any custom PyTorch model with `torchsummary`.

For further learning on the interaction of PyTorch layers with input tensors, I recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on tensor operations, `nn.Embedding`, and batch handling. In addition, it is also beneficial to examine practical examples of sequence modelling using PyTorch, commonly found in tutorials on recurrent networks, for instance in published research articles or university lecture notes online. These resources help deepen the understanding of how PyTorch handles batched data, providing the theoretical underpinning for the problem outlined here.
