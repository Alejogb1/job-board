The core challenge in implementing logistic regression with {-1, 1} labels in TensorFlow 2 lies not in the framework itself, but in adapting the standard sigmoid activation function and loss function to accommodate this unconventional label encoding.  My experience working on large-scale sentiment analysis projects highlighted this precisely; initial attempts using unmodified binary classification approaches yielded suboptimal results and inconsistent predictions.  The sigmoid function's inherent range of (0, 1), coupled with the binary cross-entropy loss function expecting {0, 1} labels, necessitates a modification.

**1.  Explanation:**

Standard logistic regression utilizes a sigmoid activation function, Ïƒ(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z)), which outputs probabilities between 0 and 1.  The corresponding loss function, binary cross-entropy, measures the dissimilarity between these predicted probabilities and the observed {0, 1} labels.  When dealing with {-1, 1} labels, this approach needs adjustments.  Instead of directly predicting probabilities, we aim to predict the class label directly, using a modified activation function and loss function.  A suitable approach involves employing the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function as the activation function and a custom loss function adapted for {-1, 1} labels.

The tanh function, tanh(z) = (exp(z) - exp(-z)) / (exp(z) + exp(-z)), outputs values in the range (-1, 1), aligning naturally with our {-1, 1} labels.  We can then construct a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the predicted values from the tanh activation and the true labels.  While a straightforward mean squared error (MSE) could suffice, a more robust approach might involve a weighted MSE or a custom loss function tailored to minimize the misclassification rate.  Importantly, careful consideration of the gradient flow during optimization is crucial for efficient training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Implementation with Tanh and MSE**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='tanh', input_shape=(input_dim,))
])

# Compile the model with MSE loss
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Training data with {-1, 1} labels
X_train = ... # Your training data
y_train = ... # Your {-1, 1} labels

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward implementation using the tanh activation and MSE loss.  The simplicity is advantageous for understanding the core concept. However, MSE might not be optimal for classification tasks.  The choice of 'adam' optimizer is empirical, and alternatives like 'sgd' or 'RMSprop' could be explored depending on dataset characteristics.


**Example 2:  Custom Loss Function for Improved Accuracy**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - tf.tanh(y_pred))) # Weighted MSE variation possible here

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear', input_shape=(input_dim,))
])

# Compile the model with custom loss
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss)

# Training data
X_train = ...
y_train = ...

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example introduces a custom loss function. By applying the `tanh` within the loss function, we explicitly align the prediction space with the label space. The use of `tf.square` ensures a positive loss regardless of the sign of the difference.  A weighted MSE (e.g., penalizing false positives more than false negatives) could further refine performance based on specific application needs.  Note that the activation is 'linear' in the layer; the non-linearity is handled by the custom loss.

**Example 3:  Incorporating a Threshold for Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the model (similar to previous examples)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='tanh', input_shape=(input_dim,))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Prediction with thresholding
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
thresholded_predictions = np.sign(predictions) # Apply sign function for {-1, 1} classification
```

This example highlights the post-processing step needed to translate the continuous output of the tanh activation into discrete {-1, 1} classifications.  The `np.sign` function effectively maps positive outputs to 1 and negative outputs to -1.  The threshold of 0 is implicit here, but it could be adjusted depending on the desired balance between precision and recall.  Note that this classification happens *after* the model training and prediction.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of logistic regression, I suggest consulting standard machine learning textbooks.  Focus on the mathematical foundations of logistic regression, various loss functions, and optimization algorithms.  A good reference on TensorFlow 2's API and its capabilities in building and training custom models will prove invaluable.  Finally, exploring resources on different activation functions and their properties, especially in the context of classification problems, will broaden your knowledge base and allow you to make informed choices for future projects.  Understanding numerical stability and potential issues related to gradient vanishing or exploding during training is also essential.  Reviewing articles and papers on handling imbalanced datasets is beneficial, especially if your {-1, 1} labels are not evenly distributed.
