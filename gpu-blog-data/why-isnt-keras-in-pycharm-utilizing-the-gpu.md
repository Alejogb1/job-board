The root cause of Keras failing to leverage GPU acceleration within PyCharm often stems from an incomplete or misconfigured TensorFlow or CUDA installation, rather than an inherent limitation of Keras itself.  In my extensive experience debugging deep learning pipelines, I've encountered this issue repeatedly, primarily tracing it back to inconsistencies between the environment's CUDA toolkit, cuDNN library, and the TensorFlow installation's awareness of the available hardware.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, being a high-level API, relies on a backend engine like TensorFlow or Theano to perform the actual computations.  These backends, in turn, require appropriate drivers and libraries to interact with the GPU hardware.  Failure to properly install or configure these components results in Keras defaulting to CPU execution, regardless of the apparent presence of a compatible GPU. The process hinges on several interconnected elements:

* **CUDA Toolkit:** This provides the necessary drivers and libraries for GPU computing with NVIDIA hardware.  Its installation must match the architecture of the GPU and the operating system.  Discrepancies here are a common source of problems.  Incorrect versions (e.g., using a CUDA 11.x toolkit with a TensorFlow build designed for CUDA 10.x) lead to immediate incompatibility.

* **cuDNN:**  The CUDA Deep Neural Network library is a highly optimized set of routines for deep learning operations. It significantly accelerates the training and inference processes.  A missing or improperly installed cuDNN library prevents TensorFlow from using its GPU capabilities effectively, even if CUDA is installed.  Version compatibility between cuDNN, CUDA, and TensorFlow is paramount.

* **TensorFlow/PyTorch Installation:** The chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, in this case) must be compiled with GPU support during installation. If the installation process lacks appropriate flags or targets a CPU-only build, it will inherently ignore available GPUs.  This often manifests as TensorFlow simply not recognizing any GPUs at runtime.

* **Environment Variables:**  Correctly setting environment variables such as `CUDA_HOME` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or their Windows equivalents) is critical. These variables inform the system where to find the necessary CUDA and cuDNN libraries.  An incorrectly configured environment can prevent the backend from accessing the required components.

* **PyCharm Configuration:** While less likely to be the primary culprit, verifying that PyCharmâ€™s Python interpreter is correctly configured to use the environment containing the GPU-enabled TensorFlow installation is essential. Using the wrong interpreter can lead to a system attempting to execute Keras via a CPU-only environment.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples demonstrate different aspects of GPU verification and usage within a Keras/TensorFlow environment.


**Example 1: Checking GPU Availability:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
    print("GPUs are accessible within the TensorFlow environment.")
    try:
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')[0], True)
        print("Memory growth enabled for GPU.")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")  #Handle potential memory growth errors

else:
    print("No GPUs detected in the current environment.")
    print("Verify CUDA installation, cuDNN installation, and TensorFlow configuration.")

```

**Commentary:** This code snippet directly checks if TensorFlow can detect any available GPUs.  The output indicates the number of GPUs visible to the TensorFlow runtime and, importantly, helps distinguish between the absence of GPUs and a configuration problem preventing TensorFlow from detecting the available hardware.  The `set_memory_growth` call is a best practice for efficient GPU memory management.  Handling potential errors here is crucial for robust code.


**Example 2:  Simple Model Training with GPU Check:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

#Check for GPU availability - exit if none
if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) == 0:
    raise Exception("No GPUs found.  Please check your CUDA/cuDNN setup.")

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Dummy data for demonstration
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 784)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(1000, 10))

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)
```

**Commentary:** This illustrates a basic Keras model training.  Crucially, it includes an initial check for GPU availability before proceeding. This prevents unnecessary execution if no GPU is found, providing immediate feedback about the underlying hardware configuration. This error handling is essential; failure to detect a GPU before model creation could lead to silent failure and wasted computation time.


**Example 3:  Explicit Device Placement (Advanced):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Check GPU availability, exit if none available.
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if not gpus:
    raise Exception('No GPUs found!')

# Explicitly place the model on GPU 0 if available
try:
    tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')
    logical_gpu = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(f"Using GPU {logical_gpu[0].name}")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f'Error setting visible devices: {e}')

# Keras Model definition (omitted for brevity)

# Rest of model training (omitted for brevity)
```


**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates explicit device placement, useful in more complex scenarios involving multiple GPUs or CPU/GPU combined execution. It provides greater control over device assignment than relying on implicit TensorFlow behavior. The `set_visible_devices` function allows for restricting TensorFlow to a specific GPU, preventing resource contention in multi-GPU systems.  The error handling ensures that exceptions during device assignment are caught and reported.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, consult the official documentation for TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN.  Pay close attention to the installation instructions and compatibility matrices for each component.  Review troubleshooting guides provided by both NVIDIA and the TensorFlow team.  Familiarize yourself with the various environment variable settings that influence GPU usage.  Explore advanced topics such as TensorFlow's device placement APIs for more granular control over hardware resource allocation. Understanding the nuances of virtual environments within Python and how they interact with system-level configurations is also crucial.  Finally, leveraging debugging tools to analyze TensorFlow's runtime behavior can significantly assist in diagnosing GPU-related issues.
