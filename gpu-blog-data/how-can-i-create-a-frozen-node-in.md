Creating a "frozen" node within a TensorFlow graph during training, as I’ve observed in multiple model development cycles, isn't about literally freezing node weights mid-training like a block of ice. Rather, it refers to a situation where you want to effectively treat the output of a specific part of your graph as a constant, despite the ongoing training of other parts of the network. This is achievable through careful manipulation of TensorFlow operations, primarily by leveraging techniques that stop gradient backpropagation. It often arises when incorporating pre-trained models, fine-tuning specific layers, or using auxiliary loss mechanisms.

The core mechanism relies on TensorFlow's automatic differentiation. During training, TensorFlow calculates gradients of the loss with respect to all trainable variables. If we want to "freeze" a portion, we must prevent gradients from flowing into that part of the graph. This can be achieved through two main techniques: explicitly using `tf.stop_gradient()` or by creating variables with `trainable=False`. The latter is typically more applicable during model definition rather than mid-training changes.

`tf.stop_gradient()` provides a straightforward way to block gradient flow. When applied to a tensor, it effectively creates a node that passes the tensor’s value during the forward pass, but it signals to the automatic differentiation engine to treat this node as a constant. Therefore, no gradient will be computed and propagated backward through this node during backpropagation. This functionality is useful if, for example, you want to use the features from a pre-trained model as inputs to a new set of layers without altering the original model’s weights.

Consider a scenario where I’m working with a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image classification. I’ve taken the first few convolutional layers from a well-trained model (let's call it `pre_trained_layers`) and I want to use the feature maps these layers produce without updating their weights. Then I add custom, fully connected layers (`fc_layers`) that I want to train for a specific task. In this situation, my code might look like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(input_tensor):
    # Assume pre_trained_layers is loaded from a model or is defined elsewhere
    # Assume this outputs a tensor called feature_maps

    feature_maps = pre_trained_layers(input_tensor)
    
    #Apply stop gradient to the feature maps
    frozen_feature_maps = tf.stop_gradient(feature_maps)

    #Define fully connected layers for task-specific learning
    fc1 = tf.layers.dense(inputs=frozen_feature_maps, units=128, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    fc2 = tf.layers.dense(inputs=fc1, units=10, activation=None)  #Example output, could be softmax for classification

    return fc2

input_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 224, 224, 3)) #Example placeholder
model_output = build_model(input_placeholder)

loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy(labels=tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=(None,)), logits=model_output))

optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)
train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # Training loop would go here
```

In this example, `tf.stop_gradient(feature_maps)` ensures that the gradients calculated during backpropagation are not used to update weights within `pre_trained_layers`. Only the weights in `fc1` and `fc2` will be optimized during training.

Another related scenario where I've had to deal with freezing nodes arises when using auxiliary losses. Imagine I'm implementing a variational autoencoder (VAE), which involves both a reconstruction loss and a KL-divergence loss. The latent variables in a VAE typically don't require backpropagation through the decoder network when calculating the KL-divergence loss as they’re based on the encoder's output distribution parameters. The following snippet demonstrates how to isolate gradient computation when calculating a divergence term.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions

def encoder(input_tensor, latent_dim):
    h1 = tf.layers.dense(input_tensor, units=128, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    mean = tf.layers.dense(h1, units=latent_dim)
    log_var = tf.layers.dense(h1, units=latent_dim)
    return mean, log_var

def decoder(latent_tensor, output_dim):
    h1 = tf.layers.dense(latent_tensor, units=128, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    output = tf.layers.dense(h1, units=output_dim)
    return output

def build_vae(input_tensor, latent_dim, output_dim):
    mean, log_var = encoder(input_tensor, latent_dim)
    
    #Sample from the latent space
    distribution = tfd.Normal(loc=mean, scale=tf.exp(0.5 * log_var))
    z = distribution.sample()
        
    #Decoder
    reconstructed_x = decoder(z, output_dim)

    #KL divergence using distributions instead of just means and vars
    prior = tfd.Normal(loc=0., scale=1.)
    kl_divergence = tfd.kl_divergence(distribution, prior)
    kl_divergence = tf.reduce_mean(kl_divergence)

    return reconstructed_x, kl_divergence, mean, log_var


#Example
input_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 784)) #Example placeholder for flattened image
reconstructed_x, kl_divergence, mean, log_var = build_vae(input_placeholder, latent_dim=2, output_dim=784)

#Reconstruction loss
reconstruction_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.losses.sigmoid_cross_entropy(labels=input_placeholder, logits=reconstructed_x))

#Combined loss
total_loss = reconstruction_loss + kl_divergence

#Optimization
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)
train_op = optimizer.minimize(total_loss)
```

In the above VAE, the `kl_divergence` tensor, while it does depend on the encoder’s output (mean and log_var), doesn’t need backpropagation through the decoder; using those mean and logvar values to influence the encoder is sufficient. The kl divergence term itself doesn't have a gradient path all the way back through the decoder, which makes `tf.stop_gradient` unnecessary here. The automatic gradient calculations of Tensorflow respect the mathematical operations already without needing explicit use of `tf.stop_gradient`. If I were to include an additional loss related to the output of the decoder where gradients were required not to propagate back to the encoder, then I would use `tf.stop_gradient`.

A final example that might require `tf.stop_gradient` could arise when using reinforcement learning methods where you might want to use the output of the critic network as a target for the policy, but you do not want to backpropogate critic gradients through the policy.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def policy_network(state_tensor, action_dim):
    h1 = tf.layers.dense(state_tensor, units=128, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    action_probs = tf.layers.dense(h1, units=action_dim, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
    return action_probs

def critic_network(state_tensor):
    h1 = tf.layers.dense(state_tensor, units=128, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    value = tf.layers.dense(h1, units=1)
    return value

# Example usage
state_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 4)) #Example state
action_dim = 2

# Networks
action_probs = policy_network(state_placeholder, action_dim)
value = critic_network(state_placeholder)

# Policy objective (using value from the critic as a baseline, but stop gradient)
baseline = tf.stop_gradient(value)
advantage = -baseline 
selected_actions = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=(None,))
action_one_hot = tf.one_hot(selected_actions, action_dim)

log_probs = tf.log(tf.reduce_sum(action_probs * action_one_hot, axis=1))

policy_loss = -tf.reduce_mean(log_probs * advantage)

# Critic loss
target_values = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None,1))
critic_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(target_values-value))

# Optimization
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)
policy_train_op = optimizer.minimize(policy_loss)
critic_train_op = optimizer.minimize(critic_loss)
```

Here, I specifically use `tf.stop_gradient(value)` when calculating the policy loss. This ensures that the critic's value estimations guide the policy updates, but the gradient of the critic's loss does not propagate backward into the policy network.

In addition to `tf.stop_gradient()`, you can control gradient flow during variable creation. If a variable is initialized with `trainable=False`, it will not receive gradient updates. This method is typically used during the initial setup of a model or when dealing with pre-trained parameters that should remain unchanged. It's not dynamic like `tf.stop_gradient()` which can be applied mid-graph.

For further understanding, I’d recommend exploring resources covering topics such as "transfer learning," "fine-tuning," and "advanced gradient control in neural networks." Look into textbooks or online courses that focus on TensorFlow's computational graph and automatic differentiation engine. Specifically, materials on variational inference and reinforcement learning frequently demonstrate practical use cases for techniques like the ones discussed here. Understanding how TensorFlow handles backpropagation at a low level will greatly enhance your ability to effectively manipulate your models for specific research or development needs. Examining the official TensorFlow documentation for `tf.stop_gradient` as well as those for trainable variables is also critical to achieve success.
