The performance of Faster R-CNN with a ResNet101 V1 backbone on 800x1333 images without pre-trained weights is significantly hampered by the model's capacity and the lack of prior knowledge.  My experience in developing object detection systems for industrial automation, specifically within the context of high-resolution imagery analysis, has consistently demonstrated this.  The absence of pre-trained weights translates directly to a longer training time, increased susceptibility to overfitting, and substantially lower accuracy compared to models initialized with weights learned from a large dataset like ImageNet.  This is a direct consequence of the model needing to learn both low-level features (edges, textures) and high-level features (object parts, object context) from scratch.

The ResNet101 architecture, while powerful, possesses a substantial number of parameters.  Training this many parameters from random initialization requires an extensive labeled dataset and substantial computational resources.  With an 800x1333 input image size, the computational burden further increases, demanding high-end hardware and optimized training strategies. Without pre-trained weights, the model struggles to converge effectively, often leading to poor generalization performance on unseen data.  This is exacerbated by the increased input size, which expands the feature maps and necessitates greater processing.  The initial layers of the network, critical for feature extraction, are particularly vulnerable to this issue.  Without prior knowledge about common visual features, these layers may struggle to learn effective representations leading to a cascading effect that hinders the performance of the later, higher-level layers responsible for object classification and bounding box regression.

To illustrate, let's analyze this through several code examples using a hypothetical, simplified framework.  These examples are intended to highlight key aspects of the training process and potential issues encountered.  I've avoided including specific framework-dependent details for broader applicability.

**Example 1:  Data Preparation and Augmentation**

```python
import hypothetical_data_loader as hdl
import hypothetical_augmentation as ha

# Load dataset
train_data = hdl.load_dataset('path/to/dataset', image_size=(800, 1333))

# Augmentation pipeline
augmentation = ha.compose([
    ha.random_horizontal_flip(),
    ha.random_vertical_flip(),
    ha.random_crop(),
    ha.random_brightness(),
    # ...other augmentations
])

# Apply augmentations during training
train_data = train_data.map(lambda image, labels: (augmentation(image), labels)) 
```

This segment demonstrates the importance of data augmentation.  Because we lack pre-trained weights, we heavily rely on data augmentation to artificially increase the size and diversity of the training data, mitigating overfitting.  Note that the augmentation pipeline must carefully consider the aspect ratio of the input images (800x1333) to avoid generating distorted images.


**Example 2: Model Initialization and Training Configuration**

```python
import hypothetical_faster_rcnn as hfr
import hypothetical_optimizer as ho

# Initialize model without pre-trained weights
model = hfr.FasterRCNN(backbone='resnet101', pretrained=False)

# Optimizer and loss function
optimizer = ho.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=0.001) # Example learning rate
loss_fn = hfr.faster_rcnn_loss() # Hypothetical loss function

# Training loop (simplified)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for images, labels in train_data:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        predictions = model(images)
        loss = loss_fn(predictions, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

This snippet shows the model initialization without pre-trained weights (`pretrained=False`).  The choice of optimizer and learning rate is critical; these hyperparameters need careful tuning.  A learning rate that's too high can lead to instability, while one that's too low will result in slow convergence.  The use of AdamW is illustrative; other optimizers might be more suitable.  Moreover, more sophisticated training techniques like learning rate scheduling and gradient accumulation might be necessary to handle the computational demands and avoid overfitting.


**Example 3:  Performance Evaluation**

```python
import hypothetical_metrics as hm
import hypothetical_data_loader as hdl

# Load validation dataset
val_data = hdl.load_dataset('path/to/val_dataset', image_size=(800, 1333))

# Evaluate the model
metrics = hm.evaluate(model, val_data)
print(f"mAP: {metrics['mAP']}")
print(f"Precision: {metrics['precision']}")
print(f"Recall: {metrics['recall']}")
```

This code segment illustrates the evaluation phase.  mAP (mean Average Precision) is a common metric for evaluating object detection models.  A low mAP, even with high precision, indicates poor recall â€“ meaning the model is failing to detect many of the objects present.  This highlights a key challenge when training from scratch; the model may struggle to generalize well due to the absence of prior knowledge.  Therefore, extensive evaluation on a held-out validation dataset is essential.

In conclusion, training Faster R-CNN ResNet101 V1 on 800x1333 images without pre-trained weights is a computationally intensive task with a high probability of achieving suboptimal results.  The model's capacity, combined with the high-resolution input and absence of prior knowledge significantly increases training complexity and time.  Careful consideration of data augmentation strategies, optimization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning is crucial.  My experience suggests focusing on transfer learning, where weights pre-trained on a large dataset like ImageNet are fine-tuned on the target dataset, would deliver a significantly improved performance in a more reasonable timeframe. This is vastly preferable to training from random initialization, especially with high-resolution images.  Successful training would necessitate significant computational resources and a large, high-quality, annotated dataset.  Furthermore, exploring alternative architectures or feature extraction techniques designed for high-resolution images could also potentially improve performance.   Thorough experimentation and a robust evaluation strategy are essential to optimize the performance of the system.  Resources to consult further would include advanced deep learning textbooks focusing on object detection, research papers on training deep networks from scratch, and documentation for relevant deep learning frameworks.
