The failure of glcontext wheel building, in my experience, predominantly stems from inconsistencies between the OpenGL context creation process and the underlying windowing system's capabilities.  This usually manifests as a failure to acquire a valid OpenGL context, often masked by seemingly unrelated errors.  My years working on high-performance visualization applications have exposed me to numerous instances of this problem, tracing the root cause back to subtle mismatches in version requirements, incompatible extensions, or issues with the window system's integration with the graphics driver.

**1.  Explanation:**

The glcontext building process involves several crucial stages. First, a window is created using a windowing toolkit like GLFW, Qt, or SDL.  This window acts as a canvas for rendering.  Next, an OpenGL context is created and associated with that window.  This context defines the rendering state, including the OpenGL version, extensions available, and the rendering pipeline. The process then involves acquiring the context, making it current (active) on the main thread, and initializing OpenGL functions. Finally, any necessary OpenGL extensions are loaded and checked for compatibility.  Failure at any stage can cause the glcontext build to fail.

Common causes for failure include:

* **Driver incompatibility:** The graphics driver might not support the requested OpenGL version or extensions.  This is especially prevalent with older hardware or improperly installed drivers.  Checking driver logs is essential in such cases.
* **Version mismatch:** Requesting an OpenGL version not supported by the system can lead to context creation failure.  This often occurs when a specific OpenGL version is hardcoded without checking system capabilities.
* **Missing or conflicting libraries:** Essential OpenGL libraries might be missing, corrupted, or conflicting with other libraries on the system.  This is more common on systems with multiple graphics cards or custom library configurations.
* **Context sharing issues:** When multiple contexts need to share resources, incorrect handling of context sharing mechanisms can lead to instability and failures.
* **Multi-threading problems:** Incorrectly accessing or modifying OpenGL state from multiple threads can easily corrupt the context and lead to unpredictable behavior.  OpenGL operations must be carefully synchronized.
* **Window system inconsistencies:** Bugs or limitations in the windowing system itself (e.g., GLFW, SDL) can sometimes interfere with context creation. This is rare but occurs when using less mature or less widely tested windowing systems.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate potential pitfalls and how to handle them within a hypothetical scenario using GLFW.

**Example 1: Incorrect OpenGL Version Request**

```c++
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    if (!glfwInit()) {
        std::cerr << "GLFW initialization failed" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 4); // Requesting OpenGL 4.x
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 5); // This might be unsupported

    GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "OpenGL Window", nullptr, nullptr);
    if (!window) {
        std::cerr << "Window creation failed" << std::endl;
        glfwTerminate();
        return 1;
    }

    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);

    // ... further OpenGL initialization ...

    glfwTerminate();
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This example explicitly requests OpenGL 4.5.  If the system only supports OpenGL 4.1, or lower, the `glfwCreateWindow` function will fail.  Robust code should query the system's capabilities before requesting a specific version.


**Example 2: Missing Error Handling**

```c++
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // ... (GLFW initialization and window creation as in Example 1) ...

    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);

    //This lacks error handling!  A failed GL call here won't be caught.
    glClearColor(0.2f, 0.3f, 0.3f, 1.0f);
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // ... (rest of the code) ...
}
```

**Commentary:** This code lacks proper error handling.  OpenGL functions can fail silently.  Always check for errors using `glGetError()` after every OpenGL call to catch potential problems early.  This should be done throughout the initialization process and during the rendering loop.


**Example 3:  Robust Context Creation**

```c++
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <GL/glew.h> // Include GLEW for extension handling

int main() {
    // ... (GLFW initialization) ...

    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 3);

    GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "OpenGL Window", nullptr, nullptr);
    if (!window) {
        std::cerr << "Window creation failed" << std::endl;
        glfwTerminate();
        return 1;
    }

    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);

    if (glewInit() != GLEW_OK) {
        std::cerr << "GLEW initialization failed" << std::endl;
        glfwTerminate();
        return 1;
    }

    // Get the actual OpenGL version from the context
    const GLubyte* renderer = glGetString(GL_RENDERER);
    const GLubyte* version = glGetString(GL_VERSION);
    std::cout << "Renderer: " << renderer << std::endl;
    std::cout << "OpenGL version supported: " << version << std::endl;

    // ... (rest of the OpenGL initialization) ...

    glfwTerminate();
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a more robust approach.  It uses GLEW to manage extensions, handles errors, and retrieves the actual OpenGL version supported by the system.  This avoids requesting unsupported versions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of OpenGL context creation and management, consult the official OpenGL specification, a comprehensive OpenGL programming textbook focusing on modern OpenGL, and the documentation for your chosen windowing library (e.g., GLFW, Qt, SDL).  Explore the documentation for your graphics card's driver for debugging purposes, as well as a debugging tool such as RenderDoc.  These resources provide necessary context and detailed explanations to resolve glcontext-related issues.  Additionally, carefully examining any error logs generated by the operating system or graphics driver can be crucial.
