The issue of TensorFlow Keras multiprocessing threads not closing, particularly when employing `tf.data` pipelines with map operations utilizing custom Python functions, stems from Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and how TensorFlow manages its internal thread pools in conjunction with user-defined multiprocessing. My experience debugging similar issues in distributed training pipelines, specifically with custom image processing functions that I implemented for a research project involving medical image segmentation, has revealed key insights into this behavior. The core problem lies in the complex interaction between TensorFlow’s C++ backend, Python's GIL-restricted multithreading, and the inherent overhead of inter-process communication.

**Understanding the Underlying Mechanisms**

TensorFlow heavily relies on optimized C++ kernels for computation. When using TensorFlow operations in Python, like those within a `tf.data` pipeline, these operations are delegated to the TensorFlow C++ runtime. This runtime, in turn, manages its own thread pool for parallel processing. When you introduce multiprocessing, such as via `num_parallel_calls` in `tf.data.Dataset.map`, you are essentially creating a separate Python interpreter process. These processes, while running in parallel, must still interact with the TensorFlow C++ backend when executing operations delegated to it.

The GIL in Python permits only one thread to hold the interpreter lock at a time, hindering true parallel execution of Python bytecode within a single process. While threads can run within a process, they do not achieve the same level of concurrency on CPU-bound tasks that multiprocessing can offer. However, these inter-process communications have associated costs in terms of memory copying and context switching. The custom functions invoked by a `tf.data.Dataset.map` function within each process have to be executed inside that process's Python interpreter.

The crux of the issue is that when TensorFlow receives a signal to exit the main Python process, especially abruptly, it does not always cleanly shut down the worker processes it spawned to execute `tf.data` pipeline functions with multiprocessing. In particular, if the processes are stalled at a point where they are waiting for the main process to send new work, and the main process exits unexpectedly, those worker processes might not receive the necessary signals to terminate. Consequently, they can linger in a detached state.

The problem is exacerbated by the fact that these `tf.data` worker processes are managed internally by TensorFlow's `tf.data` pipeline implementation. Users generally do not have direct control over the lifecycle of these processes. So, even if a `finally` block was implemented to handle potential issues, it would not ensure a clean termination of the spawned multiprocessing worker processes if the main process exits forcefully.

**Illustrative Code Examples**

The following code snippets demonstrate various scenarios where this issue can manifest and how it can be handled:

**Example 1: Basic Multiprocessing with `tf.data.Dataset.map`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

def slow_process(x):
    time.sleep(0.2)
    return x * 2

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(100)
dataset = dataset.map(slow_process, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

for element in dataset.take(10):
    print(element.numpy())
# Notice after execution, detached python processes may remain
```
Here, a simple `tf.data.Dataset` is created, and each element is transformed using the `slow_process` function. The use of `num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE` implies the use of multiprocessing by TensorFlow. Executing this code may result in detached Python processes after the main script has completed, especially when the dataset is large, or the processing takes time. These processes can be identified using system monitoring tools. They might not be easily terminated through standard script exits due to their disconnected nature.

**Example 2: Explicitly Using `tf.py_function` Within a Map Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time
import numpy as np

def slow_numpy_process(x):
    time.sleep(0.2)
    return np.array(x * 2, dtype=np.int64)

def tf_process(x):
    return tf.py_function(func=slow_numpy_process, inp=[x], Tout=tf.int64)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(100)
dataset = dataset.map(tf_process, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

for element in dataset.take(10):
    print(element.numpy())

# Notice after execution, detached python processes may remain
```
This example introduces `tf.py_function`, a more explicit way to wrap Python code within a TensorFlow graph. Although the computation itself is simple, the combination of `tf.py_function` with `num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE` still results in similar detached processes, highlighting that the root cause is not strictly within how `map` itself is operating but the underlying interaction with the process-spawning mechanisms. The fact that the underlying function uses numpy instead of pure tensor operations does not resolve this problem either.

**Example 3: Controlled Shutdown with `tf.data.Dataset.prefetch`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time
import signal
import os

def slow_process(x):
    time.sleep(0.2)
    return x * 2

def graceful_exit(signum, frame):
    print("Exiting gracefully...")
    os._exit(0)  # Forcefully exit the process

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, graceful_exit)
signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, graceful_exit)


dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(100)
dataset = dataset.map(slow_process, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
dataset = dataset.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)


try:
    for element in dataset.take(10):
        print(element.numpy())

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Interrupted by user.")


# No guarantee of closed threads. Still may remain if tf does not get the proper signal to terminate
```
This third example shows a different facet. While we might set up signal handlers for a graceful shutdown, this does not always ensure clean closure of the multiprocessing threads. The `prefetch` is added in this instance to improve the throughput of the data pipeline by allowing elements to be prepared concurrently.

The `os._exit(0)` call within the signal handler serves as a brute-force method to halt all processes within the current group. However, this is not an ideal approach and can lead to issues with resource clean up. Also, it does not guarantee a clean shut-down of TensorFlow’s worker processes, which could still leave dangling instances. The lack of deterministic behavior is the challenge.

**Recommendations**

Mitigating this issue requires a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, examine and limit the use of Python functions within `tf.data` pipelines. If possible, substitute them with equivalent TensorFlow operations. Employing `tf.numpy_function` and `tf.py_function` only when strictly necessary, and being aware of their performance impacts, can help. Minimize the usage of explicit multiprocessing if possible, since this may sometimes be replaced by asynchronous operations and careful management of the `prefetch` size. If multiprocessing is required, it might be more manageable to handle it explicitly using Python's `multiprocessing` library, then passing data into the `tf.data.Dataset`. This provides more control over process lifecycles, enabling more elegant shutdowns by signaling the process directly.

Secondly, pay close attention to the version of TensorFlow being used. Prior versions had known issues in the management of multiprocessing threads. Upgrading to the newest stable version may address some underlying bugs that cause this issue.

Finally, when facing resource cleanup problems, avoid forced exits. Instead, explore TensorFlow’s built-in mechanisms for gracefully terminating operations and datasets, when available. Consult the official TensorFlow documentation pertaining to tf.data and multiprocessing behavior, as the library is updated and revised over time. Monitoring the system resources and the CPU usage can help pinpoint situations where the processes do not close and allow for experimentation in code to determine the underlying cause of the lingering processes. There may be subtleties in the versions of TensorFlow, Python, and OS that may require careful consideration. Further investigation into TensorFlow’s source code and the interaction between it and the operating system thread and process mechanisms could provide a better understanding for more nuanced situations.
