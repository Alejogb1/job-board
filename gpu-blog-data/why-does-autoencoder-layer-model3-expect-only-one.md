The issue you're facing with the autoencoder layer `model_3` expecting one input but receiving 64 stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how autoencoders process data, particularly concerning the relationship between their input shape, the encoding layer's dimensionality, and the structure of batch processing in Keras or TensorFlow. The autoencoder, by its nature, learns a compressed representation of the input data. The confusion arises because `model_3` appears to be an individual layer within a larger model construct, and its intended input shape is being misinterpreted based on the full input batch's shape rather than each individual instance within the batch. Let me clarify this based on my experience troubleshooting similar issues in the past.

When building an autoencoder, we often define a higher-dimensional input layer, the encoder, followed by a lower-dimensional latent space, and then the decoder, which reconstructs the original input. The issue typically doesn’t lie in the autoencoder's inability to deal with batched data; rather, it's that the individual layers inside the autoencoder receive each item within a batch, one at a time, during forward propagation. If `model_3` expects an input with shape `(x,)`, the ‘x’ represents the features of *one* instance in a batch. If your model receives an input batch of shape `(batch_size, 64)`, `model_3` will receive an input of shape `(64,)`, as the `batch_size` dimension is handled outside the layer itself. This means your model is likely configured such that the input data is presented as 64 features per sample and the latent space within your model is of a single dimension, meaning model_3 is designed to receive the output of some preceding layer that had a single unit (neuron).

The error indicates an impedance mismatch between the shape of the preceding layer and the shape expected by the layer in question. This usually happens due to: 1) an incorrect layer configuration in your encoder that is producing a 64-dimensional output, or 2) an unexpected change in tensor dimensions, e.g., an accidental reshape operation or layer mismatch. The error specifically manifests because `model_3` (which, in your case, is either the latent space layer or first decoder layer) is expecting to receive the latent space representation of a single training example, but instead receives a full output of the prior layer, which happens to be of shape 64. It expects a single dimension (or a lower number) and not a batch of 64.

To effectively debug this, we need to examine the structure of the model preceding the layer causing the error. I have found that breaking down the model into smaller parts can reveal inconsistencies much easier. You will probably discover one or a combination of the following scenarios:

1.  Your encoder is not compressing the input down to one dimension but is leaving it at a higher dimensionality, such as 64.
2.  A reshaping or flatten operation could be unintentionally altering the dimensions of the output coming out of your encoder layers.
3.  The architecture is not consistently mapping between the intended data shapes at each layer.

Here are examples of how this error might present itself, along with ways to address them.

**Code Example 1: Incorrect Encoder Output Dimension**

This example illustrates an encoder producing a 64-dimensional output when only a single dimension is intended, which could manifest as the error you're encountering.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Incorrect Encoder (outputs 64-dim instead of 1-dim)
input_dim = 64
latent_dim = 1

#input layer. Input shape is (batch_size, input_dim)
inputs = layers.Input(shape=(input_dim,))

#Encoder with a final layer with 64 outputs.
encoded = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(inputs)
encoded = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(encoded)

#Latent space (The issue is that the output here should be one dimension not 64)
latent_space = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(encoded)


#Decoder that takes 64-dimensional input.
decoded = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(latent_space)
decoded = layers.Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')(decoded)
#Define the model to show how encoder output is incorrect in this setup.
autoencoder_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs,decoded)

autoencoder_model.summary() # This is very helpful for debugging as it shows the output shapes of each layer.

# Now when we feed a (batch_size, 64) to this the latent space expects (1,) but receive (64,) causing the error.

```

**Commentary:**  In this scenario, the final layer of the encoder incorrectly produces an output of shape `(64,)` instead of `(1,)`. As a result, the next layer (`model_3` in your case) expects an input with shape `(1,)` which results in the error. The fix would be to change the last encoder layer to output the correct dimensionality of the latent space.

**Code Example 2: Reshape Operation Causing Dimensionality Problems**

This shows a case where a reshape operation changes the dimensionality, which can lead to the error when not properly accounted for.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

input_dim = 64
latent_dim = 1


inputs = layers.Input(shape=(input_dim,))

encoded = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(inputs)

#Intentionally using a flatten layer here which will cause trouble.
flattened = layers.Flatten()(encoded)

#Now we are trying to use the flattened output into the latent space layer.
latent_space = layers.Dense(latent_dim, activation='relu')(flattened) #This is problematic because a flattening can cause issues.

decoded = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(latent_space)
decoded = layers.Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')(decoded)


autoencoder_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs,decoded)
autoencoder_model.summary()

# A dummy data batch of size 2
dummy_batch = np.random.rand(2, input_dim)

#Try to use model predict.
output = autoencoder_model.predict(dummy_batch)
```

**Commentary:** In this case, while the intent might be to reduce dimensionality using the dense layers, a `Flatten` layer between the encoder layers and the latent space layer forces a reshaping, causing unexpected behaviour. This is because the dense layers reduce the feature space of the tensor but do not affect the batch dimension, while the `Flatten` layer converts the tensor to a single dimension without keeping track of the batch dimension. This will lead to problems with the input dimension of the layer after the flatten operation.

**Code Example 3: Correct Autoencoder Configuration**

This example shows a correct autoencoder setup, where input dimension 64 is reduced to one in the latent space.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

input_dim = 64
latent_dim = 1

inputs = layers.Input(shape=(input_dim,))

encoded = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(inputs)
encoded = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(encoded)

#Correctly configure the latent space layer to output a 1 dimensional representation.
latent_space = layers.Dense(latent_dim, activation='relu')(encoded)

decoded = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(latent_space)
decoded = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(decoded)
decoded = layers.Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')(decoded)


autoencoder_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs,decoded)
autoencoder_model.summary()


#Dummy data for prediction.
dummy_data = tf.random.normal((2,input_dim))

#Try to predict from dummy data.
output = autoencoder_model.predict(dummy_data)
```

**Commentary:** Here, the encoder gradually reduces dimensionality, ultimately outputting a single dimension. The decoder progressively increases the dimensionality back to the original 64. This configuration is the intended setup to resolve your problem, as it guarantees that `model_3` (in this case the `latent_space` layer) receives a one-dimensional representation as expected.

For further investigation, consider these resources. First, examine the TensorFlow documentation covering layers, and the model class. Second, explore relevant sections from deep learning textbooks that cover autoencoders and dimensionality reduction. These often contain practical insights into how different layers operate. Finally, consider reviewing example code on websites and repositories that discuss autoencoders in Keras or Tensorflow. Pay close attention to how data flows between layers and their respective shapes.
By inspecting the output shapes of each layer using `model.summary()` and focusing on how data dimensionality is changed at each layer, you can readily fix the issue with `model_3` expecting one input but receiving 64. The fundamental principle involves matching the output dimensions of one layer with the input dimensions expected by its immediate successor.
