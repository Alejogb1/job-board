The core functionality of Keras' `Dense` layer – implementing a fully connected layer with a linear transformation followed by an activation function – finds its direct analog in PyTorch through the `nn.Linear` module coupled with an activation function applied separately.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects underscored the importance of understanding this subtle yet crucial distinction.  While superficially similar, the differing object-oriented architectures of Keras and PyTorch necessitate a nuanced approach.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras' `Dense` layer is a high-level abstraction encapsulating both the linear transformation and the activation function within a single layer object.  In PyTorch, this functionality is decoupled. The `nn.Linear` module performs the matrix multiplication (linear transformation)  `Wx + b`, where `W` is the weight matrix, `x` is the input vector, and `b` is the bias vector.  The activation function is then applied independently using a separate PyTorch activation function module like `nn.ReLU`, `nn.Sigmoid`, or `nn.Tanh`. This separation offers greater flexibility and control over the network architecture but requires a more explicit definition of the layer's components.

The fundamental difference stems from Keras' functional and declarative nature versus PyTorch's more imperative approach. Keras allows you to define layers and their connections in a relatively high-level way, while PyTorch emphasizes explicit tensor operations within a class-based framework. This influences how layers are defined and applied within the model. In Keras, the activation is inherently part of the layer; in PyTorch, it is a separate operation.

Another crucial aspect relates to how backpropagation is handled.  In Keras, the `Dense` layer inherently manages the gradient calculations during backpropagation.  In PyTorch, gradients are computed using `torch.autograd`, which requires that the activation function is included in the computational graph, ensuring that gradients are correctly propagated through both the linear transformation and the activation function.  Incorrectly separating the activation from the computation graph will result in a failure to correctly compute gradients, leading to inaccurate model training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Dense Layer Equivalent**

This example mirrors a Keras `Dense` layer with 64 units and a ReLU activation:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Keras equivalent: Dense(64, activation='relu')
linear_layer = nn.Linear(128, 64) # input size 128, output size 64
relu_activation = nn.ReLU()

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 128) # Example input tensor

output = relu_activation(linear_layer(input_tensor))

print(output.shape) # Output shape will be (1, 64)
```

This showcases the explicit separation: `nn.Linear` handles the linear transformation, and `nn.ReLU` applies the activation. The input tensor dimensions must be consistent with the defined input size of `nn.Linear`.

**Example 2:  Implementing Multiple Layers**

This expands to a sequence of layers, demonstrating how PyTorch handles multiple layers in a sequential model:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F # Often useful for activations

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x)) # Utilizing functional API for activation
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(x)) # Sigmoid activation for output layer
        return x

model = MyModel(784, 128, 10) # Example MNIST-like input
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 784)
output = model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape)
```

This builds a multi-layer network using `nn.Module`, emphasizing the object-oriented nature of PyTorch's model creation. Note the usage of both `nn` and `nn.functional` for applying activations. `nn.functional` provides a functional interface to the activations which are the same as the ones in `nn` but can be more convenient.

**Example 3:  Handling Batch Processing**

This example highlights how to manage batches efficiently within PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

linear_layer = nn.Linear(10, 5)
batch_input = torch.randn(32, 10) # Batch of 32 samples, each with 10 features

output = linear_layer(batch_input)
print(output.shape) # Output shape will be (32, 5), demonstrating batch handling.
```


The `batch_input` tensor's first dimension represents the batch size. PyTorch's `nn.Linear` automatically handles the matrix multiplications for the entire batch in a single operation, leading to efficient processing. This contrasts slightly with Keras, where batch handling is often implicitly managed by the training loop.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, focusing on practical implementations. A curated selection of PyTorch tutorials focusing on fundamental neural network building blocks.  A deep learning textbook covering both theoretical and practical aspects, with a focus on building neural networks from scratch.  These resources will provide a thorough understanding of PyTorch and its capabilities.  It's crucial to prioritize a thorough grasp of tensor operations and automatic differentiation before diving into more advanced concepts.  My own experience underscored that a strong mathematical understanding complements practical coding experience in achieving proficiency with PyTorch.
