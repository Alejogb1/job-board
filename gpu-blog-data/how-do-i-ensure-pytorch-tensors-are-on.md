Efficient GPU utilization in PyTorch hinges on proactive management of tensor placement.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks has underscored the critical role of explicit tensor placement, particularly before operations involving data transfer.  Neglecting this can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, rendering even the most sophisticated architectures inefficient. The core issue isn't simply moving data; it's ensuring data resides on the target device *before* the computationally expensive operation begins.  This avoids the overhead of data transfer during computation, which often dominates execution time.

The primary mechanism for controlling tensor location is the `.to()` method, complemented by device querying and conditional checks.  Simply calling `.to('cuda')` isn't sufficient; it necessitates prior verification of CUDA availability and potentially handles exceptions for environments lacking GPU acceleration.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves three key steps:

a) **Device Verification:** Before any operation, ascertain the availability of a CUDA-enabled GPU.  This involves checking if CUDA is installed and whether GPUs are accessible.  Failure to do so results in runtime errors when attempting to utilize GPU resources.

b) **Tensor Placement:** Once GPU availability is confirmed, the tensor must be explicitly moved to the GPU using `.to()`. This operation copies the tensor's data from the CPU (or another device) to the GPU's memory.

c) **Operation Execution:** Only after confirming tensor placement on the GPU should computationally intensive operations begin. This prevents unnecessary data transfers during computation.

Failing to adhere to this sequence will force PyTorch to perform implicit transfers, significantly slowing down training and inference.  Implicit transfers occur when an operation involves tensors residing on different devices. PyTorch will automatically move data, but this adds overhead.  Explicit control avoids this overhead.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic GPU Transfer with Error Handling:**

```python
import torch

def move_tensor_to_gpu(tensor):
    """Moves a tensor to the GPU if available, otherwise keeps it on the CPU."""
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        try:
            return tensor.to('cuda')
        except RuntimeError as e:
            print(f"CUDA error: {e}.  Falling back to CPU.")
            return tensor  #Return tensor on CPU if GPU transfer fails
    else:
        print("CUDA is not available. Using CPU.")
        return tensor

# Example usage
cpu_tensor = torch.randn(100, 100)
gpu_tensor = move_tensor_to_gpu(cpu_tensor)

print(f"Tensor is on device: {gpu_tensor.device}")
```

This example demonstrates robust GPU transfer. It explicitly checks for CUDA availability and gracefully handles potential `RuntimeError` exceptions, which might arise from insufficient GPU memory or driver issues. The function ensures the tensor is correctly placed (either on GPU or CPU) before proceeding.

**Example 2:  Conditional Operations Based on Device:**

```python
import torch

cpu_tensor = torch.randn(100, 100)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    gpu_tensor = cpu_tensor.to('cuda')
    # Perform GPU-bound operations
    result = gpu_tensor.mm(gpu_tensor.t()) #Matrix multiplication example

    print("GPU computation completed.")
else:
    #Perform CPU-bound operations
    result = cpu_tensor.mm(cpu_tensor.t())
    print("CPU computation completed.")

print(f"Result shape: {result.shape}")
print(f"Result device: {result.device}")
```

This illustrates conditional operation based on device availability. Operations are tailored to the available device, ensuring optimal resource utilization.  The code avoids attempts to utilize GPU resources when they are unavailable.

**Example 3: Data Parallelism with Multiple GPUs:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn.parallel import DataParallel

# ... Define your model ...
model = MyModel()  #Replace with your model

if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    print("Let's use", torch.cuda.device_count(), "GPUs!")
    # dim = 0 [30, xxx] -> [10, ...], [10, ...], [10, ...] on 3 GPUs
    model = DataParallel(model)

model.to('cuda') #Places the model on CUDA
# ... Continue training or inference ...

```

In more complex scenarios like data parallelism, `DataParallel` automatically handles tensor distribution across multiple GPUs. However, the `.to('cuda')` call is crucial to initialize the model on the GPU before data parallelism is initiated.  This example highlights best practice for multi-GPU configurations, where efficient tensor management is even more critical.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation itself is an invaluable resource.  Specifically, sections dedicated to CUDA programming, data parallelism, and tensor manipulation are indispensable.  Further, several advanced PyTorch tutorials, often found within educational repositories or accompanying academic publications, provide in-depth examples of efficient tensor handling within larger projects. Mastering these resources is essential for efficient and error-free GPU utilization.  Consider consulting books focused on performance optimization in deep learning to solidify understanding of memory management techniques.  Finally, the PyTorch community forums can provide practical insights and solutions to common problems related to GPU programming.
