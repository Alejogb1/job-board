TensorFlow, at its core, excels at numerical computation, posing challenges when directly handling complex, non-numeric data like text and raw video. Efficiently integrating these heterogeneous data types into a TensorFlow pipeline demands a careful choreography of pre-processing stages, leveraging specific APIs within `tf.data` and TensorFlow's native capabilities. From personal experience building a real-time video summarization system, I've observed that naively attempting to feed raw text or video frames directly into a model leads to significant performance bottlenecks. Therefore, the key lies in preprocessing data to a numerically represented format that TensorFlow can ingest efficiently.

To process text effectively, the initial step involves converting strings into numerical representations. Unlike integers or floats, strings lack inherent order and meaning for a neural network. We must therefore tokenize them - breaking them down into smaller units such as words, subwords, or characters - and assign each unit a unique integer identifier, mapping to a vocabulary. After tokenization, we apply padding or truncation to ensure each sequence has consistent length, crucial for batch processing. This process transforms variable-length textual sequences into fixed-size numerical tensors suitable for network input.

For video data, the challenge lies in the sheer volume and dimensionality of raw frames. Directly feeding each frame into the network is impractical. Instead, I have found that extracting features at a temporal level is often the best practice. This means using a library outside of TensorFlow, typically a video processing library like OpenCV or FFmpeg, to decode frames and then transform these frames into a format that TensorFlow can handle; such as a NumPy array, which TensorFlow can seamlessly convert into a tensor. The frames could then be processed to extract relevant features such as, motion vectors or optical flow before being ingested into the network. Further efficiencies are gained through asynchronous data loading using `tf.data.Dataset` API, which allows data preprocessing and model training to happen in parallel.

Here are specific code examples illustrating the mentioned pre-processing methodologies:

**1. Text Tokenization and Padding:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Fictional text data
text_data = [
    "This is the first sentence.",
    "Another sentence here, longer this time.",
    "A very short one.",
    "And yet another string for processing."
]

# Initialize a tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=None, oov_token="<unk>")
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(text_data)

# Convert texts to sequences of integers
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(text_data)

# Pad sequences
max_length = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')

# Convert to a TensorFlow Dataset
text_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(padded_sequences)


for data in text_dataset:
   print(data)
```

This code snippet demonstrates a typical text pre-processing pipeline. The `Tokenizer` learns a vocabulary from the input texts, assigning a unique integer to each word. The `texts_to_sequences` method transforms sentences into numerical sequences based on this vocabulary. The `pad_sequences` method then makes all sequences the same length by adding padding tokens, enabling batch operations. The `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` function efficiently converts the padded sequences into a TensorFlow dataset for processing. Note that I choose a post padding method to avoid loss of information at the beginning of a sentence.

**2. Video Frame Decoding and Feature Extraction (Conceptual):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np # For demonstration only

#  Using the assumption of a video processing library external to tensorflow for decoding.
def decode_and_process_frame(video_path, frame_index):

    # Placeholder for real video decoding code (e.g., using OpenCV or FFmpeg)
    # Example: Using mock frame generation as an example instead.
    frame = np.random.rand(256, 256, 3).astype(np.float32)  # Simulating RGB frame
    #  In reality, here's where you'd call a function to decode the frame from the video file at a particular index
    # frame = video_decoder.decode_frame(video_path, frame_index)


    # Example of feature extraction (e.g., mean RGB values)
    feature_vector = np.mean(frame, axis=(0, 1))

    #Return a processed frame or feature
    return feature_vector

# Function to process sequence of frames in batch
def process_video(video_path, num_frames):
    features = []
    for i in range(num_frames):
      features.append(decode_and_process_frame(video_path,i))
    return tf.convert_to_tensor(features, dtype=tf.float32)


# Example of usage for a given video
video_path = "sample.mp4" # Place holder
num_frames_to_process = 10

video_tensor = process_video(video_path, num_frames_to_process)


video_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(video_tensor)

for data in video_dataset:
  print(data)
```

This second example is conceptual, as actual video decoding requires external libraries not part of standard TensorFlow. The `decode_and_process_frame` function shows how frames would be decoded (replaced with random frame creation), with the result converted into a vector of RGB means as example features. In practice, one would implement the video decoding and feature extraction logic using libraries such as `OpenCV`, `FFmpeg` or other equivalent.  The `process_video` function showcases how a tensor of video features might be created.  This tensor is then transformed into a `tf.data.Dataset` object to be integrated into the TensorFlow pipeline. Note that we could include multiple sequences for batch training.

**3. Combined Text and Video Dataset:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Fictional text data
text_data = [
    "A video of dogs playing.",
    "A cat sleeping on a couch.",
    "Birds chirping and flying",
    "A car racing on a track"
]

# Fictional video paths
video_paths = [
    "video_01.mp4",
    "video_02.mp4",
    "video_03.mp4",
    "video_04.mp4"
]
num_frames_per_video = 5 # Assuming this is known.

# Text Tokenization
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=None, oov_token="<unk>")
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(text_data)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(text_data)
max_length = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')


# Placeholder for video loading & processing (reuse function from 2)
def load_and_process_video(video_path,num_frames):
  return process_video(video_path, num_frames)



video_tensors = [load_and_process_video(path,num_frames_per_video) for path in video_paths]

# Creating paired dataset

text_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(padded_sequences)
video_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(video_tensors)
# Combine datasets
combined_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.zip((text_dataset, video_dataset))

# Verify shape of each entry of combined dataset
for text,video in combined_dataset:
    print("Text data:", text.shape)
    print("Video data", video.shape)

```
This last example shows how one can create a dataset which includes both pre-processed text and video data using `tf.data.Dataset.zip`, combining both data streams for training multimodal models. The pre-processing from the previous two examples is reused. Text data is tokenized and padded, and the video data is loaded and transformed into tensors (with feature vectors).  The `zip` function combines the text and video datasets, ensuring that data pairs are processed together. This method allows training models that can learn relationships between textual descriptions and visual content.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow's data pipelines, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data`. It provides detailed explanations and numerous examples for efficient data loading and preprocessing.  Furthermore, a detailed study on the Keras preprocessing API, specifically `Tokenizer`, `pad_sequences` and other text pre-processing utilities, can greatly help when handling textual data. Lastly, understanding the use of external video processing libraries like OpenCV and FFmpeg is essential for efficient video processing pipelines within a TensorFlow context; these libraries are often more performant for video decoding than what might be found natively in TensorFlow. These resources, combined with practical application, provide a robust foundation for efficiently handling text and video data in TensorFlow.
