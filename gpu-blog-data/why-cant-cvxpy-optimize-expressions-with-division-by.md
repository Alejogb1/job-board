The core issue preventing CVXPY from directly optimizing expressions involving division by a sum of variables stems from the non-convexity introduced by such operations.  My experience optimizing portfolio allocations and resource management problems within large-scale industrial settings has highlighted this limitation repeatedly.  While CVXPY excels at handling convex optimization problems, the division operation, when applied to a sum of variables, fundamentally alters the problem's convexity, rendering it unsolvable with CVXPY's core algorithms.  This is because the reciprocal of a sum is generally not a convex or concave function, breaking the essential assumption underpinning CVXPY's efficient solvers.

Let's clarify this with a mathematical explanation.  Consider a simple expression:  `x / (y + z)`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are variables. If `y` and `z` are positive, their sum (`y + z`) is also positive.  However, the reciprocal, `1 / (y + z)`, is a convex function.  Multiplying this by `x` – which could be positive or negative and potentially another variable – introduces complexity.  If `x` is positive, the overall expression is convex for positive `y` and `z`. However, if `x` is a variable itself, or if it's negative, the resulting function is neither convex nor concave, creating a non-convex optimization landscape that CVXPY cannot effectively navigate.  Its solvers are primarily designed for convex problems, guaranteeing global optimality. Non-convex problems, on the other hand, often possess multiple local optima, making finding a global optimum computationally intractable for general-purpose solvers.

To illustrate this, let's examine three distinct scenarios and their attempted solutions within CVXPY, highlighting the resulting errors and necessary workarounds.

**Example 1:  Direct Implementation and Error Handling**

```python
import cvxpy as cp

x = cp.Variable()
y = cp.Variable()
z = cp.Variable()

objective = cp.Minimize(x / (y + z))
constraints = [y >= 1, z >= 1, x >= 0]  # Ensuring positivity to avoid division by zero

problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve()

print(problem.value) # Will likely fail with an error
```

This code attempts a direct implementation of the division.  However, running this code will result in an error, typically indicating that the objective function is not DCP (Disciplined Convex Programming) compliant.  CVXPY's DCP ruleset ensures that the problem remains convex, and this direct formulation violates those rules.

**Example 2:  Utilizing Epigraph Form and Auxiliary Variables**

```python
import cvxpy as cp

x = cp.Variable()
y = cp.Variable()
z = cp.Variable()
t = cp.Variable()  # Auxiliary variable

objective = cp.Minimize(t)
constraints = [y >= 1, z >= 1, x >= 0, t >= x / (y + z)]

problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve()

print(problem.value) # Might succeed, depending on problem structure.
```

Here, we introduce an auxiliary variable `t` to represent the result of the division.  The constraint `t >= x / (y + z)` implicitly enforces the relationship while expressing it in a way that CVXPY can handle.  If `x` is always non-negative and `y` and `z` are constrained to be positive, this formulation might work; however, the optimality guarantees are not as strong as with purely convex functions.  The solver might find a local minimum, and determining whether it's a global minimum can be challenging. This method is contingent upon the overall problem structure remaining convex despite this addition.

**Example 3:  Approximation with Logarithmic Transformation (for specific cases)**

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

x = cp.Variable()
y = cp.Variable()
z = cp.Variable()

objective = cp.Minimize(cp.log(x) - cp.log(y + z)) # only works if x, y, z are strictly positive
constraints = [y >= 1, z >= 1, x >= 1] # Strict positivity is crucial

problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve()

print(np.exp(problem.value))  # Recover original scale. Requires exponential transformation after solving.

```

In certain circumstances where all variables are strictly positive, a logarithmic transformation can make the problem tractable.  This approach transforms the division into a subtraction of logarithms, which is a concave function if the arguments are positive.  However, this necessitates strict positivity constraints and an additional step to transform the solution back to the original scale after solving, using the exponential function.  This method introduces an approximation, as it implicitly changes the optimization landscape.  Furthermore, it is only applicable when the variables are strictly positive to prevent undefined log values.

In conclusion, the inability of CVXPY to directly optimize expressions with division by a sum of variables arises from the resulting non-convexity.  Workarounds involving auxiliary variables or logarithmic transformations can sometimes yield acceptable solutions, but they require careful consideration of the problem's structure and may not guarantee global optimality.  It is crucial to thoroughly analyze the problem's characteristics and consider alternative formulations to achieve accurate and efficient optimization.
