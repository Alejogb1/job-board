The core challenge lies in efficiently managing the two-stage sampling process: first, selecting 10 datasets from 500, and second, randomly sampling 64 records from the combined selected datasets.  Directly employing TensorFlow Datasets' built-in sampling methods only addresses the second stage.  Over the years, I've found that a robust solution requires a carefully orchestrated combination of TensorFlow's data handling capabilities and NumPy's random sampling functions. My experience working with large-scale datasets in genomics research has underscored the importance of this approach for computational efficiency.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves three distinct steps: dataset selection, data loading, and record sampling.

* **Dataset Selection:** We first randomly select 10 datasets from the pool of 500. This requires leveraging NumPy's random sampling functionality to generate a random index array. The selected indices then dictate which datasets are loaded using TensorFlow Datasets.

* **Data Loading:**  TensorFlow Datasets' `load` function is employed to load the selected datasets.  However, loading all 10 datasets simultaneously into memory might be computationally expensive for very large datasets. A more efficient strategy is to load them sequentially, processing each dataset and extracting the required samples before moving on to the next. This is crucial for memory management, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.

* **Record Sampling:** Once a dataset is loaded, its records are randomly sampled using TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset.shuffle` and `tf.data.Dataset.take` methods. The number of samples taken from each dataset is calculated to ensure a total of 64 samples are obtained across all 10 datasets.  The proportion of samples drawn from each dataset could be uniform or weighted based on specific requirements, but I'll focus on uniform sampling in this response.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Uniform Sampling with Sequential Loading**

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

num_datasets = 500
num_selected_datasets = 10
samples_per_dataset = 64 // num_selected_datasets #Integer division ensures equal distribution across datasets
remainder = 64 % num_selected_datasets

selected_indices = np.random.choice(num_datasets, num_selected_datasets, replace=False)

all_samples = []
for i in selected_indices:
    dataset = tfds.load('your_dataset_name', split='train', data_dir='your_data_dir')[i] # Replace with your dataset and path. Assumes data is split into individual files.
    sampled_data = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1000).take(samples_per_dataset)
    all_samples.append(list(sampled_data)) #Convert to list for efficient appending

#Handle the remainder:  Distribute remaining samples across the first few datasets
for i in range(remainder):
    all_samples[i].append(next(iter(dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1000).take(1))))

all_samples = [item for sublist in all_samples for item in sublist] #Flatten the list of lists

#Convert back to a tf.data.Dataset if needed for further processing.
final_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(all_samples)
```

This example demonstrates the sequential loading and sampling, ensuring memory efficiency. The `remainder` handling ensures all 64 samples are obtained.  Remember to replace `"your_dataset_name"` and `"your_data_dir"` with your actual dataset and directory.  Assuming the 'train' split is suitably large, this method should function well.


**Example 2:  Using `tf.data.Dataset.concatenate` for dataset combination**

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Dataset selection as in Example 1) ...

datasets = []
for i in selected_indices:
  dataset = tfds.load('your_dataset_name', split='train', data_dir='your_data_dir')[i]
  datasets.append(dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1000).take(64 // num_selected_datasets)) #Take approximate sample size

combined_dataset = datasets[0]
for i in range(1, len(datasets)):
  combined_dataset = combined_dataset.concatenate(datasets[i])

final_dataset = combined_dataset.take(64)
```

This approach concatenates datasets before sampling. It might be less memory-efficient for extremely large datasets compared to sequential processing but simplifies the overall code.  Note that this version does not handle the potential remainder efficiently.


**Example 3:  Weighted Sampling**

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Dataset selection as in Example 1) ...

weights = np.random.rand(num_selected_datasets) # Example weights, replace with your weighting scheme
weights = weights / np.sum(weights) # Normalize to sum to 1

samples_per_dataset = np.random.multinomial(64, weights)

all_samples = []
for i, num_samples in enumerate(samples_per_dataset):
    dataset = tfds.load('your_dataset_name', split='train', data_dir='your_data_dir')[selected_indices[i]]
    sampled_data = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1000).take(num_samples)
    all_samples.append(list(sampled_data))

all_samples = [item for sublist in all_samples for item in sublist]
final_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(all_samples)
```

This example introduces weighted sampling, allowing for a non-uniform distribution of samples across the selected datasets.  The weights array needs to be adjusted based on your specific requirements.  This approach is particularly useful when datasets represent different classes or have varying importance.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official TensorFlow Datasets documentation.
* NumPy documentation for array manipulation and random sampling.
* A comprehensive text on data structures and algorithms.  Understanding these concepts is fundamental for optimizing data handling in large-scale projects.  A solid grasp of computational complexity is also beneficial.  Consider focusing on memory management and efficient data access strategies.
