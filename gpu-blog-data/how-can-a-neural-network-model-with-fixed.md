The core challenge in accommodating a variable number of inputs with a fixed-weight neural network lies not in the weights themselves, but in the architecture preceding the weighted layers.  Fixed weights imply a predetermined structure;  therefore, the adaptability must reside in a preprocessing stage that transforms the variable-length input into a consistent, fixed-size representation suitable for the network's input layer.  I've encountered this problem extensively in my work on time-series anomaly detection, where sensor data streams often exhibit unpredictable lengths.  My experience highlights three primary approaches: sequence padding, recurrent neural networks (though technically violating the "fixed weights" constraint in their internal recurrent connections, their output can be considered fixed), and input feature engineering.


**1. Sequence Padding:**

This is the most straightforward approach.  It involves augmenting shorter input sequences with a special "padding" token to match the length of the longest sequence encountered in the training dataset.  This ensures all inputs have the same dimensionality before being fed to the network.  The padding token should ideally represent a neutral or insignificant value, preventing it from unduly influencing the network's computations.  For example, in numerical data, zero padding is often employed; for categorical data, a dedicated "PAD" token is commonly used.  The padded sequences then proceed through the network, with the network's fixed weights applied uniformly across all elements (including padding).  It's crucial to appropriately mask the padding tokens during the loss calculation to avoid misleading the network.


**Code Example 1 (Python with NumPy and TensorFlow/Keras):**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def pad_sequences(sequences, max_len, padding_value=0):
    padded_sequences = np.full((len(sequences), max_len), padding_value, dtype=np.float32)
    for i, seq in enumerate(sequences):
        padded_sequences[i, :len(seq)] = seq
    return padded_sequences

# Example usage:
sequences = [np.array([1, 2, 3]), np.array([4, 5]), np.array([6, 7, 8, 9])]
max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, max_len)

#Create a simple model (weights are fixed after compilation)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(max_len,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', use_bias=False, kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.Constant(np.random.rand(max_len,10))), #Fixed Weights
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', use_bias=False, kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.Constant(np.random.rand(10,1))) #Fixed Weights
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

#Masking during training is crucial.  This example omits it for brevity, but is essential for real-world use.
model.fit(padded_sequences, np.array([0,1,0])) #Example labels
```


This example uses a simple dense network.  The key is the `kernel_initializer` which sets the weights to fixed random values and prevents them from being updated during training.  Note that masking during training is vital and omitted here for brevity, but a mask should be applied to ignore padding values during loss calculation.


**2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Fixed Weights Post-Training:**

While RNNs inherently possess variable-length input capabilities due to their recurrent connections, their weights are typically updated during training. However, we can circumvent this by training the RNN beforehand and then fixing its weights. The final output of the RNN—which summarizes the variable-length input sequence into a fixed-size vector—can then be fed into a subsequent fixed-weight network.  The challenge lies in properly training the RNN such that the fixed weights capture sufficient information from the varying input lengths.  This approach benefits from RNNs' ability to process sequential information effectively.

**Code Example 2 (Python with TensorFlow/Keras):**


```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume you have a trained RNN model 'trained_rnn' with fixed weights after training.

# ... (Training code for trained_rnn, omitted for brevity.  Key: After training, set model.trainable = False) ...

# Example usage:
sequences = [np.array([1, 2, 3]), np.array([4, 5]), np.array([6, 7, 8, 9])]

#Assuming the trained_rnn outputs a vector of length 10
rnn_outputs = [trained_rnn.predict(np.expand_dims(seq,axis=0)) for seq in sequences]
rnn_outputs = np.array([output.flatten() for output in rnn_outputs])

# Fixed-weight network after the RNN
fixed_weight_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)), #Output shape from trained_RNN
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', use_bias=False, kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.Constant(np.random.rand(10,1)))
])
fixed_weight_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')


fixed_weight_model.fit(rnn_outputs, np.array([0,1,0])) #Example Labels
```

This exemplifies a two-stage approach.  The `trained_rnn` is assumed pre-trained with its weights frozen.  The output of this pre-trained model then serves as the input to a simple fixed-weight dense layer.



**3. Input Feature Engineering:**

Instead of directly feeding the raw variable-length data, we can create fixed-length feature vectors that capture the essence of the input sequence.  This involves meticulously designing features that are invariant to the sequence length.  These features could include statistical summaries (mean, standard deviation, percentiles), frequency domain representations (Fourier transform), or other domain-specific aggregates.  These fixed-size feature vectors then become the input to the fixed-weight network. The effectiveness of this approach relies heavily on expert knowledge of the data and the ability to extract relevant information regardless of sequence length.


**Code Example 3 (Python with NumPy):**

```python
import numpy as np

def extract_features(sequence):
    mean = np.mean(sequence)
    std = np.std(sequence)
    #Add other features as needed
    return np.array([mean, std])

sequences = [np.array([1, 2, 3]), np.array([4, 5]), np.array([6, 7, 8, 9])]
feature_vectors = [extract_features(seq) for seq in sequences]
feature_vectors = np.array(feature_vectors)

#Fixed Weight model with 2 features as input
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(2,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', use_bias=False, kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.Constant(np.random.rand(2,1)))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

model.fit(feature_vectors, np.array([0,1,0]))
```

This example demonstrates a simplistic feature extraction process.  In practice, more sophisticated techniques might be necessary, potentially involving dimensionality reduction or more complex feature transformations.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend studying texts on sequence modeling, machine learning, and signal processing.  Specific books on deep learning architectures, including those covering RNNs and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are also highly beneficial.  Finally, examining papers on time-series analysis and feature engineering will prove invaluable.  These resources provide the theoretical background and practical guidance necessary to implement and refine these techniques.
