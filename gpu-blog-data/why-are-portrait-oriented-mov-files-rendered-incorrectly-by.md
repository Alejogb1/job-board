Incorrect rendering of portrait-oriented .mov files in FFmpeg often stems from metadata discrepancies or codec-specific handling of rotation flags.  My experience troubleshooting this issue over the years, primarily working with archival footage and broadcast-quality video, points to three main culprits: inconsistent rotation metadata, improper handling of QuickTime atom structures, and limitations within specific FFmpeg codecs.

**1. Metadata Mismatch and Inconsistent Rotation Flags:**

The QuickTime container format, commonly used with .mov files, utilizes various atoms to store metadata, including rotation information.  Crucially, rotation might be specified in multiple locations: within the `moov` atom's `udta` (user data) section, potentially embedded within the video stream's metadata, or even within the file's EXIF data if originating from a digital camera. FFmpeg's parsing of these metadata fields isn't always consistent.  A conflict – for instance, one atom specifying a 90-degree clockwise rotation while another indicates no rotation – will often lead to incorrect rendering.  Furthermore, some older cameras or encoding software might embed rotation information in non-standard ways, which FFmpeg might not recognize or interpret correctly.  This results in the video appearing in landscape orientation despite being recorded in portrait.

**2. Codec-Specific Handling of Rotation:**

FFmpeg supports a wide array of codecs, each with its nuanced approach to handling metadata. While the general framework aims for uniformity, variations exist.  Certain codecs, particularly older or less widely used ones, might not fully support or properly interpret all rotation flags present within the QuickTime atoms.  This leads to a situation where the codec ignores or misinterprets the rotation information, irrespective of the correctness of the metadata itself.  The solution might involve a codec-specific work-around, which requires careful examination of FFmpeg's codec documentation.  In my experience, this was particularly apparent with some less common codecs used in professional broadcast equipment from the early 2000s.


**3.  Issues with QuickTime Atom Parsing:**

FFmpeg's ability to parse and interpret the QuickTime atom structures is critical.  A bug or imperfection in this parsing mechanism – which occasionally occurs, given the complexity of the QuickTime specification – can lead to the incorrect extraction or interpretation of rotation information.  This can manifest in a variety of ways, including simply ignoring the rotation data altogether or applying the wrong rotation angle.  These issues are typically addressed by FFmpeg developers in subsequent updates, underscoring the importance of keeping the software up-to-date.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three FFmpeg command examples illustrating different approaches to addressing this issue, each based on a specific hypothesis of the underlying problem:

**Example 1:  Forcing Rotation with `-vf` (Video Filter):**

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf "transpose=1" output.mp4
```

This command uses the `transpose` video filter to rotate the video by 90 degrees clockwise (`transpose=1`). This is a brute-force approach that overrides any metadata-based rotation.  It's useful if the metadata is unreliable or conflicting, but it is less ideal if the metadata is actually correct and only the interpretation is faulty.  The resulting video will be correctly oriented, but metadata may still be inconsistent.  This approach was invaluable in many cases dealing with inconsistent metadata found in third-party archival material.

**Example 2:  Using `-map_metadata` to Select Metadata Source:**

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mov -map_metadata:g 0 -map 0 -c copy output.mp4
```

This command attempts to selectively copy metadata from the input stream (specified by `-map_metadata:g 0`). The `-c copy` stream copy ensures that the video is not re-encoded. This is a more sophisticated approach that aims to preserve metadata that FFmpeg handles correctly and overwrite any conflicting metadata.  This strategy proved successful in instances where the primary metadata was valid but some secondary metadata was interfering with rendering.


**Example 3:  Using `-metadata` to Explicitly Set Rotation:**

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mov -metadata:s:v rotate="90" -c copy output.mp4
```

This approach directly sets the rotation metadata for the video stream (`-metadata:s:v rotate="90"`). This overrides any existing rotation information and explicitly informs FFmpeg about the correct orientation. This solution is effective when the existing metadata is either missing or incorrect, and you have ascertained the correct rotation angle.  I used this technique frequently after analyzing the video and comparing the actual frame orientation with the metadata extracted with tools like `mediainfo`.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The FFmpeg documentation, particularly the sections on codecs, filters, and metadata handling, should be consulted.  A thorough understanding of the QuickTime container format and its metadata structures is invaluable.  Furthermore, tools such as `mediainfo` can be used to inspect the metadata of the input file to identify potential inconsistencies or problems.  Exploring online forums dedicated to FFmpeg can provide practical guidance on similar issues and solutions others have discovered.  Finally, mastering command-line debugging techniques is beneficial in identifying the precise source of rendering problems.
