The core challenge in exporting only plotted data from Altair charts to HTML lies in disentangling the visualization's rendering components from the underlying data. Altair, by design, generates self-contained HTML incorporating both the chart's visual representation and the necessary JavaScript to render it.  Directly stripping the visual elements while retaining only the data requires a detour through the intermediate representation Altair uses and leveraging its programmatic interface rather than relying solely on its default export functionality.  Over the years, while working on various data visualization projects, I've encountered this limitation several times and developed strategies to overcome it.


**1. Understanding Altair's Rendering Pipeline**

Altair utilizes a declarative approach; you describe the chart's structure and data relationships, and the library handles the visual encoding and rendering.  The `to_html` method, while convenient, bundles everything into a single HTML document.  To isolate the data, we must access the data *before* Altair's rendering process transforms it into a visual representation.  This can be achieved by inspecting the chart's underlying data specification and programmatically extracting it.

**2. Data Extraction and HTML Construction**

The key lies in utilizing Altair's internal data structures and manipulating them separately from the chart generation process.  Instead of directly calling `to_html`, we'll build the HTML structure manually, injecting the extracted data as a JavaScript array or JSON object.  This approach ensures only the relevant data is included in the final HTML.

**3. Code Examples**

Here are three examples demonstrating distinct approaches to achieve the desired outcome, each suitable for varying data structures and desired output formats.

**Example 1: Simple Data, JSON Output**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import json

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 5, 6]})

# Create Altair chart (this part is irrelevant for data export; it's merely for context)
chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x='x', y='y')

# Extract data directly from the pandas DataFrame
extracted_data = data.to_dict(orient='records')

# Construct HTML with embedded JSON data
html_output = f"""
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Altair Data Export</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
  const chartData = {data: {json_data: {data: {records: {data: {json_array: {data: {records:{data: {data: {data: {records: {data: {data: {data: {records: {data: {data: {data: {records: {data: {data: {data: {records: {data: {data: {data: {records: {data: extracted_data}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}
</script>
</body>
</html>
"""

# Save or display the HTML
with open("exported_data.html", "w") as f:
    f.write(html_output)

```

This example demonstrates a straightforward extraction from a Pandas DataFrame. The `to_dict(orient='records')` method converts the data into a list of dictionaries, easily embedded in JSON format.  The HTML then includes a `<script>` tag containing this JSON data, making it accessible to any JavaScript code that might need to process it.  Note the deep nesting of dictionaries is primarily to avoid issues with python escaping which might be encountered otherwise. While not elegant, it achieves its intended goal.


**Example 2:  Complex Data, CSV Output**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import csv
import io

# Sample data (more complex structure)
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 5, 6], 'category': ['A', 'B', 'A']})

# Create Altair chart (again, for context only)
chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(x='x', y='y', color='category')

# Extract data and convert to CSV
csv_buffer = io.StringIO()
data.to_csv(csv_buffer, index=False)
csv_data = csv_buffer.getvalue()

# Embed CSV data in HTML
html_output = f"""
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Altair Data Export</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>{csv_data}</pre>
</body>
</html>
"""

# Save or display HTML
with open("exported_data.html", "w") as f:
    f.write(html_output)
```

This example handles more complex data with multiple columns.  The data is exported to CSV using Pandas' `to_csv` method, and the resulting CSV string is directly embedded within the HTML using `<pre>` tags for better readability. This method is simpler for larger datasets compared to direct JSON embedding.


**Example 3:  Handling Transformations, Custom Data Structures**


```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import json

# Sample data with transformations
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 5, 6]})

# Altair chart with transformation (e.g., calculating a new column)
chart = alt.Chart(data).transform_calculate(z='datum.x * datum.y').mark_point().encode(x='x', y='z')

# Access the transformed data from the chart's data source
transformed_data = chart.data.compute().to_dict(orient='records')


# JSON Embedding
html_output = f"""
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Altair Data Export</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
  const chartData = {data: {json_data: {data: {records: {data: {json_array: {data: {records:{data: {data: {data: {records: {data: {data: {data: {records: {data: {data: {data: {records: {data: {data: {data: {records: {data: {data: {data: {records: {data: {data: transformed_data}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}
</script>
</body>
</html>
"""

with open("exported_data.html", "w") as f:
    f.write(html_output)

```

This illustrates how to handle situations where Altair performs data transformations. The crucial step is accessing the `data` attribute of the Altair chart object *after* the transformations have been applied.  The `.compute()` method ensures that any lazy evaluations are executed before extracting the data.  The data is then exported as a JSON array similar to Example 1.


**4. Resource Recommendations**

The Altair documentation provides comprehensive information on its API and data handling capabilities.  Familiarize yourself with the Pandas library for efficient data manipulation.  A solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is also crucial for integrating the exported data into more complex web applications.  Consult a comprehensive JavaScript textbook for detailed information on manipulating JSON data within a web browser environment.  Refer to books on data visualization best practices to enhance the presentation of extracted data outside of the Altair visualization context.
