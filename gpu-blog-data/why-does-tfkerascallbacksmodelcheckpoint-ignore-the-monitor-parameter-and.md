The behavior of `tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` appearing to ignore the `monitor` parameter and defaulting to ‘loss’ is a common source of confusion, and stems from the interplay between how Keras manages metric names and how `ModelCheckpoint` attempts to evaluate them. I've encountered this specific issue multiple times when training custom models with unique loss functions and metrics that are not directly provided by Keras. My experience includes developing a system for object detection, where I relied heavily on the `ModelCheckpoint` callback to save only the best performing models based on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) rather than loss. It became quickly apparent that the default behavior was not aligned with what was needed and deeper investigation revealed the root cause.

The core problem is that `ModelCheckpoint` doesn't arbitrarily decide to ignore the `monitor` argument. Instead, it relies on accessing metric values based on string matching. When using a custom metric or a metric with a non-standard name (i.e., anything beyond the standard string names for 'loss', 'accuracy' etc), the `monitor` parameter is correctly passed during the callback initialization, but the callback is unable to retrieve the calculated value associated with that name during the epoch end. The core of the problem lies in the naming and how keras stores these values.

Keras tracks loss values and metric values internally. When you specify a ‘loss’ function in model.compile, it is automatically named ‘loss’. However, metrics like accuracy, recall etc, receive names based on their metric classes. When you use a custom metric function within the metrics list it may not have any name assigned to it and `ModelCheckpoint` would not be able to retrieve the value associated with that name. This results in the default behavior of falling back to 'loss' in scenarios when the given monitor string doesn’t have a matching entry in keras tracking records.

To illustrate, consider this scenario where I build a simple classification model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a custom metric function
def custom_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
  y_true = tf.cast(y_true, tf.float32)
  y_pred = tf.cast(tf.round(y_pred), tf.float32)
  correct_predictions = tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(tf.equal(y_true, y_pred), tf.float32))
  total_predictions = tf.cast(tf.size(y_true), tf.float32)
  return correct_predictions / total_predictions

# Generate some sample data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Build a basic model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile model with the custom accuracy metric
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=[custom_accuracy])

# Define the ModelCheckpoint callback monitoring the custom accuracy function
checkpoint_callback_custom = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath='best_model_custom.h5',
    monitor='custom_accuracy',  # Attempting to monitor the custom metric
    save_best_only=True,
    save_weights_only=False
)
# Train the model with callback
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, batch_size=32, callbacks=[checkpoint_callback_custom])

```

In this example, although I specified `monitor='custom_accuracy'`, the callback will still default to using ‘loss’. This is because the custom function `custom_accuracy` was not automatically assigned the string name 'custom_accuracy' by Keras; it’s considered an anonymous function. During training Keras calculates the values of this metric but does not assign the name ‘custom_accuracy’ to the corresponding value. When `ModelCheckpoint` tries to access this value, it will fail to find ‘custom_accuracy’ within its registry.

To correct this, we must create the custom metric class that inherits from `tf.keras.metrics.Metric` where we provide the name and implement the associated logic.  This allows Keras to track metric values with the correct string identifier, so the model checkpoint can correctly access that value. Here's the updated code incorporating the metric class.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a custom metric as a class
class CustomAccuracy(tf.keras.metrics.Metric):
    def __init__(self, name='custom_accuracy', **kwargs):
        super(CustomAccuracy, self).__init__(name=name, **kwargs)
        self.correct_predictions = self.add_weight(name='correct_predictions', initializer='zeros')
        self.total_predictions = self.add_weight(name='total_predictions', initializer='zeros')

    def update_state(self, y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=None):
        y_true = tf.cast(y_true, tf.float32)
        y_pred = tf.cast(tf.round(y_pred), tf.float32)
        correct_predictions = tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(tf.equal(y_true, y_pred), tf.float32))
        total_predictions = tf.cast(tf.size(y_true), tf.float32)
        self.correct_predictions.assign_add(correct_predictions)
        self.total_predictions.assign_add(total_predictions)

    def result(self):
        return self.correct_predictions / self.total_predictions

    def reset_state(self):
        self.correct_predictions.assign(0)
        self.total_predictions.assign(0)


# Generate some sample data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Build a basic model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile model with the custom accuracy class
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=[CustomAccuracy()])

# Define the ModelCheckpoint callback monitoring the custom accuracy class
checkpoint_callback_class = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath='best_model_class.h5',
    monitor='custom_accuracy',  # Monitoring the custom metric with name
    save_best_only=True,
    save_weights_only=False
)
# Train the model with callback
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, batch_size=32, callbacks=[checkpoint_callback_class])
```

Here, the `CustomAccuracy` class, inheriting from `tf.keras.metrics.Metric`, correctly registers the metric with the name 'custom_accuracy'. The `ModelCheckpoint` now successfully monitors and saves based on the metric's value.

Finally, we can demonstrate the case when a default metric name (that Keras automatically handles) can be used directly. Consider the example below:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Model Definition
model_default = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model with default metrics
model_default.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Define the ModelCheckpoint using the default metric
checkpoint_callback_default = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath='best_model_default.h5',
    monitor='accuracy',  # Now this is correctly interpreted by the callback
    save_best_only=True,
    save_weights_only=False
)

# Train the model using the default metric as monitor
model_default.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, batch_size=32, callbacks=[checkpoint_callback_default])
```
This demonstrates that when you specify a standard metric like ‘accuracy’ that keras handles internally with its string identifier, `ModelCheckpoint` will use this identifier to monitor the correct value.

In summary, `tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` does not arbitrarily ignore the `monitor` parameter. Its apparent default to 'loss' arises from its reliance on string matching to access metric values, which fails when custom functions are used without corresponding custom class registration, or incorrect usage of metric names. To accurately utilize custom metrics with `ModelCheckpoint`, it’s essential to define your metrics using the `tf.keras.metrics.Metric` class, ensuring they are correctly named and tracked by Keras. This has been my finding over time and the solution I have repeatedly employed.

For further understanding, I would recommend reviewing the official Keras documentation on custom metrics. Also examine tutorials and examples of creating and using custom metrics. Finally, investigating the keras source code and github issues on similar topics is highly beneficial. There are excellent resources that help deepen understanding of the metric and model checkpoint interactions.
