PyTorch's flexibility enables complex tensor manipulations, yet performing a mean along a specified axis using dynamic indices and controlling gradient flow requires careful application of its core functions. The naive approach of directly indexing and averaging often fails to account for broadcasting rules or inadvertently includes elements in gradient computations when they should be detached. My experience building custom loss functions for sequence models frequently demanded this precise operation, and a nuanced understanding of `torch.gather`, masking, and `torch.no_grad` is key.

The core challenge stems from the fact that indexing with a separate integer tensor, unlike simple slicing, doesn't guarantee a direct, memory-contiguous view that a standard mean operation can handle. We can't rely on typical tensor broadcasting for alignment. Consider a scenario where you have a tensor `data` of shape `[batch, seq_length, features]` and another tensor `indices` of shape `[batch, num_indices]` containing the specific indices within the `seq_length` dimension from which to extract data for computing the mean. A simple `data[:, indices]` is incorrect for calculating the mean as it results in a tensor of shape `[batch, num_indices, features]`. This does not reflect the result of taking a mean *along* `seq_length` with the help of a separate index tensor. This is where we need to gather values and use a mask. `torch.gather` can collect the required values, but it does not perform mean itself.

A critical aspect is controlling gradient flow. Certain parts of the operation, particularly the index extraction and related masking, should ideally not be part of the computation graph. This is because the indices are often determined by external factors like argmax operations or other discrete choices. Backpropagation should focus on optimizing the `data` tensor, not the indices. We accomplish this by explicitly detaching the relevant tensors with `torch.no_grad`.

Let's consider code example one:

```python
import torch

def mean_along_axis_with_indices_v1(data, indices):
    """Computes the mean along axis 1 of `data` using `indices`,
    detached from the computational graph.

    Args:
        data (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [batch, seq_length, features].
        indices (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [batch, num_indices].

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Tensor of shape [batch, features].
    """

    batch_size, seq_length, features = data.shape
    _, num_indices = indices.shape

    with torch.no_grad():
        # Prepare index tensors for torch.gather
        batch_indices = torch.arange(batch_size).view(-1, 1).repeat(1, num_indices)
        batch_indices = batch_indices.to(data.device)

        # Create the index tensor of the same shape of the data to collect
        gather_indices = torch.stack((batch_indices, indices), dim = -1)
        # Re-arrange the batch and the indexes to perform gather on axis 1
        gather_indices = gather_indices.reshape(batch_size, 1, -1, 2)
        gather_indices = gather_indices.repeat(1,features,1,1)
        gather_indices = gather_indices.reshape(batch_size, features, -1, 2)
        gather_indices = gather_indices.permute(0,1,3,2)
        gather_indices = gather_indices.reshape(batch_size, features, -1)
        gather_indices_x = gather_indices[:, :, 0]
        gather_indices_y = gather_indices[:, :, 1]
        gather_indices_z = torch.zeros_like(gather_indices_x).to(data.device)

        # Index to form the batch dimension and the second dimension
        gather_indices_for_dim1 = torch.stack((gather_indices_x, gather_indices_y, gather_indices_z), dim = 0).permute(1,2,0)
        gather_indices_for_dim1 = gather_indices_for_dim1.reshape(batch_size, 1, num_indices, 3)

        # Build the required matrix to perform gather along axis 1
        gather_indices_for_dim1 = gather_indices_for_dim1.repeat(1, features, 1, 1)
        gather_indices_for_dim1 = gather_indices_for_dim1.reshape(batch_size,features*num_indices, 3)
        data_gathered = torch.gather(data, 1, gather_indices_for_dim1[:,:,1].long().view(batch_size, -1, 1).repeat(1,1,features) )
        data_gathered = data_gathered.reshape(batch_size, num_indices, features)

    mean_result = torch.mean(data_gathered, dim=1)
    return mean_result

# Example usage
data = torch.randn(4, 7, 5, requires_grad=True)
indices = torch.randint(0, 7, (4, 3))
result = mean_along_axis_with_indices_v1(data, indices)
print(result.shape) # Output: torch.Size([4, 5])
```

In this example, I start by setting up the index tensors necessary for the `torch.gather` function which essentially collects the values from the third dimension as specified by the `indices`. To do this, the `batch_indices` is built which is essentially a sequence number to specify the batch that the index is referring to. Then the final index to pass to gather is constructed in such a way as to provide the (batch, index, feature) information. Note that the `torch.no_grad()` context ensures that gradients are not computed for the indexing operations. After this the mean is computed across the `num_indices` dimension, generating the tensor of the expected size. This version handles gradient detachment well but might be considered verbose.

Let's now examine an optimized version using a mask for a more efficient method:

```python
import torch

def mean_along_axis_with_indices_v2(data, indices):
    """Computes the mean along axis 1 of `data` using `indices` and masking,
    detached from the computational graph.

    Args:
        data (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [batch, seq_length, features].
        indices (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [batch, num_indices].

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Tensor of shape [batch, features].
    """
    batch_size, seq_length, features = data.shape
    _, num_indices = indices.shape

    with torch.no_grad():
        # Create mask
        mask = torch.zeros(batch_size, seq_length, dtype=torch.bool, device=data.device)
        batch_idx = torch.arange(batch_size).unsqueeze(1).to(data.device)
        mask[batch_idx, indices] = True

    # Apply mask and compute mean
    masked_data = data.masked_fill(~mask.unsqueeze(-1), 0)
    mean_result = masked_data.sum(dim=1) / mask.sum(dim=1, keepdim=True)
    return mean_result


# Example usage
data = torch.randn(4, 7, 5, requires_grad=True)
indices = torch.randint(0, 7, (4, 3))
result = mean_along_axis_with_indices_v2(data, indices)
print(result.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([4, 5])
```

This version, `mean_along_axis_with_indices_v2`, uses a boolean mask instead of `torch.gather`. Inside the `torch.no_grad()` block a mask is created. It is essentially a boolean tensor where `True` corresponds to the selected indices for each batch. This mask is then applied to the data with `masked_fill`, setting the non-selected values to zero, which ensures that the `sum` operation only sums the required values. Finally, we divide by the sum of the mask along the second axis to obtain the average. This version is significantly more concise and often faster than the `gather` based solution. Itâ€™s also more easily extended to cover more complex cases.

A third approach is based on one-hot encoding of the indices.

```python
import torch

def mean_along_axis_with_indices_v3(data, indices):
    """Computes the mean along axis 1 of `data` using one-hot encoding,
    detached from the computational graph.

    Args:
        data (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [batch, seq_length, features].
        indices (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [batch, num_indices].

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Tensor of shape [batch, features].
    """
    batch_size, seq_length, features = data.shape

    with torch.no_grad():
        # Create one-hot encoding for the indices
        one_hot_indices = torch.zeros(batch_size, seq_length, dtype=torch.float, device=data.device)
        batch_indices = torch.arange(batch_size).to(data.device).unsqueeze(1)
        one_hot_indices[batch_indices, indices] = 1.0
    
    # Apply one-hot encoding to the data and compute the mean
    mean_result = torch.matmul(one_hot_indices.unsqueeze(1), data).squeeze(1) / one_hot_indices.sum(dim=1, keepdim=True)
    
    return mean_result

# Example usage
data = torch.randn(4, 7, 5, requires_grad=True)
indices = torch.randint(0, 7, (4, 3))
result = mean_along_axis_with_indices_v3(data, indices)
print(result.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([4, 5])
```

`mean_along_axis_with_indices_v3` converts the index to one-hot encoding, which it multiplies with data and computes the mean. In this approach, the indices are one-hot encoded inside the `torch.no_grad()` block. Multiplying this one-hot encoding to `data` is equivalent to gathering the values. After the matrix multiplication, the mean is calculated by dividing by the sum of the one-hot encoding along the second axis. This method is also concise and tends to be computationally efficient because of its reliance on highly optimized matrix operations.

For further study, I would suggest consulting the PyTorch documentation on `torch.gather`, tensor indexing, and automatic differentiation. The official tutorials on tensor manipulation and advanced autograd can also prove invaluable. Additionally, exploring community forums can provide practical insights into how others have approached similar problems. Lastly, experimentation with various tensor sizes and indices is crucial to solidify one's comprehension and gain practical experience with edge cases. Understanding the trade-offs between memory footprint and computation speed for different approaches is also essential.
