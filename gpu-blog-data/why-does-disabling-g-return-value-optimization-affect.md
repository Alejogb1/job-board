The performance discrepancy observed when disabling g++ return value optimization (RVO) specifically impacts the last constructor call for temporary references due to the compiler's inability to elide the copy or move construction.  My experience debugging memory-intensive C++ applications over the past decade has repeatedly highlighted this behavior.  RVO is a crucial optimization that directly affects how temporary objects created within functions are handled, and its absence forces explicit object creation and destruction, leading to observable performance penalties.

**1. Explanation:**

When a function returns an object by value, the compiler typically performs RVO.  This avoids the creation of a temporary object on the stack and the subsequent copy or move construction into the caller's variable.  Instead, the compiler constructs the object directly in the memory location designated for the caller's variable. This optimization is particularly beneficial for large objects or objects with expensive constructors.

However, disabling RVO, often done through compiler flags like `-fno-elide-constructors`, forces the compiler to follow the standard object lifetime rules.  In the context of temporary references, this means the function will construct a temporary object on the stack. This temporary object then undergoes either a copy or move construction into the caller's reference, depending on whether the object's class defines a move constructor.

This extra construction and destruction step is computationally expensive.  The cost is especially noticeable for the *last* call in a sequence of calls, primarily due to the accumulation of these overhead operations.  Previous calls might have been optimized regardless of the RVO flag, particularly if they are not constructing temporaries but assigning to existing objects, or if the compiler can apply other optimizations such as copy elision in other contexts.  The last call, however, frequently involves returning a temporary object, directly affected by the absence of RVO.  The compilerâ€™s inability to optimize this final creation triggers the performance hit.  Furthermore, if the destructor is computationally expensive, the cost is amplified.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples demonstrate the impact of RVO on a simple class with an expensive constructor and destructor.  These examples illustrate the difference between RVO enabled and disabled.  For clarity, the "expensive operation" is simulated with a simple loop; in reality, this could be a complex computation or I/O operation.


**Example 1: RVO Enabled (Optimized)**

```c++
#include <iostream>

class ExpensiveObject {
public:
  ExpensiveObject() {
    std::cout << "Constructor called\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i); // Simulate expensive operation
  }
  ExpensiveObject(const ExpensiveObject&) {
    std::cout << "Copy constructor called\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i); // Simulate expensive operation
  }
  ExpensiveObject(ExpensiveObject&&) noexcept {
    std::cout << "Move constructor called\n";
  }
  ~ExpensiveObject() {
    std::cout << "Destructor called\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i); // Simulate expensive operation
  }
};

ExpensiveObject createExpensiveObject() {
  return ExpensiveObject();
}

int main() {
  ExpensiveObject obj = createExpensiveObject();
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, with RVO enabled (the default behavior for most compilers), you will only see one "Constructor called" and one "Destructor called" message. The compiler directly constructs the object `obj` within `main()`, avoiding the temporary object and its associated copy or move.


**Example 2: RVO Disabled (Unoptimized)**

```c++
#include <iostream>

// ExpensiveObject class remains the same as in Example 1

ExpensiveObject createExpensiveObject() {
  return ExpensiveObject();
}

int main() {
    ExpensiveObject obj = createExpensiveObject();
    return 0;
}
```

Compile this example with `-fno-elide-constructors`. Now, you will observe a "Constructor called", a "Move constructor called" (or "Copy constructor called" depending on your compiler and optimization level), and a "Destructor called" for the temporary object, and then another "Destructor called" for `obj`  This illustrates the overhead introduced by the absence of RVO. The performance difference becomes significant with more complex objects and repeated calls.


**Example 3: Multiple Calls, RVO Disabled**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// ExpensiveObject class remains the same as in Example 1

ExpensiveObject createExpensiveObject() {
  return ExpensiveObject();
}

int main() {
  std::vector<ExpensiveObject> objects;
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    objects.emplace_back(createExpensiveObject());
  }
  return 0;
}
```


Compiling this with `-fno-elide-constructors` further amplifies the performance issue.  Each call to `createExpensiveObject()` will incur the cost of creating a temporary, moving/copying it, and then destroying the temporary, ten times over. The impact on performance is clearly noticeable due to the repeated object creation and destruction.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  The C++ Programming Language (Stroustrup) - For a comprehensive understanding of C++ language features and object lifetime.
* Effective Modern C++ (Scott Meyers) -  For best practices in modern C++ programming, including object construction and optimization techniques.
* More Effective C++ (Scott Meyers) - Similar to above, focusing on improving code efficiency.
*  A good compiler's documentation: Consult your compiler's documentation for details on optimization flags and their effects on specific compiler behavior.  Understanding the compiler's optimization strategies is paramount in diagnosing performance bottlenecks.


Understanding the implications of RVO and its disabling is crucial for optimizing C++ code, particularly when dealing with complex objects and performance-sensitive applications.  My experience has repeatedly shown that overlooking this subtle point leads to unexpected performance regressions, especially when working with a large number of temporary objects.  The provided examples and recommended resources offer a solid foundation for further investigation and mitigation of similar issues.
