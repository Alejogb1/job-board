TensorFlow 2.x's seemingly slower GPU performance relative to CPU expectations often stems from inadequate configuration or inefficient code, rather than inherent limitations of the framework itself.  My experience troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in large-scale image classification projects has consistently revealed that the perceived underperformance originates from several common pitfalls, which I'll detail here.  I've personally witnessed projects exhibiting a 10x performance discrepancy between anticipated GPU acceleration and actual results, all stemming from correctable errors.

**1. Inadequate GPU Memory Management:**

The most frequent cause of suboptimal performance is insufficient GPU memory allocation.  TensorFlow, by default, attempts to allocate memory dynamically. While convenient, this approach can lead to frequent memory swaps between GPU and system RAM (page swapping), drastically slowing computation.  For large datasets or complex models, explicitly allocating sufficient GPU memory becomes crucial.  This requires understanding your model's memory footprint – the total memory required for weights, activations, and intermediate calculations.  Tools like `nvidia-smi` are essential for monitoring GPU memory usage.  Failing to allocate enough memory forces TensorFlow to fall back on CPU computations for parts of the process, thereby negating the advantage of the GPU.

**2. Inefficient Data Pipelining:**

Efficient data transfer between CPU and GPU is vital for optimal performance.  Slow data loading and preprocessing significantly impact overall speed.  TensorFlow's `tf.data` API offers tools for building efficient input pipelines, but improper usage can lead to bottlenecks.  Failure to utilize features like prefetching, batching, and parallel data loading will result in the GPU spending significant time idle, waiting for data.  This often manifests as low GPU utilization reported by monitoring tools.  The GPU's massive parallel processing capabilities are wasted if it receives data sporadically.  A well-constructed data pipeline should ensure a continuous stream of data to maximize GPU occupancy.

**3.  Incorrect CUDA and cuDNN Installation:**

The CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library are essential for enabling GPU acceleration in TensorFlow.  An incorrect or incomplete installation is a common source of performance problems.  Inconsistencies between TensorFlow's version and the CUDA/cuDNN versions can cause errors ranging from compilation failures to subtle performance regressions.  One must meticulously verify compatibility between these components, ensuring their alignment with the operating system and the specific GPU hardware.  I've personally encountered situations where a seemingly minor version mismatch led to a substantial performance hit, completely nullifying any GPU advantage.  This often involves checking drivers, reinstalling libraries, and verifying the installation process thoroughly.

**4.  Lack of Kernel Optimization:**

TensorFlow utilizes highly optimized kernels for various operations. However, the default kernels might not be optimal for all scenarios.  Custom kernel implementations, tailored to specific hardware and data types, can significantly improve performance.  This involves a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's internals and familiarity with CUDA programming.  While demanding expertise, custom kernels offer the potential for substantial performance gains for computationally intensive operations like convolutions.  During my work on a real-time object detection project, carefully crafted kernels were essential to meet stringent latency requirements.

**Code Examples:**


**Example 1: Efficient Data Pipelining with `tf.data`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)  # Replace 'data' with your data
dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size).prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

# preprocess_function:  Your data preprocessing function

# AUTOTUNE dynamically adjusts the number of parallel calls
# batch_size: the batch size suitable for your GPU memory
# buffer_size:  Sets the prefetch buffer size.
```
This example demonstrates efficient data prefetching and parallel processing using `tf.data`, ensuring the GPU remains busy.  Ignoring `AUTOTUNE` and `prefetch` often leads to significant performance degradation.


**Example 2:  Explicit GPU Memory Allocation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        tf.config.experimental.set_virtual_device_configuration(
            gpus[0],
            [tf.config.experimental.VirtualDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=memory_limit)]) # Set memory limit in MB
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)

# ... your TensorFlow model building and training code here ...
```
This code explicitly limits GPU memory allocation to `memory_limit` MB.  Experimentation is crucial to determine the optimal memory allocation for a specific hardware configuration and model size.  Improper setting can lead to out-of-memory errors or still not utilize the GPU efficiently if set too high.


**Example 3:  Profiling for Bottleneck Identification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
profiler = tf.profiler.Profiler(graph) #graph is your TF graph or session
profile_options = tf.profiler.ProfileOptionBuilder.float_operation()

# ... Run your model  ...

profiler.profile(options=profile_options)
profiler.save()
# Analyze profiler output to identify performance bottlenecks
```
TensorFlow's profiler can identify performance bottlenecks within the model itself. This code illustrates the basic profiling process; analysis of the profiler's output is crucial for targeted optimization.  I've personally used this to identify computationally expensive layers needing re-architecture or custom kernel implementation.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation,  the CUDA Toolkit documentation, the cuDNN library documentation, and  performance profiling guides specific to your GPU hardware are crucial resources.  Furthermore, books and online courses focused on high-performance computing and GPU programming will be invaluable.  Consider exploring various GPU profiling tools beyond TensorFlow's integrated profiler to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the GPU’s performance characteristics.  Understanding these resources allows for effective troubleshooting and optimization.
