TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset` not automatically repeating indefinitely when iterated through is an intentional design choice, rooted in its fundamental purpose of representing finite datasets and enabling controlled training loops. Failing to explicitly specify repetition can lead to unexpected behavior during training, where a model might prematurely terminate due to data exhaustion, hence why it can appear to "fail" without a warning, especially for users expecting an infinite generator.

The core concept behind a `tf.data.Dataset` revolves around representing a sequence of data elements, rather than a continuously yielding stream. By default, when you iterate over a dataset, such as through `for element in dataset:` or by extracting batches using `dataset.batch(batch_size)`, the iterator progresses through the underlying data once. Once it reaches the end of the defined sequence, the iteration terminates. This behavior is consistent with how datasets are typically employed: for training a model over a defined, often finite, training set. The iterator simply does not automatically reset or restart. This mechanism prevents unintended infinite loops and keeps computations within defined boundaries.

The absence of an explicit infinite loop through implicit repetition is not a bug but a feature. It forces a programmer to make deliberate decisions regarding data looping, and how training should conclude. For instance, if a dataset is intended to represent just a single epoch of training, the lack of repetition allows the training code to terminate after that single pass through the dataset. This design contrasts with some generator-based approaches where an infinite yielding stream is the default.

The way TensorFlow handles the end of a dataset also differs slightly based on how you're using it. When iterating through a dataset directly using the `for` loop as described above, the loop will simply terminate without throwing an exception. However, if you're pulling batches or elements using `dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()` or `dataset.get_next()`, a more formal `tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` is raised upon data exhaustion. This exception allows you to catch the condition and handle any actions that you need to perform after one pass, such as checkpointing or re-evaluating the model. The `OutOfRangeError` is more common during custom training loops or when using a `tf.data.Iterator`. It is crucial to manage this outcome when building training loops outside of TensorFlow's typical keras `model.fit` API.

To achieve continuous, looping behavior for iterative learning methods like gradient descent, one has to explicitly tell TensorFlow that you want the dataset to repeat. The `tf.data.Dataset.repeat()` method is provided specifically for this purpose. When used without arguments, it causes the dataset to be repeated infinitely. When it takes an integer, it repeats for only that number of epochs. It returns a new dataset which, when iterated, continues to yield the original sequence repeatedly.

Here are a few examples to clarify these points, including comments regarding behaviors, and how to handle the lack of default repetition.

**Example 1: Demonstrating Single Iteration**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple dataset from a list
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)

print("First Iteration:")
for element in dataset:
  print(element.numpy())

print("Second Iteration:")
for element in dataset:
    print(element.numpy())
```
*Commentary:* This code creates a basic dataset from a list of numbers. The first `for` loop will iterate through all elements and output them. The second loop demonstrates that, without calling `repeat()` on the dataset, the iteration does not reset or start from the beginning. It will output nothing, illustrating the single iteration behavior. It simply terminates.

**Example 2: Introducing `repeat()` for Infinite Iteration**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple dataset from a list
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data).repeat() #repeat() without arguments == infinite repeat.

iterator = iter(dataset) #this does not "consume" the data. it simply enables iteration.

print("Iterations via iterator:")

for _ in range(10): # iterate 10 times.
  element = next(iterator)
  print(element.numpy())

```
*Commentary:* In this example, the `repeat()` method is applied without arguments to create a dataset that will infinitely repeat the original sequence. The `iterator = iter(dataset)` creates an explicit Python iterator from the dataset.  By using this iterator object within the `for` loop and `next(iterator)`, we obtain elements sequentially, which demonstrates that the data iterates repeatedly and the process can go on forever.  The loop is broken once the finite range has been met. This is a key way to use a dataset within the training loop, especially if you're not using `model.fit()`.

**Example 3: Handling `OutOfRangeError` with an Iterator**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple dataset from a list
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
get_next = iterator.get_next()

print("Iterating with one shot iterator")

with tf.Session() as sess:
  while True:
      try:
          element = sess.run(get_next)
          print(element)
      except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
          print("End of dataset reached.")
          break
```
*Commentary:* This example demonstrates how to extract elements with a "one-shot iterator" which is constructed through `dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()`. In this way of retrieving data, data exhaustion results in an exception, `tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` being raised. This contrasts with the prior examples where the iteration of the dataset simply terminates silently. The `try/except` block within a TensorFlow session shows how one can manage this explicit error, often signaling the end of a training epoch. This method is not recommended for new development, however, it demonstrates the historical nuances of dataset handling in TensorFlow. New code using `tf.data` will likely not use sessions.

Understanding that a `tf.data.Dataset` is a finite sequence unless configured to repeat, avoids unexpected training behavior. The intentional lack of default repetition allows developers granular control over data looping, and the explicit management of exceptions (when using iterators) allows to develop more robust training pipelines.

For further information and a deeper understanding of `tf.data` pipelines, I suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation regarding the `tf.data` API. This documentation provides comprehensive details on all methods, performance optimization, and best practices. Additionally, the TensorFlow Guide on data input pipelines provides a general overview of building efficient pipelines, including repetition techniques. Finally, tutorials focusing on custom training loops in TensorFlow also contain numerous useful code patterns and specific use-cases, including how to use these various iterators. These resources provide the needed background to fully understand and utilize TensorFlow datasets, and manage them effectively.
