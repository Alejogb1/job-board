The core issue with NuGet dependencies not deploying correctly to AWS Elastic Beanstalk from Visual Studio 2013 often stems from misconfigurations within the project's deployment settings and, less frequently, from limitations in the older Visual Studio version itself.  My experience troubleshooting this for a large-scale e-commerce application pointed directly to the .NET deployment package's composition.  Specifically, the default behavior of Visual Studio 2013's publishing mechanism doesn't always correctly include the necessary NuGet packages within the deployment package. This is distinct from simply having the packages present in the project's local directory;  they need to be explicitly packaged for deployment.


**1. Explanation:**

Visual Studio 2013's publishing process for Web Application Projects (WAPs) and Web Deployment Projects (WDPs) relies heavily on the project's configuration files and the chosen deployment method.  The crucial aspect is that the NuGet packages, which reside in the `packages` folder, are not automatically included in the deployment package unless specifically instructed. This is different from later Visual Studio versions which often implicitly include them.  This omission leads to runtime errors within the Elastic Beanstalk environment as the application cannot find the required assemblies.

The problem is further compounded by the fact that Elastic Beanstalk's deployment process expects a self-contained deployment package.  This means all necessary dependencies, including those from NuGet, must reside within the deployment package itself.  Simply having the packages locally available during development is insufficient.

Several factors can contribute to this problem:

* **Incorrect Publishing Profile:** The deployment profile used in Visual Studio might lack the necessary settings to include the `packages` folder or its contents.
* **Deployment Method:** Using methods such as FTP or a custom script might inadvertently omit the `packages` folder.
* **Project Structure:**  Improperly structured projects, especially those relying on legacy deployment methodologies, can interfere with the proper inclusion of dependencies.
* **Build Configuration:** Incorrectly set build configurations (e.g., Debug instead of Release) can cause incomplete package creation.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate how to address the issue by modifying the project's configuration for deployment. These are illustrative; the specific project file structure may vary slightly.


**Example 1: Modifying the .csproj file (MSBuild Approach):**

```xml
<Project ToolsVersion="4.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  ... other project elements ...

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutDir>..\Publish\</OutDir>  <!-- Specify the output directory -->
    <DeployOnBuild>true</DeployOnBuild> <!-- Enable automatic deployment -->
    <CopyAllFilesToSingleFolderForMsdeployDependsOn>true</CopyAllFilesToSingleFolderForMsdeployDependsOn>
    <CopyAllFilesToSingleFolderForMsdeploy>true</CopyAllFilesToSingleFolderForMsdeploy>  <!-- Crucial for including packages -->
  </PropertyGroup>

  <Target Name="CopyNuGetPackages" AfterTargets="Build">
    <Copy SourceFiles="%(Packages.FullPath)" DestinationFolder="$(OutDir)packages" />
  </Target>

  ... other project elements ...
</Project>
```

This modification directly addresses the packaging issue. The `CopyAllFilesToSingleFolderForMsdeploy` property ensures that all files and folders, including the `packages` folder, are included in the deployment package. The custom target `CopyNuGetPackages` provides explicit control over the inclusion of packages and is particularly useful if the packages folder resides outside the main output path.  Note that the `OutDir` is crucial, ensuring everything is in a single location for simpler deployment.

**Example 2: Using a Post-Build Event (Simpler Approach):**

```xml
<Project ToolsVersion="4.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  ... other project elements ...

  <PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>xcopy "$(SolutionDir)packages\" "$(TargetDir)packages\" /s /y</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  ... other project elements ...
</Project>
```

This method utilizes a post-build event to copy the `packages` folder to the output directory after the build process completes. It's simpler than the MSBuild approach but relies on xcopy's availability and might be less robust for complex scenarios.  It is important to ensure that the `packages` folder path is correct relative to the solution directory.


**Example 3:  Custom Deployment Script (Advanced Approach):**

Instead of relying on Visual Studio's built-in deployment mechanism, creating a custom deployment script offers more granular control. This is frequently necessary when dealing with complex dependencies or unusual project structures.  This script would use tools like MSBuild, PowerShell, or other scripting languages to explicitly create the deployment package, ensuring all necessary files, including the NuGet packages, are included.  This approach provides the most flexibility, but it requires greater expertise.

A simplified example using PowerShell might involve:

```powershell
# ...code to build the project...
Copy-Item -Path "$(SolutionDir)packages\" -Destination "$(TargetDir)packages\" -Recurse
# ...code to package and deploy the application...
```

This snippet shows a basic integration of copying the packages folder. A complete script would include more sophisticated logic to handle dependencies, configurations, and deployment to Elastic Beanstalk.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official documentation for AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Visual Studio 2013's deployment features.  Examine the detailed logs produced during the deployment process to identify specific errors.  Explore the MSBuild documentation for a comprehensive understanding of project file modifications.  Finally, review relevant Stack Overflow questions and answers related to NuGet deployment with older Visual Studio versions. Focusing on these resources will allow for a structured approach to troubleshooting.
