MvcMailer's attachment functionality, while seemingly straightforward, often presents subtle complexities stemming from its reliance on underlying email libraries and the nuances of handling different file types and encoding.  My experience troubleshooting attachment issues across numerous projects highlighted the importance of meticulous handling of the `MailMessage` object and careful selection of appropriate encoding strategies to ensure reliable delivery and consistent display across various email clients.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

MvcMailer leverages the .NET `System.Net.Mail` namespace.  Attachments are added to the `MailMessage` instance before the email is sent.  Crucially, MvcMailer's simplicity can mask the underlying complexities of email transmission.  Issues frequently arise from improperly handling file paths, incorrect content types, and insufficient error handling. The core process involves creating a `Attachment` object from a file, setting its content type correctly, and adding it to the `MailMessage` object managed by MvcMailer.  Failure to accurately identify and set the content type can lead to emails being rejected by mail servers or rendered incorrectly by email clients.  Furthermore, handling large attachments requires careful consideration of potential server-side limitations and the impact on email delivery reliability.  Robust error handling is paramount, as network issues or file access problems can interrupt the attachment process.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Attaching a Single File:**

```csharp
using MvcMailer;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.IO;

public class MyMailer : MailerBase
{
    public MailMessage MyEmail(string to, string subject, string body, string filePath)
    {
        To.Add(to);
        Subject = subject;
        Body = body;

        if (File.Exists(filePath))
        {
            Attachment attachment = new Attachment(filePath);
            // Critically important: Determine the content type automatically.
            attachment.ContentType.MediaType = MimeMapping.GetMimeMapping(filePath); 
            Attachments.Add(attachment);
        }
        else
        {
            // Handle file not found gracefully, perhaps by logging the error or sending a fallback email.
            Log.Error($"Attachment file not found: {filePath}");
            //Consider adding a notification to the email body about missing attachment.
            Body += "\n\nNote: An attachment was expected, but could not be found.";
        }

        return Message;
    }
}
```
This example demonstrates the fundamental process.  The key improvement lies in using `MimeMapping.GetMimeMapping` to automatically determine the MIME type, preventing common content type mismatches.  Error handling is included for robustness.

**Example 2: Attaching Multiple Files:**

```csharp
using MvcMailer;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.IO;

public class MyMailer : MailerBase
{
    public MailMessage MyEmailWithMultipleAttachments(string to, string subject, string body, string[] filePaths)
    {
        To.Add(to);
        Subject = subject;
        Body = body;

        foreach (string filePath in filePaths)
        {
            if (File.Exists(filePath))
            {
                Attachment attachment = new Attachment(filePath);
                attachment.ContentType.MediaType = MimeMapping.GetMimeMapping(filePath);
                Attachments.Add(attachment);
            }
            else
            {
                Log.Error($"Attachment file not found: {filePath}");
                Body += $"\n\nNote: Attachment '{filePath}' was not found.";
            }
        }

        return Message;
    }
}
```
This expands on the first example to handle multiple files.  It iterates through an array of file paths, adding each valid file as an attachment.  The error handling is extended to provide feedback for each missing file.  This is crucial for user experience and debugging.

**Example 3: Handling Large Attachments and potential encoding issues:**

```csharp
using MvcMailer;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;

public class MyMailer : MailerBase
{
    public MailMessage SendLargeAttachment(string to, string subject, string body, string filePath, Encoding encoding = null)
    {
        To.Add(to);
        Subject = subject;
        Body = body;

        if (File.Exists(filePath))
        {
            using (var stream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
            {
                Attachment attachment = new Attachment(stream, Path.GetFileName(filePath));
                attachment.ContentType.MediaType = MimeMapping.GetMimeMapping(filePath);
                // Explicitly set encoding if needed to handle special characters.
                if (encoding != null)
                {
                    attachment.TransferEncoding = TransferEncoding.SevenBit; // or other suitable encoding.
                }
                Attachments.Add(attachment);
            }
        }
        else
        {
            Log.Error($"Attachment file not found: {filePath}");
            Body += $"\n\nNote: Attachment '{filePath}' was not found.";
        }

        return Message;
    }
}
```
This example demonstrates handling potentially large attachments by using a `FileStream` to avoid loading the entire file into memory. It also includes an optional encoding parameter to address potential issues with character encoding in specific file types.  This is especially vital when dealing with non-ASCII characters.  The choice of `TransferEncoding` should be based on the email server's and client's capabilities.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   Consult the official .NET documentation on `System.Net.Mail` for detailed information on the `MailMessage` and `Attachment` classes.
*   Explore advanced email sending libraries that might offer more robust features and error handling than MvcMailer's built-in capabilities.
*   Examine email server logs for detailed information on any delivery failures that might be related to attachments.  Specific error codes will provide valuable clues.  Pay close attention to size limitations and accepted content types.


Remember, consistent and thorough testing across various email clients is critical to ensure compatibility and reliable attachment delivery.  The examples above provide a foundation, but the specific requirements will vary depending on the project's needs and the nature of the attachments being handled.  Always prioritize error handling and logging for improved debugging and maintenance.
