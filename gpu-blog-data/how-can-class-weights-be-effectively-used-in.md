Handling class imbalance in multi-label binary classification with temporal data requires careful consideration beyond simply applying class weights.  My experience working on anomaly detection in financial time series highlighted the crucial interaction between temporal dependencies and class weighting strategies.  Improper weighting can lead to overfitting on the majority class within specific temporal contexts, even if overall class frequencies are addressed.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

In multi-label binary classification, each data point belongs to multiple binary classes simultaneously.  Temporal data introduces the additional complexity of sequential dependencies, where the prediction for a given time step might depend heavily on preceding steps.  Standard class weighting, applied independently to each time step and class, fails to capture these temporal relationships.  For instance, a rare anomaly might only be detectable by considering a sequence of preceding 'normal' data points.  Ignoring temporal context in weight application results in a model that might learn to disregard subtle temporal patterns indicative of the minority class.

Therefore, an effective approach involves incorporating temporal context into the class weight calculation.  This can be achieved by using a weighted loss function that dynamically adjusts the weights based on both the class label and the temporal context within a sequence.  We can achieve this by modifying the loss function during training or by pre-processing the data to emphasize the minority classes in critical temporal contexts.  The former is generally preferred as it adapts better to the nuances of the data.  I've found success using a combination of approaches to mitigate overfitting and improve recall for the minority classes.

Several factors influence the weighting strategy:

* **Class frequency distribution:** The ratio between the number of instances belonging to each class significantly impacts the choice and magnitude of weights.  A simple inverse proportional weighting scheme often works well as a starting point, but careful analysis might necessitate a more sophisticated approach.
* **Temporal correlation:** The degree to which class labels are correlated over time directly influences the weight adjustments.  Strong temporal correlations require a more context-aware weighting strategy than weakly correlated data.
* **Data length:** The length of the temporal sequences impacts computational cost and the effectiveness of different weighting schemes.  Longer sequences might benefit from more sophisticated, computationally expensive methods, whereas shorter sequences might allow for simpler, less computationally demanding approaches.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples demonstrate different weighting strategies within a Keras model for multi-label binary classification with temporal data. I assume the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) like LSTM due to its suitability for temporal data.

**Example 1:  Simple Inverse Class Weighting**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 20, 10) # 100 sequences, 20 timesteps, 10 features
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 5)) # 100 sequences, 5 binary labels

# Calculate class weights
class_counts = np.sum(y_train, axis=0)
class_weights = {i: 1.0 / count if count > 0 else 1.0 for i, count in enumerate(class_counts)}

# Build the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])),
    Dense(5, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model with class weights
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'], sample_weight_mode="temporal")

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, sample_weight=np.tile(np.array([class_weights[i] for i in range(5)]), (X_train.shape[0],1,1)), batch_size=32)
```

This example utilizes simple inverse class weighting.  `sample_weight` is crucial here, allowing time series sample weighting. The weights are calculated based on the inverse of the class frequencies and applied to each time step independently.  This is a basic approach, but it serves as a foundation for more advanced methods.


**Example 2:  Time-Aware Weighting with a Custom Loss Function**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Data and model definition as in Example 1) ...

def time_aware_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    # Example: Weight recent timesteps more heavily
    weights = tf.linspace(1.0, 2.0, y_pred.shape[1]) # Linear increase in weight over time
    weights = tf.reshape(weights, (1, -1, 1))
    weighted_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.reduce_sum(weights * tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_true, logits=y_pred), axis=1))
    return weighted_loss

# Compile the model with the custom loss function
model.compile(loss=time_aware_loss, optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

This example introduces a custom loss function, `time_aware_loss`.  It assigns progressively higher weights to later time steps within each sequence, reflecting the potential importance of recent data.  This accounts for potential temporal dependencies influencing class manifestation.  The `tf.linspace` function creates the time-dependent weights.


**Example 3: Data Augmentation for Temporal Class Imbalance**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# ... (Data and model definition as in Example 1) ...

# Reshape data for SMOTE
X_train_reshaped = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], -1)
y_train_reshaped = y_train.reshape(y_train.shape[0], -1)

# Apply SMOTE for oversampling
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train_reshaped, y_train_reshaped)

# Reshape data back to original shape
X_train_resampled = X_train_resampled.reshape(X_train_resampled.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])
y_train_resampled = y_train_resampled.reshape(y_train_resampled.shape[0], y_train.shape[1])

# Train the model (no class weights needed as data is balanced)
model.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

This approach uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to oversample the minority classes in the training data before training.  It addresses class imbalance directly, but remember to adapt SMOTE for temporal data (hence the reshaping).  This method needs careful consideration for temporal data; inappropriate use can lead to artifacts in the generated samples.
