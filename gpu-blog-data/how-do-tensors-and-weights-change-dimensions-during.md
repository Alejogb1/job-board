The core principle governing dimensional changes during tensor summation, particularly in the context of neural networks, lies in the application of broadcasting and reduction operations.  My experience implementing and optimizing deep learning models, specifically recurrent networks and convolutional autoencoders, has highlighted the crucial role of these operations in managing tensor shapes effectively. Understanding the underlying rules allows for efficient code design and prevents common errors stemming from shape mismatches.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Tensor summation, in its broadest sense, involves combining elements from one or more tensors into a resulting tensor. This combination is not arbitrary; it follows specific rules determined by the operation's type and the tensors' dimensions.  Two primary operations are involved: broadcasting and reduction.

* **Broadcasting:** This mechanism implicitly expands smaller tensors to match the dimensions of a larger tensor before the summation.  The expansion is performed along axes where the dimensions are either 1 or absent (i.e., a scalar).  For instance, adding a scalar (a 0-dimensional tensor) to a vector (a 1-dimensional tensor) broadcasts the scalar to each element of the vector before performing element-wise addition.  Broadcasting rules ensure that the dimensions of involved tensors are compatible before the summation occurs. Incompatibility results in a shape mismatch error.

* **Reduction:** This operation collapses specific dimensions of a tensor.  Summation is a reduction operation where elements along a particular axis are summed to produce a single value. For example, summing along the rows of a matrix (2-dimensional tensor) results in a vector (1-dimensional tensor). The axis along which the reduction is performed defines the output tensor's dimension. Reduction significantly impacts the output shape and is often used to aggregate information from feature maps in convolutional neural networks or to condense hidden states in recurrent neural networks.

The interplay between broadcasting and reduction is key to understanding dimensional changes.  A summation might involve broadcasting to make tensors compatible, followed by a reduction to consolidate the information along certain axes.  The final dimensions of the resulting tensor are determined by which axes remain after reduction and the shapes after broadcasting.  Failure to correctly manage these two operations is a frequent source of debugging in tensor manipulation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

I will use NumPy, a widely used Python library, for these examples, though the underlying principles apply to other frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

**Example 1: Broadcasting and Element-wise Summation**

```python
import numpy as np

# A 2x3 matrix
tensor_a = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                    [4, 5, 6]])

# A 1x3 vector (will be broadcasted)
tensor_b = np.array([7, 8, 9])

# Element-wise summation.  Tensor_b is broadcasted to match tensor_a's shape.
result = tensor_a + tensor_b
print(result)  # Output: [[ 8 10 12], [11 13 15]]
print(result.shape) # Output: (2, 3)
```

This example demonstrates broadcasting. `tensor_b` is implicitly replicated along the first axis to match the shape of `tensor_a`. The element-wise summation results in a tensor of the same shape as `tensor_a`. No dimensions are reduced.

**Example 2: Reduction along an Axis**

```python
import numpy as np

# A 3x4 matrix
tensor_c = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                    [5, 6, 7, 8],
                    [9, 10, 11, 12]])

# Summing along axis 0 (rows): reduces the first dimension.
row_sums = np.sum(tensor_c, axis=0)
print(row_sums)  # Output: [15 18 21 24]
print(row_sums.shape) # Output: (4,)


# Summing along axis 1 (columns): reduces the second dimension.
column_sums = np.sum(tensor_c, axis=1)
print(column_sums)  # Output: [10 26 42]
print(column_sums.shape) # Output: (3,)
```

Here, reduction is applied along different axes. Summing along `axis=0` collapses the rows, resulting in a vector representing column sums. Summing along `axis=1` collapses the columns, producing a vector of row sums.  The resulting dimensions reflect the axes that remain after reduction.

**Example 3:  Combined Broadcasting and Reduction**

```python
import numpy as np

# A 2x3 matrix
tensor_d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                    [4, 5, 6]])

# A scalar (will be broadcasted)
scalar = 10

# Broadcasting the scalar and then reducing along axis 1 (columns)
result = np.sum(tensor_d + scalar, axis=1)
print(result)  # Output: [36 46]
print(result.shape) # Output: (2,)

```
This example combines broadcasting and reduction.  The scalar is broadcasted to every element of `tensor_d`, then the sum is calculated along each column (axis 1). The final result is a 1D array (vector). The shape change reflects broadcasting followed by a dimension reduction.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I suggest consulting comprehensive linear algebra textbooks, specifically those covering matrix and tensor operations.  Additionally, the documentation for NumPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch provide thorough explanations of tensor manipulation functions and broadcasting rules. Carefully studying the examples within those documentation pages will prove invaluable.  Finally, seeking out well-structured online tutorials that focus on practical applications of tensor operations, such as those found in deep learning contexts, will solidify your understanding.  These resources should comprehensively address advanced topics such as handling higher-dimensional tensors and applying more complex reduction operations.  Remember that consistent practice and careful attention to error messages during coding exercises are instrumental to mastering these concepts.
