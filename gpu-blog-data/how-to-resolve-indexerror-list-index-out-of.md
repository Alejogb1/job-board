The `IndexError: list index out of range` in TensorFlow 1.5, often encountered within Python 3.6 data processing pipelines, typically stems from attempting to access an element in a list using an index that exceeds the list's boundaries.  This is a fundamental programming error, exacerbated in TensorFlow by the often complex data structures and asynchronous operations. My experience debugging this in large-scale image recognition projects highlighted the crucial need for robust indexing checks and careful consideration of data shapes.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The error arises because Python lists (and similarly, NumPy arrays, frequently used with TensorFlow) are zero-indexed.  The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.  The last element's index is always one less than the list's length.  Therefore, attempting to access an element using an index equal to or greater than the list's length (`.__len__()`) will invariably trigger the `IndexError`.

Several scenarios can lead to this in TensorFlow 1.5:

* **Incorrect Data Preprocessing:**  If your preprocessing steps, for example, resizing images or extracting features, generate lists or tensors of varying lengths, attempts to uniformly access elements across these inconsistent data structures will lead to the error.

* **Batch Processing Issues:** During batch processing, you might encounter situations where a batch contains fewer elements than anticipated. If your code assumes a fixed batch size, indexing beyond the actual batch size in a loop will produce the error.

* **Asynchronous Operations:** TensorFlow's asynchronous nature can sometimes lead to unexpected data availability. If you are accessing data from a queue or a dataset before it has been fully populated, an `IndexError` can result.

* **Logical Errors in Indexing Logic:**  Complex indexing schemes involving nested loops, conditional statements, or dynamic index calculations are prone to errors.  Off-by-one errors are extremely common here.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Batch Processing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a dataset that doesn't guarantee a consistent batch size
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([ [1,2,3], [4,5], [6,7,8,9] ])
dataset = dataset.batch(3)

iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
next_element = iterator.get_next()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    try:
        while True:
            batch = sess.run(next_element)
            # INCORRECT: Assumes all batches have 3 elements
            for i in range(3):
                print(batch[i]) # IndexError likely on second iteration
    except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
        pass

```

This code fails because the second batch only has two elements. Attempting to access `batch[2]` will raise the `IndexError`. The solution involves checking the batch size before iterating.

**Corrected Example 1:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([ [1,2,3], [4,5], [6,7,8,9] ])
dataset = dataset.batch(3)

iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
next_element = iterator.get_next()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    try:
        while True:
            batch = sess.run(next_element)
            batch_size = len(batch)
            for i in range(batch_size):
                print(batch[i])
    except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
        pass
```

This corrected version checks `len(batch)` to determine the actual batch size, preventing the `IndexError`.

**Example 2:  Incorrect List Manipulation after Tensorflow Operations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#Example of a tensor operation that can create shape issues
tensor = tf.constant([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
reduced_tensor = tf.reduce_sum(tensor,axis=0)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    reduced = sess.run(reduced_tensor) #reduced will be [5,7,9]
    #INCORRECT: Trying to access element 3, which doesn't exist.
    print(reduced[3])
```

The `reduce_sum` operation changes the shape of the tensor.  Attempting to access `reduced[3]` fails as only three elements exist.

**Corrected Example 2:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tensor = tf.constant([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
reduced_tensor = tf.reduce_sum(tensor,axis=0)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    reduced = sess.run(reduced_tensor)
    print(reduced)
    if len(reduced)>0:
        print(reduced[0]) #Safe access to a valid element
```


This revised example avoids the error by first confirming if the reduced list is populated before indexing.


**Example 3:  Nested Loop Indexing Error**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

features = tf.constant([[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]]) #Shape is (2,2,2)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    f = sess.run(features)
    #INCORRECT:  Potential index error if the inner lists have varying lengths.
    for i in range(2):
        for j in range(2):
            for k in range(3): #Error here: Assumes all inner lists have 3 elements
                 print(f[i][j][k])
```

This code assumes every inner list has three elements, which is not true for this `features` data.

**Corrected Example 3:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

features = tf.constant([[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]])

with tf.Session() as sess:
    f = sess.run(features)
    for i in range(len(f)):
        for j in range(len(f[i])):
            for k in range(len(f[i][j])):
                print(f[i][j][k])
```

This version dynamically determines the lengths of the inner lists before accessing elements, preventing the `IndexError`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **TensorFlow documentation:** Thoroughly review the official documentation for data handling, specifically `tf.data` API and tensor manipulation functions. Pay close attention to shape information and data types.

* **Python documentation:**  Re-familiarize yourself with Python's list manipulation, specifically indexing and slicing.  Understand how to safely access elements.

* **NumPy documentation:** NumPy arrays are heavily used in TensorFlow.  Mastering NumPy array manipulation will significantly reduce data-related errors.  Pay close attention to shape and broadcasting rules.  Understanding methods like `numpy.shape`, `numpy.size`, and boolean indexing are essential.


By meticulously checking array/list sizes before accessing elements and employing dynamic indexing based on actual data dimensions, you can effectively prevent and resolve `IndexError: list index out of range` within your TensorFlow 1.5 and Python 3.6 applications.  Remember that proactive error prevention is significantly more efficient than post-hoc debugging in complex data pipelines.
