TensorFlow's flexibility in handling tensor operations extends to performing element-wise multiplication along a specified axis.  This is fundamentally achieved through the judicious use of broadcasting and reshaping, leveraging TensorFlow's optimized underlying computations.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines within a distributed TensorFlow environment heavily relied on this capability for efficient matrix manipulations, particularly when dealing with batch processing of image features.

**1. Clear Explanation**

TensorFlow, at its core, is a library designed for efficient tensor manipulation.  A tensor, conceptually, is a multi-dimensional array.  Standard multiplication, using the `*` operator, performs element-wise multiplication if the tensors are broadcastable. Broadcasting, in essence, allows TensorFlow to implicitly expand the dimensions of a smaller tensor to match the shape of a larger tensor before performing the element-wise operation. However, when we need to multiply along a specific axis, standard broadcasting alone may not suffice.  We need to ensure that the multiplication occurs between corresponding elements along the target axis, while retaining the dimensions of other axes.

This selective multiplication is typically accomplished using techniques such as reshaping and employing TensorFlow's `tf.einsum` or `tf.tensordot` functions.  Reshaping allows us to explicitly arrange the tensor's dimensions such that the target axis is properly aligned for element-wise multiplication with another tensor, or a scalar value.  `tf.einsum` provides a concise notation for expressing arbitrary tensor contractions, including the specific axis-wise multiplication we desire.  `tf.tensordot` is another powerful tool offering generalized tensor contractions, useful for scenarios beyond simple element-wise multiplication along a single axis. The choice between these methods largely depends on the complexity of the operation and personal preference; `tf.einsum` often provides more readable code for complex interactions.

The key lies in understanding how the shapes of involved tensors interact during these operations. Mismatched shapes will typically result in a `ValueError`, emphasizing the importance of careful consideration of the tensor dimensions before performing the multiplication.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Element-wise multiplication along a specific axis using `tf.reshape` and broadcasting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define two tensors
tensor_a = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])  # Shape: (2, 2, 2)
tensor_b = tf.constant([10, 20])  # Shape: (2,)

# Reshape tensor_b to be broadcastable along the desired axis (axis=2 in this case)
tensor_b_reshaped = tf.reshape(tensor_b, [1, 1, 2])  # Shape: (1, 1, 2)

# Perform element-wise multiplication along axis 2
result = tensor_a * tensor_b_reshaped

# Print the result and its shape
print(result)
print(result.shape)
```

This example demonstrates the use of reshaping to facilitate broadcasting.  `tensor_b`, a rank-1 tensor, is reshaped to a rank-3 tensor with appropriate singleton dimensions, allowing it to be broadcast across the first two axes of `tensor_a`. The multiplication then occurs element-wise along the last axis (axis=2).

**Example 2:  Utilizing `tf.einsum` for concise axis-wise multiplication**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define two tensors
tensor_c = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # Shape: (2, 2)
tensor_d = tf.constant([10, 20])  # Shape: (2,)

# Perform element-wise multiplication along axis 1 using einsum
result = tf.einsum('ij,j->ij', tensor_c, tensor_d)

# Print the result and its shape
print(result)
print(result.shape)
```

Here, `tf.einsum` elegantly handles the multiplication.  The equation `'ij,j->ij'` specifies the operation: `ij` represents `tensor_c`, `j` represents `tensor_d`, and `ij` indicates the output shape, indicating element-wise multiplication along axis 1 (the second axis, indexed by `j`).  This approach is significantly more concise than explicit reshaping, particularly for higher-dimensional tensors.


**Example 3: Employing `tf.tensordot` for more generalized tensor contractions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define two tensors
tensor_e = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]) #Shape: (2, 2, 2)
tensor_f = tf.constant([[10, 20], [30, 40]]) #Shape: (2,2)

#Perform multiplication along axis 1 of tensor_e and axis 0 of tensor_f
result = tf.tensordot(tensor_e, tensor_f, axes=([1],[0]))

#Print result and shape
print(result)
print(result.shape)
```

`tf.tensordot` offers fine-grained control over the contraction.  The `axes` argument specifies which axes of each tensor should be contracted (summed over).  In this case, we specify that axis 1 of `tensor_e` should be contracted with axis 0 of `tensor_f`, effectively performing the desired multiplication along the specified axes. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex tensor manipulations involving multiple axes.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a more comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow's tensor operations, I highly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  The documentation thoroughly details broadcasting rules, the usage of `tf.einsum` and `tf.tensordot`, and various other tensor manipulation functions.  Additionally, studying linear algebra concepts related to matrix multiplication and tensor contractions significantly enhances the understanding of the underlying mathematical principles at play.  Finally, exploration of the numerous TensorFlow tutorials and examples available online provides invaluable hands-on experience in implementing these techniques within various contexts.  These resources provide a strong foundation for mastering efficient tensor manipulations in TensorFlow.
