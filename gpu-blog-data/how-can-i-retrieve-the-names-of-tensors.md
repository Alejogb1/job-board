Sparse tensors, by their very nature, don't inherently store the names of their constituent tensors in the same manner as dense tensors.  My experience working on large-scale graph neural networks frequently involved manipulating sparse tensor representations, and this lack of direct name association presented a recurring challenge.  Therefore, retrieving tensor names requires careful consideration of the data structure and its construction methodology.  The solution isn't intrinsic to the sparse tensor itself but relies on metadata maintained alongside the tensor.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the fundamental difference between how sparse and dense tensors are represented. Dense tensors are typically stored as contiguous blocks of data, implicitly indexing elements through their array coordinates.  Names, if present, might be attached directly to the tensor object. Conversely, sparse tensors represent only non-zero elements, often using a coordinate system (indices) alongside the corresponding values.  This efficient storage scheme inherently sacrifices explicit naming within the tensor structure.

Therefore, to retrieve tensor names associated with a sparse tensor, one must employ an external mechanism, effectively a mapping system that links the tensor's indices or specific components to a separate name registry. This registry could be a dictionary, a pandas DataFrame, or even a custom-designed class, depending on the complexity and scale of the problem.  The choice of mapping mechanism is crucial for efficiency and maintainability, particularly when dealing with extremely large sparse tensors.

The mapping needs to be established during the sparse tensor's creation.  Each non-zero element, or a group of elements (for example, if you're representing feature vectors at each node in a graph), gets assigned a unique identifier linked to its corresponding name in the external registry. This identifier could be an integer index directly mirroring the tensor's index structure, or a more sophisticated key like a tuple, if each element carries multiple attributes influencing its name.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches to implementing this named sparse tensor concept.  I've leveraged Python's `scipy.sparse` library for sparse tensor representation and standard data structures for name management.

**Example 1:  Simple Index-Based Mapping**

```python
import scipy.sparse as sparse
import numpy as np

# Create a sample sparse matrix
data = np.array([1, 2, 3])
row = np.array([0, 1, 2])
col = np.array([1, 0, 2])
sparse_matrix = sparse.csc_matrix((data, (row, col)), shape=(3, 3))

# Create a name registry (simple dictionary using indices as keys)
tensor_names = {0: 'tensor_A', 1: 'tensor_B', 2: 'tensor_C'}

# Accessing names based on sparse matrix indices
for i in range(len(data)):
    row_index = row[i]
    col_index = col[i]
    name = tensor_names.get(i, "Unnamed") # Handling potential missing names
    print(f"Element at ({row_index}, {col_index}): Value = {data[i]}, Name = {name}")

```

This example uses a simple dictionary where keys represent the sequential index of the non-zero element within the sparse matrix and values are the corresponding names.  This is suitable for smaller sparse tensors where direct indexing is straightforward.


**Example 2:  Multi-Attribute Key-Based Mapping**

```python
import scipy.sparse as sparse
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample sparse matrix (same as before)
data = np.array([1, 2, 3])
row = np.array([0, 1, 2])
col = np.array([1, 0, 2])
sparse_matrix = sparse.csc_matrix((data, (row, col)), shape=(3, 3))

# Name registry using a dictionary with tuples as keys (for multi-attribute indexing)
tensor_names = defaultdict(str)
tensor_names[(0,1)] = "feature_X_node_A"
tensor_names[(1,0)] = "feature_Y_node_B"
tensor_names[(2,2)] = "feature_Z_node_C"


# Accessing names based on multiple attributes
for i in range(len(data)):
    key = (row[i], col[i])
    name = tensor_names.get(key, "Unnamed") #Handling missing names
    print(f"Element at {key}: Value = {data[i]}, Name = {name}")

```

This example demonstrates handling more complex scenarios where the sparse tensor elements might need multiple attributes (here, row and column indices) to uniquely identify them for naming purposes.  A `defaultdict` is employed to handle cases where an element may lack a name.


**Example 3:  Pandas DataFrame-based Mapping**

```python
import scipy.sparse as sparse
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Sample sparse matrix
data = np.array([1, 2, 3])
row = np.array([0, 1, 2])
col = np.array([1, 0, 2])
sparse_matrix = sparse.csc_matrix((data, (row, col)), shape=(3, 3))


# Create a Pandas DataFrame for the name registry
df = pd.DataFrame({'row': row, 'col': col, 'name': ['tensor_A', 'tensor_B', 'tensor_C']})

# Accessing names using Pandas' merging capabilities
named_data = pd.DataFrame({'row': row, 'col': col, 'value': data}).merge(df, on=['row', 'col'])
print(named_data)

```

This approach uses a pandas DataFrame as the name registry.  The power of pandas becomes evident in larger datasets allowing efficient querying and manipulation of the naming information. The merge operation joins the sparse tensor's data with the naming information efficiently.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of sparse tensors and their operations, consult standard linear algebra textbooks and resources on scientific computing.  Familiarize yourself with documentation of relevant libraries such as `scipy.sparse` in Python or equivalent libraries in other programming languages.  Pay close attention to data structure design principles when crafting the name mapping system, especially for performance in high-dimensional sparse tensors.  Furthermore, explore the documentation and use cases of graph database systems, as their handling of node and edge attributes often parallels the need for metadata in sparse tensors.  Finally, reading research papers on large-scale graph processing and sparse matrix computation can provide valuable insight into advanced techniques and strategies for managing these data structures.
