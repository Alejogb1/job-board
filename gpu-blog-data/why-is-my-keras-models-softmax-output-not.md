The discrepancy between expected and observed softmax output sums in Keras, deviating from the theoretical unity, often stems from numerical instability during the computation, particularly pronounced with high-dimensional probability distributions or when using low-precision floating-point arithmetic.  Over the years, working on large-scale classification tasks involving deep learning models, I've encountered this issue repeatedly.  The root cause isn't necessarily a bug in your Keras implementation, but rather a consequence of the inherent limitations of floating-point representation and the softmax function itself.


**1. Explanation:**

The softmax function, defined as  `softmax(xᵢ) = exp(xᵢ) / Σⱼ exp(xⱼ)`, transforms a vector of arbitrary real numbers into a probability distribution where each element represents the probability of belonging to a specific class.  Theoretically, the sum of these probabilities should always equal 1. However,  computers use finite-precision floating-point numbers, leading to rounding errors.  These errors accumulate during the exponentiation and summation steps.  When dealing with very large or very small values of `xᵢ`, the exponentiation can lead to numerical overflow (exceeding the maximum representable value) or underflow (resulting in a value too close to zero to be represented accurately).  Both these scenarios distort the resulting probabilities, preventing the sum from precisely equaling one.

Furthermore, the subtraction of the maximum value from the input vector, a common optimization technique to mitigate overflow issues (as it shifts the range without changing the output probabilities), can still introduce minute errors due to the limited precision.  The accumulation of these small errors, amplified across numerous calculations within a deep neural network, results in a sum that deviates slightly from 1.  This deviation, while often small (e.g., on the order of 1e-7 or less), can be significant enough to affect subsequent calculations depending on the application.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating Numerical Instability:**

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(x):
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x)) #Improved Numerical Stability
    return e_x / e_x.sum()

x = np.array([1000, 1000, 1000]) # Exaggerated example to highlight the issue.
probabilities = softmax(x)
print(f"Probabilities: {probabilities}")
print(f"Sum of probabilities: {np.sum(probabilities)}")
```

This example uses an exaggerated input vector to vividly demonstrate how numerical instability impacts the softmax result.  The subtraction of the maximum value is crucial for mitigating overflow, but even with this optimization, slight deviations from the expected sum of 1 are apparent. The output demonstrates a sum close to, but not exactly, 1 due to floating-point limitations.

**Example 2:  Keras Model Output Check:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple Keras model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', input_shape=(5,))
])

# Example Input
input_data = np.random.rand(1,5)

# Obtain predictions
predictions = model.predict(input_data)

print(f"Predictions: {predictions}")
print(f"Sum of predictions: {np.sum(predictions)}")

```

This example demonstrates how to check the softmax outputs directly from a Keras model. Note that even with relatively small input values, rounding errors can accumulate, causing the sum to differ slightly from 1. The sum printed should be close to 1, illustrating the inherent nature of this phenomenon.


**Example 3:  Handling Small Deviations:**

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax_with_correction(x):
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
    sum_prob = np.sum(e_x)
    corrected_probabilities = e_x / sum_prob
    return corrected_probabilities

x = np.random.rand(10)
probabilities = softmax_with_correction(x)
print(f"Probabilities: {probabilities}")
print(f"Sum of probabilities: {np.sum(probabilities)}")

```

While a correction to force the sum to exactly 1 is generally unnecessary (as the deviation is usually insignificant), this example demonstrates how to normalize the probabilities post-softmax if the application strictly requires a sum of 1.  This approach, however, could potentially introduce further error.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **Numerical Analysis Textbooks:**  These provide a rigorous foundation in understanding the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.
* **Deep Learning Textbooks:**  Refer to chapters on probability and numerical stability in the context of neural networks.
* **Scientific Computing Documentation:**  Consult documentation for numerical libraries like NumPy or TensorFlow for insights into their handling of floating-point computations.  Pay close attention to functions related to probability distributions.


In conclusion, the slight deviation of softmax outputs from a perfect sum of 1 is not a bug, but a consequence of the inherent limitations of representing real numbers using floating-point arithmetic.  The magnitude of this deviation is typically negligible for practical purposes. While the presented code examples serve as a diagnostic and illustrative tool, directly manipulating the softmax output to force a sum of 1 is generally discouraged unless strict adherence to the theoretical definition is absolutely critical, at which point an awareness of the introduced errors is vital. Understanding the underlying numerical challenges is key to interpreting the results accurately.
