TensorFlow 1.15's handling of weights and biases requires a nuanced understanding of variable scopes and the `tf.get_variable` function, especially given the deprecation of certain functionalities in later versions.  My experience working on large-scale neural network deployments in the financial modeling domain highlighted the critical importance of meticulous weight and bias management for both model accuracy and reproducibility.  Incorrect handling can easily lead to unexpected behavior, including gradient vanishing or exploding problems, and ultimately, model failure.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

In TensorFlow 1.15, weights and biases are represented as `tf.Variable` objects.  Crucially, these variables must be explicitly defined within a variable scope to avoid name collisions and ensure proper weight sharing (or lack thereof) across different layers or models.  The `tf.get_variable` function is the recommended approach for creating and retrieving variables, offering fine-grained control over variable initialization, reuse, and scope management.

The general procedure involves:

a) **Defining the variable scope:**  This creates a hierarchical namespace for your variables. This prevents naming conflicts, crucial in complex architectures.  Consider using descriptive names that reflect the layer or function they belong to.

b) **Using `tf.get_variable`:** This function allows you to create or retrieve a variable within the defined scope.  The `initializer` argument allows specification of how the weights and biases are initially populated (e.g., random uniform, Xavier, He initialization).  The `trainable` argument (defaulting to `True`) dictates whether the optimizer updates the variable during training.

c) **Utilizing the variables in your model:** The defined weight and bias variables are then integrated into the calculations of your layers, forming the core computational steps of your network.  For example, a dense layer calculation would involve a matrix multiplication of the input with the weight matrix, followed by an addition of the bias vector.

d) **Handling weight sharing:** If you intend to share weights across multiple parts of the network, you leverage the same variable name within the appropriate scope.  `tf.get_variable` will return the existing variable if it already exists within the scope, thereby enforcing weight sharing.  Conversely, using distinct names creates independent variables.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Dense Layer with Explicit Weight and Bias Creation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.variable_scope("my_dense_layer"):
    W = tf.get_variable("weights", shape=[10, 5], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer())
    b = tf.get_variable("biases", shape=[5], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

#Further model definition and training steps would follow...
```

This example demonstrates the creation of a simple dense layer.  The `tf.variable_scope` ensures that the weights and biases are uniquely named within the "my_dense_layer" scope.  The `initializer` arguments specify the initialization methods for weights (random normal) and biases (zeros).


**Example 2: Weight Sharing across Multiple Layers:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.variable_scope("shared_weights"):
    W = tf.get_variable("shared_weights", shape=[5, 2], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer())

with tf.variable_scope("layer1"):
    b1 = tf.get_variable("biases", shape=[2], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())
    x1 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 5])
    y1 = tf.matmul(x1, W) + b1

with tf.variable_scope("layer2"):
    b2 = tf.get_variable("biases", shape=[2], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())
    x2 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 5])
    y2 = tf.matmul(x2, W) + b2

# ... further model definition and training
```

Here, the weight matrix `W` is shared between `layer1` and `layer2`.  Both layers use the same variable name ("shared_weights") within their respective scopes, ensuring they reference the same underlying weight matrix.  The biases, however, are distinct for each layer.


**Example 3:  Handling Variable Reuse with `reuse=True`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.variable_scope("my_layer") as scope:
    W = tf.get_variable("weights", shape=[10, 5], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer())
    b = tf.get_variable("biases", shape=[5], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())
    x1 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])
    y1 = tf.matmul(x1, W) + b

    scope.reuse_variables() #Enables reuse
    x2 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])
    y2 = tf.matmul(x2, W) + b

# ... further model definition and training
```

This example demonstrates variable reuse within the same scope.  By setting `scope.reuse_variables()` to `True`, subsequent calls to `tf.get_variable` within the "my_layer" scope will reuse the existing variables instead of creating new ones. This is useful for efficient implementation of recurrent networks.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 1.x documentation (specifically sections covering variables and variable scopes),  a well-structured textbook on deep learning emphasizing TensorFlow implementation details, and  a comprehensive guide to TensorFlow's computational graph would provide further in-depth knowledge.  Reviewing example code from established deep learning repositories on platforms like GitHub focusing on TensorFlow 1.x implementations offers invaluable practical insight.  Focusing on examples utilizing `tf.get_variable` is highly beneficial.
