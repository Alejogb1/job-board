My experience designing complex neural networks, especially within the realm of sequence-to-sequence tasks and multi-modal learning, has consistently highlighted the nuanced challenges of managing models with multiple output shapes. Specifically, utilizing TensorFlow’s subclassing API with Keras for such models necessitates a firm grasp on how to define output structures within the `call` method and how losses and metrics adapt to these structures. Failing to address this properly will likely result in compatibility issues during training and evaluation.

The core issue arises from the fact that Keras' default behavior is geared towards models with a single output tensor. When a model produces multiple outputs – for instance, in tasks involving both regression and classification, or where different decoder components generate independent sequences – it becomes essential to explicitly guide both the forward pass and the subsequent loss computation. The `call` method of a subclassed `tf.keras.Model` is the primary point of control for dictating how these multiple outputs are generated. The key is returning a tuple or a dictionary of tensors, where each element represents one of the output branches of the model.

Let's start by examining a scenario with two distinct output heads: one for binary classification and one for a single numeric regression. Here's a simplified code example outlining this situation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class DualOutputModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units=64):
        super(DualOutputModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='relu')
        self.dense_classification = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
        self.dense_regression = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        classification_output = self.dense_classification(x)
        regression_output = self.dense_regression(x)
        return classification_output, regression_output

# Usage Example
model = DualOutputModel()
input_data = tf.random.normal((32, 10)) # Batch of 32 inputs, dimension 10
outputs = model(input_data)
print(f"Classification Output shape: {outputs[0].shape}")
print(f"Regression Output shape: {outputs[1].shape}")
```

In this example, the `DualOutputModel` generates two outputs: a classification probability and a regression value. The `call` method returns these as a tuple. Crucially, notice that no specific shape information is baked into the model's structure. It is the user’s responsibility to match the losses and metrics to the outputs’ specific types. This flexibility is the power, and also the responsibility, of subclassing.

Consider the scenario of a model employing two distinct decoders, each producing a sequence of a specific, possibly different, length. This is common in machine translation, text summarization or image captioning where the output length is not always the same as the input.

```python
class SequenceDecoderModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim=64, vocab1_size=500, vocab2_size=700, decoder1_units=128, decoder2_units=128):
        super(SequenceDecoderModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=vocab1_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)
        self.decoder1_lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=decoder1_units, return_sequences=True)
        self.decoder2_lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=decoder2_units, return_sequences=True)
        self.projection1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab1_size, activation='softmax')
        self.projection2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab2_size, activation='softmax')


    def call(self, inputs, decoder1_inputs, decoder2_inputs):
      embedded = self.embedding(inputs) # Assume input is sequence of ids.
      
      decoder1_output = self.decoder1_lstm(decoder1_inputs)
      projected1 = self.projection1(decoder1_output)

      decoder2_output = self.decoder2_lstm(decoder2_inputs)
      projected2 = self.projection2(decoder2_output)
      
      return projected1, projected2

# Usage Example (assuming some data preprocessing for inputs)
embedding_dim=64
vocab1_size = 500
vocab2_size=700
model = SequenceDecoderModel(embedding_dim=embedding_dim, vocab1_size=vocab1_size, vocab2_size=vocab2_size)

input_sequences = tf.random.uniform((32, 10), minval=0, maxval=vocab1_size, dtype=tf.int32)
decoder1_start_tokens = tf.random.uniform((32, 5), minval=0, maxval=vocab1_size, dtype=tf.int32)
decoder2_start_tokens = tf.random.uniform((32, 7), minval=0, maxval=vocab2_size, dtype=tf.int32)

outputs = model(input_sequences, decoder1_start_tokens, decoder2_start_tokens)
print(f"Decoder 1 Output shape: {outputs[0].shape}")
print(f"Decoder 2 Output shape: {outputs[1].shape}")
```

In this case, we have two separate decoder LSTM branches, each handling potentially different target vocabularies and sequence lengths.  The `call` method returns a tuple with the output sequences projected to vocabulary size through a softmax. The key here is the separate projection layers ensuring distinct shapes are produced. Crucially, during training, separate losses will need to be computed and combined.

Finally, let’s examine how to approach output handling with a dictionary rather than a tuple. Dictionaries become essential when there are many output branches, and descriptive keys improve code readability.

```python
class MultiModalModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, embedding_dim=64, units=128, num_classes=10):
      super(MultiModalModel, self).__init__()
      self.text_embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=embedding_dim)
      self.image_conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')
      self.image_pool = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D()
      self.image_flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
      self.fusion_dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
      self.class_head = tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
      self.regression_head = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)


  def call(self, text_input, image_input):
    text_embedding = self.text_embedding(text_input)
    text_embedding = tf.reduce_mean(text_embedding, axis=1) # Simple average embedding

    image_feature = self.image_conv(image_input)
    image_feature = self.image_pool(image_feature)
    image_feature = self.image_flatten(image_feature)

    fused_features = tf.concat([text_embedding, image_feature], axis=1)
    fused_features = self.fusion_dense(fused_features)

    class_output = self.class_head(fused_features)
    regression_output = self.regression_head(fused_features)


    return {'classification': class_output, 'regression': regression_output}

# Usage Example
model = MultiModalModel()
text_input = tf.random.uniform((32, 15), minval=0, maxval=1000, dtype=tf.int32) # batch of 32, max seq len 15
image_input = tf.random.normal((32, 64, 64, 3)) # batch of 32 images, 64x64x3

outputs = model(text_input, image_input)
print(f"Classification Output shape: {outputs['classification'].shape}")
print(f"Regression Output shape: {outputs['regression'].shape}")
```

Here, we return the output tensors within a dictionary. This approach is incredibly advantageous because it explicitly names the different output branches (`classification` and `regression`). When compiling the model, the names of the keys directly relate to the targets and losses.

In conclusion, handling multiple output shapes with TensorFlow subclassed Keras models requires careful design of the `call` method to structure the output into tuples or dictionaries. Subsequent handling during loss calculation and metric evaluation requires explicit assignment based on those output structures, but that flexibility provides fine-grained control over complex, multi-faceted models.  This approach allows developers to craft sophisticated model architectures tailored to specific problems rather than being constrained by simpler single-output patterns.

For further study, I recommend examining Keras documentation on custom models and training loops. Additionally, investigation of model architectures with multiple outputs such as those used in multi-task learning or multimodal fusion can provide valuable insight.  Exploration of TensorFlow's tutorial on custom training with gradient tape is also quite valuable. Finally, examples within the official TensorFlow models repository can also provide concrete examples of such implementations.
