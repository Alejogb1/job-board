The `IndexError: select(): index 1 out of range for tensor of size [1, 32, 100]` during a PyTorch backward pass typically stems from an incorrect indexing operation within a custom or implicitly defined differentiable function that is involved in the computation of gradients. Specifically, this error indicates that you are attempting to select an element at index 1 along a dimension that has fewer than 2 elements within a tensor that is part of the computation graph during the backpropagation phase.

I encountered this exact issue during a model development project involving dynamic sequence length modeling, where I was using a custom attention mechanism. Initially, the forward pass worked flawlessly, but the backward pass threw this exception. The error message itself provides crucial information: the tensor has a size of `[1, 32, 100]`, and the attempted selection occurs at index 1, suggesting the problem is likely along the first dimension (index 1). However, the size of the dimension at that position (32) clearly indicates the indexing *should* work; the issue isn't in the forward pass where the tensor dimensions are known beforehand. The problem isn't that dimension 1 is out-of-range in the tensor itself; rather, that the *gradient* for the backpropagated tensor is having dimension 1 reduced to 1.

This is typically a result of a dimension reduction operation that is not correctly handled during backpropagation. Common dimension reduction operations include `torch.sum`, `torch.mean`, and potentially custom attention implementations that, during gradient computation, apply similar reductions. When PyTorch computes the gradient, operations must be reversed.  If a dimension has been implicitly or explicitly reduced without properly accounting for it in the backward pass, that dimension's size can change to size 1 before a gradient attempt to access that dimension using index 1 can be performed, creating the error. The key misunderstanding here is that this `select` operation that the error message mentions doesn't refer to the original tensors; it refers to the gradients in the backpropagation.

Here’s a breakdown using simplified examples to illustrate this behavior:

**Example 1: Incorrect Summation Handling (Conceptual)**

Imagine a simplified operation that sums across the second dimension of a tensor.

```python
import torch

def my_custom_op(x):
  # Assume x has shape [batch_size, seq_len, feature_dim] - e.g., [1, 32, 100]
  output = torch.sum(x, dim=1)  # shape becomes [1, 100]
  return output

# Example tensor
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 32, 100, requires_grad=True)

# Forward pass
output = my_custom_op(input_tensor)

# Backward pass (where the error occurs)
output.backward(torch.ones_like(output))
```

In the forward pass, `torch.sum` reduces the tensor's second dimension (size 32) to a single dimension, resulting in `output` of shape `[1, 100]`. During backpropagation, PyTorch calculates gradients with respect to this output by examining what produced the output. This involves tracing back the `sum` operation. PyTorch implicitly tries to distribute the gradients according to the summation; it is during this operation that, for a tensor that needs a `requires_grad` value to compute it, it is assumed the original dimension of 32 exists and that gradients along this dimension need to be constructed, when actually that dimension was reduced. Therefore, the `select` indexing attempt happens on a gradient where that dimension now has a size of 1. The error occurs when it tries to get to index `1` along the dimension that now has size `1`. Note that this exact case wouldn’t usually happen because `torch.sum` is already implemented with correct backpropagation; however, the example demonstrates the concept.

**Example 2:  Corrected Summation Handling**

The problem in the previous example is the missing handling of implicit dimension reductions in custom operations. This can be corrected as follows:

```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Function

class CorrectedCustomSum(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        ctx.save_for_backward(x)
        return torch.sum(x, dim=1)
    
    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_x = grad_output.unsqueeze(1).expand_as(x)
        return grad_x


input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 32, 100, requires_grad=True)
output = CorrectedCustomSum.apply(input_tensor)
output.backward(torch.ones_like(output))
```

This example uses `torch.autograd.Function`, a class that allows explicit control over forward and backward passes. The forward pass behaves the same but the backward pass, `backward`, performs the needed reversal of the summation by expanding the gradient to match the original tensor's shape using `unsqueeze` and `expand_as`. Here, the `grad_output` has shape `[1, 100]` and is first reshaped to `[1, 1, 100]`, and is then expanded to match the original `[1, 32, 100]` to allow the correct gradient to be computed.  This is how PyTorch implements its own gradient calculations, such as for `torch.sum`, which ensures the correct dimension is available in the backward pass. This will not cause an `IndexError`.

**Example 3: Implicit Reduction and Correction**

Often, the dimension reduction can happen implicitly, within an attention layer or similar custom mechanism. For example, let’s imagine a simplified attention-like function that computes a single weighted average using a simplified mechanism:

```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Function

class SimplifiedAttention(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x, attention_weights):
      # Assume x shape: [batch_size, seq_len, feature_dim]
      # Assume attention_weights shape: [batch_size, seq_len]
      ctx.save_for_backward(x, attention_weights)
      weighted_sum = torch.sum(x * attention_weights.unsqueeze(-1), dim=1)
      return weighted_sum
    
    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, attention_weights = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_attention_weights = torch.sum(grad_output.unsqueeze(1) * x, dim=-1)
        grad_x = grad_output.unsqueeze(1) * attention_weights.unsqueeze(-1)
        return grad_x, grad_attention_weights


input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 32, 100, requires_grad=True)
attention_weights = torch.rand(1, 32, requires_grad=True)
output = SimplifiedAttention.apply(input_tensor, attention_weights)
output.backward(torch.ones_like(output))
```

Here, the `SimplifiedAttention` class multiplies the input tensor with attention weights and sums the result along the sequence length dimension (dimension 1).  The forward pass sums across `seq_len`, reducing dimension 1 to size 1. The `backward` pass correctly accounts for this in the gradient calculation by using `unsqueeze` to expand gradients when necessary to align the sizes between the forward and backward operations so that the correct gradients for each variable are produced.  This ensures the backpropagation step does not attempt to access a dimension at an index that exceeds the dimension size. The error is avoided. This also demonstrates that the problem isn’t only tied to `torch.sum`, but any operation that can result in dimension reduction, and therefore needs special handling in the gradient calculation.

In summary, the `IndexError: select(): index 1 out of range` often indicates a mismatch in the size of the tensors and gradients during backpropagation. This can be addressed by ensuring your custom layers correctly handle the gradients for operations that reduce tensor dimensions during the forward pass. Using `torch.autograd.Function` and paying close attention to the shape changes is crucial for constructing robust, custom differentiable operations within PyTorch.

For further study, I recommend thoroughly reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on autograd and custom `torch.autograd.Function`. Understanding the inner workings of the autograd engine is crucial for avoiding and debugging these types of issues. Studying research papers and code examples related to custom attention mechanisms and other sequence processing architectures is also beneficial, paying specific attention to how their operations are handled within custom autograd classes. Examining and walking through the code of PyTorch's implemented operations is also incredibly instructive to how each specific case is handled.
