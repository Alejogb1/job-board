TensorFlow loss functions, despite being crucial for gradient-based optimization, don’t inherently possess a gradient. Instead, the gradient is derived *from* the loss function’s computational graph when it’s used within a TensorFlow context, specifically during training. This differentiation process is what enables the backpropagation algorithm to function, adjusting model weights to minimize loss. The absence of a pre-computed gradient within the loss function object is a key feature that allows for flexibility and avoids unnecessary computation.

The core of the issue lies in understanding how TensorFlow represents operations and computations. TensorFlow constructs a computational graph, often referred to as a 'dataflow graph,' that defines how tensors (multidimensional arrays) are transformed and manipulated. When you define a loss function, such as mean squared error (MSE) or categorical cross-entropy, you are essentially describing a series of operations that result in a single scalar value representing the model's performance. This scalar is then the output of the loss function, but the function itself is merely a specification of *how* that scalar is calculated, not a pre-calculated gradient.

This distinction is important because the gradient computation depends entirely on the specific input tensor values and the model parameters which are involved in producing the loss result. These values change during training. Pre-computing the gradient would be a static process unrelated to the training dynamics. Consequently, TensorFlow performs gradient calculations through automatic differentiation, leveraging the chain rule and the constructed computation graph. During the `tf.GradientTape` context (or when `model.fit` is used in Keras), TensorFlow traces the forward pass operations and then calculates the gradients using the reverse pass, propagating the loss gradient back through the model's layers. This ensures the gradient is always tailored to the current state of model parameters and input data.

Here is an example of how a loss function is defined and then used in the training process:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a custom loss function (MSE)
def mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y_true))

# Generate some dummy data
x = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [5.9], [8.1]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Define a simple model with a single weight
W = tf.Variable([[0.5]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Define an optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Train for a few epochs
for epoch in range(100):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_predicted = tf.matmul(x, W)
        loss_value = mean_squared_error(y, y_predicted)

    # Compute gradients only in context
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss_value, W)
    optimizer.apply_gradients([(gradients, W)])

    if epoch % 20 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {loss_value.numpy()}, W = {W.numpy()}')
```

In this example, `mean_squared_error` is a function that calculates the MSE, but it doesn’t compute the gradient itself. The gradient is computed within the `tf.GradientTape` context using `tape.gradient()`, utilizing the graph built for the forward calculation during that context. This process enables `optimizer.apply_gradients` to update the weights. Without this dynamic differentiation, the model would be unable to learn.

Consider a more complex case using TensorFlow's built-in loss functions:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a simple multi-class classification model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')
])

# Define the loss and optimizer
loss_function = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Generate synthetic training data
num_samples = 100
X_train = np.random.rand(num_samples, 20)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 5, num_samples)
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=5)
X_train = tf.convert_to_tensor(X_train, dtype=tf.float32)
y_train = tf.convert_to_tensor(y_train, dtype=tf.float32)


# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      y_pred = model(X_train)
      loss = loss_function(y_train, y_pred)

  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

  if epoch % 20 == 0:
    print(f'Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {loss.numpy()}')
```

Here, `tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()` is used; like the custom MSE, it doesn’t hold a pre-calculated gradient. Again, the gradient is dynamically determined by `tape.gradient`, which is crucial for training a multi-layer neural network. The gradients are then applied to the model’s trainable variables. This illustrates how TensorFlow's framework handles a variety of loss functions, providing flexibility while relying on automatic differentiation to achieve the gradient computation.

The final example explores the use of a custom training loop using a custom loss function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a custom Huber loss function
def huber_loss(y_true, y_pred, delta=1.0):
  error = y_pred - y_true
  abs_error = tf.abs(error)
  squared_loss = 0.5 * tf.square(error)
  linear_loss = delta * (abs_error - 0.5 * delta)
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.where(abs_error <= delta, squared_loss, linear_loss))

# Generate some dummy data
x = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.1], [5.8], [8.2]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Define a simple linear model
W = tf.Variable([[0.1]], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.Variable([[0.1]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_predicted = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
        loss_value = huber_loss(y, y_predicted)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss_value, [W, b])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [W,b]))

    if epoch % 20 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {loss_value.numpy()}, W = {W.numpy()}, b = {b.numpy()}')
```

This demonstrates that the principle remains consistent: even with a custom loss such as Huber loss, the gradient is *not* an intrinsic part of the loss function's definition, but rather a result of the automatic differentiation within the `tf.GradientTape` block. The gradients are then used to update both the weight 'W' and the bias 'b'. This final example underscores that the gradient is always calculated dynamically based on the context in which the loss function is called, not pre-computed within the function itself.

In conclusion, the absence of a pre-computed gradient within TensorFlow loss functions is not a deficiency, but rather a design choice that provides dynamic gradient calculation within the training workflow. This approach, achieved through automatic differentiation and the TensorFlow computational graph, facilitates optimization by adapting to the specific input tensors and current model parameters. Understanding this principle is critical when implementing or customizing models and training loops in TensorFlow. I recommend consulting resources such as the TensorFlow documentation related to automatic differentiation, gradient tape usage, and the mechanics of the training process for a deeper understanding. Also, exploring theoretical concepts related to backpropagation will further clarify the underlying mathematics and intuition. These resources provide a solid foundation for both using and understanding the power of TensorFlow.
