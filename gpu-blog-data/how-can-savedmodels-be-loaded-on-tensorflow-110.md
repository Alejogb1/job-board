TensorFlow 1.x's SavedModel mechanism, while powerful, presents challenges when integrating custom device placement strategies, particularly across versions.  My experience working on large-scale deployment pipelines for a financial modeling application highlighted this precisely.  Successfully loading a SavedModel with specified device placement in TensorFlow 1.10 and beyond necessitates a nuanced understanding of the `tf.Session` configuration and the limitations of SavedModel's inherent graph structure.  Simply relying on the default device placement is insufficient; explicit control is needed.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core problem stems from the SavedModel's serialization process.  It effectively captures the computation graph's structure and the variable values, but not the execution context, which includes device assignments.  During loading, TensorFlow reconstructs the graph, and unless you explicitly provide instructions, it will default to the available devices, potentially leading to suboptimal performance or outright failures.  This is especially pertinent for models with substantial memory footprints or operations optimized for specific hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs).

To achieve custom device placement, you must configure the `tf.Session` at load time, specifying device assignments for individual operations or variables within the restored graph. This is done by leveraging the `tf.ConfigProto` object, which controls various aspects of the session's behavior, including device allocation. The `tf.ConfigProto` allows you to set options for CPU and GPU resource usage, including inter-device communication (e.g., using Nvidia NCCL for multi-GPU training).  This configuration must be applied *before* restoring the SavedModel.  Attempts to modify the graph's device placement after the `tf.saved_model.load` call will be ineffective.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic CPU placement for all operations:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the session configuration.  This explicitly places all operations on the CPU.
config = tf.ConfigProto(device_count={'GPU': 0}) #Setting GPU count to 0 forces CPU usage

# Load the SavedModel; note the config argument.
with tf.Session(config=config) as sess:
    imported_meta_graph = tf.saved_model.load(sess, ["serve"], "path/to/saved_model")
    # Access and use the loaded graph and variables here.
    # ... your inference or training code ...
    sess.close()

```

This example demonstrates the simplest case, forcing all operations onto the CPU.  It's crucial for scenarios where you lack GPU resources or need deterministic execution across platforms.  The `device_count={'GPU': 0}` setting ensures that TensorFlow doesn't attempt to utilize any GPUs.


**Example 2:  Selective GPU placement for specific operations:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

config = tf.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=True, log_device_placement=True)
with tf.Session(config=config) as sess:
    imported_meta_graph = tf.saved_model.load(sess, ["serve"], "path/to/saved_model")

    # Manually assign devices for specific tensors/ops.  This requires knowing the graph structure.
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):  #Assumes a GPU is available. Check your system's GPU count.
        output_tensor = imported_meta_graph.graph.get_tensor_by_name("my_model/output:0")
        # ... perform operations using output_tensor ...

    sess.close()

```

This example uses the `allow_soft_placement` option, which allows TensorFlow to fall back to the CPU if a requested device is unavailable.  `log_device_placement=True` is invaluable for debugging; it prints the device assignments to the console.  Critically, this approach requires familiarity with the SavedModel's internal graph structure to identify the specific tensors or operations that benefit from GPU placement.  The `tf.device` context manager governs the placement.


**Example 3:  Using `tf.device` with a loop for iterative processing:**


```python
import tensorflow as tf

config = tf.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=True, log_device_placement=True)
with tf.Session(config=config) as sess:
    imported_meta_graph = tf.saved_model.load(sess, ["serve"], "path/to/saved_model")
    input_tensor = imported_meta_graph.graph.get_tensor_by_name("my_model/input:0")
    output_tensor = imported_meta_graph.graph.get_tensor_by_name("my_model/output:0")

    for i in range(10):
        with tf.device('/GPU:0' if i % 2 == 0 else '/CPU:0'): # Alternate between GPU and CPU for each iteration.
            result = sess.run(output_tensor, feed_dict={input_tensor: data_batch[i]})  #Assume data_batch is defined elsewhere.
            #Process result
            print(f"Iteration {i}: Result shape {result.shape}")

    sess.close()
```

This example showcases a more sophisticated application of device placement, dynamically assigning devices within a loop. This can be beneficial when optimizing for resource contention or when certain operations are more efficiently executed on the CPU than on the GPU, especially considering data transfer overhead between devices.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation for your specific version (1.10+) is indispensable.  Focus on the sections detailing `tf.ConfigProto`, `tf.Session`, and the `tf.saved_model` API. Pay attention to examples showcasing graph manipulation and device placement.  Consult advanced tutorials on TensorFlow graph optimization and performance tuning; understanding graph execution is vital for effective device placement.  Thorough testing with various device configurations and profiling tools (e.g., TensorBoard) is crucial to identify bottlenecks and fine-tune your strategy for optimal performance.  Consider using a debugger to step through your code to see what the execution plan looks like.  This will help to identify any potential conflicts and inefficiencies in your custom device placement scheme.
