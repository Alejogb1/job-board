The freezing behavior observed in `tf.layers.batch_normalization` during TensorFlow session execution stems primarily from incorrect handling of the training phase indicator, typically a boolean placeholder or variable.  My experience debugging this issue across numerous production-level deep learning models consistently points to this root cause.  The layer's internal statistics (moving mean and variance) are updated only when the training phase is explicitly set to `True`;  otherwise, it operates using pre-computed statistics, effectively freezing the normalization process. This behavior, while intended, often leads to unexpected outcomes if the training phase is not managed correctly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`tf.layers.batch_normalization` (now deprecated, but its functionality is replicated in `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization`) employs a two-mode operational paradigm: training and inference. During training, the layer calculates the batch statistics (mean and variance) and updates its internal moving averages.  These moving averages are exponentially weighted averages of the batch statistics, offering a robust estimate of the distribution across the entire dataset.  During inference (or evaluation), the layer bypasses the batch statistic calculation and directly utilizes these pre-computed moving averages for normalization. This efficient approach avoids recalculating statistics for each inference batch, significantly accelerating the process.

The transition between these modes is controlled by a boolean flag, often named `training` or similar. This flag is typically a placeholder fed with a value of `True` during training and `False` during inference.  Failure to properly set or feed this flag results in the layer remaining in inference mode even during training, leading to the observed "freezing" effect.  The layer's output then becomes solely determined by the initially computed (or initialized) moving averages, preventing any further adaptation to the data distribution.  The normalization parameters, therefore, remain constant, effectively hindering the model's learning process and potentially leading to poor performance or instability.  Furthermore, improperly initialized moving averages can exacerbate this problem, resulting in severely skewed normalized activations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Handling of Training Phase**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect - the training phase is consistently set to False
training_phase = tf.constant(False)

input_tensor = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10])
bn_layer = tf.layers.batch_normalization(input_tensor, training=training_phase)

# Session execution will always use pre-computed moving averages
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # ... training loop ...  This loop will not update bn_layer's statistics
    # because training_phase is always False.
```

This code snippet demonstrates a common error. The `training_phase` is set to a constant `False`, forcing the batch normalization layer to use pre-computed statistics throughout the entire session, even during what should be the training phase.  This will effectively freeze the layer's parameters.

**Example 2: Correct Handling with Placeholder**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Correct - training phase is a placeholder
training_phase = tf.placeholder(tf.bool)

input_tensor = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10])
bn_layer = tf.layers.batch_normalization(input_tensor, training=training_phase)

# Update ops are explicitly fetched in the training loop
update_ops = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # ... data loading ...
        _, _ = sess.run([optimizer, update_ops], feed_dict={input_tensor: batch_data, training_phase: True})  # Correctly feed True during training
        # ... evaluation ...  Here you would set training_phase to False
```

Here, `training_phase` is a placeholder, allowing dynamic control over the layer's mode.  Crucially, `tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)` retrieves the update operations for the moving averages.  These operations *must* be executed alongside the optimizer during training to update the batch normalization layer's internal statistics.  Failing to include these updates is another common source of the freezing problem. Note the explicit `feed_dict` setting `training_phase` to `True` during training.

**Example 3:  Keras Implementation with `training` argument**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=5)
])

# Training
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Inference
predictions = model.predict(x_test)
```

The Keras implementation simplifies the management of the training phase.  The `fit` method automatically handles setting the `training` argument correctly for the `BatchNormalization` layer during training. The `predict` method automatically uses the learned statistics for inference. This approach reduces the risk of manual errors encountered in the lower-level TensorFlow API.  However, understanding the underlying mechanism remains crucial for effective debugging.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation (specifically, sections on batch normalization and the Keras API) should provide comprehensive explanations and examples.  A thorough understanding of TensorFlow's computational graph and the lifecycle of variables is also invaluable for grasping the nuances of training and inference.  Examining the source code of `tf.layers.batch_normalization` (or the equivalent in the Keras layers) can provide deeper insights into its internal operations.  Finally, searching for solutions to specific errors encountered during the implementation can be crucial.  Remember to always meticulously check error messages for valuable hints.  My experience has shown that focusing on the details of the `training` flag and the update operations often leads to quick resolution of this specific problem.
