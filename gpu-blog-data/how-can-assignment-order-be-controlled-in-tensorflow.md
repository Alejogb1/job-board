TensorFlow's execution model, particularly in eager execution, can lead to non-deterministic behavior if assignment operations aren't carefully managed.  My experience optimizing large-scale graph neural networks revealed this acutely; subtle variations in assignment order within a training step directly impacted gradient calculations, resulting in inconsistent model performance across runs.  Understanding and controlling assignment order is critical for reproducibility and, in many cases, for correct functionality.

The core issue stems from the inherent parallelism within TensorFlow.  Operations aren't necessarily executed in the order they're written.  While TensorFlow's optimizer strives for efficiency, it lacks guarantees about precise execution order unless explicitly constrained. This is particularly relevant when dealing with shared resources or operations with side effects, such as variable updates.  This lack of strict sequential execution, while enabling performance optimization, necessitates specific strategies to enforce a desired assignment order.

The primary mechanism for controlling assignment order is through the use of control dependencies.  These dependencies ensure that one operation completes before another begins, effectively creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) specifying the execution sequence.  This is achieved using `tf.control_dependencies`.  Another approach, particularly relevant in graph mode, leverages the inherent ordering within the graph construction itself. Finally, techniques involving custom Python code execution intertwined with TensorFlow operations can further refine control.

**1. Controlling Assignment Order with `tf.control_dependencies`:**

This method is most effective for situations where you need to guarantee the order of individual operations.  It directly manipulates the execution graph to enforce specific dependencies.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.Variable(0.0)
b = tf.Variable(1.0)

with tf.control_dependencies([tf.assign(a, b)]): # b is assigned to a first
    c = tf.add(a, 2.0) # a (now equal to b) will be used in this operation

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(c)) # Output: 3.0
```

In this example, `tf.assign(a, b)` is placed within a `tf.control_dependencies` context. This ensures that the assignment of `b` to `a` is completed before the addition operation.  The `tf.add` operation has a dependency on the assignment. Altering the order of these statements would yield undefined results, potentially resulting in `c` being calculated before `a` is updated, leading to an incorrect value. This demonstrates a direct control over the assignment precedence.  Note the utilization of `tf.Session`.  While this is less common in current TensorFlow practice due to the prevalence of eager execution, understanding this approach remains vital for migrating or interpreting older codebases.

**2. Leveraging Graph Construction Order (Graph Mode):**

In graph mode (less frequently used now, but still relevant), the order of operations within the graph construction itself dictates their execution order.  This is a more implicit method but equally effective.  Constructing the graph meticulously, with assignments occurring in the desired sequence, eliminates the need for explicit control dependencies.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    a = tf.Variable(0.0, name="a")
    b = tf.Variable(1.0, name="b")
    assign_op = tf.assign(a, b)
    add_op = tf.add(a, 2.0)

    init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()

with tf.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    sess.run(init_op)
    sess.run(assign_op)  #Assignment happens before addition because it is listed before
    print(sess.run(add_op)) # Output: 3.0

```
Here, the `assign_op` is explicitly executed before the `add_op`, guaranteeing the correct assignment sequence within the constructed computation graph.  The sequential nature of the graph building process implicitly controls the execution order.  This approach often provides cleaner code in scenarios where order is critical from a logical perspective.

**3. Custom Python Control Flow with `tf.py_function`:**

For more intricate control or when dealing with operations not directly supported by TensorFlow,  `tf.py_function` allows integration of custom Python code.  This affords finer-grained control over assignment sequencing but requires careful consideration of potential performance overhead.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def custom_assignment(a, b):
    a[:] = b  #In-place assignment in numpy array
    return a

a = tf.Variable(np.zeros((1,)))
b = tf.Variable(np.ones((1,)))

a_assigned = tf.py_function(custom_assignment, [a, b], [tf.float32])
c = tf.add(a_assigned[0], 2.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    result = c

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(result)) # Output: [3.]
```

In this example, `custom_assignment` performs the assignment within a Python function.  `tf.py_function` encapsulates this operation within the TensorFlow graph, allowing its execution to be controlled by the graph's dependencies. The Python-based assignment ensures the correct order while leveraging NumPy's efficient in-place modification.  However, this method introduces a potential performance bottleneck, as it necessitates a transition between TensorFlow's computational graph and Python's interpreter.  Therefore, it's best reserved for situations where the level of control surpasses the capabilities of purely TensorFlow-based methods.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections covering variable management, control flow, and graph construction, provides the most comprehensive information.  Further detailed understanding can be gained from exploring resources on computational graphs and parallel programming concepts, specifically in the context of deep learning frameworks.  Consult textbooks focused on distributed and parallel algorithms for a more theoretical foundation.  Finally, reviewing TensorFlow's source code itself for relevant modules (such as `tf.control_dependencies` implementation) can provide invaluable insight.  Studying example code and tutorials related to building and optimizing custom training loops in TensorFlow would be highly beneficial.
