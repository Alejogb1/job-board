The root cause of unrecognized CUDA texture functions often stems from inconsistencies between the compiler's understanding of the texture memory configuration and the actual usage within the kernel.  Over my years working with high-performance computing, I've encountered this issue numerous times, particularly when transitioning between different CUDA toolkits or when dealing with legacy code.  The compiler needs explicit declarations and bindings to correctly interpret and utilize texture memory accesses.  Failure to provide these results in compilation errors or, more subtly, incorrect execution.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

CUDA texture memory provides a specialized memory space optimized for read-only access with caching and filtering capabilities.  This is beneficial for applications involving image processing, volume rendering, and other tasks requiring frequent, spatially coherent data access.  However, unlike global memory, accessing texture memory requires specific steps.  The process involves:

* **Texture Object Declaration:**  A texture object must be declared to define the properties of the texture memory, including the data type, dimensionality (1D, 2D, 3D), and filter mode. This declaration essentially creates a handle for the CUDA runtime to manage the texture memory.

* **Texture Binding:**  The declared texture object must be bound to a CUDA array or a linear memory region containing the texture data. This binding links the texture object to the actual data it will access.

* **Texture Function Calls:**  The kernel code then uses specific texture functions (e.g., `tex1Dfetch()`, `tex2D()` etc.) to access data from the bound texture memory.  These functions are intrinsic functions provided by the CUDA runtime, not general-purpose functions you can define yourself.  Their use is crucial for leveraging texture memory's performance advantages.

Failure to correctly perform these steps will lead to compilation errors or, more insidiously, runtime errors resulting in incorrect results or crashes.  The compiler won’t recognize the texture functions if the proper setup isn’t in place, treating them as undefined symbols or leading to incorrect memory addresses being accessed.  Common mistakes include incorrect header inclusion, missing or incorrect texture object declarations, and failing to bind the texture object to the data.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Header Inclusion and Texture Declaration:**

```cuda
__global__ void myKernel(float* output, /* ... missing texture object declaration ... */) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  output[i] = tex2D(texRef, i, 0); // texRef is undefined!
}

int main() {
  // ... other code ...
  // ... missing texture object creation and binding ...
  // ... kernel launch ...
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This code lacks the crucial header inclusion (`#include <texture_fetch_functions.h>`) and  the texture object declaration and binding. The compiler will flag `tex2D` as an undefined symbol.  The proper inclusion of necessary headers and the creation and binding of a texture object are prerequisites.

**Example 2: Incorrect Texture Binding:**

```cuda
#include <texture_fetch_functions.h>

texture<float, 2, cudaReadModeElementType> texRef;

__global__ void myKernel(float* output) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  output[i] = tex2D(texRef, i, 0);
}

int main() {
  // ... allocate and initialize texture data: myTextureData ...

  cudaChannelFormatDesc channelDesc = cudaCreateChannelDesc<float>();
  cudaArray* cuArray;
  cudaMallocArray(&cuArray, &channelDesc, 1024, 1024); //incorrect size?
  cudaMemcpyToArray(cuArray, 0, 0, myTextureData, sizeof(myTextureData), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // ... BINDING IS MISSING HERE ...  This is crucial.

  myKernel<<< ... >>>(...);
  // ...
}
```


**Commentary:** While this example includes the header and declares a texture object, it critically omits the binding step using `cudaBindTextureToArray()`. The `tex2D` function will likely access an incorrect memory location leading to unexpected results or a crash.  The `cudaBindTextureToArray` function is essential for connecting the texture object with the CUDA array containing the texture data. Verify the array's dimensions match the texture object's specification.  Further, ensure correct memory allocation and copying to the device.

**Example 3:  Correct Implementation:**

```cuda
#include <texture_fetch_functions.h>

texture<float, 2, cudaReadModeElementType> texRef;

__global__ void myKernel(float* output) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  output[i] = tex2D(texRef, i, 0);
}

int main() {
  float* h_textureData; // Host-side texture data
  // ... allocate and initialize h_textureData ...
  float* d_textureData; // Device-side texture data
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_textureData, sizeof(float) * 1024 * 1024); // Allocate device memory
  cudaMemcpy(d_textureData, h_textureData, sizeof(float) * 1024 * 1024, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  cudaChannelFormatDesc channelDesc = cudaCreateChannelDesc<float>();
  cudaArray* cuArray;
  cudaMallocArray(&cuArray, &channelDesc, 1024, 1024); //Create CUDA array
  cudaMemcpyToArray(cuArray, 0, 0, d_textureData, sizeof(float) * 1024 * 1024, cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);

  cudaBindTextureToArray(texRef, cuArray, channelDesc); // BINDING is correctly done

  myKernel<<< ... >>>(...);
  // ... deallocate memory ...
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates the correct procedure.  It includes the header, declares the texture object, allocates and copies data to the device, creates a CUDA array to hold the texture data, and *crucially*, binds the texture object to the CUDA array using `cudaBindTextureToArray`.  This ensures the `tex2D` function correctly accesses the intended data in texture memory.  Note the use of `cudaCreateChannelDesc` for proper type specification.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA C Programming Guide, the CUDA Toolkit documentation, and sample code provided within the CUDA toolkit are indispensable resources.  Furthermore, examining successful examples from open-source projects that extensively utilize texture memory can provide invaluable insight.  Thorough understanding of CUDA array creation and management is also crucial.  Debugging tools such as NVIDIA Nsight can greatly assist in identifying and resolving issues related to texture memory access.  Reviewing compiler error messages meticulously often points directly to the source of the problem.
