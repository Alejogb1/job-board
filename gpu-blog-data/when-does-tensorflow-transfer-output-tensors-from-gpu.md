TensorFlow's transfer of tensors between GPU and CPU memory is governed by a complex interplay of factors, primarily driven by the placement of operations within the computation graph and the explicit or implicit memory management strategies employed.  My experience optimizing large-scale deep learning models has highlighted that this seemingly straightforward question necessitates a nuanced understanding of TensorFlow's execution mechanisms.  The key fact is that TensorFlow doesn't automatically transfer tensors unless absolutely necessary; the framework strives to keep computations on the most efficient device.  This seemingly optimal approach, however, often requires careful consideration to avoid performance bottlenecks.

**1. Data Placement and Operation Placement:**

TensorFlow's execution engine relies heavily on the concept of "device placement."  This involves explicitly specifying the device (CPU or GPU) on which each operation within the computation graph will execute.  If an operation is placed on the GPU, its input tensors must reside in GPU memory, and its output tensors will initially be in GPU memory.  Conversely, a CPU-placed operation requires its inputs in CPU memory and produces outputs in CPU memory.  Crucially, the transfer of tensors between devices only occurs when an operation's input requirements and the tensor's current location are mismatched.

Implicit device placement, while convenient, can be a source of unexpected transfers.  If no device is explicitly specified, TensorFlow will attempt to infer the optimal placement.  This inference is based on a number of factors including available resources and the types of operations involved.  However, this automatic placement can lead to suboptimal results if not carefully considered in the context of the overall computation graph structure and data flow.  My experience working with distributed training revealed that inconsistent device placement across nodes resulted in significant communication overhead, significantly impacting performance.

**2.  Session Management and Memory Allocation:**

The TensorFlow `Session` object plays a critical role in memory management and tensor transfer.  When a `Session` is created, TensorFlow allocates memory on the specified devices.  During execution, TensorFlow keeps track of tensor locations and only transfers data when required.  However, improper session management can introduce unnecessary transfers.  For instance, repeatedly creating and destroying sessions can lead to frequent allocations and deallocations, increasing memory overhead and potentially triggering data transfers even when avoidable.  I've encountered this issue during debugging sessions where multiple short-lived sessions were created, leading to significantly slower execution times than anticipated.


**3. Eager Execution vs. Graph Execution:**

The execution mode – eager or graph – significantly impacts tensor transfer behavior.  Eager execution, where operations are executed immediately, tends to have more frequent data transfers compared to graph execution.  In eager execution, each operation is executed sequentially, and data movement is often required to match the operation's location.  Graph execution, conversely, allows TensorFlow to optimize the entire computation graph before execution, reducing the number of data transfers through careful placement and fusion of operations.  Switching from eager execution to graph execution is often a simple adjustment but can yield substantial performance gains in many applications.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Explicit Device Placement:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
  a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], name='a')
  b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], name='b')
  c = a + b  # Addition happens on GPU

with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
  d = tf.sqrt(c) # Square root happens on CPU - transfer from GPU to CPU occurs here

with tf.Session() as sess:
  result = sess.run(d)
  print(result)
```

This example explicitly places `a` and `b` on the GPU and then moves the result `c` to the CPU for the square root operation.  The tensor `c` is transferred from GPU memory to CPU memory because the `tf.sqrt` operation is placed on the CPU.


**Example 2: Implicit Device Placement (Potential for Transfer):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
c = a + b

with tf.Session() as sess:
  result = sess.run(c)
  print(result)
```

In this case, TensorFlow will infer the device placement. If a GPU is available, the addition might happen on the GPU, but if a subsequent operation requires CPU execution, a transfer would be necessary.  This highlights the unpredictability of implicit placement and the potential for hidden data transfers.


**Example 3:  Using `tf.debugging.check_numerics` to identify potential issues:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    x = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
    y = tf.matmul(x, x) #Large matrix multiplication on GPU

    with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
        z = tf.debugging.check_numerics(y, 'Check for NaN/Inf') #Check on CPU (Transfer necessary)

    with tf.Session() as sess:
      try:
          sess.run(z)
      except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
          print(f"Error detected: {e}")
```

This example showcases proactive error checking.  The check for numerical issues is done on the CPU after the computationally intensive GPU operation. The transfer of the potentially large tensor `y` to the CPU is explicit and necessary for the error-checking functionality.



**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation;  advanced texts on deep learning optimization and distributed systems;  research papers focusing on GPU memory management within TensorFlow.  Understanding the underlying CUDA and cuDNN libraries is also beneficial for deeper insights into the GPU interaction.


In conclusion, understanding when TensorFlow transfers tensors between GPU and CPU memory requires a detailed understanding of device placement, session management, execution mode, and the inherent nature of data dependencies within the computation graph.  Careful consideration of these factors and proactive usage of debugging techniques allows for the optimization of data transfer, leading to significantly improved performance and efficiency, as I have personally experienced.
