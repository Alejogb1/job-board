The Frank-Wolfe algorithm, in its standard formulation, assumes linear constraints.  Direct application to problems with nonlinear constraints leads to significant challenges, primarily due to the algorithm's reliance on linear optimization subproblems to find the feasible descent direction. My experience optimizing large-scale portfolio optimization models underscored this limitation.  Adapting the algorithm necessitates a reformulation that effectively handles the nonlinearity.  This response details three distinct approaches, each with its trade-offs.

**1.  Penalty Methods:** This approach converts the constrained problem into an unconstrained one by incorporating the nonlinear constraints into the objective function via penalty terms.  Consider a general nonlinearly constrained problem:

Minimize:  f(x)
Subject to: g<sub>i</sub>(x) ≤ 0, i = 1, ..., m

A penalty function approach would reformulate this as:

Minimize:  f(x) + ρ Σ<sub>i</sub> max(0, g<sub>i</sub>(x))<sup>p</sup>

where ρ is a penalty parameter and p is the power of the penalty term (typically p = 1 or 2).  The penalty parameter controls the weight given to constraint satisfaction.  The Frank-Wolfe algorithm can then be applied to this unconstrained problem.  As ρ increases, the solution of the penalized problem converges to the solution of the original constrained problem.  However, excessively large ρ values can lead to ill-conditioned optimization problems.

**Code Example 1 (Penalty Method):**

```matlab
function [x, fval] = frankWolfePenalty(f, grad_f, g, grad_g, x0, rho, p, maxIter)
  x = x0;
  for i = 1:maxIter
    % Calculate gradient of penalized objective function
    grad_f_pen = grad_f(x) + rho * sum(p * max(0, g(x)).^(p-1) .* grad_g(x), 2);

    % Linearization step (Frank-Wolfe core)
    s = findLinearMin(grad_f_pen); % Function to find linear minimum (details omitted for brevity)
    
    % Line search (finding optimal step size along direction s)
    alpha = lineSearch(f, x, s); % Function to perform line search (details omitted for brevity)

    x = x + alpha * (s - x);
  end
  fval = f(x);
end

%Note: 'findLinearMin' and 'lineSearch' are assumed to be appropriately defined functions
% accounting for the problem's dimensionality.
```

This code snippet demonstrates the fundamental adaptation.  The key modification is the inclusion of the penalty term's gradient in the calculation of the overall gradient.  The `findLinearMin` function would need careful implementation;  a simple gradient descent approach might suffice, particularly if the problem dimensions are not enormous.  The line search ensures that we find a suitable step size along the search direction.

**2.  Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) with Frank-Wolfe Subproblems:**  SQP is a powerful method for nonlinearly constrained optimization.  Its core idea is to approximate the nonlinear problem with a sequence of quadratic programming (QP) subproblems.  Here, we can integrate the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to solve the QP subproblems.  Each iteration involves constructing a QP approximation of the Lagrangian function using the current iterate and its gradients and Hessians.  The Frank-Wolfe algorithm, with its efficiency in solving linear subproblems (which the QP approximation effectively reduces to), can be used to solve this QP subproblem.

**Code Example 2 (SQP with Frank-Wolfe):**

```matlab
function [x, fval] = frankWolfeSQP(f, grad_f, hess_f, g, grad_g, hess_g, x0, maxIter)
  x = x0;
  for i = 1:maxIter
    % Construct QP approximation (details omitted for brevity – involves calculating Hessians)
    % This step requires calculating the Hessian of the Lagrangian.
    [H, c] = constructQPApproximation(f, grad_f, hess_f, g, grad_g, hess_g, x);

    % Solve QP subproblem using Frank-Wolfe (modified to handle QP structure)
    s = frankWolfeQP(H, c); % Modified Frank-Wolfe for QP (details omitted)

    % Line search
    alpha = lineSearch(f, x, s);

    x = x + alpha * s;
  end
  fval = f(x);
end
```

This approach leverages the efficiency of Frank-Wolfe while using SQP's robustness for nonlinear constraints.  The complexity arises in accurately approximating the Hessian of the Lagrangian, which is crucial for convergence.  Approximating Hessians might involve techniques like BFGS updates to improve efficiency.


**3.  Augmented Lagrangian Method:**  This method, similar to the penalty method, combines the objective function with a Lagrangian term.  However, it updates Lagrangian multipliers iteratively to improve constraint satisfaction.

**Code Example 3 (Augmented Lagrangian):**

```matlab
function [x, fval] = frankWolfeAugmentedLagrangian(f, grad_f, g, grad_g, x0, lambda, mu, maxIter)
  x = x0;
  for i = 1:maxIter
    % Augmented Lagrangian
    L_aug = @(x) f(x) + lambda.' * g(x) + (mu/2) * sum(g(x).^2);
    grad_L_aug = @(x) grad_f(x) + grad_g(x) * lambda + mu * g(x) .* grad_g(x);

    % Frank-Wolfe step using augmented Lagrangian gradient
    s = findLinearMin(grad_L_aug(x));
    alpha = lineSearch(L_aug, x, s);
    x = x + alpha * (s - x);

    % Update Lagrange multipliers
    lambda = lambda + mu * g(x);
  end
  fval = f(x);
end
```

This example shows an iterative update of the Lagrange multipliers, `lambda`,  based on the current constraint violation.  The parameter `mu` controls the penalty strength.  The algorithm iteratively refines the approximation towards the optimal solution.

In conclusion, adapting the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for nonlinear constraints involves a strategic trade-off between computational simplicity and convergence guarantees. The penalty method offers simplicity, while SQP and the augmented Lagrangian method provide more robust convergence, at the expense of increased computational overhead.  The choice depends heavily on the specific problem characteristics and computational resources available.  Each method outlined requires a careful consideration of implementation details, particularly regarding line search techniques and the handling of gradients and Hessians.  My experience has highlighted the importance of choosing an appropriate method based on the problem's structure and scale.
