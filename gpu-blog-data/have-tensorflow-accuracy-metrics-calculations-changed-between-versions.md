TensorFlow's accuracy metric computation didn't undergo a fundamental algorithmic shift between versions 1.14 and 2.3, but significant changes in the underlying APIs and the recommended best practices introduced subtle variations that could affect the final reported accuracy, especially when dealing with complex scenarios or custom metrics.  My experience in developing and deploying machine learning models using both versions highlights this crucial distinction.  The core calculation—comparing predicted labels to ground truth labels—remained consistent, but the methods of accessing and manipulating tensors evolved, impacting how one would implement and interpret accuracy calculations.

**1.  Clear Explanation of Potential Discrepancies:**

The discrepancies stem primarily from API changes and the shift towards Keras as the primary high-level API in TensorFlow 2.x.  In TensorFlow 1.x, the `tf.metrics` module provided a functional approach to calculating metrics.  This approach often involved manual tensor manipulation and the use of `tf.Session` for evaluation.  TensorFlow 2.x, with its eager execution mode by default, significantly alters this workflow.  Keras models now integrate metrics directly within the `compile` method, streamlining the process and potentially masking underlying implementation differences.

Furthermore, changes in how TensorFlow handles sparse tensors and one-hot encoding can affect accuracy calculation, especially when dealing with multi-class classification problems.  In older versions,  mismatches in handling sparse labels versus one-hot encoded labels could lead to incorrect accuracy computations if not carefully managed. TensorFlow 2.x, while still permitting both representations, generally encourages more streamlined handling through Keras' `sparse_categorical_accuracy` metric.

Finally, subtle differences in numerical precision and internal optimization routines within TensorFlow’s underlying computation graph could, in very rare cases, produce minute discrepancies in the final accuracy values reported across versions. These discrepancies are typically negligible but could become significant when dealing with extremely large datasets or models with highly sensitive accuracy requirements.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: TensorFlow 1.14 - using `tf.metrics.accuracy`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample data
labels = tf.constant([0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=tf.int32)
predictions = tf.constant([0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.2, 0.7], dtype=tf.float32)
predictions = tf.round(predictions) # Convert probabilities to classes

# Calculate accuracy using tf.metrics.accuracy
accuracy, update_op = tf.metrics.accuracy(labels, predictions)

# Initialize local variables
init_op = tf.group(tf.local_variables_initializer())

# Create a session and run the operations
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init_op)
    sess.run(update_op)
    accuracy_value = sess.run(accuracy)
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_value) # Output: Accuracy: 0.8
```

*Commentary:*  This exemplifies the TensorFlow 1.x approach. Note the explicit variable initialization and session management.  The `tf.round` function is used to discretize the probability output into class labels. This was common practice, though potentially less efficient.


**Example 2: TensorFlow 2.3 - using Keras `compile` and `sparse_categorical_accuracy`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Sample data
labels = tf.constant([0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=tf.int32)
predictions = tf.constant([[0.1, 0.9], [0.2, 0.8], [0.3, 0.7], [0.8, 0.2], [0.3, 0.7]], dtype=tf.float32)

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['sparse_categorical_accuracy'])
accuracy = model.evaluate(predictions,labels)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy[1])
```

*Commentary:* This demonstrates the streamlined approach in TensorFlow 2.x using Keras.  The accuracy metric is directly specified during model compilation. `sparse_categorical_accuracy` is used, which directly handles integer labels without requiring explicit one-hot encoding, simplifying the code and potentially increasing efficiency.  The model is a placeholder; the focus is on the accuracy calculation.


**Example 3: TensorFlow 2.3 - Custom Metric Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def custom_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred = tf.round(tf.nn.softmax(y_pred)) #Handle probabilities to class labels for custom metric
    correct_predictions = tf.equal(y_true, tf.cast(y_pred, tf.int32))
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_predictions, tf.float32))

# Sample data (same as example 2)
labels = tf.constant([0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=tf.int32)
predictions = tf.constant([[0.1, 0.9], [0.2, 0.8], [0.3, 0.7], [0.8, 0.2], [0.3, 0.7]], dtype=tf.float32)

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=[custom_accuracy])
accuracy = model.evaluate(predictions, labels)
print("Custom Accuracy:", accuracy[1])

```

*Commentary:* This illustrates how one might implement a custom accuracy metric in TensorFlow 2.x.  This allows for greater control and flexibility but requires a more thorough understanding of TensorFlow’s tensor manipulation capabilities.  Here, the softmax activation and rounding are handled explicitly within the custom metric.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation for both versions 1.x and 2.x.  Comprehensive textbooks on TensorFlow and deep learning.  Advanced tutorials focusing on custom metric implementation within Keras.  Research papers discussing the intricacies of accuracy metrics in different machine learning contexts.



In conclusion, while the fundamental principle of accuracy calculation remains unchanged, the practical implementation and the resulting subtle numerical variations across TensorFlow 1.14 and 2.3 necessitate careful attention to API changes, best practices, and the appropriate handling of data representations.  The examples provided demonstrate the crucial differences and highlight the transition towards the Keras-centric approach of TensorFlow 2.x, which simplifies many aspects of model development and evaluation, including the calculation of accuracy metrics.  A thorough understanding of these changes is essential for ensuring consistency and accuracy in machine learning projects utilizing different TensorFlow versions.
