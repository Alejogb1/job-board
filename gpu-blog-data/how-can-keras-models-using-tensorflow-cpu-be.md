Migrating a Keras model trained on TensorFlow CPU to utilize GPU acceleration involves several key steps centered around configuring TensorFlow to recognize and use your NVIDIA GPU. The fundamental requirement is ensuring that the appropriate NVIDIA drivers, CUDA Toolkit, and cuDNN library are installed and correctly configured for your system. Without these dependencies, TensorFlow will default to the CPU, regardless of your model's design or your intention to use a GPU. This is because TensorFlow does not inherently handle GPU hardware directly; it relies on these NVIDIA-provided resources to interact with the GPU's processing capabilities.

My initial experience with TensorFlow centered on CPU usage due to the initial simplicity and accessibility of that configuration. Later, as I dealt with larger models and datasets, the performance limitations of CPU became apparent, motivating my exploration of GPU acceleration. I encountered challenges initially, particularly with version incompatibilities between TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN. Getting these aligned correctly is crucial, often requiring very specific combinations. The process is not automatic; simply having a GPU does not automatically enable TensorFlow to leverage it. The critical part involves directing TensorFlow to the GPU device specifically.

The migration process involves several stages. First, confirming GPU availability is paramount. TensorFlow provides methods to list available devices. This confirmation prevents wasted effort debugging code that’s simply never interacting with the GPU. Next, I generally explicitly specify the device to use when constructing model components and during the training loop. This manual approach gives me greater control and ensures no unintentional reliance on CPU fallback. Finally, monitoring utilization using system tools or TensorFlow-provided profiling utilities is vital to confirming that the GPU is indeed being engaged during the computations. I found that relying on a “fire and forget” approach could lead to a silent return to CPU, with degraded performance and no clear indications of the problem.

Let's examine specific code examples illustrating this process. Assume we are dealing with a relatively simple convolutional neural network (CNN) built with Keras, initially trained on CPU, and now intended to run on GPU:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Confirm that TensorFlow can 'see' the GPU
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  print("GPUs are available:", gpus)
else:
  print("No GPUs were found. Will run on CPU.")

# Example CNN model (modified for clarity)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Generate some dummy data for demonstration
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255.0
x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255.0
x_train = np.expand_dims(x_train, axis=-1)
x_test = np.expand_dims(x_test, axis=-1)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model (will run on GPU if it's available and set)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, batch_size=32)
```
This first example serves as a baseline to confirm if the GPU is even detected. The `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` line retrieves a list of all available physical GPU devices. This helps you understand whether the issue lies with TensorFlow's visibility of your GPU or the model's configuration. The print output indicates whether or not GPUs are detected, and training proceeds with CPU in the case of none being found. The rest of the code creates a simple CNN and trains it without specifically targeting the GPU. The model will run on CPU if the GPU is not correctly configured for use with Tensorflow.

Now let's look at a second example that explicitly defines the device context for computations:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Check for GPU availability
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
    print("GPU found, configuring training")
    # Set the GPU as the default device
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Assuming single GPU, adjust index if needed
      model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
        keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        keras.layers.Flatten(),
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
        ])
        # Generate data and compile model (same as before)
      (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
      x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255.0
      x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255.0
      x_train = np.expand_dims(x_train, axis=-1)
      x_test = np.expand_dims(x_test, axis=-1)

      model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                    loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                    metrics=['accuracy'])


      model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, batch_size=32)
else:
  print("No GPUs found, defaulting to CPU")
  # Same model and training if GPU not detected (same code as in the first example)
  model = keras.Sequential([
      keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
      keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
      keras.layers.Flatten(),
      keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
      ])

  (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
  x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255.0
  x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255.0
  x_train = np.expand_dims(x_train, axis=-1)
  x_test = np.expand_dims(x_test, axis=-1)


  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])
  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, batch_size=32)


```
In this improved example, a context manager, `tf.device('/GPU:0')`, is used to ensure all operations within the block, including model creation, are run on the designated GPU. The index `0` assumes you have a single GPU. For multi-GPU systems, you would iterate over available GPUs and distribute model components or data accordingly. It is critical that this is executed before the model layers are instantiated, as they are allocated to the default device at that time. If no GPUs are detected, the code falls back to a similar CPU implementation as the first example. This ensures that the code will still run, and provides feedback in case GPU availability is the problem.

For a third, more explicit approach let’s demonstrate utilizing `tf.distribute.Strategy`
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Check for GPU availability and distribute across available GPUs
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
  print("GPUs found, configuring distributed training")
  strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy() # Use Mirrored Strategy for distributed GPU training
  with strategy.scope():
      model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
        keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        keras.layers.Flatten(),
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
        ])
      # Generate data and compile model (same as before)
      (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
      x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255.0
      x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255.0
      x_train = np.expand_dims(x_train, axis=-1)
      x_test = np.expand_dims(x_test, axis=-1)

      model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                    loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                    metrics=['accuracy'])


  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, batch_size=32)
else:
  print("No GPUs found, defaulting to CPU")
  # Same model and training if GPU not detected
  model = keras.Sequential([
      keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
      keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
      keras.layers.Flatten(),
      keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
      ])

  (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
  x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255.0
  x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255.0
  x_train = np.expand_dims(x_train, axis=-1)
  x_test = np.expand_dims(x_test, axis=-1)


  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])
  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, batch_size=32)

```
This example uses `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`, enabling the model to be mirrored across multiple GPUs, if available. The strategy handles distributing the computations and synchronizing results. Similar to the last example, everything model specific is contained within the scope of the context manager, ensuring that the distributed computation occurs where intended. If no GPUs are found, the fallback CPU code is used, as in previous cases. This approach is very useful for distributed training, since TensorFlow and the strategy handle most of the complexities in mapping models and data to available compute.

Regarding further resources, I would highly recommend exploring NVIDIA’s documentation for the CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN, particularly the installation guides and release notes. The official TensorFlow website has excellent tutorials on GPU usage, including multi-GPU and distributed training techniques. Finally, online forums and communities are invaluable for troubleshooting specific hardware configurations or incompatibility issues. They provided support during my own experiences. Specific topics to research in these resources include the proper environment setup, using `tf.config.experimental`, various distribution strategies, and profiling.
