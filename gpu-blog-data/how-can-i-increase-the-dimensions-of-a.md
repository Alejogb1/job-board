TensorFlow tensors, by their very nature, are immutable. Consequently, directly 'increasing' their dimensions, in the sense of altering the tensor in-place, is not possible. The process instead involves the creation of a new tensor with the desired dimensions, derived from the original. This is commonly achieved using various TensorFlow operations that rearrange or expand the existing data. I’ve encountered this often during my work building custom neural network architectures, where manipulating tensor shapes to align with specific layer inputs is crucial. The key operations revolve around concepts like broadcasting, padding, and reshaping, which form the bedrock of effective tensor manipulation in TensorFlow.

The general methods for increasing tensor dimensions fall broadly into three categories: adding new singleton dimensions (often for broadcasting), padding with additional values, and reshaping to reinterpret the data's organization. Understanding the distinctions between these methods is critical for leveraging TensorFlow effectively. Let’s examine them in detail.

**1. Adding Singleton Dimensions:**

This approach adds dimensions with a size of 1. These extra dimensions don’t modify the underlying data, but provide opportunities for broadcasting during operations with tensors of different rank. Operations that benefit from broadcasting include element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which require conformable shapes. A practical example is where a weight tensor might need to be broadcast across all samples in a batch.

*Example Code:*

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.float32)
print("Original Tensor Shape:", original_tensor.shape)

# Expand dimensions with tf.expand_dims at position 0
expanded_tensor_1 = tf.expand_dims(original_tensor, axis=0)
print("Expanded Tensor 1 Shape:", expanded_tensor_1.shape)

# Expand dimensions with tf.expand_dims at position 1
expanded_tensor_2 = tf.expand_dims(original_tensor, axis=1)
print("Expanded Tensor 2 Shape:", expanded_tensor_2.shape)

# Expand dimensions with tf.newaxis (shorthand)
expanded_tensor_3 = original_tensor[tf.newaxis, :]
print("Expanded Tensor 3 Shape:", expanded_tensor_3.shape)

expanded_tensor_4 = original_tensor[:, tf.newaxis]
print("Expanded Tensor 4 Shape:", expanded_tensor_4.shape)
```
*Commentary:*
This code demonstrates the primary mechanism for inserting singleton dimensions: `tf.expand_dims` allows specific placement of the new dimension by the `axis` parameter. This operation does not create new elements; it merely changes the tensor's shape. Also demonstrated is the use of `tf.newaxis` as a concise way to achieve the same result through slicing notation, which I often utilize for clarity. The results clearly show how adding the axis at different positions yields different shapes. In particular, expanded_tensor_1 has a shape of (1,3), while expanded_tensor_2 has a shape of (3,1), both from the original shape (3).  The use of `tf.newaxis` is functionally equivalent. This technique is highly useful during broadcasting.

**2. Padding Dimensions:**

Padding is employed when it is necessary to increase the size of a tensor with constant values. This is useful in situations such as preparing batches of data with varying lengths, or aligning feature maps for concatenation operations. Common padding values include zero, although any constant can be chosen. There are different techniques including pre-padding, post-padding, or mirroring. This ensures that the data is aligned and of the correct shape before feeding into different operations.

*Example Code:*

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original 2D tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=tf.float32)
print("Original Tensor Shape:", original_tensor.shape)

# Pad to (3, 4) with zeros using tf.pad
padded_tensor_1 = tf.pad(original_tensor, [[1, 0], [1, 2]], constant_values=0)
print("Padded Tensor 1 Shape:", padded_tensor_1.shape)
print("Padded Tensor 1:\n", padded_tensor_1.numpy())

# Pad to (3,4) with ones, post-padding only
padded_tensor_2 = tf.pad(original_tensor, [[0, 1], [0, 2]], constant_values = 1)
print("Padded Tensor 2 Shape:", padded_tensor_2.shape)
print("Padded Tensor 2:\n", padded_tensor_2.numpy())
```
*Commentary:*
The `tf.pad` function uses a padding list which details how many elements to pad before and after each dimension.  Padding is done before, after, or both in the shape dimensions. In this specific example, in `padded_tensor_1`, `[[1, 0], [1, 2]]` indicates that one row should be added before and none after the row dimension, while one column will be added before, and two after in the column dimension.  A constant value of zero was chosen to pad with, which results in `[[0,0,0,0], [1,2,0,0], [3,4,0,0]]`. Likewise `padded_tensor_2` demonstrates padding with a constant 1, and by only padding post-dimension, the result is `[[1,2,1,1], [3,4,1,1], [1,1,1,1]]`. The practical benefit of padding is that tensors can be brought to conformable shapes, even when the original data is of varying size.

**3. Reshaping Dimensions:**

Reshaping involves reinterpreting the existing data's layout, without adding or removing elements. This is useful when a certain data structure needs to conform to the input format of a layer, or when you need to re-organize data for further processing. Reshaping has to maintain the original number of elements.

*Example Code:*

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original 1D tensor with 12 elements
original_tensor = tf.constant(range(12), dtype=tf.float32)
print("Original Tensor Shape:", original_tensor.shape)

# Reshape to a 2D tensor of (3, 4)
reshaped_tensor_1 = tf.reshape(original_tensor, (3, 4))
print("Reshaped Tensor 1 Shape:", reshaped_tensor_1.shape)
print("Reshaped Tensor 1:\n", reshaped_tensor_1.numpy())

# Reshape to a 3D tensor of (2, 2, 3)
reshaped_tensor_2 = tf.reshape(original_tensor, (2, 2, 3))
print("Reshaped Tensor 2 Shape:", reshaped_tensor_2.shape)
print("Reshaped Tensor 2:\n", reshaped_tensor_2.numpy())

# Infer the second dimension size with '-1'
reshaped_tensor_3 = tf.reshape(original_tensor, (3, -1))
print("Reshaped Tensor 3 Shape:", reshaped_tensor_3.shape)
print("Reshaped Tensor 3:\n", reshaped_tensor_3.numpy())

```
*Commentary:*
The `tf.reshape` function allows one to redefine the organization of the tensor.  In this code snippet, a 1D tensor of shape `(12)` is reorganized into shapes of `(3,4)` and `(2,2,3)`, demonstrating different dimensionalities. Crucially, both operations maintain the same 12 elements from the original tensor.  I've found the `-1` placeholder very useful, allowing TensorFlow to calculate the necessary dimension based on the total size and the other dimensions specified. This flexibility is convenient when dealing with different batch sizes, or similar situations where you don't want to manually calculate a specific dimension. Notice that the reshape operation, as opposed to padding or expanding dimensions, does not add new data but reorganizes the original values. This makes it an important operation for adapting tensors to compatible shapes for further computations, and is often the basis of input layers for neural networks.

In summary, increasing the dimensionality of a TensorFlow tensor involves creating new tensors based on the original by employing functions such as `tf.expand_dims`, `tf.pad`, and `tf.reshape`. These operations are not mutative, and hence, understanding that they create new tensors based on the original data is important. Selecting the appropriate method depends on the specific requirements of the task. Expanding dimensions is useful for broadcasting, padding for alignment, and reshaping for data reorganization. While often these three techniques work together, their distinct functionalities are crucial for creating robust data processing pipelines in TensorFlow.

Further resources to explore these topics are plentiful. The official TensorFlow documentation provides in-depth explanations and tutorials for each function. I also recommend looking into general documentation on linear algebra concepts related to tensor shapes, which can help build a more comprehensive understanding of how these transformations affect data. Reading case studies of TensorFlow models, focusing on pre-processing techniques and data input handling, can give you real-world examples of how these techniques are employed. Finally, reviewing academic papers that detail the rationale behind the architecture design of neural networks will explain the need for these tensor manipulation techniques.
