TensorFlow's behavior regarding tensor shape preservation during slicing is nuanced, depending critically on the slicing mechanism employed and the context of the operation.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects involving millions of image patches consistently revealed that while TensorFlow generally attempts to infer and propagate shape information, explicit shape specification often proves necessary for optimal performance and to prevent runtime errors.  This stems from TensorFlow's dynamic nature; the framework needs sufficient information to compile efficient execution graphs, particularly with operations involving potentially variable-sized tensors.


**1. Explanation of TensorFlow Slicing and Shape Inference**

TensorFlow's slicing operations, primarily achieved using array indexing (similar to NumPy), extract subsets of a tensor.  The fundamental principle guiding shape preservation is the *static shape analysis* performed by the TensorFlow compiler. This analysis, based on the provided slicing indices and the original tensor's shape, attempts to determine the resulting tensor's shape *before* execution.  If the analysis can definitively determine the shape based solely on constant indices, the resulting tensor will possess a statically defined shape.  However, if the indices themselves are tensors or variables with dynamically determined values (e.g., placeholders or the result of a previous operation), the resulting slice will likely have a dynamic shape. This dynamic shape is represented internally but might not be immediately apparent during inspection unless specifically queried.

The complexity arises when combining slicing with other operations. For instance, a slice taken from a tensor with a dynamic shape might feed into a subsequent operation that requires a static shape.  In such scenarios, TensorFlow may need additional shape information to perform efficient computations or might raise an error if a shape conflict is detected during graph construction or execution.  This necessitates careful consideration of the slicing indices and the downstream operations that utilize the slice.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate various slicing scenarios and their impact on shape preservation within TensorFlow.  I've included detailed comments to clarify the observed behavior in each case.

**Example 1: Static Slicing with Constant Indices**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor with a static shape
tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Slice the tensor using constant indices
slice_tensor = tensor[1:2, 0:2]  # Extract a 1x2 sub-tensor

# Print the shape of the sliced tensor
print(slice_tensor.shape)  # Output: (1, 2)

# Print the sliced tensor itself
print(slice_tensor)       # Output: tf.Tensor([[4 5]], shape=(1, 2), dtype=int32)
```

In this example, the slicing indices are constant integers. TensorFlow's static shape analysis can readily determine the shape of the resulting slice, leading to a statically defined shape of (1, 2).  This is a typical scenario where shape preservation is straightforward.


**Example 2: Dynamic Slicing with Variable Indices**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor with a static shape
tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Define a variable for the slicing index
start_index = tf.Variable(1, dtype=tf.int32)

# Slice the tensor using the variable index
slice_tensor = tensor[start_index:start_index+1, 0:2]

# Print the shape of the sliced tensor (Note: this will be dynamic)
print(slice_tensor.shape)  # Output: (1, 2) - but it's actually dynamic.

# Execute a session to see the actual value and shape.
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(slice_tensor)) # Output: [[4 5]]
    print(sess.run(slice_tensor.shape)) # Output: (1, 2) - this is consistent because we started with start_index = 1

    start_index.assign(0) # Change the variable
    print(sess.run(slice_tensor)) # Output: [[1 2]]
    print(sess.run(slice_tensor.shape)) # Output: (1, 2) - shape remains (1, 2) even though data changed
```

Here, the `start_index` variable introduces dynamism.  While TensorFlow might initially infer a shape based on the initial value of `start_index`, this shape is effectively dynamic.  The true shape is only determined during runtime, based on the actual value of `start_index`.  The output reflects that the shape is still (1, 2) *after runtime execution*, but the data within the tensor changes. This highlights the distinction between inferred shape and the runtime shape. The shape remains statically declared (1, 2) but the actual values are dynamically computed.


**Example 3: Slicing and Reshaping for Explicit Shape Control**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor with a static shape
tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Slice the tensor
slice_tensor = tensor[:, 0:2] #Extract all rows, first two columns

# Reshape the slice to explicitly define its shape
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(slice_tensor, [6, 1])

# Print the shape of the reshaped tensor
print(reshaped_tensor.shape)  # Output: (6, 1)
```

This example showcases explicit shape control using `tf.reshape`.  Even if the slice had a dynamic shape initially, `tf.reshape` forces a specific, static shape onto the resulting tensor. This is crucial when feeding tensors into operations requiring predetermined shapes. This is particularly useful when dealing with operations like convolutional layers which strictly enforce their input tensor shapes.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow's tensor manipulation, I recommend thoroughly studying the official TensorFlow documentation, focusing on sections related to tensor slicing, shape manipulation functions, and the intricacies of static vs. dynamic shapes.  Furthermore, a robust grasp of linear algebra and matrix operations is invaluable for comprehending the underlying mathematics of tensor manipulations.  Finally, exploring TensorFlow's debugging tools, especially those related to shape inspection, proves crucial for diagnosing shape-related issues in complex models.  These resources offer practical, step-by-step guidance in managing tensor shapes effectively.
