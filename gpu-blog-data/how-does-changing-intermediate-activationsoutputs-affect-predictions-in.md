The impact of altering intermediate activations within a TensorFlow 2/Keras model profoundly affects the model's learned representations and ultimately, its predictive capabilities.  This isn't simply a matter of tweaking hyperparameters;  it fundamentally changes the information flow and transformation within the network.  In my experience optimizing large-scale image classification models for medical diagnostics, I've observed firsthand the subtle yet significant consequences of these modifications.  The non-linearity introduced by activation functions shapes the decision boundaries learned by the model, and altering them can lead to shifts in performance, ranging from minor improvements to complete model failure.

**1. Explanation:**

A Keras model comprises layers, each performing a specific transformation on its input.  The output of each layer, before passing to the next, is termed the 'intermediate activation'.  Activation functions, applied to these intermediate activations, introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex, non-linear relationships within the data.  Common examples include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, tanh, and variations such as Leaky ReLU and ELU.  These functions define the model's capacity to represent data;  a ReLU, for example, allows for sparse representations, while a sigmoid constrains outputs to the range (0, 1), often used in binary classification.

Modifying intermediate activations influences several aspects of the model:

* **Gradient Flow:** The choice of activation function directly impacts the gradient during backpropagation.  Functions with vanishing or exploding gradients (like sigmoid and tanh in extreme cases) can hinder training, making it difficult to optimize deeper layers. ReLU variants mitigate this issue.  Altering activations can therefore impact the optimization process itself.

* **Representation Learning:** Each activation function transforms the data in a unique way. Changing it alters the feature representation learned by the network.  A ReLU might emphasize positive features while suppressing negative ones, leading to different decision boundaries than a tanh function, which considers both positive and negative features equally.  This is crucial for feature extraction and model generalization.

* **Interpretability (to an extent):** While deep learning models are often considered "black boxes," analyzing intermediate activations provides insights into the model's decision-making process. By examining the activations of different layers, we can understand which features are considered important at different stages of processing.  Changing activations can alter these feature importance maps and influence our understanding of what drives predictions.

* **Computational Cost:**  Different activation functions have varying computational costs.  ReLU is generally faster to compute than sigmoid or tanh.  The choice of activation and its impact on training time is a critical aspect, particularly in resource-constrained environments.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Replacing ReLU with Leaky ReLU**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Modifying the model to use LeakyReLU in the first dense layer
modified_model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation=keras.layers.LeakyReLU(alpha=0.1), input_shape=(784,)), # LeakyReLU instead of ReLU
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
modified_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

#Training and comparison would follow here...
```
*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a simple swap of ReLU with LeakyReLU in one layer.  LeakyReLU addresses the "dying ReLU" problem where neurons become inactive, improving gradient flow.  Comparing the performance of `model` and `modified_model` highlights the effect of this relatively minor change.  The alpha parameter controls the slope for negative inputs.

**Example 2:  Introducing a custom activation function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def my_activation(x):
  return tf.math.sigmoid(x) * tf.math.tanh(x) #Example custom activation

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=my_activation), #Custom activation in the second layer
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#... Compilation and Training would follow here
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates the flexibility of Keras. By defining a custom activation function, `my_activation`,  we combine the properties of sigmoid and tanh, potentially creating a unique representation.  This necessitates careful experimentation to determine its suitability and impact on performance, as its properties are less well-established than standard activation functions.

**Example 3: Layer-wise Activation Variation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='tanh'),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='elu'), #ELU in a hidden layer
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#...Compilation and Training would follow here.
```

*Commentary:* This example explores varying activation functions across different layers.  The combination of ReLU, tanh, and ELU potentially creates a richer feature representation due to the different transformation characteristics of each function. This method requires understanding how these different functions interact and carefully selecting functions that complement each other.  Observe the impact of changing the order of layers as well.

Through my years of experience tackling complex deep learning problems, it's become clear that seemingly small changes to activation functions profoundly affect a model's learning dynamics and predictive ability.  Thorough experimentation and validation are paramount when making such adjustments.  The examples above offer a starting point for understanding the nuances involved. Remember that these are just illustrations, and optimal activation function choices are highly dependent on the specific dataset and task.  Systematic exploration and rigorous evaluation are essential to effectively leverage this powerful aspect of model design.
