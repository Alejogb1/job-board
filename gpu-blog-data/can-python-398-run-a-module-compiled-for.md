A Python module compiled for version 3.6, specifically utilizing C extensions, will very likely *not* function correctly in Python 3.9.8 without recompilation. The crux of the issue lies in the Application Binary Interface (ABI) compatibility. During my tenure maintaining a large data processing pipeline using custom Python extensions written in C, this was a frequent source of breakage during upgrades.

The ABI, in the context of Python C extensions, defines how compiled code interacts with the Python interpreter and its internal data structures. This includes function calling conventions, layout of data types, and the overall structure expected by Python. Each Python version can, and often does, introduce changes to its ABI, even between minor releases. While the Python core team strives to maintain a degree of backward compatibility at the *source code* level, this does not extend to compiled artifacts. A C extension compiled against the 3.6 interpreter’s ABI will embed assumptions about memory layout and function prototypes that will almost certainly be different in 3.9.8.

This difference is not merely a matter of version numbers. The internal C data structures that represent Python objects undergo changes across releases. For instance, fields within the `PyObject` structure (the base of all Python objects) might shift their positions in memory. Function calls that directly interact with these structures through C extensions will then be looking at incorrect memory locations or expecting parameters in the wrong registers, potentially leading to segmentation faults, undefined behavior, or silent corruption of data. Additionally, the Python API itself, while attempting to remain stable, may add or remove functions or change their behavior. Any C extension directly using that API would need to be adapted.

Furthermore, precompiled binary formats like `.so` on Linux, `.dll` on Windows, or `.dylib` on MacOS are platform and architecture-specific. Therefore, even if a C extension was somehow miraculously compatible with the ABI of 3.9.8 (which is highly improbable), it would still be tied to the architecture it was initially compiled on. Moving from an x86 system to ARM, for example, would necessitate recompilation regardless of Python versions.

Attempting to import a module built for Python 3.6 into Python 3.9.8 generally produces an `ImportError` with a message hinting at ABI incompatibility or an architecture mismatch. It will almost never "just work," unlike pure Python files where compatibility is mostly guaranteed for most use cases.

Let's illustrate this concept with a contrived C extension and some examples. Assume the following minimal C code that defines a simple module:

```c
// my_module.c

#include <Python.h>

static PyObject* my_function(PyObject* self, PyObject* args) {
    return PyLong_FromLong(42);
}

static PyMethodDef MyMethods[] = {
    {"my_function", my_function, METH_NOARGS, "Returns 42"},
    {NULL, NULL, 0, NULL}        /* Sentinel */
};

static struct PyModuleDef mymodule = {
    PyModuleDef_HEAD_INIT,
    "my_module",   /* name of module */
    NULL, /* module documentation, may be NULL */
    -1,       /* size of per-interpreter state of the module, or -1 if the module keeps state in global variables. */
    MyMethods
};

PyMODINIT_FUNC PyInit_my_module(void) {
    return PyModule_Create(&mymodule);
}
```

**Example 1: Compilation for Python 3.6 and Import in 3.9.8**

First, compile the C code for Python 3.6. Assuming the necessary `python3.6-dev` packages are installed:

```bash
# For python 3.6
gcc -c -fPIC -I/usr/include/python3.6 my_module.c
gcc -shared -o my_module.so my_module.o
```

Now, let’s assume I attempted to import the resultant `my_module.so` within Python 3.9.8 using a simple python script:

```python
# test_import.py
import my_module

print(my_module.my_function())
```

This `test_import.py` script run with python3.9 will almost certainly fail with output similar to the following:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/path/to/test_import.py", line 1, in <module>
    import my_module
ImportError: /path/to/my_module.so: undefined symbol: _Py_NoneStruct
```

The `ImportError` specifically indicates a symbol is not found which is an internal part of the Python API. Specifically the name `_Py_NoneStruct`, which is a Python internal symbol, has different definitions and memory layouts between the version.

**Example 2: Compilation for Python 3.9.8 and successful import**

To make it work, I need to recompile for Python 3.9.8. The compilation process remains the same, but with the correct headers:

```bash
# For python 3.9
gcc -c -fPIC -I/usr/include/python3.9 my_module.c
gcc -shared -o my_module.so my_module.o
```

Now, when running the same `test_import.py` script:

```bash
python3.9 test_import.py
```
The script will now execute successfully and output:

```
42
```

**Example 3: ABI breaking change within 3.x minor versions**

The problem is not limited to just major version changes. If you compiled with the ABI of Python 3.9.2 and try to run with Python 3.9.8, a failure can occur in rare circumstances.  While 3.9.2 and 3.9.8 are very similar, it is not advised to attempt this method. If a specific Python 3.9 patch introduces a change, a different undefined symbol error similar to `_Py_NoneStruct` or a segmentation fault might occur. For illustration, assume an ABI incompatibility has been introduced between 3.9.2 and 3.9.8, even though they share the same major and minor version number, the results would be the same as in Example 1.

To ensure a Python C extension works correctly, it *must* be compiled against the specific Python version it will be used with, and for the correct architecture. This is why many binary packages distribute pre-compiled wheels for each compatible Python version. Relying on a single compiled module across versions is not a recommended practice and can lead to unpredictable and often difficult-to-debug issues.

For deeper understanding of these issues, I recommend consulting the official Python documentation related to C API and ABI compatibility, especially the details on the C API version and related compile-time macros. Resources such as PEP-384, which introduces a stable ABI for C extension modules, and PEP-689 are pertinent to these discussions, specifically regarding stable ABI for the CPython runtime, and the potential for a "limited" C API. Additionally, reviewing the documentation of the `distutils` and `setuptools` packages will help with correct packaging of C extensions. Studying the source code of a few prominent C extension based Python libraries can shed light on best practices related to maintaining ABI compatibility. These resources provide the details on the specific nuances of Python C extension compilation.
