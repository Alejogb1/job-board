The discrepancy between TensorFlow Sequential's expected input shape of 1 and the received input shape of `frames * files` stems fundamentally from a misunderstanding of how the model's input layer interprets data dimensionality and the structure of your input data.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous deep learning projects – particularly those involving time-series data or multi-file datasets – this often arises from an implicit assumption about data reshaping within the model itself.  TensorFlow Sequential, unlike more flexible models, expects a rigidly defined input shape; any mismatch will result in this error.


**1. Clear Explanation**

The error message "ValueError: Input 0 of layer sequential is incompatible with the layer: expected axis 0 of input shape to have value 1 but received input with shape \[frames, files, ...]" indicates that your input data's primary axis (axis 0) has a dimension greater than 1.  TensorFlow Sequential models, by their nature, are designed to process sequences of data, where each sequence is treated as a single sample.  If your data is structured as a two-dimensional array (or higher), where one dimension represents multiple files and the other represents frames within those files, the model interprets each *frame* as a separate sample, not each *file* as a sample.  Therefore, the `frames * files` dimension reflects the total number of "samples" the model sees, while it expects only one sample at a time.

The core problem lies in the preprocessing and reshaping of your input data before it is fed into the model.  The model itself does not inherently handle the concatenation of frames from different files.  This responsibility falls on the preprocessing stage.  The input layer expects a 3D tensor (or higher depending on your data and intended model architecture) with the shape (samples, timesteps, features).  In your case, a single "sample" must be a single file containing all its frames, represented as a 2D array (timesteps, features).

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate this with three examples, demonstrating different ways to correctly preprocess the data for TensorFlow Sequential:

**Example 1:  Reshaping single-file data**

This example focuses on the case where you have multiple files, but each file's data needs to be processed independently.  Each file should be treated as a single input sample.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'data' is a list where each element is a NumPy array representing a single file's data (frames, features)
data = [np.random.rand(100, 3) for _ in range(5)] # 5 files, each with 100 frames and 3 features

#Reshape data to be (number of files, number of frames, number of features)
reshaped_data = np.array(data)

#Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(reshaped_data.shape[1], reshaped_data.shape[2])),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

#Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(reshaped_data, np.random.rand(len(data), 1), epochs=10)
```

Here, we directly reshape the list of NumPy arrays into a 3D tensor suitable for the LSTM layer. The `input_shape` parameter accurately reflects the dimensions of each file's data. Each file is a separate sample.

**Example 2:  Concatenating frames from multiple files**

If your intention is to treat all frames from all files as a single long sequence, you need to concatenate them before feeding the data to the model:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'data' is a list as before
data = [np.random.rand(100, 3) for _ in range(5)]

# Concatenate all frames from all files
concatenated_data = np.concatenate(data, axis=0)

# Reshape for single sample, time-series data
reshaped_data = np.expand_dims(concatenated_data, axis=0) # Adds a sample dimension

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(concatenated_data.shape[0], concatenated_data.shape[1])),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(reshaped_data, np.random.rand(1, 1), epochs=10)
```

This example concatenates all frames, effectively creating one long sequence. We use `np.expand_dims` to add the sample dimension, satisfying the Sequential model's expectation of a single sample.

**Example 3: Handling variable-length sequences**

If your files have different numbers of frames, you can use padding to ensure consistent input length:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

data = [np.random.rand(i, 3) for i in np.random.randint(50, 150, size=5)] # Variable length sequences


# Pad sequences to the maximum length
max_length = max(len(x) for x in data)
padded_data = pad_sequences(data, maxlen=max_length, padding='post', dtype='float32')

#Reshape to (number of files, padded length, number of features)
reshaped_data = np.array(padded_data)

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(reshaped_data.shape[1], reshaped_data.shape[2])),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(reshaped_data, np.random.rand(len(data), 1), epochs=10)

```

This example uses `pad_sequences` to handle variable-length sequences.  Padding is crucial when dealing with sequences of uneven lengths, ensuring consistent input to the LSTM layer.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's data handling, I highly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation. Pay close attention to the sections on input pipelines and data preprocessing.  The Keras documentation provides detailed explanations of Sequential models and the `input_shape` parameter.  Finally, a strong foundation in NumPy array manipulation and reshaping techniques is invaluable for this task.  Reviewing NumPy's documentation on array manipulation functions will prove beneficial in effectively preparing your data for deep learning models.
