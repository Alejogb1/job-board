The crux of gradient computation errors within TensorFlow’s C++ API when leveraging `BuildWhileLoop` frequently stems from improper handling of loop-carried variables or the graph's structural implications on backpropagation. I've encountered this particularly during simulations where the loop's state needs to propagate backward correctly. The key understanding here is that TensorFlow's automatic differentiation requires an explicit and consistent data flow graph; `BuildWhileLoop`, if not used carefully, can obscure or break this flow.

Specifically, the problems manifest primarily as `nullptr` gradient tensors or inconsistent shapes when attempting to calculate gradients with respect to tensors inside or affected by the loop. This is because the loop’s forward pass, when constructed in C++, is not trivially linked to its backward pass as it would be in eager execution with Python or dynamic graphs. Consequently, the gradient computation cannot effectively traverse the computational graph built within the loop.

To illustrate, let's examine three specific scenarios, along with code snippets and how to address their related gradient problems. The first, and most common, issue involves incorrect `outputs` arguments to `BuildWhileLoop`. When a `while` loop iterates and updates a tensor, this updated state becomes a loop-carried variable, and it *must* be listed in the `outputs` argument. If the updated tensor isn't declared as output, it won't be a part of the backward graph, leading to `nullptr` gradients.

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/graph/graph_def_builder.h"
#include "tensorflow/cc/client/client_session.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/platform/env.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"
#include <vector>

using namespace tensorflow;

Status RunGradientExample1() {
    Scope scope = Scope::NewRootScope();
    
    auto initial_val = ops::Const(scope, 0.0f, TensorShape({1}));
    auto loop_var = initial_val;
    auto const_one = ops::Const(scope, 1.0f, TensorShape({1}));
    auto condition = [&](const std::vector<Output>& input) -> Output {
        return ops::Less(scope, input[0], ops::Const(scope, 10.0f, TensorShape({1})));
    };
    
    auto body = [&](const std::vector<Output>& input) -> std::vector<Output> {
       return {ops::Add(scope, input[0], const_one)}; // INCORRECT: Only returns updated loop variable
    };
    
    std::vector<Output> loop_outputs;
    TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(BuildWhileLoop(scope, condition, body, {loop_var}, &loop_outputs));

    auto loop_result = loop_outputs[0]; // Access the final value after the loop.

    auto gradients = ops::gradients::Grad(scope, {loop_result}, {initial_val});
    
    ClientSession session(scope);
    std::vector<Tensor> outputs;
    TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(session.Run({gradients}, &outputs));

    if(outputs[0].NumElements() > 0)
    {
        LOG(INFO) << "Gradient: " << outputs[0].flat<float>()(0);
    }
    else{
         LOG(ERROR) << "Gradient tensor is empty, likely a nullptr.";
    }
    return Status::OK();
}

```

In this example, `body` returns *only* the updated value, which is correct *for the loop's computation*, but insufficient for automatic differentiation. The initial value `initial_val` is the target of the gradient. However, because the output of the loop is not correctly associated with the input loop variable which must be declared as an output, the `gradients` op will fail, often resulting in an empty tensor or a `nullptr` when accessing the gradient value. The critical correction requires specifying  `body` to return both the loop-carried variable (i.e the updated `loop_var`) *and* the updated output which should be used for differentiation. I will demonstrate that in the second example.

The next issue arises when the loop body doesn't preserve the structural consistency of the gradient graph, particularly regarding mutable state. Let's assume a scenario where we want to update an accumulator tensor within a loop. If we directly modify this tensor in the body without explicitly threading it as a loop-carried output, the gradient computation is again disrupted.

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/graph/graph_def_builder.h"
#include "tensorflow/cc/client/client_session.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/platform/env.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"
#include <vector>

using namespace tensorflow;

Status RunGradientExample2() {
  Scope scope = Scope::NewRootScope();

  auto initial_val = ops::Const(scope, 0.0f, TensorShape({1}));
  auto loop_var = initial_val;
  auto const_one = ops::Const(scope, 1.0f, TensorShape({1}));
  auto accumulator = ops::Variable(scope, TensorShape({1}), DT_FLOAT); // State outside the loop
  auto init_accumulator = ops::Assign(scope, accumulator, ops::Const(scope, 0.0f, TensorShape({1})));
  auto condition = [&](const std::vector<Output>& input) -> Output {
      return ops::Less(scope, input[0], ops::Const(scope, 10.0f, TensorShape({1})));
  };

  auto body = [&](const std::vector<Output>& input) -> std::vector<Output> {
      auto updated_var = ops::Add(scope, input[0], const_one);
      auto update_op = ops::AssignAdd(scope, accumulator, input[0]); //Modifying outside variable

      return {updated_var, update_op};
  };

  std::vector<Output> loop_outputs;
  TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(BuildWhileLoop(scope, condition, body, {loop_var}, &loop_outputs));

  auto loop_result = loop_outputs[0];
  auto gradients = ops::gradients::Grad(scope, {loop_result}, {initial_val});
  
  ClientSession session(scope);
  std::vector<Tensor> outputs;
  TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(session.Run({init_accumulator}, nullptr));
  TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(session.Run({gradients}, &outputs));
    if(outputs[0].NumElements() > 0)
    {
        LOG(INFO) << "Gradient: " << outputs[0].flat<float>()(0);
    }
    else{
         LOG(ERROR) << "Gradient tensor is empty, likely a nullptr.";
    }
    return Status::OK();
}
```
Here, `accumulator` is a variable defined outside the `BuildWhileLoop`. The `body` updates it with `ops::AssignAdd`, seemingly accumulating the loop variable. However, because this updated `accumulator` is not explicitly a loop-carried output and also is not an input to the loop, the gradient with respect to `initial_val` will be incorrect or result in `nullptr` values. The `AssignAdd` operation is a mutation of a resource outside of the graph itself, which is problematic for proper gradient propagation.

To correct this, you must treat any value that changes over the course of the loop, and whose state you need for the backward pass, as a *loop-carried variable*.

Finally, consider that the gradient itself might need to be updated *within* the loop. A typical example is where the gradient calculation becomes an iterative process of updating the gradient at each step inside the loop using the output of another operation within the loop.

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/graph/graph_def_builder.h"
#include "tensorflow/cc/client/client_session.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/platform/env.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"
#include <vector>

using namespace tensorflow;

Status RunGradientExample3() {
  Scope scope = Scope::NewRootScope();
  auto initial_val = ops::Const(scope, 0.0f, TensorShape({1}));
  auto initial_grad = ops::Const(scope, 1.0f, TensorShape({1})); // Initial gradient
  auto loop_var = initial_val;
  auto loop_grad = initial_grad;
  auto const_one = ops::Const(scope, 1.0f, TensorShape({1}));

  auto condition = [&](const std::vector<Output>& input) -> Output {
      return ops::Less(scope, input[0], ops::Const(scope, 10.0f, TensorShape({1})));
  };

  auto body = [&](const std::vector<Output>& input) -> std::vector<Output> {
    auto updated_var = ops::Add(scope, input[0], const_one);
    auto updated_grad = ops::Mul(scope, input[1], ops::Const(scope, 0.5f, TensorShape({1}))); // Update the gradient each step.
    return {updated_var, updated_grad};
  };

  std::vector<Output> loop_outputs;
  TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(BuildWhileLoop(scope, condition, body, {loop_var, loop_grad}, &loop_outputs));


  auto loop_result = loop_outputs[0];
  auto final_gradient = loop_outputs[1]; // Access the final gradient

  auto gradients = ops::gradients::Grad(scope, {loop_result}, {initial_val});

  ClientSession session(scope);
  std::vector<Tensor> outputs;
  TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(session.Run({gradients, final_gradient}, &outputs));
    if(outputs[0].NumElements() > 0)
    {
        LOG(INFO) << "Gradient (from Grad Op): " << outputs[0].flat<float>()(0);
        LOG(INFO) << "Gradient (from loop): " << outputs[1].flat<float>()(0);
    }
    else{
        LOG(ERROR) << "Gradient tensor is empty, likely a nullptr.";
    }
    return Status::OK();
}
```

Here, we're explicitly updating a "gradient" within the loop by multiplying by a constant. While not the typical use case of gradients produced with the `Grad` operation, this type of construct is encountered in Reinforcement Learning or more complicated models. The key point here is that `loop_grad` is treated as a loop-carried variable. It's both an input *and* an output to the `body` function; otherwise, TensorFlow will lose the chain of differentiation and produce invalid gradients. You can now see both the results of the gradient produced via the gradient op and the one that has been updated in the loop. The important point is that *both* must be treated as loop-carried variables.

In summary, effective gradient computation when using `BuildWhileLoop` in TensorFlow's C++ API requires a meticulous understanding of data flow within the loop and its implications for backpropagation. Specifically, ensure that all loop-carried variables, including those needed for the backward pass like mutable variables or intermediate gradient computations, are treated as explicit inputs *and* outputs of the loop body. These outputs must be incorporated in the final output list of the `BuildWhileLoop` call. Failure to maintain this structural consistency between the forward and backward passes results in erroneous gradient tensors or `nullptr` values.

Regarding resources, the official TensorFlow C++ API documentation offers details about the individual operations. It is highly beneficial to study the API, especially those related to `BuildWhileLoop` and gradient computation. I would also recommend examining source code examples within the TensorFlow repository, particularly in the `tensorflow/cc/tutorials` directory, as well as studying implementations of more advanced models where loop operations are more common.
