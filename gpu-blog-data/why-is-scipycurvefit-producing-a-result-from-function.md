The `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` function demands strictly numerical input; specifically, it expects the residual function to return a NumPy array of floating-point numbers with a shape compatible with the provided data.  The "Result from function call is not a proper array of floats" error arises when this condition is violated.  In my years working on signal processing and data analysis projects, I've encountered this repeatedly, often stemming from subtle type mismatches or unexpected array dimensions within the custom function being fitted.  The solution necessitates careful examination of both the data and the fitting function's output.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core problem lies in the incompatibility between the output of the user-defined function passed to `curve_fit` and the expectations of the optimization algorithm.  `curve_fit` relies on minimizing the sum of squares of residuals.  These residuals are calculated by subtracting the model's predictions (from the user-defined function) from the observed data.  If the user-defined function doesn't return a NumPy array of floats with the correct shape, this subtraction operation fails, leading to the error.  This can manifest in several ways:

* **Incorrect data types:** The function might return an array containing integers, complex numbers, or objects of other types.  `curve_fit` strictly requires floating-point numbers.
* **Incorrect array dimensions:** The output array's shape might be incompatible with the shape of the observed data. For instance, if fitting a single dataset with `N` data points, the function should return an array of shape `(N,)` or `(N,1)`.  Providing a scalar, a multi-dimensional array (e.g., `(N,M)` with `M > 1`), or an array of incorrect length will trigger the error.
* **Implicit type conversions:**  Type coercion within the fitting function (e.g., integer division yielding an integer rather than a float) can subtly introduce incorrect data types into the output.
* **Exceptions within the fitting function:** If an exception occurs within the function's calculations, it could lead to unexpected outputs, causing `curve_fit` to fail.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Type**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

def faulty_function(x, a, b):
    return np.array([a*i + b for i in x], dtype=int) #Incorrect dtype

xdata = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
ydata = 2*xdata + 1 + np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)

popt, pcov = curve_fit(faulty_function, xdata, ydata) #Will raise error
```

This example demonstrates a common mistake: using `dtype=int` within the `faulty_function`. This forces the output to be an array of integers, violating `curve_fit`'s requirement for floats.  Correcting this by removing the `dtype` argument (or setting it to `float`) solves the problem.


**Example 2: Incorrect Array Dimensions**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

def dimensionally_faulty_function(x, a, b):
    return np.array([[a*i + b] for i in x]) #Incorrect dimensions

xdata = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
ydata = 2*xdata + 1 + np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)

popt, pcov = curve_fit(dimensionally_faulty_function, xdata, ydata) #Will raise error
```

Here, the function returns a two-dimensional array, even though it models a one-dimensional relationship. This mismatch triggers the error. The correct form should return a 1D array, `np.array([a*i + b for i in x])`.


**Example 3: Exception Handling within the Fitting Function**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

def exception_prone_function(x, a, b):
    try:
        return a*x + b
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return np.array([np.nan]*len(x)) #Returning NaN array instead of raising exception.

xdata = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
ydata = 2*xdata + 1 + np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)

popt, pcov = curve_fit(exception_prone_function, xdata, ydata) #Might still raise error depending on the exception
```

In this example, the `exception_prone_function` includes a `try-except` block.  While it attempts to gracefully handle exceptions,  returning an array containing `np.nan` values can still cause `curve_fit` to fail if not carefully handled.  A more robust solution would involve handling the exception in a way that prevents the function from returning non-numeric data or an array of inconsistent shape.  A better approach would be to raise the exception directly instead of creating and returning an array.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official SciPy documentation for detailed explanations of `curve_fit`'s parameters and expected inputs.  Review introductory and advanced texts on numerical optimization and curve fitting.  Explore resources on NumPy array manipulation and data type handling. Understanding vectorization and broadcasting in NumPy is crucial for efficiency and avoiding type errors in the fitting function.  Examine examples of successful curve-fitting implementations in the context of your specific application (e.g., signal processing, statistical modelling) to gain insight into common practices and avoid pitfalls.  Thorough debugging techniques, including print statements to inspect variable types and shapes at various points within the fitting function, are invaluable in identifying the source of the error.
