The core issue lies in understanding the underlying data structure and applying the appropriate reshaping operation.  My experience working with large-scale sensor data, specifically in the context of environmental monitoring projects, frequently involved this type of data transformation.  The input array, with dimensions [n*7, 12], represents a flattened or vectorized representation of a higher-dimensional dataset. To achieve the desired output of [n, 7, 12], we need to effectively unflatten this structure, interpreting it as a three-dimensional array. This requires a precise understanding of how the initial flattening occurred.  Assuming a row-major ordering (the default in most array libraries), we can reconstruct the original three-dimensional structure through array reshaping and potentially a transposition.

**1.  Explanation of the Reshaping Process**

The input array [n*7, 12] implies that we initially had a dataset comprising `n` instances, each represented by 7 features, where each feature contains 12 data points. This could be, for instance, 7 sensors recording 12 measurements over some period, repeated for `n` trials. The flattening process combined these `n` instances, stacking them one after the other.  Therefore, each row in the [n*7, 12] matrix represents a concatenated set of feature data from a single instance.

To reshape this, we must first determine the correct number of instances (`n`).  While not explicitly provided, the total number of rows (n*7) provides a clear indication.  Given `n*7` rows, dividing this by 7 will yield the value of `n`.  This is crucial; incorrect determination of `n` will lead to an incorrect reshaping and an erroneous interpretation of the data.

Following this, using a suitable array library function, we can reshape the data into a three-dimensional array of shape [n, 7, 12]. This fundamentally involves a rearrangement of the data elements, mapping each row in the original [n*7, 12] array into the correct position within the new [n, 7, 12] structure. This process is often implicitly handled by these libraries without explicit transposition.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The examples below use three common array libraries: NumPy (Python), MATLAB, and R. Each demonstrates the reshaping process.  Note that error handling for incorrect input dimensions is omitted for brevity but should always be included in production code.

**2.1 NumPy (Python)**

```python
import numpy as np

def reshape_data(flattened_data):
    """Reshapes a flattened data array.

    Args:
        flattened_data: A NumPy array of shape [n*7, 12].

    Returns:
        A NumPy array of shape [n, 7, 12], or None if reshaping fails.
    """
    rows, cols = flattened_data.shape
    n = rows // 7  # Calculate n
    try:
        reshaped_data = flattened_data.reshape(n, 7, cols)
        return reshaped_data
    except ValueError:
        return None #Handle invalid shape

# Example usage:
n = 100
flattened_array = np.random.rand(n*7, 12)
reshaped_array = reshape_data(flattened_array)
if reshaped_array is not None:
    print(f"Reshaped array shape: {reshaped_array.shape}")
else:
    print("Reshaping failed due to invalid input dimensions.")

```

This Python code utilizes NumPyâ€™s `reshape()` function, directly achieving the desired transformation after calculating `n`. The `try-except` block ensures robust error handling.

**2.2 MATLAB**

```matlab
function reshapedData = reshape_data(flattenedData)
  % Reshapes a flattened data array.
  %
  % Args:
  %   flattenedData: A matrix of size [n*7, 12].
  %
  % Returns:
  %   A 3D array of size [n, 7, 12], or an error message if reshaping fails.

  [rows, cols] = size(flattenedData);
  n = floor(rows / 7);  % Calculate n, using floor for integer division
  if mod(rows,7) ~= 0
      error('Invalid input dimensions: Number of rows must be a multiple of 7');
  end
  try
      reshapedData = reshape(flattenedData, n, 7, cols);
  catch ME
      error(['Reshaping failed: ' ME.message]);
  end
end

% Example usage:
n = 100;
flattenedArray = rand(n*7, 12);
reshapedArray = reshape_data(flattenedArray);
disp(['Reshaped array size: ' num2str(size(reshapedArray))]);
```

The MATLAB code employs the `reshape()` function similarly, incorporating error checking to verify the divisibility of rows by 7 and handling potential exceptions during the reshaping operation.


**2.3 R**

```R
reshape_data <- function(flattened_data) {
  # Reshapes a flattened data array.

  # Args:
  #   flattened_data: A matrix of size [n*7, 12].

  # Returns:
  #   A 3D array of size [n, 7, 12], or an error message if reshaping fails.

  rows <- nrow(flattened_data)
  cols <- ncol(flattened_data)
  n <- rows %/% 7 # Integer division in R
  if (rows %% 7 != 0) {
    stop("Invalid input dimensions: Number of rows must be a multiple of 7")
  }
  
  array(flattened_data, dim = c(n, 7, cols))
}

# Example usage:
n <- 100
flattened_array <- matrix(rnorm(n*7*12), nrow = n*7, ncol = 12)
reshaped_array <- reshape_data(flattened_array)
print(paste("Reshaped array dimensions:", dim(reshaped_array)))

```

The R code uses the `array()` function, specifying the desired dimensions explicitly.  Error handling is again integrated to manage situations where the input dimensions are invalid.  The modulo operator (`%%`) confirms divisibility by 7.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further information and deeper understanding of array manipulation and reshaping, I recommend consulting the official documentation for NumPy, MATLAB, and R. These resources provide comprehensive details on their respective array libraries, including advanced techniques and best practices.  Additionally, introductory texts on linear algebra and matrix operations are highly valuable for understanding the theoretical underpinnings of these transformations.  Furthermore, exploring specialized documentation for handling large datasets in the chosen programming language would be beneficial.
