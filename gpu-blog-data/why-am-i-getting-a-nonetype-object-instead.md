The root cause of receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a `History` object from TensorFlow Keras callbacks frequently stems from improper handling of the `on_train_end` method, or a misunderstanding of the callback's lifecycle within the training process.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, particularly those involving complex custom callbacks and multi-GPU training, points consistently to this area.  The `History` object, containing metrics and loss values, is populated *after* the training loop concludes, and attempting to access it prematurely – before the training is complete – results in the observed `NoneType` error.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras callbacks offer a mechanism to interact with the training process at various stages.  These stages are clearly defined:  `on_train_begin`, `on_epoch_begin`, `on_epoch_end`, `on_batch_begin`, `on_batch_end`, and `on_train_end`.  Each method receives relevant information as arguments. Crucially, the `History` object is only fully populated and available *within* the `on_train_end` method.  Accessing it within `on_epoch_end`, for instance, or even worse, outside the callback entirely, will invariably yield `None`. This is because the final training metrics aren't computed until the entire training process is finished.  Furthermore, improper implementation of a custom callback, including erroneous return statements or exceptions within the callback's methods, can prematurely terminate the callback’s lifecycle, preventing the `History` object from being properly populated and leading to the `NoneType` error.  Finally, issues with how the callback is instantiated and passed to the `model.fit` function can also contribute to the problem.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

This example demonstrates the correct way to access the `History` object. Note the crucial placement of the `history` variable access within the `on_train_end` method.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyCallback, self).__init__()
        self.history = None

    def on_train_end(self, logs=None):
        self.history = self.model.history.history  # Access history here
        print("Training finished. History:", self.history)


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

my_callback = MyCallback()
model.fit(x=tf.random.normal((100, 100)), y=tf.random.normal((100, 1)), epochs=10, callbacks=[my_callback])

print("History from callback:", my_callback.history) #Access history after training
```

This code defines a custom callback that stores the `History` object in an instance variable. The crucial line `self.history = self.model.history.history` ensures that the `history` attribute is populated only *after* training completes.  This avoids the `NoneType` error.

**Example 2: Incorrect Implementation (Accessing too early)**

This example illustrates a common mistake: attempting to access the `History` object within `on_epoch_end`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class IncorrectCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        try:
            history = self.model.history.history # Incorrect: Accessing too early
            print(f"Epoch {epoch} finished. History: {history}")
        except AttributeError as e:
            print(f"Error accessing history in on_epoch_end: {e}")


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

incorrect_callback = IncorrectCallback()
model.fit(x=tf.random.normal((100, 100)), y=tf.random.normal((100, 1)), epochs=10, callbacks=[incorrect_callback])

```

This will print an error message or `None` because the `history` attribute isn't fully populated until after all epochs are finished.

**Example 3:  Handling Exceptions**

Robust callbacks should anticipate potential issues and handle them gracefully.  This example demonstrates best practice by including exception handling:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class RobustCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super(RobustCallback, self).__init__()
        self.history = None

    def on_train_end(self, logs=None):
        try:
            self.history = self.model.history.history
            print("Training finished. History:", self.history)
        except AttributeError as e:
            print(f"Error accessing history: {e}. Check training process.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

robust_callback = RobustCallback()
model.fit(x=tf.random.normal((100, 100)), y=tf.random.normal((100, 1)), epochs=10, callbacks=[robust_callback])
```

This example adds error handling.  The `try...except` block ensures that even if an error occurs (e.g., due to a premature termination of training), the program doesn't crash and provides informative error messages.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on Keras callbacks is an excellent starting point.  Familiarize yourself with the lifecycle methods and their arguments.  Reviewing examples of custom callbacks in the TensorFlow documentation and community-contributed code repositories will further enhance your understanding.  Finally, a thorough understanding of Python's exception handling mechanisms is vital for writing robust and resilient Keras callbacks.  Debugging tools such as a debugger will be extremely valuable in pinpointing the exact location where the `NoneType` error occurs.
