The core challenge in computing the loss gradient with respect to model inputs in Keras stems from the typical forward-pass-only nature of many input processing stages.  While Keras readily provides gradients with respect to model weights through its built-in backpropagation mechanisms, obtaining gradients regarding the input itself necessitates a more nuanced approach.  My experience working on adversarial example generation and gradient-based optimization techniques has highlighted the importance of understanding this distinction.  Directly accessing these input gradients requires constructing a custom computation graph within the Keras framework.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The standard Keras workflow focuses on weight updates. The `model.fit()` method, and even custom training loops, primarily concern themselves with calculating `dLoss/dWeights`, the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's trainable parameters.  This is achieved efficiently via automatic differentiation. However, to calculate `dLoss/dInputs`, the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, we must explicitly define a computational pathway that allows Keras's automatic differentiation engine to trace the loss back to the input tensors.  This involves creating a `tf.GradientTape` context manager (assuming TensorFlow backend, as it's the most common).  Inside this context, we execute the forward pass, and then use the `gradient()` method to compute the desired gradient.

The process involves these key steps:

1. **Define a Keras model:** This could be a pre-trained model or a custom one, but it needs to be compiled with an appropriate loss function.

2. **Create a `tf.GradientTape`:** This context manager records operations for automatic differentiation.

3. **Perform the forward pass:**  Feed the input data through the model to obtain the model's output and the loss.

4. **Compute the gradient:**  Use `tape.gradient()` to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data.  Crucially, the second argument specifies the target tensor for which we want the gradient (in this case, the input).

5. **Handle the gradient:** The obtained gradient is a tensor that can be utilized for various purposes, including adversarial example generation, input saliency map creation, or input optimization.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Dense Network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')

# Sample input data
inputs = np.random.rand(1, 10)

# Compute the gradient
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(inputs)  # Explicitly watch the inputs
    predictions = model(inputs)
    loss = model.compiled_loss(tf.constant([0.5]), predictions) # Dummy target

input_gradients = tape.gradient(loss, inputs)

print(input_gradients)
```

This example showcases the fundamental process.  `tape.watch(inputs)` is crucial; it explicitly tells the tape to track the operations involving the input tensor.  The `model.compiled_loss` method ensures we use the same loss function as during training.  The output `input_gradients` will be a tensor representing the gradient of the loss with respect to each element of the input.


**Example 2:  Handling Multiple Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Model with multiple inputs
input_a = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
input_b = keras.Input(shape=(5,))
x = keras.layers.concatenate([input_a, input_b])
x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
output = keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=output)
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')

# Sample input data
inputs_a = np.random.rand(1, 10)
inputs_b = np.random.rand(1, 5)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch([inputs_a, inputs_b])
    predictions = model([inputs_a, inputs_b])
    loss = model.compiled_loss(tf.constant([0.5]), predictions)

input_gradients_a, input_gradients_b = tape.gradient(loss, [inputs_a, inputs_b])

print(input_gradients_a, input_gradients_b)
```

This demonstrates handling models with multiple inputs.  `tape.watch()` is used with a list to track gradients for each input separately. The resulting gradients are also returned as a list, allowing for individual analysis of input contributions to the loss.


**Example 3:  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a CNN model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')

# Sample input data
inputs = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)
targets = tf.one_hot(np.random.randint(0, 10), 10)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(inputs)
    predictions = model(inputs)
    loss = model.compiled_loss(targets, predictions)

input_gradients = tape.gradient(loss, inputs)

print(input_gradients)
```

This example extends the concept to CNNs. The input shape reflects the typical image data format. Note that the loss function is adjusted to `categorical_crossentropy` suitable for multi-class classification problems. The gradient computation remains the same, adapting seamlessly to the different input structure.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation, I would suggest reviewing the TensorFlow documentation on `tf.GradientTape`.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics in optimization theory, specifically gradient-based methods, will significantly enhance your comprehension of gradient manipulation within the context of deep learning models.  Finally, thoroughly studying the Keras API documentation regarding model building and compilation will solidify your foundation for implementing these techniques.  These resources, coupled with practical experimentation, will allow you to effectively compute and utilize loss gradients with respect to model inputs.
