The persistence of TensorFlow's session state, particularly within Keras, often leads to unexpected behavior during model training and evaluation, especially when working with multiple models or experimenting with different hyperparameters.  This stems from TensorFlow's graph-based execution model; operations aren't executed immediately but rather compiled into a graph before execution.  Improper session management can leave lingering variables and operations in memory, resulting in inaccurate results or resource exhaustion.  My experience developing large-scale recommender systems highlighted this issue repeatedly, requiring rigorous session control.  Therefore, a thorough reset encompasses more than just closing the session; it requires careful management of the computational graph and associated resources.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

A complete reset of a Keras TensorFlow session necessitates addressing three key aspects: (a) clearing the computational graph, (b) deleting existing TensorFlow variables, and (c) potentially restarting the TensorFlow session itself.  Simply calling `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()` is insufficient for a truly comprehensive reset in many scenarios.  This function primarily clears the Keras session graph, but it might not fully remove all associated TensorFlow variables, especially if they were created outside the Keras API.  For instance, in my work with custom loss functions and optimizers implemented directly using TensorFlow, `clear_session()` alone proved inadequate.


To ensure a complete reset, I've found that leveraging the lower-level TensorFlow APIs for graph management and variable control provides a more robust solution.  This involves explicitly deleting the graph and resetting the default graph, followed by explicitly deleting any lingering variables and optionally restarting the session.  The specific approach might depend on the TensorFlow version and the context of its usage. For example, in distributed settings, additional considerations are necessary.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Reset using TensorFlow APIs:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Explicitly delete the current default graph.
tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()  #For TensorFlow 2.x compatibility

# Delete all global variables.  Crucial for complete cleanup.
tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer().run(session=tf.compat.v1.Session()) # Ensure variables are actually deleted.

# Optionally, explicitly create a new session (recommended for complete isolation).
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()

# Now you can safely build and train a new model in this fresh session.
# ... your Keras model building and training code here ...

# Remember to close the session when finished.
sess.close()
```

*Commentary*: This example directly leverages TensorFlow's graph management functions (`reset_default_graph()`), variable management (`global_variables_initializer()`), and explicit session creation and closure.  This ensures a clean slate before initiating new model building. Using `tf.compat.v1` ensures compatibility across different TF versions. This was essential when transitioning my older projects.

**Example 2:  Reset within a function for reusable cleanup:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def reset_keras_tf_session():
    try:
        tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()
        tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer().run(session=tf.compat.v1.Session())
        K = tf.compat.v1.keras.backend
        K.clear_session()
        print("Session reset successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during session reset: {e}")

# Example usage:
reset_keras_tf_session()
# Proceed with new model building.
```

*Commentary*:  Encapsulating the reset procedure within a function enhances code reusability and improves error handling. This function helps streamline the model development workflow and prevents repeated code duplication.  The try-except block handles potential errors that might occur during the reset process.  This was critical in my automated testing pipeline to avoid crashes due to failed cleanups.


**Example 3:  Handling Custom Operations:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your custom TensorFlow operations or variables ...
my_custom_variable = tf.Variable(0, name="my_var")

# ... your Keras model building code ...


def reset_with_custom_ops():
    try:
        tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()
        sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
        sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
        K = tf.compat.v1.keras.backend
        K.clear_session()
        sess.close()
        print("Session and custom operations reset successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during reset with custom operations: {e}")


reset_with_custom_ops()

# ... subsequent model building and training
```

*Commentary*: This example demonstrates how to handle situations involving custom TensorFlow operations or variables defined outside the Keras framework.  It explicitly includes the initialization of the session before calling `clear_session()`, and critically, handles potential exceptions specifically related to custom operations. I encountered similar situations while integrating third-party libraries into my workflows.  This approach ensures all related resources are freed.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on graph management and session management, offers comprehensive information.  The TensorFlow API reference is invaluable for understanding the intricacies of the various functions related to session and graph control.  Exploring examples and tutorials on building and training custom Keras models will further solidify your understanding of session management best practices within a Keras context.  Finally, exploring materials that cover advanced TensorFlow concepts, such as distributed training and custom operations, will offer more nuanced insights into managing sessions effectively in more complex scenarios.  Thorough comprehension of these aspects is crucial for robust and reliable deep learning model development.
