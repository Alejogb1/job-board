The fundamental challenge in representing triangles with NumPy lies in structuring their geometric information within multi-dimensional arrays, which are optimized for numerical operations rather than abstract geometric forms. My experience in computational geometry projects, particularly in 3D mesh processing, has underscored the importance of selecting efficient array layouts for such representations.

The most common and generally efficient approach is to represent each triangle as a set of three 2D or 3D coordinate points, where each point is itself represented by its X, Y (and optionally Z) components. This data can be structured in a NumPy array with a shape of `(N, 3, D)`, where `N` signifies the number of triangles, and `D` denotes the dimensionality of the space (typically 2 or 3). The inner dimension of size 3 represents the three vertices of each triangle.

Consider, for instance, a set of 100 triangles in 2D space. We would have a NumPy array of shape `(100, 3, 2)`. The first dimension indexes individual triangles, the second dimension accesses each of the triangle's vertices, and the third dimension refers to the x and y coordinates. In 3D, it's the same, but with an additional z-component, yielding a shape of `(N, 3, 3)`. This organization permits streamlined vectorized computation, a primary advantage of using NumPy.

**Code Example 1: 2D Triangles**

```python
import numpy as np

# Represent 3 triangles in 2D space
triangles_2d = np.array([
    [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]],  # Triangle 1
    [[2, 2], [3, 2], [2, 3]],  # Triangle 2
    [[4, 0], [5, 1], [4, 2]]   # Triangle 3
])

print("Shape of triangles_2d:", triangles_2d.shape)
print("First triangle's vertices:\n", triangles_2d[0])
print("Y-coordinates of all vertices:\n", triangles_2d[:, :, 1])

# Computing barycenter for the first triangle
barycenter = np.mean(triangles_2d[0], axis=0)
print("Barycenter of first triangle:", barycenter)
```

In this example, I've directly created a NumPy array containing three 2D triangles, each defined by three vertices. The shape, `(3, 3, 2)`, verifies the structure I previously described. The output demonstrates accessing the vertices of the first triangle, retrieving all Y-coordinates, and calculating the barycenter of one triangle utilizing NumPy's `mean()` function, illustrating a simple vectorized computation. By leveraging broadcasting rules, operations can be performed on all triangles without explicit loops.

**Code Example 2: 3D Triangles and Transformation**

```python
import numpy as np

# Represent 2 triangles in 3D space
triangles_3d = np.array([
    [[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]],
    [[2, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1]]
])

# Define a translation vector
translation = np.array([2, 1, 0.5])

# Translate all triangles
translated_triangles = triangles_3d + translation

print("Original triangles:\n", triangles_3d)
print("Translated triangles:\n", translated_triangles)

# Define a scaling factor
scale = 2
# Scale all triangles by multiplying each coordinate by the scale factor
scaled_triangles = triangles_3d * scale
print("Scaled triangles:\n", scaled_triangles)
```

Here, I extend the concept to 3D space with two triangles, utilizing broadcasting to translate all triangles in a single operation using a translation vector. The scaling operation demonstrates that scaling every vertex coordinate by a single factor is straightforward using NumPy. Notice how the translation vector is automatically added to each vertex of each triangle due to broadcasting rules. Such vectorized transformations contribute significantly to performance compared to iteratively processing each point.

**Code Example 3: Using Structured Arrays**

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the data type for a vertex
vertex_dtype = np.dtype([('x', 'f4'), ('y', 'f4'), ('z', 'f4')])

# Define the data type for a triangle (composed of vertices)
triangle_dtype = np.dtype([('v1', vertex_dtype), ('v2', vertex_dtype), ('v3', vertex_dtype)])


# Create a structured array with two triangles
triangles_structured = np.array([
  ((0.0, 0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)),
  ((2.0, 2.0, 1.0), (3.0, 2.0, 1.0), (2.0, 3.0, 1.0))
], dtype=triangle_dtype)


print("Structured array of triangles:\n", triangles_structured)
print("x-component of all vertices of first triangle:\n",
      [triangles_structured[0]['v1']['x'], triangles_structured[0]['v2']['x'], triangles_structured[0]['v3']['x']])


# Calculate the mean y-coordinates of the vertices of the second triangle
y_coords = [triangles_structured[1]['v1']['y'], triangles_structured[1]['v2']['y'], triangles_structured[1]['v3']['y']]
print("Mean of y-coords of vertices in second triangle", np.mean(y_coords))
```

This example demonstrates using NumPy's structured arrays to organize the data. By defining custom data types for vertices and triangles, the underlying data gains semantic meaning. Access to vertex attributes ('x', 'y', 'z') is now possible by name and facilitates organized data handling. This approach sacrifices some vectorization simplicity, but can be useful in scenarios where each vertex has additional associated attributes that need to be retained along with coordinate values. It's also a demonstration of the flexibility in structuring NumPy arrays. While more verbose, I have found that this more structured organization can greatly assist clarity, especially when dealing with more complex data sets.

In summary, representing triangles with NumPy is best achieved using a `(N, 3, D)` shaped array, which enables straightforward manipulation of geometric data utilizing NumPy's efficient vectorized operations. The examples provided highlight this capability for 2D and 3D cases, including translation and scaling.  Structured arrays, while requiring more verbose syntax, offer a path for representing more complex data, especially where attributes are associated with individual vertices.

For further study, I recommend consulting resources that provide detailed explanations on NumPy's broadcasting mechanism, as that's key to understanding how these array-based representations function. I also recommend investigating resources focusing on computational geometry, particularly those dealing with mesh representations, as these will provide a broader context. Resources concerning linear algebra operations in the context of computer graphics can greatly assist in understanding geometric transformations within NumPy.
