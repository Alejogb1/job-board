The crux of retrieving the optimal model's weights after employing GridSearchCV lies in correctly accessing the `best_estimator_` attribute and subsequently extracting the desired weight parameters from the underlying model structure. GridSearchCV, while automating hyperparameter tuning, stores the trained model corresponding to the highest score within this attribute, and the methodology to access weights varies depending on the specific type of neural network architecture.

I've encountered this scenario frequently during my time developing predictive models, specifically working on various projects ranging from image classification to timeseries forecasting. The challenge isn't in the training itself, rather it arises in the post-tuning analysis where access to the specifically tuned parameters, often encapsulated within complex model objects, becomes crucial.

The process generally involves two core steps after fitting `GridSearchCV`:

1.  **Accessing the `best_estimator_`:** This attribute of the fitted `GridSearchCV` object returns the model object that produced the highest score across all evaluated hyperparameter combinations. It’s essential to understand that this isn’t just a set of parameters; it's a fully trained model.

2. **Extracting the weights:** This step is model-specific. For simpler models within `scikit-learn`, such as a `MLPClassifier` or `MLPRegressor` (multilayer perceptron), the weights are accessible as numpy arrays in the `.coefs_` and `.intercepts_` attributes. More complex models, often constructed via frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, require different methodologies which typically involve iterating through the model's layers, each of which often has a weight and bias matrix or tensor that can be extracted. The output of this operation will be the optimal model's weights. The code examples will emphasize the difference.

Let's break this down with examples:

**Example 1: Simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with scikit-learn**

Consider a scenario where I used a `MLPClassifier` from scikit-learn and optimized its hidden layer sizes using `GridSearchCV`. My code, after performing training, would look like this:

```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic classification data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=20, random_state=42)

# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'hidden_layer_sizes': [(50,), (100,), (50, 50)],
    'activation': ['relu', 'tanh'],
    'solver': ['adam']
}

# Initialize the MLPClassifier
mlp = MLPClassifier(random_state=42, max_iter=100)

# Initialize and fit GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(mlp, param_grid, cv=3)
grid_search.fit(X, y)

# Access the best estimator
best_mlp = grid_search.best_estimator_

# Extract the weights and biases
weights = best_mlp.coefs_
biases = best_mlp.intercepts_

# Output the shape of the weights for each layer.
for layer_index, w in enumerate(weights):
  print(f"Layer {layer_index} weights shape: {w.shape}")

# Output the shape of the biases for each layer.
for layer_index, b in enumerate(biases):
  print(f"Layer {layer_index} biases shape: {b.shape}")


#Example output:
#Layer 0 weights shape: (20, 100)
#Layer 1 weights shape: (100, 2)
#Layer 0 biases shape: (100,)
#Layer 1 biases shape: (2,)
```

In this example, `best_mlp` holds the optimal `MLPClassifier`.  `best_mlp.coefs_` is a list of numpy arrays, where each array represents the weight matrix for a given layer; likewise,  `best_mlp.intercepts_` provides the bias vectors. The length of both lists corresponds to the number of layers in the tuned model. The output displays the shapes of the weight matrices and bias vectors per layer. For example, a shape of `(20, 100)` indicates the first layer had 20 inputs and 100 hidden units. Accessing these weight matrices and bias vectors enable you to inspect the model’s learned parameters, a process integral to understanding the model’s inner workings.

**Example 2: A More Complex Model using Keras/TensorFlow**

Now let's assume a more elaborate model using Keras, wrapped as a scikit-learn compatible estimator, and optimized with GridSearchCV. This scenario was common when exploring deeper architectures:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from scikeras.wrappers import KerasClassifier

# Generate synthetic classification data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=20, random_state=42)

# Function to build the Keras model
def build_model(hidden_units=100, activation='relu'):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(hidden_units, activation=activation, input_shape=(X.shape[1],)))
    model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax')) # binary classification with 2 outputs
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Wrap the Keras model for scikit-learn compatibility
keras_model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=build_model, verbose=0)

# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'hidden_units': [50, 100, 150],
    'activation': ['relu', 'tanh'],
    'epochs':[10,20]
}

# Initialize and fit GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(keras_model, param_grid, cv=3)
grid_search.fit(X, y)


# Access the best estimator
best_keras_model = grid_search.best_estimator_.model_

# Extract and output the shapes of the weights per layer
for layer in best_keras_model.layers:
    weights = layer.get_weights()
    if weights:  # layers like dropout have no weights
        print(f"Layer {layer.name} weights shapes: {[w.shape for w in weights]}")


# Example output:
# Layer dense_1 weights shapes: [(20, 100), (100,)]
# Layer dense_2 weights shapes: [(100, 2), (2,)]
```

Here, instead of attributes, I access the best model, which was the `.model_` attribute of the best estimator, and then I iteratively extract weights from each of the layers in the Keras model using `layer.get_weights()`. This method returns a list containing the weight matrix (or tensor) and the bias vector, respectively, depending on the layer. The shapes of these extracted parameters are then printed. Again, the specifics vary with architecture. The output here shows us the shapes of each of the weight tensors.

**Example 3: A PyTorch Neural Network**

Finally, let's look at a PyTorch model, commonly used in more complex learning scenarios. Note, this assumes a basic familiarity with the framework. The process is similar to Keras, but accessing the weights requires a different function.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
import numpy as np
from skorch import NeuralNetClassifier


# Generate synthetic classification data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=20, random_state=42)
X = X.astype(np.float32)
y = y.astype(np.int64)

# Define PyTorch model architecture
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_units=100, activation='relu'):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(X.shape[1], hidden_units)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU() if activation == 'relu' else nn.Tanh()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_units, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Wrap the PyTorch model with skorch for sklearn compatibility
net = NeuralNetClassifier(
    module=SimpleNet,
    criterion=nn.CrossEntropyLoss,
    optimizer=optim.Adam,
    max_epochs=10,
    verbose=0,
)


# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'module__hidden_units': [50, 100, 150],
    'module__activation': ['relu', 'tanh'],
    'max_epochs': [10,20]
}

# Initialize and fit GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(net, param_grid, cv=3)
grid_search.fit(X, y)


# Access the best estimator
best_torch_model = grid_search.best_estimator_.module_

# Extract the weights and print their shapes
for name, param in best_torch_model.named_parameters():
    print(f"Parameter {name} shape: {param.shape}")

# Example Output
# Parameter fc1.weight shape: torch.Size([100, 20])
# Parameter fc1.bias shape: torch.Size([100])
# Parameter fc2.weight shape: torch.Size([2, 100])
# Parameter fc2.bias shape: torch.Size([2])
```

Here, the `best_torch_model` is the PyTorch module. I iterate through the named parameters of this model to extract the weight tensors, and their shapes. This approach applies for generic PyTorch models that are not necessarily constructed using the `nn.Sequential()` pattern as displayed in the Keras example above.

**Resource Recommendations:**

*   For conceptual understanding of neural networks, explore resources that detail the mathematical operations underlying layers and connections, which form the foundation for weight manipulation.
*   For deep dives into Scikit-learn, review their official documentation pertaining to `MLPClassifier`, `MLPRegressor`, and the `GridSearchCV` class. Understand the nuances of its model attributes and available methods.
*   For TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch, consult their respective official documentation, paying close attention to sections regarding model construction, weight manipulation, and how layers are implemented.

In summary, retrieving the best model's weights post `GridSearchCV` primarily entails accessing the `best_estimator_`, followed by weight extraction procedures specific to the model's framework. The examples above showcase common scenarios, however, note that the specific approach can vary depending on the framework used to construct your model. These extraction processes enable the scrutiny of learned parameters, aiding in model understanding and refinement, a key aspect of effective machine learning practices.
