OpenVINO's Model Optimizer, a crucial component of the OpenVINO 2.0 API,  strictly requires a frozen TensorFlow 1.x graph for successful conversion.  My experience working on large-scale deployment projects involving object detection and image classification models consistently highlighted this limitation.  Attempting conversion of unfrozen graphs invariably resulted in errors, stemming from the Optimizer's inability to resolve variable dependencies and determine the final graph structure.  Therefore, the answer is no; direct conversion of unfrozen TensorFlow 1.x models is not supported.

The core reason for this requirement lies in the nature of the conversion process.  OpenVINO's Model Optimizer analyzes the graph structure to optimize it for inference on Intel hardware. An unfrozen graph, characterized by the presence of `tf.Variable` operations that retain state during runtime, presents a dynamic structure that the Optimizer cannot effectively handle.  The optimizer needs a static representation where all weights and biases are embedded directly within the graph, effectively eliminating variable dependencies.  This static representation is precisely what a frozen graph provides.

The freezing process essentially transforms the computational graph into a static computation. It replaces all variable placeholders with constant tensors containing the learned weights. This produces a self-contained graph where all necessary parameters are embedded, removing runtime dependencies on variables and enabling accurate model representation for efficient inference optimization.  Failure to freeze the graph leads to ambiguous graph structures, resulting in conversion errors and potentially inaccurate inference results after deployment.


**Explanation:**

The conversion process involves several stages: graph importation, analysis, optimization, and finally, conversion to the intermediate representation (IR) used by the OpenVINO runtime.  The Model Optimizer relies on a complete, static graph representation to perform these stages successfully.  An unfrozen model lacks this complete picture.  The Optimizer encounters unresolved variables during the analysis phase, leading to errors such as undefined tensor shapes, missing nodes, or incorrect data type inferences, preventing successful completion of the subsequent steps.  This isn't simply a matter of the Optimizer "not understanding" the unfrozen graph; it's a fundamental limitation imposed by the requirement of a static and fully defined computational graph for optimal conversion and deployment.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating the Freezing Process (Python)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Load your TensorFlow 1.x model) ...

# Create a saver object
saver = tf.train.Saver()

# Create a session
with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Restore the model variables
    saver.restore(sess, "path/to/your/checkpoint")

    # Create a frozen graph definition
    output_graph_def = tf.graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(
        sess,
        tf.get_default_graph().as_graph_def(),
        ["output_node_name"], # Replace with your output node's name
    )

    # Save the frozen graph
    with tf.gfile.GFile("frozen_graph.pb", "wb") as f:
        f.write(output_graph_def.SerializeToString())

print("Frozen graph saved to frozen_graph.pb")
```

This code demonstrates the crucial step of freezing.  `tf.graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants` is the key function.  It takes the session (containing the learned parameters), the graph definition, and a list of output node names as input. It replaces variables with constant tensors and saves the resulting frozen graph.  Remember to replace `"path/to/your/checkpoint"` and `"output_node_name"` with your specific paths and output node names.


**Example 2:  Illustrating a Typical Conversion Error (Command Line)**

```bash
mo --input_model frozen_graph.pb --output_dir converted_model
```

This command, using the Model Optimizer, will succeed only if `frozen_graph.pb` is indeed a frozen graph. Using an unfrozen model in place of `frozen_graph.pb` will result in errors reported by the Model Optimizer, likely indicating missing nodes or unresolved dependencies.  The exact error messages vary depending on the specifics of the model, but they consistently point towards the requirement for a frozen graph.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Output Nodes**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Load your TensorFlow 1.x model) ...

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Restore the model variables
    saver.restore(sess, "path/to/your/checkpoint")

    output_node_names = ["output_node_1", "output_node_2"] # Multiple outputs

    output_graph_def = tf.graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(
        sess,
        tf.get_default_graph().as_graph_def(),
        output_node_names,
    )

    # Save the frozen graph
    with tf.gfile.GFile("frozen_graph.pb", "wb") as f:
        f.write(output_graph_def.SerializeToString())
```

This example demonstrates how to handle models with multiple output nodes.  This is often the case in complex architectures, such as those with both classification and regression outputs. The crucial change is providing a list of all output node names to the `convert_variables_to_constants` function.


**Resource Recommendations:**

1.  OpenVINOâ„¢ documentation. Pay close attention to the sections detailing the Model Optimizer and the specific requirements for TensorFlow model conversion.
2.  TensorFlow documentation on freezing graphs.  Understanding this process is paramount for successful OpenVINO integration.
3.  Refer to the examples provided in the OpenVINO samples repository.  Many examples demonstrate the entire workflow, including model freezing and conversion.


In conclusion, direct conversion of unfrozen TensorFlow 1.x models with the OpenVINO 2.0 API is not feasible.  The necessity of a frozen graph is a fundamental requirement of the Model Optimizer's functionality.  Properly freezing the TensorFlow model before conversion is an essential prerequisite for successful deployment using OpenVINO.  Ignoring this step inevitably leads to conversion errors.  The provided code examples and recommended resources should provide a solid foundation for implementing the necessary freezing and conversion steps effectively.
