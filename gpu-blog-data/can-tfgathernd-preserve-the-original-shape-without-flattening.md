The core issue with `tf.gather_nd` and shape preservation stems from its fundamental operation: gathering elements based on multi-dimensional indices.  While it's highly flexible,  it inherently transforms the output shape unless explicitly handled.  My experience working on large-scale tensor manipulation pipelines within a high-frequency trading environment highlighted this repeatedly.  Misunderstanding this behavior frequently led to debugging nightmares involving dimensionality mismatches in downstream operations.  Therefore, directly addressing shape preservation requires a careful consideration of the index tensor's structure and the desired output configuration.  Directly preserving the original shape without flattening necessitates utilizing advanced indexing strategies and, in many cases, supplementary tensor manipulation operations.

**1. Clear Explanation**

`tf.gather_nd`'s output shape is determined by the shape of the indices tensor, specifically its leading dimensions.  The final dimension of the indices tensor dictates which elements are selected from the input tensor.  If the indices tensor has only one dimension, the resulting tensor will be one-dimensional, regardless of the input tensorâ€™s shape.  To maintain the original shape, we must construct the indices in a manner that replicates the input's higher-order structure within the gathered output. This usually involves generating indices that represent the original shape's multi-dimensional coordinates.

Consider an input tensor `A` with shape `(a, b, c)` and a desired output `B` with the same shape.  Simply selecting elements from `A` using a flattened index won't preserve the original `(a, b, c)` arrangement.  Instead, the index tensor must reflect the `(a, b, c)` structure. Each element in the index tensor will be a three-element tuple corresponding to the `(x, y, z)` coordinates within the input `A`, where `0 <= x < a`, `0 <= y < b`, and `0 <= z < c`.  The resulting tensor `B` will then maintain the same shape as `A`, but with selectively gathered values.  Failing to do this results in a flattened or differently shaped output.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Preserving a 2D Shape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Indices to select elements preserving the original 2D shape
indices = tf.constant([[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]])

# Gather elements
gathered_tensor = tf.gather_nd(input_tensor, indices)

# Reshape to original form - this is crucial
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(gathered_tensor, [3,1])

# Output: [[1], [5], [9]]
print(reshaped_tensor)
```

*Commentary*:  This example demonstrates a simple case.  The `indices` tensor defines the locations (coordinates) of elements to extract.  Crucially, the `tf.reshape` operation is necessary to explicitly reconstruct the desired 2D shape (3,1) from the gathered 1D array.  Without reshaping, the output would be a 1D tensor `[1, 5, 9]`. This highlights the need for explicit shape manipulation even when the selection pattern implicitly suggests the target shape.


**Example 2: Preserving a 3D Shape with Selective Gathering**


```python
import tensorflow as tf

# 3D input tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[9, 10], [11, 12]]])

# Indices to select specific elements
indices = tf.constant([[[0, 0], [1, 0]], [[0, 1], [1, 1]], [[1, 0], [0, 1]]])

# Gather elements
gathered_tensor = tf.gather_nd(input_tensor, indices)

#Reshape to the original shape.
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(gathered_tensor, [3,2,1])

# Output: [[[1], [3]], [[6], [8]], [[7], [10]]]
print(reshaped_tensor)
```

*Commentary*: Here, the `indices` tensor itself is 3D, reflecting the desired output structure.  Each element within `indices` represents a 2D coordinate within each 2D slice of the input tensor.  The resulting `gathered_tensor` will have a shape compatible with the original, but it still needs to be explicitly reshaped to reflect the intended dimensions in the final output.  This emphasizes the need for meticulous index construction for complex shape preservation scenarios.


**Example 3:  Conditional Gathering and Shape Reconstruction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Condition for selection (example: select elements greater than 4)
condition = tf.greater(input_tensor, 4)

# Find indices where the condition is true
indices = tf.where(condition)

# Gather elements based on the condition
gathered_tensor = tf.gather_nd(input_tensor, indices)

# Original shape is lost and needs to be reconstructed based on the conditional logic
#  This is a more complex scenario and may require more sophisticated reshaping logic
# based on your knowledge of the conditional logic. In many cases, this may not be possible directly with just gather_nd.
print(gathered_tensor) # Output: [5 6 7 8 9]
```

*Commentary*: This example illustrates that shape preservation becomes considerably more challenging when element selection is conditional. The `tf.where` function provides indices, but these indices don't inherently reflect the original 2D shape.  The resulting tensor will be flattened.  Reconstructing the original shape in such scenarios requires additional logic based on the conditions used for selection.  In this particular instance,  simple reshaping is insufficient.  You may need to combine `tf.where` with other tensor manipulation operations, potentially involving `tf.scatter_nd` or custom logic to rebuild the original shape.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation is invaluable.  Thoroughly studying the documentation on `tf.gather_nd`, `tf.scatter_nd`, `tf.reshape`, `tf.where`, and other tensor manipulation functions is crucial.  Furthermore,  reviewing relevant sections in introductory and advanced linear algebra texts will improve your conceptual understanding of tensor operations and facilitate effective problem-solving.  Consider exploring publications and presentations on efficient tensor manipulations within the context of deep learning and large-scale data processing.  These resources will provide a more profound understanding of these concepts and facilitate more sophisticated applications.
