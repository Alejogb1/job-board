The number of trainable parameters in a TensorFlow 2 model from the Model Garden is not fixed; it varies significantly depending on the specific model architecture, its chosen configuration, and any pre-trained weights employed. Directly stating a singular figure is therefore not possible. To accurately determine this, one must inspect the model's structure programmatically using TensorFlowâ€™s APIs.

My experience working with image classification models, specifically, shows this variation clearly. I've encountered situations where a seemingly minor architectural change, like swapping the number of filters in a convolutional layer or the size of a fully connected layer, resulted in a substantial difference in the number of trainable parameters. This directly impacts computational costs and memory requirements during training, emphasizing the need for precise parameter counting.

The trainable parameters, essentially, are the weights and biases in neural network layers that are adjusted during the training process using optimization algorithms like gradient descent. Not all parameters within a model are trainable. For example, batch normalization layers may contain scale and offset parameters that can be learned, but also non-trainable moving average parameters. Additionally, when using transfer learning with a frozen backbone, the weights in that backbone will not be modified during training.

Therefore, the determination requires a focused analysis of each layer's contribution to the overall count.  TensorFlow provides the necessary tools to dissect a model and tally these trainable variables. To clarify this process, I will outline a method using the TensorFlow API, illustrating its application with diverse model configurations.

Consider a scenario involving a ResNet50 model. Here's how to obtain the parameter count:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50

# Load the ResNet50 model pre-trained on ImageNet.
model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

# Obtain the number of trainable parameters.
trainable_params = tf.reduce_sum([tf.reduce_prod(var.shape) for var in model.trainable_variables])

# Print the result.
print(f"Trainable parameters in ResNet50: {trainable_params.numpy():,}")
```

In this code snippet, I first imported TensorFlow and the specific `ResNet50` model from `tensorflow.keras.applications`. The model was loaded with pre-trained ImageNet weights, allowing me to proceed directly to the parameter counting step. The core logic utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through `model.trainable_variables`, obtaining the shape of each variable. `tf.reduce_prod` computes the product of all elements within each shape, providing the number of individual parameters for that variable. These are then summed using `tf.reduce_sum`, yielding the total count.  The output is converted to a NumPy integer for formatted display. The result, for the ResNet50 model with pre-trained ImageNet weights, is typically around 25.6 million trainable parameters.

Let's analyze a slightly modified scenario now, with a custom model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define a custom convolutional model.
def create_custom_model():
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model

# Instantiate the custom model.
custom_model = create_custom_model()

# Obtain and print the number of trainable parameters.
trainable_params = tf.reduce_sum([tf.reduce_prod(var.shape) for var in custom_model.trainable_variables])
print(f"Trainable parameters in the custom model: {trainable_params.numpy():,}")
```

This example illustrates counting parameters in a model built from the ground up. I created a simple sequential model with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.  The function `create_custom_model` encapsulates this model's construction. I then instantiated it and applied the same logic as before to obtain and print the number of trainable parameters.  The parameter count here is significantly lower, typically in the hundreds of thousands, reflecting the smaller scale of the model architecture. The difference in parameter count highlights the variability based on model design.

Now consider a more involved situation where I utilize transfer learning with a pre-trained MobileNetV2 and freeze the base layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load the MobileNetV2 model pre-trained on ImageNet, excluding top layers.
base_model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the base model.
base_model.trainable = False

# Add a classification head on top.
global_average_layer = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()
prediction_layer = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

# Build the final model.
model = models.Sequential([
    base_model,
    global_average_layer,
    prediction_layer
])

# Obtain and print the number of trainable parameters.
trainable_params = tf.reduce_sum([tf.reduce_prod(var.shape) for var in model.trainable_variables])
print(f"Trainable parameters in the transfer learning model: {trainable_params.numpy():,}")
```

In this example, I loaded MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet, omitting the top classification layers by setting `include_top` to `False`. I then froze all the layers in this base model using `base_model.trainable = False`. A global average pooling layer and a new fully connected dense layer with 10 output nodes were then added to suit a different classification task. This shows that, even when a large pre-trained model is used, the number of trainable parameters is greatly reduced, since the large pre-trained weights are not changed.  The output shows that a much smaller number of trainable parameters are present, corresponding solely to the newly added classification head, typically in the thousands, demonstrating a significant reduction compared to training the full model from scratch.

These examples highlight the importance of programmatically checking the trainable parameter count within a TensorFlow model.  There is no universal, simple answer. As shown, even similar types of models (e.g. convolutional architectures) will have drastically different parameters based on size and complexity.

For further study and to improve understanding, I would recommend consulting the TensorFlow documentation, which has in-depth information about model building and the Keras API. Research publications outlining specific neural network architectures, such as ResNet and MobileNet, will also be beneficial for grasping the nuances of their design and their associated parameter counts. Textbooks on Deep Learning provide a comprehensive foundational approach. Experimenting with the models directly, as I did in these examples, allows for a more hands-on, and often more insightful, approach to understanding parameter counts.
