The core challenge in storing asynchronous functions within a Rust `HashMap` lies in the lack of inherent `Send` and `Sync` implementation for futures.  My experience working on a large-scale asynchronous data processing pipeline highlighted this limitation.  Simply trying to insert a `impl Future` directly into the map will result in a compiler error, as the `HashMap` requires its keys and values to be `Send` and `Sync` unless you utilize an `Arc` or similar construct for sharing.  This stems from the inherent mutability of futures during execution.  The following explains how to address this, outlining different strategies depending on your specific needs.

**1.  Explanation: Managing Ownership and Thread Safety**

The primary obstacle is the ownership model of asynchronous functions in Rust.  An `impl Future` represents a computation in progress, and its state is mutable. This mutability prevents direct storage within a `HashMap`, which requires its values to be safely shared across threads (`Sync`) and moved between threads (`Send`).  The solutions revolve around using appropriate types to safely manage ownership and thread safety.

The most common approach leverages smart pointers like `Arc` (Atomically Reference-Counted) to enable shared ownership.  `Arc<T>` allows multiple owners of the same data, preventing the data from being dropped prematurely.  However, the encapsulated type `T` still must implement `Sync`, which is where the complexities of dealing with asynchronous functions arise. We need to wrap the future in a type that can safely be shared across threads.

Another vital consideration is the lifetime of the future.  If you store a future directly (even with `Arc`), accessing it later might lead to a use-after-free error if the future has already completed.  We must ensure the stored future remains valid until its access.  This usually involves managing lifetimes properly and possibly using channels or other synchronization mechanisms.

Finally, the specific operation you intend to perform on the retrieved future needs careful consideration.  If you simply intend to spawn it, the `Send` requirement is less problematic. If you need to manipulate its state mid-execution across threads, more advanced techniques are necessary.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Using `Arc` and `Mutex` for Shared Mutable State (Suitable for complex futures)**

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::future::Future;
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};
use std::collections::HashMap;
use futures::executor::block_on;

// Define a trait for your asynchronous operations
trait AsyncOperation: Send + Sync {
    type Output;
    fn execute(&self) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Self::Output> + Send + 'static>>;
}

//A simple implementation of the AsyncOperation trait.  Replace this with your actual operation.
struct MyAsyncOp;

impl AsyncOperation for MyAsyncOp {
    type Output = i32;

    fn execute(&self) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Self::Output> + Send + 'static>> {
        Box::pin(async { 42 }) // Replace with your actual async logic
    }
}



fn main() {
    let mut map: HashMap<&str, Arc<Mutex<dyn AsyncOperation>>> = HashMap::new();

    let op = Arc::new(Mutex::new(MyAsyncOp));
    map.insert("my_op", op.clone());

    // Accessing and executing the future
    let op_to_execute = map.get("my_op").unwrap();

    let result = block_on(op_to_execute.lock().unwrap().execute());
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

This example utilizes a `Mutex` for thread-safe access to the inner `AsyncOperation` which needs to be `Send` and `Sync`.  The `Arc` enables multiple owners of the `Mutex`, making it safe to access from multiple threads. This approach is suitable when the future's internal state needs modification during execution.


**Example 2: Using `Arc` for simple futures (Suitable for stateless futures)**

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use futures::future::BoxFuture;
use futures::executor::block_on;

type AsyncFunc = BoxFuture<'static, i32>;

fn main() {
    let mut map: HashMap<&str, Arc<AsyncFunc>> = HashMap::new();

    let future = Arc::new(Box::pin(async { 10 }));
    map.insert("func1", future.clone());

    let future_to_run = map.get("func1").unwrap();

    let result = block_on(future_to_run.as_ref());
    println!("Result: {}", result);

}
```

This example demonstrates a simpler scenario. Because the `async` function is stateless, we only need `Arc` to handle shared ownership without the need for a `Mutex`. Note the use of `BoxFuture` for storing a `Future` with an unbounded lifetime. This is generally preferred over storing the future directly due to the dynamic dispatch.


**Example 3:  Using a channel for future completion (Useful for decoupling)**

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc::{channel, Sender, Receiver};
use std::thread;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use futures::executor::block_on;

fn main() {
    let mut map: HashMap<&str, Sender<i32>> = HashMap::new();

    let (tx, rx) = channel();
    map.insert("func2", tx);

    // Simulate an asynchronous operation in a separate thread.
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let result = block_on(async { 100 });
        //Send result back to main thread
        map.get("func2").unwrap().send(result).unwrap();
    });

    //Retrieve and receive result in main thread
    let rx_clone = map.get("func2").unwrap().clone();
    let result = rx_clone.recv().unwrap();
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```


This example employs channels for communication. The asynchronous operation sends its result through a channel, decoupling the storage from the future's execution.  This is a robust solution for complex scenarios where the future's lifetime is unpredictable and managing direct ownership becomes excessively complicated.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of ownership and concurrency in Rust, I strongly recommend the official Rust Programming Language book.   "Rust by Example" provides practical examples illustrating many concepts related to asynchronous programming.   The "Concurrency in Go" book (despite being Go-specific) offers valuable insights into general concurrent programming principles, which are highly transferable to Rust's concurrency model.  Finally, studying the source code of tokio and async-std, the most popular asynchronous runtime libraries in Rust, is immensely beneficial.  These resources provide a comprehensive understanding of advanced techniques for managing asynchronous operations effectively.
