The loss of shape information when transferring a NumPy array from Python to TensorFlow.js via CSV is fundamentally due to the inherent nature of the CSV (Comma Separated Values) format: it’s a plain text representation of tabular data, agnostic to the multi-dimensional structure of arrays. When I routinely handle machine learning model deployments, I often see engineers stumble on this issue, assuming a file format is more than it is.

A CSV file, at its core, stores data as a sequence of values separated by delimiters (typically commas). Each row in the file represents a 1D sequence. NumPy arrays, conversely, can be multi-dimensional (2D, 3D, or higher) with shape attributes reflecting the sizes of each dimension. The export process to CSV flattens the NumPy array into a 1D representation, where each row becomes a sequence of values. This information about the original dimensions is discarded during this conversion. Therefore, when TensorFlow.js imports the CSV data, it only sees the flattened data points and has no inherent understanding of the original shape. The import process treats the data as a flat sequence of numbers and requires manual reassembly using shape parameters. Without explicit shape information, TensorFlow.js initializes the tensor with a 1D shape by default or the shape implied by the row or column count if reading it as a pandas DataFrame.

Let me clarify with a couple of examples. First, consider a simple 2x3 NumPy array in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2x3 NumPy array
my_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Save it as a CSV file
np.savetxt("my_array.csv", my_array, delimiter=",")

print("Shape of the NumPy Array: ", my_array.shape)
```

In this Python code, `np.savetxt` saves the 2x3 NumPy array into the "my_array.csv" file. The contents of this CSV file would look like:
```
1,2,3
4,5,6
```
This flattened representation loses the information that the original structure was 2x3. It represents simply two rows of three numbers each.
Now, let’s look at how this is read in TensorFlow.js:

```javascript
async function loadCSV() {
    const csvUrl = "my_array.csv"; // Assuming "my_array.csv" is accessible in the web environment
    const csvDataset = tf.data.csv(csvUrl);
    const allData = await csvDataset.toArray();
    
    // When logging the data, it will print as an array of objects
    // each object representing one row from the CSV
    console.log("Data from CSV: ", allData);

    const flattenedTensor = tf.tensor(allData.map(row => Object.values(row).map(Number)));
    console.log("Shape of flattened tensor:", flattenedTensor.shape);

     const reshapedTensor = flattenedTensor.reshape([2,3])
     console.log("Reshaped tensor:", reshapedTensor.shape)
}

loadCSV();
```

The `tf.data.csv` function in TensorFlow.js reads the CSV data as an array of objects where each object represents a row. I then use `flattenedTensor` to map over the rows and extract the values to create the initial tensor. Critically, `flattenedTensor.shape` would print `[2,3]` assuming it is read and transformed as a row-based list.  However, depending on how the data is parsed, the shape may instead be interpreted as  `[6]` or `[1,6]` if the data is read column-wise.  In either case, we must explicitly reshape to get back our original `[2,3]` shape.  The `reshape()` method reconstructs the intended dimensionality using the shape parameters. This illustrates how TensorFlow.js does not inherently restore the shape of a NumPy array when using a CSV file.

I've frequently needed to deal with more complex multi-dimensional arrays. Consider a three-dimensional array:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2x2x2 NumPy array
my_3d_array = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])

# Attempting to save it as a CSV file without further pre-processing will result in an error
# Reshape the 3D array to a 2D array before saving
reshaped_array = my_3d_array.reshape(my_3d_array.shape[0], -1)
np.savetxt("my_3d_array.csv", reshaped_array, delimiter=",")
print("Shape of the NumPy array:", my_3d_array.shape)
print("Shape of the reshaped array:", reshaped_array.shape)
```

Here, we encounter that a true 3-D array is not directly compatible with a CSV's 2-dimensional tabular structure. We reshape the 3D array to a 2D array for CSV compatibility before saving to CSV. `np.reshape(arr.shape[0], -1)` collapses the last two dimensions into one, resulting in a 2x4 shape. When loaded into TensorFlow.js from the CSV, the 2x4 shape will be inferred.

```javascript
async function load3DCSV() {
    const csvUrl = "my_3d_array.csv";
    const csvDataset = tf.data.csv(csvUrl);
    const allData = await csvDataset.toArray();

    console.log("Data from CSV:", allData);

    const flattenedTensor = tf.tensor(allData.map(row => Object.values(row).map(Number)));
    console.log("Shape of the flattened tensor:", flattenedTensor.shape);

    const reshapedTensor = flattenedTensor.reshape([2, 2, 2]); // Explicitly reshape
    console.log("Reshaped tensor:", reshapedTensor.shape);
}

load3DCSV();
```
After loading the CSV, the `flattenedTensor` will likely have a shape of `[2,4]` or `[8]`. Again, the shape is dependent upon the parsing. The critical action is the `reshape([2, 2, 2])` step, which restores the original 3D shape.

Finally, consider the situation where a complex 2D array is flattened for use with a simpler network and then needs to be reassembled. Suppose the `flattenedTensor` is now of shape `[1, 784]` and we want to reassemble it into its `[28, 28]` shape. It is important to note that the original 28x28 data is likely of a floating-point type and the data parsing must take this into account.

```python
import numpy as np

#Create a dummy 28x28 array
dummy_array=np.random.rand(28, 28)
flattened_array = dummy_array.flatten()

#Now, save it to CSV
np.savetxt("flattened_array.csv", [flattened_array], delimiter=",", fmt='%.8f')

print("Shape of the flattened array:", flattened_array.shape)
print("Sample of the flattened array:", flattened_array[:10])
```

This code simulates flattening the array. The resulting `flattened_array.csv` will contain a single row with 784 numbers separated by commas. The `fmt='%.8f'` ensures a full representation of the floating-point values. When loading it into TensorFlow.js we see that the resulting tensor requires reshaping.

```javascript
async function loadFlattenedCSV() {
    const csvUrl = "flattened_array.csv";
    const csvDataset = tf.data.csv(csvUrl);
    const allData = await csvDataset.toArray();
     
    console.log("Data from CSV:", allData);
    
    const flattenedTensor = tf.tensor(allData.map(row => Object.values(row).map(Number)));
    console.log("Shape of flattened tensor:", flattenedTensor.shape);
    
     const reshapedTensor = flattenedTensor.reshape([28, 28]);
     console.log("Shape of the reshaped tensor:", reshapedTensor.shape);
}

loadFlattenedCSV();
```

Here, the loaded `flattenedTensor` will likely have a shape `[1, 784]` or `[784]`, depending on how it is read and parsed. The reshape operation is required to restore the shape of `[28, 28]`.

In summary, the CSV format lacks the capacity to retain multi-dimensional shape information of a NumPy array. TensorFlow.js, when reading CSV, interprets the data in a flat, 1D manner unless otherwise explicitly specified. The responsibility for maintaining and restoring the shape information lies with the user, which must involve explicit coding to reshape tensors as desired. The CSV format excels for its simplicity but lacks the meta-data required for preserving more complex data structures.

For resource recommendations, I suggest exploring the official documentation of NumPy and TensorFlow.js. The NumPy documentation offers insights into array manipulation and file I/O. The TensorFlow.js documentation, especially the sections related to data loading and tensor manipulation, provides guidance on how to reconstruct the desired shapes. Additionally, tutorials on machine learning model deployment and data serialization can offer practical examples and best practices. Investigating the capabilities of formats that do store metadata like HDF5, which is not directly compatible with the web without a conversion layer, provides useful insights into the trade-offs between simplicity and meta-data. Examining the specifics of `tf.data.csv` within the TensorFlow.js documentation is also worthwhile.
