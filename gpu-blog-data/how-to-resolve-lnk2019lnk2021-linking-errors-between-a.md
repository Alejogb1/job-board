The root cause of LNK2019 (unresolved external symbol) and LNK2021 (unresolved external symbol) errors when linking C++ and CUDA code often stems from mismatches in calling conventions, name mangling, and the handling of differing compilation units' object files and libraries.  Over the course of my fifteen years developing high-performance computing applications, I've encountered this issue numerous times, usually tracing it back to inconsistencies in the build process or neglecting crucial compiler and linker flags.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental problem arises from the linker's inability to find the definitions for symbols (functions or variables) referenced in your C++ code that are supposedly provided by your CUDA library.  This happens because C++ and CUDA compilers employ different name mangling schemes.  Name mangling transforms function and variable names into unique identifiers used during linking.  Differences in mangling mean that what your C++ code expects as `myCUDAfunction` might be compiled into something like `?myCUDAfunction@@YAHHH@Z` in the C++ code but `_Z13myCUDAfunctionii` in the CUDA code (these are simplified examples; actual mangled names are more complex).  Therefore, the linker fails to match these symbols, leading to LNK2019/LNK2021 errors.

Further complicating this, CUDA code often interacts with the host (CPU) through managed memory and function calls.  Improper handling of these interfaces contributes significantly to linking errors. This includes issues with function visibility (whether a function is exported from the library for external use), issues with header file inclusions ensuring the correct prototypes are available in both the C++ and CUDA sides, and problems with compiling CUDA code for the correct target architecture (compute capability).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Correct CUDA Function Declaration and Linkage:**

```cpp
// CUDA Kernel (in cuda_kernel.cu)
__global__ void myCUDAfunction(int *a, int *b, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    b[i] = a[i] * 2;
  }
}

// CUDA Wrapper Function (in cuda_wrapper.cu)
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void cudaWrapper(int *a, int *b, int n) {
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  myCUDAfunction<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(a, b, n);
  cudaDeviceSynchronize();
}
```

```cpp
// C++ Code (in main.cpp)
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
//This assumes a header file cuda_wrapper.h which declares cudaWrapper.  Crucially this header is only needed on the C++ side.
#include "cuda_wrapper.h"

int main() {
  int *a, *b;
  int n = 1024;
  // Allocate and initialize data...
  cudaWrapper(a, b, n);
  // Process results...
  return 0;
}
```


**Commentary:**  `extern "C"` in the CUDA wrapper function ensures C-style name mangling, preventing conflicts.  `__declspec(dllexport)` explicitly makes the function visible for linking from other modules (important for DLLs).  The CUDA kernel itself uses standard CUDA syntax.  The C++ code includes the relevant header and calls the wrapper function.  The critical aspect is ensuring the C++ compilation process links against the compiled CUDA library (e.g., using the linker command-line option `/LIBPATH:<path_to_cuda_lib>` along with linking against the CUDA runtime library `cudart.lib`).


**Example 2:  Incorrect Header File Inclusion Leading to Mismatched Prototypes:**

```cpp
// Incorrect C++ header (incorrect_header.h)
void cudaWrapper(int*, int*, int); // Missing extern "C"
```

This header file would lead to a linking error because the C++ compiler mangles the name differently than the CUDA compiler.



**Example 3:  Handling CUDA Errors:**

```cpp
//Improved CUDA Wrapper with Error Handling (in cuda_wrapper.cu)
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int cudaWrapper(int *a, int *b, int n) {
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  cudaError_t cudaStatus;
  cudaStatus = cudaSetDevice(0); //Set the device
  if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) { return 1;} //Check for Error

  myCUDAfunction<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(a, b, n);
  cudaStatus = cudaDeviceSynchronize();
  if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) { return 2;} //Check for Error
  cudaStatus = cudaGetLastError();
  if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {return 3;} //Check for Error from kernel
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates robust error handling within the CUDA wrapper function.  Checking `cudaError_t` return values after every CUDA API call is crucial for diagnosing problems.  The C++ code should handle the return value from `cudaWrapper` to properly address potential errors from the CUDA execution.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The CUDA Programming Guide (NVidia documentation).  This provides comprehensive information on CUDA programming, including detailed explanations of libraries and functions.
* A good C++ textbook covering advanced topics like compiler behavior, linking, and name mangling.
* A dedicated text focusing on GPU computing and parallel programming concepts. Understanding parallel programming paradigms improves the design of kernels.



In conclusion, resolving LNK2019/LNK2021 errors when working with C++ and CUDA libraries involves carefully examining your build process. Paying close attention to compiler flags, header file consistency, using `extern "C"` when appropriate, explicit exporting of functions, and comprehensive CUDA error handling is essential to successfully integrate the two programming models.  Remember to check your linker settings for correct library paths and ensure that you have the necessary CUDA libraries (including `cudart.lib`) in the link command.  Systematic debugging and meticulous attention to detail are crucial for eliminating these frustrating linker errors.
