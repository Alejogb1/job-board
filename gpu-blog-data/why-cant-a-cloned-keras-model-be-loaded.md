The inability to load a cloned Keras model typically stems from a misunderstanding of how Keras handles model serialization and the distinction between copying model architecture and copying model weights.  While it's straightforward to replicate a model's structure, the weights—the numerical parameters learned during training—require specific handling.  My experience debugging similar issues across various projects, including a large-scale NLP application where model cloning was crucial for distributed training, highlights this critical point.  Simply creating a new instance of the same model class does not automatically populate it with the original model's trained weights.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras offers two primary mechanisms for model persistence: saving the model's architecture (structure) and saving the model's weights.  The `model.save()` method, when used with the HDF5 format (`.h5`), saves both the architecture and the weights.  However, creating a *new* model instance using the `keras.models.load_model()` function on this `.h5` file effectively *loads* a fully configured model, including its trained parameters.  The crucial point is that merely instantiating a new model of the same class, without loading the weights, results in a model with identical architecture but *randomly initialized weights*. This explains why a direct clone – a new instance of the model class – will not behave the same as the original. The new instance lacks the experience encoded in the learned weights.

The process of cloning, therefore, necessitates explicitly loading the weights separately or using the complete `.h5` file loading mechanism.  Attempting to copy the weights directly from the original model's internal representation is generally not recommended, as it's prone to errors and is not a stable or portable approach. The HDF5 format handles this process in a robust and efficient manner. Errors commonly arise from incorrect file paths, incompatible Keras versions between saving and loading, or attempts to load weights into a model with a mismatched architecture.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Loading of a Cloned Model:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model (necessary for saving/loading)
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model (replace with your actual training data)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Save the entire model to an HDF5 file
model.save('my_model.h5')

# Load the model from the HDF5 file. This creates a completely independent, yet identical clone
cloned_model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')

# Verify that the cloned model's weights are identical (or very close due to floating-point precision)
# This step requires careful consideration of floating-point comparisons
# For simple verification, you could compare a few key weight matrices.
# More robust methods involve comparing summary statistics or using a tolerance threshold.

# ...Further evaluation of cloned_model...
```

This example demonstrates the correct procedure.  The `model.save()` method stores the complete model, and `keras.models.load_model()` reconstructs it accurately.  Any subsequent evaluation or use will reflect the trained weights.

**Example 2: Incorrect Cloning – Architecture Only:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Original model (as in Example 1)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Incorrect cloning: creating a new instance without loading weights
cloned_model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
cloned_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# cloned_model now has the same architecture but different, randomly initialized weights.
# Any predictions will be meaningless.
```

This highlights the critical error.  The `cloned_model` shares the architecture but lacks the trained weights, leading to unpredictable and incorrect outputs.

**Example 3:  Partial Weight Loading (Advanced, use cautiously):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (Original model training as in Example 1) ...

# Save weights separately
model.save_weights('my_model_weights.h5')

# Create a new model with the same architecture
cloned_model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
cloned_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load weights into the cloned model
cloned_model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5')

# ...Further evaluation of cloned_model...

```

This method is more advanced and requires careful attention to ensure the architecture of the `cloned_model` precisely matches that of the original model at the time the weights were saved.  Any discrepancies will result in errors.  The `load_model` approach (Example 1) remains the recommended method for its simplicity and robustness.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on Keras model saving and loading.  A good introductory text on deep learning, focusing on practical implementation details.  A reference on numerical computation and floating-point arithmetic for understanding precision issues in weight comparisons.


In conclusion, effectively cloning a Keras model requires loading the trained weights alongside the architecture.  Direct instantiation of a new model class without loading the weights results in an untrained model with the same structure but random weights.  Utilizing the `model.save()` and `keras.models.load_model()` methods provides a reliable and efficient mechanism for complete model cloning and avoids potential pitfalls associated with handling weights manually. Remember to always verify the cloned model’s functionality through thorough testing.
