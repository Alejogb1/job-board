The inherent limitation of `keras.preprocessing.image.DirectoryIterator` lies in its design: it's a generator, not a container.  This means it yields data on demand, rather than loading the entire dataset into memory at once.  Directly accessing all training data simultaneously therefore requires a fundamental shift in approach; we need to exhaust the generator's iterations and collect the yielded data.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in large-scale image classification projects has highlighted the importance of memory management in this process.  Failure to handle this correctly can lead to system crashes or crippling performance degradation.

**1.  Explanation:**

`DirectoryIterator` operates efficiently by loading and preprocessing images only when requested during training.  Retrieving the complete training dataset involves iterating through the entire generator and storing the results.  This necessitates careful consideration of memory consumption.  Large datasets will require strategic memory management, potentially involving techniques like batch processing and utilizing memory-mapped files for reduced memory footprint.  The fundamental approach involves iterating through the generator, appending the yielded data (images and labels) to appropriate lists, and finally converting these lists to NumPy arrays for further processing.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Basic Approach (Suitable for smaller datasets):**

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator, DirectoryIterator

# ... (ImageDataGenerator and DirectoryIterator initialization) ...

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(...)
train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    ...,
    target_size=(img_width, img_height),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical'  # or appropriate class mode
)


X_train = []
y_train = []

for i in range(train_generator.__len__()): # Iterate through all batches
    x_batch, y_batch = train_generator.next()
    X_train.extend(x_batch)
    y_train.extend(y_batch)

X_train = np.array(X_train)
y_train = np.array(y_train)


# X_train and y_train now hold the complete training data
```

This approach is straightforward but memory-intensive for large datasets.  The `__len__()` method provides the number of batches, making iteration predictable. The `extend` method efficiently adds batches to the growing lists.  Finally, we convert to NumPy arrays for compatibility with most machine learning libraries.

**Example 2: Memory-Efficient Approach (for larger datasets):**

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator, DirectoryIterator
import gc  # Garbage collection

# ... (ImageDataGenerator and DirectoryIterator initialization) ...

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(...)
train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    ...,
    target_size=(img_width, img_height),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical'
)

X_train = np.empty((train_generator.__len__() * batch_size, img_width, img_height, channels), dtype=np.float32)
y_train = np.empty((train_generator.__len__() * batch_size, num_classes), dtype=np.float32)


for i in range(train_generator.__len__()):
    x_batch, y_batch = train_generator.next()
    X_train[i * batch_size:(i + 1) * batch_size] = x_batch
    y_train[i * batch_size:(i + 1) * batch_size] = y_batch
    gc.collect()  # Explicit garbage collection for better memory management

# X_train and y_train now hold the complete training data
```

This example pre-allocates NumPy arrays to avoid repeated resizing, a significant performance bottleneck.  The garbage collector (`gc.collect()`) is explicitly called after each batch to release memory used by the generator.  This approach significantly improves memory efficiency, especially crucial when dealing with high-resolution images or large numbers of classes.

**Example 3:  Handling Class Imbalance (Advanced):**

In scenarios with class imbalance, directly accessing all data can be computationally expensive and might not be necessary.  A stratified sampling approach might be more efficient:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator, DirectoryIterator
from sklearn.utils import shuffle

# ... (ImageDataGenerator and DirectoryIterator initialization) ...

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(...)
train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    ...,
    target_size=(img_width, img_height),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical'
)

# ... (Obtain class distribution from train_generator.classes or similar metadata) ...

# Stratified sampling -  replace with your preferred stratified sampling strategy
sampled_indices = stratified_sampling(train_generator.classes, sample_size) #sample_size defines how much data you want to extract

X_train = []
y_train = []

for i in sampled_indices:
  x_batch, y_batch = train_generator[i]  # Direct access to generator with index
  X_train.extend(x_batch)
  y_train.extend(y_batch)

X_train = np.array(X_train)
y_train = np.array(y_train)

X_train, y_train = shuffle(X_train, y_train, random_state=42) #Shuffle data for randomness

```

This example showcases a more advanced technique, specifically addressing class imbalances. By strategically sampling the data, we gain control over representation, reducing computational burden associated with handling excessively large datasets, while maintaining the representativeness of the classes.  You'll need to implement the `stratified_sampling` function according to your specific needs and class distribution. Note that indexing directly into the generator might not be efficient for large datasets and will depend on the implementation details.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of memory management in Python, consult resources on efficient data structures and algorithms. Explore documentation on NumPy array manipulation and memory-mapped files.  Study the Keras documentation on data preprocessing and image augmentation techniques.  Review literature on handling large datasets in machine learning, focusing on techniques like mini-batching and distributed training.  Consider advanced topics such as data generators and their optimization strategies.  Understanding how garbage collection works in Python is highly recommended.
