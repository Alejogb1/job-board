The core issue regarding dropout within `tf.keras.layers.RNN` and variable batch sizes in TensorFlow 2.0 hinges on the internal state management of recurrent layers.  During training with varying batch sizes, the dropout mask's dimensions must dynamically adapt to the input sequence's shape.  My experience debugging similar scenarios in large-scale NLP projects revealed that a naive implementation of dropout can lead to inconsistencies and errors if not carefully handled.  In short, while `tf.keras.layers.RNN` inherently supports variable-length sequences, the appropriate application of dropout requires a nuanced approach.

**1.  Explanation:**

Standard dropout, as implemented in many frameworks, generates a binary mask of the same shape as the input tensor. This mask is then element-wise multiplied with the input, effectively dropping out units.  The challenge with variable batch sizes arises when applying this to recurrent layers.  Recurrent layers maintain a hidden state that's updated across time steps.  If the batch size changes between time steps (which is allowed with variable-length sequences), a fixed-size dropout mask becomes incompatible.

TensorFlow's `tf.keras.layers.Dropout` layer, when used within an `RNN` layer, will *not* automatically handle this variability correctly. It expects a consistent input shape across a batch.  Applying it directly results in shape mismatches and consequently, runtime errors.  The correct implementation requires utilizing the `mask` parameter within the `RNN` layer or employing a custom dropout mechanism that dynamically adapts to the varying batch dimensions.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Dropout Application**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(1000, 64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),  # Incorrect placement
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# This will likely fail with shape mismatch errors when training with variable batch sizes.
```

This example demonstrates the incorrect placement of the `Dropout` layer. Placing it before the `LSTM` layer leads to shape mismatches because the dropout mask's batch dimension is fixed, while the batch size feeding into the LSTM might vary across training steps due to padded sequences of different lengths.


**Example 2: Correct Dropout using RNN's `return_sequences=True` and Masking:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(1000, 64, mask_zero=True), #Crucial for masking
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5), #Correct placement now. RNN handles masking.
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# This leverages masking to handle variable-length sequences and proper Dropout application.
```

Here, the `mask_zero=True` in the `Embedding` layer creates a mask for zero-padded sequences.  Crucially, `return_sequences=True` in the first `LSTM` layer ensures the output is a sequence, allowing the subsequent `Dropout` layer to operate correctly on the time-distributed output.  The second `LSTM` layer then processes the already masked and dropped-out sequence.  This approach efficiently handles variable batch sizes through masking.

**Example 3: Custom Dynamic Dropout (Advanced)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class DynamicDropout(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, rate, **kwargs):
        super(DynamicDropout, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.rate = rate

    def call(self, inputs, training=None):
        if training:
            mask = tf.random.uniform(tf.shape(inputs)) > self.rate
            return tf.math.multiply(inputs, tf.cast(mask, inputs.dtype))
        else:
            return inputs

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(1000, 64, mask_zero=True),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
    DynamicDropout(0.5), #Custom layer handles variable shapes.
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# This provides explicit control over dropout behavior across variable batch sizes.
```

This example presents a custom `DynamicDropout` layer.  This layer conditionally applies dropout only during training and generates a dropout mask matching the input tensor's dynamic shape, solving the shape mismatch issue.  Note that even here, the use of masking in the embedding layer is beneficial for performance and stability.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* TensorFlow documentation on RNN layers.  Pay close attention to sections detailing masking and state management.
* TensorFlow documentation on `tf.keras.layers.Dropout`. Thoroughly understanding its limitations in dynamic scenarios is crucial.
* A reputable text on deep learning, focusing on the nuances of recurrent neural networks and dropout regularization.  Look for discussions on handling variable-length sequences and dropout implementation strategies within RNN architectures.  These often include advanced techniques for masking and stateful RNNs.


In summary, achieving correct dropout behavior with variable batch sizes in TensorFlow 2.0's `tf.keras.layers.RNN` necessitates careful consideration of the interaction between dropout, masking, and the internal state management of recurrent layers.  The suggested approaches, using the `mask` parameter within the RNN layer or implementing a custom dynamic dropout layer, offer robust solutions to this challenge.  Always prioritize effective masking techniques, especially when working with variable-length sequences.  Ignoring these details can lead to unpredictable behavior and inaccurate model training.
