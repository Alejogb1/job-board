The fastest method for copying an array in many programming environments hinges on understanding the underlying memory operations and leveraging optimized built-in functions when available. Shallow copies, typically produced by simple assignment, merely replicate the reference to the original array's memory location; true, deep copies require allocating new memory and populating it with the original data's content. This distinction is critical for performance considerations.

My experience building high-frequency trading systems has often involved meticulous performance profiling, exposing bottlenecks related to data copying. For example, in one instance, naive loop-based array copying was a significant drag on pre-trade risk calculations. We shifted to employing native array-copying functions, which resulted in a demonstrable improvement in throughput. This is because these optimized routines often employ direct memory block transfer instructions and minimize loop overhead common to interpreted code or manually constructed iterations.

Let's first address the case of shallow copying. Assignment operators, such as `=` in languages like Python or JavaScript, create a new variable that points to the same memory location as the original array. No new memory is allocated, hence the process is incredibly rapid, essentially equivalent to creating a pointer. However, altering the copied array will also alter the original, since both refer to the same data.

Now, consider the various approaches to deep copying – creating a truly independent copy. Looping through each element and assigning it to a new array is the most obvious but often least efficient method. The overhead of accessing and manipulating individual elements within a loop contributes to a substantial performance penalty, especially with larger arrays. This is because of the interpreter's step through each iteration, combined with the individual allocation and assignment actions.

Here's the inefficient, loop-based approach in Python:

```python
# Example 1: Inefficient loop-based copy
import time

def slow_copy(original_array):
  new_array = []
  for element in original_array:
    new_array.append(element)
  return new_array

original = list(range(100000))
start = time.time()
copied = slow_copy(original)
end = time.time()

print(f"Loop-based copy time: {end - start:.6f} seconds")
```

This demonstrates the process of creating a new list, and then explicitly appending each element of `original` to it. We track the execution time to illustrate its relative slowness. While straightforward conceptually, the append operation within the loop adds significant overhead, making it unsuitable for performance-critical operations.

A significant improvement can be achieved by leveraging language-specific optimized methods for array copying. For instance, in Python, the `copy` module provides functionalities like `copy.copy()` and `copy.deepcopy()`, which are far more performant than looping due to optimized C implementations behind the scenes. The `copy.copy()` method produces shallow copies for nested structures and deep copies for primitive types, which might be sufficient in cases where deep copying is not necessary. On the other hand, `copy.deepcopy()` performs true deep copies recursively for all contained objects.

The following code demonstrates how to achieve a deep copy using `copy.copy()` in Python:

```python
# Example 2: Deep copy using copy module (shallow for nested, deep for primitives)
import copy
import time

original = list(range(100000))
start = time.time()
copied = copy.copy(original)
end = time.time()

print(f"Copy module copy time: {end - start:.6f} seconds")

```

This demonstrates the use of `copy.copy()` on the same data as the previous example. We observe a considerably faster execution time compared to the loop-based approach. The performance improvement is attributable to the underlying optimized implementation of `copy.copy()`. This approach is adequate for typical numerical arrays (consisting of primitive types).

However, to explicitly achieve a deep copy of mutable elements within nested structures (e.g., list of lists) the use of `copy.deepcopy()` is necessary. If nested structure is not a concern, `copy.copy()` is suitable because of reduced memory operations.

```python
# Example 3: Deep copy using deepcopy for nested structures
import copy
import time

original = [[i] for i in range(10000)]  # Nested list
start = time.time()
copied = copy.deepcopy(original)
end = time.time()

print(f"Deep copy time: {end - start:.6f} seconds")
```

This shows an example where the original array consists of sub-lists. `copy.deepcopy()` is used to ensure that each of these sub-lists are also copied, not just the references to them.

In languages like JavaScript, methods like `slice()` and the spread syntax `[...]` can be used to create shallow copies of arrays, while for a deep copy, `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(array))` is frequently employed. Similar to Python, these methods are generally more efficient than manual loops for equivalent operations. However, the performance of the JSON method is limited because of its stringification step and the potential loss of certain data types. Furthermore, languages like C++ provide methods such as `std::copy` and algorithms from `<algorithm>` which are often very efficient, leveraging lower level memory access techniques.

The most effective array copying method will often depend on the specific context and needs of your application. For basic numeric arrays without nested structures, native shallow copy or copy module techniques provide the best performance with minimal development effort. When deep copies of nested mutable elements are required, `copy.deepcopy` provides a straightforward solution albeit with performance implications related to increased memory usage and traversal complexity. For extremely large arrays and time-critical operations, specific profiling and custom solutions might be necessary to achieve optimal performance.

I would recommend exploring literature on optimized data structures and algorithms for insights on achieving high performance. Investigating compiler optimization techniques, particularly as they pertain to vectorization, can illuminate lower-level approaches to array copying. Understanding your specific language's core libraries provides access to built-in optimizations for common operations including array copying. Detailed documentation regarding your specific programming language’s standard library will often yield optimized solutions for array manipulation.
