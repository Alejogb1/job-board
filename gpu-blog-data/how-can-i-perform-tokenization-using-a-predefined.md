Controlled vocabulary tokenization, restricting tokenization to a predefined set of words or sub-word units, is crucial for tasks demanding consistent representation and reduced vocabulary size, especially in scenarios with limited resources or the need for interpretability.  My experience working on low-resource language modeling projects highlighted the significant performance gains achievable through this technique.  Simply relying on standard tokenizers often leads to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, disrupting model training and potentially harming downstream performance. This response will detail the process of performing controlled vocabulary tokenization within TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, leveraging three distinct approaches.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Controlled vocabulary tokenization involves mapping each word in a text corpus to a pre-defined vocabulary index.  This vocabulary is typically constructed beforehand, often through techniques such as frequency analysis, pruning based on word embedding similarity, or by leveraging existing word lists like WordNet or a specialized domain lexicon.  Words not present in the vocabulary (OOV words) require special handling, usually assigned a dedicated OOV token index.  The resulting numerical representation facilitates easier model input and allows for efficient storage and processing, especially beneficial when working with large datasets.

The core process comprises several steps:

* **Vocabulary Creation:** Generating the controlled vocabulary, typically sorted by frequency or other criteria.
* **Token Mapping:** Creating a mapping from words to their corresponding indices in the vocabulary. This often involves creating dictionaries or lookup tables.
* **OOV Handling:** Defining a strategy to deal with words absent from the vocabulary, e.g., assigning a unique index or using a special token like `<UNK>`.
* **Sequence Generation:** Transforming text into numerical sequences using the vocabulary mapping and OOV handling.
* **Padding/Truncation (Optional):** Ensuring all sequences have a uniform length, critical for batch processing in deep learning models.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**a) TensorFlow:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Predefined vocabulary
vocabulary = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "<UNK>"]
word_to_index = {word: index for index, word in enumerate(vocabulary)}

def tokenize_tensorflow(text):
  """Tokenizes text using a predefined vocabulary."""
  tokens = text.lower().split()
  token_ids = []
  for token in tokens:
    token_ids.append(word_to_index.get(token, word_to_index["<UNK>"])) #OOV handling
  return token_ids

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
tokenized_text = tokenize_tensorflow(text)
print(f"Tokenized text: {tokenized_text}") #Output will contain index for <UNK> for 'lazy' and 'dog'
```

This TensorFlow example utilizes a simple dictionary for mapping.  For larger vocabularies, a TensorFlow lookup table might offer improved performance.  Error handling for OOV words is explicitly addressed using `.get()` with a default value.


**b) PyTorch:**

```python
import torch

# Predefined vocabulary
vocabulary = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "<UNK>"]
word_to_index = {word: index for index, word in enumerate(vocabulary)}

def tokenize_pytorch(text):
  """Tokenizes text using a predefined vocabulary."""
  tokens = text.lower().split()
  token_ids = [word_to_index.get(token, word_to_index["<UNK>"]) for token in tokens]
  return torch.tensor(token_ids) #Convert to PyTorch tensor

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
tokenized_text = tokenize_pytorch(text)
print(f"Tokenized text: {tokenized_text}") #Output is a PyTorch tensor
```

The PyTorch example mirrors the TensorFlow approach but leverages list comprehension for conciseness and converts the result into a PyTorch tensor, suitable for direct use in PyTorch models.


**c) Keras:**

```python
import tensorflow.keras as keras
import numpy as np

# Predefined vocabulary
vocabulary = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "<UNK>"]
word_to_index = {word: index for index, word in enumerate(vocabulary)}

def tokenize_keras(text):
  """Tokenizes text using a predefined vocabulary."""
  tokens = text.lower().split()
  token_ids = [word_to_index.get(token, word_to_index["<UNK>"]) for token in tokens]
  #Keras expects NumPy arrays as input.  Padding or truncation might be needed here based on sequence length requirements.
  return np.array(token_ids)


text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
tokenized_text = tokenize_keras(text)
print(f"Tokenized text: {tokenized_text}") #Output is a NumPy array.

#Example of padding using Keras preprocessing tools (for illustration)

tokenizer = keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer(num_words=len(vocabulary), oov_token="<UNK>")
tokenizer.fit_on_texts([vocabulary]) #fit tokenizer on our vocabulary
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(["The quick brown fox", "The quick"])
padded_sequences = keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=5)
print(padded_sequences)

```

This Keras example demonstrates tokenization similar to TensorFlow and PyTorch.  Crucially, it emphasizes the importance of converting the token IDs to a NumPy array, the standard data structure for Keras models. The added section demonstrates using Keras's built-in `Tokenizer` for simpler padding.  Note that using the pre-built `Tokenizer` won't directly enforce our *specific* vocabulary if that vocabulary isn't the complete corpus used for training the `Tokenizer`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of vocabulary handling and tokenization strategies, I strongly advise consulting the official documentation for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.  Furthermore, exploring resources on natural language processing (NLP) fundamentals and advanced tokenization techniques, such as subword tokenization (Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece), will enhance your knowledge and enable development of more robust and efficient NLP pipelines.   A solid grasp of vector space models and their relationship to word embeddings is also beneficial.  Finally, research papers on low-resource NLP, particularly those addressing OOV word handling, provide valuable insights and practical solutions.
