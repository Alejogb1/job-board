The core issue with CORS blocking redirects to the origin domain stems from a fundamental security principle:  the prevention of indirect attacks exploiting the browser's same-origin policy.  While a redirect itself isn't inherently malicious, it can be leveraged as a vector for cross-origin attacks if not carefully managed. My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale web applications highlights this vulnerability.  The browser, adhering to the CORS specification, meticulously verifies the origin of each request and response throughout the entire process, including those triggered by redirects.

**Explanation:**

The browser initiates a request to a third-party domain (the target of the initial request).  This request may return a 3xx redirect status code, instructing the browser to fetch a resource from a different URL.  Crucially, this redirect URL must also comply with CORS rules.  If the redirect target is the origin domain, the browser still performs a CORS preflight check (for non-simple requests) or checks the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in the response of the redirect itself.  The failure to meet these CORS requirements will result in the browser blocking the redirect, preventing the final resource from being loaded.  This is not a limitation of redirects per se; it is a robust application of the CORS policy to avoid sophisticated attacks.

One scenario I encountered involved a payment gateway. Our application initiated a payment request to the gateway's domain.  The gateway successfully processed the payment and responded with a redirect to our domain, indicating successful payment. However, because the gateway's response lacked the appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header set to our origin domain, the browser blocked the redirect, leaving the user with a confusing "payment failed" experience despite successful processing.  This highlighted the need for a careful alignment of CORS configurations across all involved services.

**Code Examples:**

The following examples demonstrate scenarios where CORS redirects are either successfully handled or blocked, emphasizing the importance of proper header configuration.

**Example 1: Successful Redirect with CORS Compliance**

```javascript
// Client-side JavaScript (Origin Domain: https://example.com)
fetch('https://payment-gateway.com/process-payment', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ /* payment data */ })
}).then(response => {
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }
  return response.text(); // Expecting a redirect
}).then(redirectURL => {
  // Redirect received, check if allowed
  if (redirectURL.startsWith("https://example.com")) {
      window.location.href = redirectURL;
  } else {
      throw new Error("Invalid redirect URL");
  }
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});

// Server-side (Payment Gateway: https://payment-gateway.com) - Response to POST request
// ... payment processing ...
// Successful payment:
response.writeHead(302, {
  'Location': 'https://example.com/payment-success',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://example.com', // Crucial for CORS compliance
  'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials': 'true' // If using cookies
});
response.end();

```
In this example, the payment gateway explicitly sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to match the origin domain, allowing the redirect to proceed without issue. The `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is included assuming cookies are used for authentication, which mandates this header.  Failure to include this header, when credentials are involved, will prevent the redirect even with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set correctly.

**Example 2: Blocked Redirect due to Missing CORS Header**

```javascript
// Client-side JavaScript (Origin Domain: https://example.com)
// This code is identical to Example 1, except the server response lacks the necessary CORS headers

// Server-side (Payment Gateway: https://payment-gateway.com) - Response to POST request
// ... payment processing ...
// Successful payment:
response.writeHead(302, {
  'Location': 'https://example.com/payment-success'
});
response.end();
```

Here, the crucial `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is missing.  The browser will intercept the redirect and prevent the navigation to `https://example.com/payment-success` due to the CORS violation, triggering a security error.


**Example 3:  Preflight Request and Redirect**

```javascript
// Client-side JavaScript (Origin Domain: https://example.com) -  Non-simple request
fetch('https://api.external.com/data', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-Custom-Header': 'test' //Non-simple request due to custom header
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({})
}).then(response => {
  //If response is a redirect, same rules apply as in Example 1 and 2
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }
  return response.text();
}).then(data => {
  console.log(data)
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});


// Server-side (https://api.external.com) -  Response to OPTIONS preflight request
response.writeHead(200, {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://example.com',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST, GET, OPTIONS',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, X-Custom-Header',
    'Access-Control-Max-Age': '86400', //Cache preflight response for 24 hours
});
response.end();

//Server-side (https://api.external.com) - Response to POST request including redirect
response.writeHead(302, {
  'Location': 'https://example.com/success',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://example.com'
});
response.end();
```
This example involves a non-simple request (due to the custom header) triggering a preflight OPTIONS request. The server must respond to this preflight correctly with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` to permit the actual POST request. The same CORS rules apply to the subsequent redirect response from the POST request.



**Resource Recommendations:**

The CORS specification itself, a well-structured HTTP specification document explaining CORS in detail.  Thorough documentation on the specific web servers you are utilizing (e.g., Nginx, Apache) will be invaluable in configuring CORS headers accurately.  Finally, browser developer tools (specifically the Network tab) provide crucial insights into network requests and responses, allowing you to diagnose CORS issues effectively.  Understanding the HTTP status codes is essential for effective debugging.
