F1-score calculation during compilation is generally not a practical or meaningful operation in the typical software development lifecycle. The F1-score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall, is inherently a metric associated with evaluating the performance of a *trained* model on *data*, not with the static attributes of source code. Compilation focuses on translating source code into executable instructions, and the notion of ‘prediction’ or ‘actual’ classification outcomes, fundamental to F1, simply doesn't exist at this phase. Therefore, the request to calculate F1 during compilation highlights a possible misunderstanding of what compilation does versus what model evaluation entails. However, if we interpret the question as finding a way to approximate an F1-like calculation during a specific, non-standard build process, or during a custom code analysis workflow, that's a more tractable, if specialized, problem. I'll address the latter interpretation, framing a plausible scenario and presenting viable solutions based on my past work on custom static analysis tools.

Let's consider the specific case where during code generation – a phase often following compilation but intertwined with code transformation and optimization processes – we’re generating code with some inherent *classification*, in a broad sense. Imagine a compiler or code generator that synthesizes different code blocks based on static analysis decisions about code paths. The system predicts or classifies a code path as ‘optimized’ or ‘not optimized’. The actual outcome would then be that a section of code *is* or *is not* optimized by the generator. While this isn't machine learning in the traditional sense, we can construct a classification analogy that allows us to use precision, recall, and consequently, F1.

The challenge is then to determine at this specific phase within the build, the compiler or code generator:

1. How to identify a true positive (TP): a piece of code predicted to be optimized and that was optimized.
2. How to identify a false positive (FP): a piece of code predicted to be optimized but that was not optimized.
3. How to identify a false negative (FN): a piece of code predicted not to be optimized but was actually optimized.
4. How to track each of these counts during the process so that F1 can be calculated at the end.

This requires modifying the compilation/code generation toolchain. There's no way to leverage standard compiler features; a custom pipeline is necessary.

The following code examples demonstrate how this could be realized in a hypothetical scenario. Assume we have some internal API that lets us access code properties and modification states within the code generation stage. These examples focus on the logic within the *analysis* and *tracking* phases, and not on the actual code generation/optimization.

**Example 1: Simple Python Tracker**

This Python snippet shows how to accumulate TP, FP, and FN during a hypothetical code generation process. We assume a simplified `CodeGenerator` class with methods to identify optimization predictions and actual outcomes.

```python
class CodeGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.optimized_blocks = set()  # Simulate list of code blocks that actually get optimized.

    def predict_optimization(self, block_id):
         # Hypothetically, our code generator might use some static analysis to decide to optimize
        if block_id % 2 == 0:
            return True # Predict optimization for even IDs
        return False

    def optimize_block(self, block_id):
        if block_id % 3 == 0: # Only optimize blocks that are multiples of three (simulated optimization)
            self.optimized_blocks.add(block_id)


def calculate_f1(tp, fp, fn):
    if tp == 0 and (fp == 0 or fn == 0):
        return 0.0 #Handle ZeroDivisionError and edge case when there aren't any relevant predictions.
    precision = tp / (tp + fp)
    recall = tp / (tp + fn)
    return 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) if precision + recall > 0 else 0

def track_optimization_performance(code_generator, total_blocks):
    tp = 0
    fp = 0
    fn = 0

    for block_id in range(total_blocks):
       predicted_optimization = code_generator.predict_optimization(block_id)
       code_generator.optimize_block(block_id)
       is_optimized = block_id in code_generator.optimized_blocks

       if predicted_optimization and is_optimized:
            tp += 1
       elif predicted_optimization and not is_optimized:
            fp += 1
       elif not predicted_optimization and is_optimized:
            fn += 1

    f1_score = calculate_f1(tp, fp, fn)
    print(f"True Positives: {tp}, False Positives: {fp}, False Negatives: {fn}")
    print(f"F1 Score: {f1_score}")

# Example usage
generator = CodeGenerator()
track_optimization_performance(generator, 10) # Evaluate over 10 blocks
```

In this example, the `CodeGenerator`’s `predict_optimization` method acts as a classifier, and its `optimize_block` method determines the actual outcome. The `track_optimization_performance` function then calculates TP, FP, FN, and ultimately the F1-score. This highlights the necessary logic.

**Example 2: C++ with Hypothetical Analysis API**

Now, let's consider a more performance-oriented (though still simplified) approach in C++, illustrating how this type of tracking could be integrated within a build tool or code generation framework. We assume that the compiler's internal data structures are exposed through a hypothetical C++ API called `CodeAnalysisAPI`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

class CodeAnalysisAPI {
public:
  bool is_block_optimizable(int blockId) {
     // Hypothetical decision based on blockId properties
      return blockId % 2 == 0;
  }

  void apply_optimization(int blockId) {
     if (blockId % 3 == 0) {
        optimizedBlocks.insert(blockId);
    }
  }

  bool is_optimized(int blockId){
        return optimizedBlocks.count(blockId) > 0;
  }

private:
  std::unordered_set<int> optimizedBlocks;
};

double calculateF1(int tp, int fp, int fn) {
  if (tp == 0 && (fp == 0 || fn == 0)){
      return 0.0;
  }
  double precision = static_cast<double>(tp) / (tp + fp);
  double recall = static_cast<double>(tp) / (tp + fn);
    return (precision + recall > 0) ? 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) : 0;

}


void track_optimization_performance(CodeAnalysisAPI& api, int totalBlocks) {
    int tp = 0;
    int fp = 0;
    int fn = 0;

    for (int blockId = 0; blockId < totalBlocks; ++blockId) {
      bool predicted_opt = api.is_block_optimizable(blockId);
      api.apply_optimization(blockId);
      bool is_opt = api.is_optimized(blockId);


       if(predicted_opt && is_opt)
          tp++;
       else if(predicted_opt && !is_opt)
          fp++;
        else if (!predicted_opt && is_opt)
            fn++;
    }
    double f1 = calculateF1(tp, fp, fn);
    std::cout << "True Positives: " << tp << ", False Positives: " << fp << ", False Negatives: " << fn << std::endl;
    std::cout << "F1 Score: " << f1 << std::endl;

}


int main() {
  CodeAnalysisAPI analysisAPI;
  track_optimization_performance(analysisAPI, 10);
  return 0;
}
```

This C++ example mirrors the Python version in principle but uses a C++ `CodeAnalysisAPI` and standard C++ data structures. Note how the `apply_optimization` simulates the actual code transformation step. The `track_optimization_performance` is similar, accumulating the necessary counts and calculates the final F1 score.

**Example 3: Integration with a Build Script**

Let's consider integrating such F1 calculation into a hypothetical build pipeline by simulating a shell script that invokes a compiled program like our previous C++ example, capturing its output.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Compile the C++ program (replace with your actual build command)
g++ f1_tracker.cpp -o f1_tracker

# Run the compiled program, and capture its output
output=$(./f1_tracker)

# Extract the F1 score from the output string (basic parsing example)
f1_score=$(echo "$output" | grep "F1 Score:" | awk '{print $3}')


# Check if the score exceeds the threshold
threshold=0.5  # Define a threshold value
if [[ $(echo "$f1_score > $threshold" | bc) -eq 1 ]]; then
  echo "F1 score above threshold ($threshold): $f1_score"
  # Perform further actions here based on F1-score quality
  exit 0 # Success if F1 is good enough
else
  echo "F1 score below threshold ($threshold): $f1_score"
  exit 1 # Fail the build if F1 is not acceptable
fi
```

This shell script executes the compiled C++ executable (named `f1_tracker`), captures its output, and parses the F1-score. It then checks if the score meets a predefined threshold, causing a success or a fail in the build process, illustrating a primitive but functional integration approach.

These examples demonstrate how F1-like metrics can be used during the compilation *process*, not during a typical compile operation, by framing a hypothetical problem of decision-based code transformations. The examples show how tracking, basic calculations, and build integration might look. This framework allows for evaluation of code transformations, or even code generation, using a classification methodology similar to model performance evaluation.

**Resource Recommendations**

For those delving deeper into the internals of compilers and build systems, a strong foundation in compiler theory is advisable. A good text on compiler construction will introduce the phases of compilation, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation which forms a context for introducing any custom modifications. Exploring the internals of code optimization and transformations would be highly relevant. Familiarity with build systems like Make, CMake, and similar tools, or build scripting languages like Python will enable integration into pipelines, as shown in the shell example. If delving into static analysis, researching techniques like abstract interpretation, data-flow analysis, and control-flow analysis, is essential to build tools that can make prediction necessary for the kind of tracking mechanism discussed here. While this topic focuses on a very specific need, these resources will provide a solid understanding of the core components necessary to implement these types of custom analysis during a build process.
