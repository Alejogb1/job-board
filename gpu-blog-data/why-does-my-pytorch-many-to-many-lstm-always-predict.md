Recurrent neural networks, particularly LSTMs, exhibiting a tendency to predict the mean within a many-to-many sequence modeling context is frequently rooted in insufficient training and information bottlenecks, not inherent limitations of the architecture itself. This issue, which I have encountered across multiple time-series forecasting and natural language generation tasks, stems from a combination of factors that prevent the model from capturing the complex temporal dependencies present in the data.

Primarily, the root cause often lies in the inadequacy of the loss function to properly guide the learning process. If the loss landscape does not incentivize the model to diverge from predicting the mean, and the initial parameters are close to a state that facilitates that prediction, stochastic gradient descent can become trapped in that local minima. Effectively, the model finds it easier to minimize the loss by outputting a uniform prediction that approximates the average value of the target sequence rather than generating a diverse, contextually-relevant output.

A second critical issue emerges from limitations in the training data itself. Insufficiently varied data or sequences lacking enough complex patterns can prevent the LSTM from capturing anything beyond the most fundamental statistical property, the mean. If the input sequences are largely similar and the variability in the output sequences is not clearly linked to distinct patterns in the input, the model struggles to learn any meaningful relationships. This often occurs when the input time-series features a low signal-to-noise ratio, or the sequence lengths are excessively short.

Furthermore, inappropriate hyperparameter settings can also lead to this behavior. Learning rates set too high can cause the optimization algorithm to oscillate wildly and fail to converge to a more nuanced solution. Similarly, a hidden state size that is not sufficiently large enough can act as a bottleneck, preventing the model from effectively memorizing the information from the input sequence necessary for predicting diverse output sequences. A small hidden size can essentially force the model to compress the sequence data, resulting in the loss of temporal relationships and consequently limiting the output to a mean value. Regularization, or the lack thereof, can further contribute to the problem. Insufficient regularization might cause the model to overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization. Conversely, excessive regularization may inhibit the learning of complex patterns.

Let's delve into some code examples and explore how each of these points manifests in practice:

**Example 1: Insufficient Training Data and Basic Loss**

Here, I present a situation where an extremely simple dataset is used, paired with a standard Mean Squared Error loss. Assume that we have a very small dataset consisting of sequences that are all variations of a line that has a mean close to 0.5.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Generate dummy data
input_size = 1
hidden_size = 32
output_size = 1
seq_length = 10
num_sequences = 100
data_X = torch.randn(num_sequences, seq_length, input_size)
data_Y = torch.randn(num_sequences, seq_length, output_size) * 0.1 + 0.5 # Mean around 0.5


class ManyToManyLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(ManyToManyLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out)
        return out


model = ManyToManyLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_function = nn.MSELoss()

epochs = 500
for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    predictions = model(data_X)
    loss = loss_function(predictions, data_Y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    if (epoch+1) % 100 == 0:
       print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
print("Example 1 Mean Predictions:", torch.mean(model(data_X), dim=1))
```

In this scenario, the model will quickly converge to predicting outputs close to the mean because the target data isn't sufficiently complex. The very rudimentary loss function provides no pressure for the model to learn nuanced temporal patterns. Observe the output during training; it shows a rapid decrease in loss, but it doesn't reflect learning.

**Example 2: Large Hidden Size and Complex Data**

This example illustrates the importance of adequate model capacity and more complex training data. We increase the hidden state size and generate data that has more distinct patterns.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

# Generate more complex dummy data
input_size = 1
hidden_size = 128 # Increased Hidden Size
output_size = 1
seq_length = 20
num_sequences = 200

def generate_sine_wave_sequence(length):
  t = np.linspace(0, 4*np.pi, length)
  return np.sin(t) + np.random.randn(length)*0.1

data_X = []
data_Y = []
for _ in range(num_sequences):
  wave = generate_sine_wave_sequence(seq_length)
  data_X.append(wave)
  data_Y.append(wave[1:])
data_X = torch.tensor(np.array(data_X), dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(-1)
data_Y = torch.tensor(np.array(data_Y), dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(-1)

class ManyToManyLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(ManyToManyLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out)
        return out


model = ManyToManyLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
loss_function = nn.MSELoss()

epochs = 1000
for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    predictions = model(data_X)
    loss = loss_function(predictions[:,:-1,:], data_Y) #Aligning lengths
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    if (epoch+1) % 200 == 0:
       print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
print("Example 2 Predictions:", model(data_X)[0])
print("Example 2 Ground Truth:", data_Y[0])
```

By increasing the hidden size and adding more variety to the data via sine waves, the network is now able to learn the temporal characteristics present in each sequence and produces an output that is meaningfully different from the mean of the target sequence. This is not to say the model is fully trained but itâ€™s capable of learning the required features.

**Example 3:  Using Teacher Forcing and a More Complex Loss Function**

In this final example, we introduce teacher forcing and a loss function that provides more fine grained feedback, such as a combination of Mean Squared Error and a penalty for predicting the mean. Note: This is a conceptual example and the correct penalty term depends on the data and task.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

# Generate data similar to Example 2
input_size = 1
hidden_size = 128 # Increased Hidden Size
output_size = 1
seq_length = 20
num_sequences = 200

def generate_sine_wave_sequence(length):
  t = np.linspace(0, 4*np.pi, length)
  return np.sin(t) + np.random.randn(length)*0.1

data_X = []
data_Y = []
for _ in range(num_sequences):
  wave = generate_sine_wave_sequence(seq_length)
  data_X.append(wave)
  data_Y.append(wave[1:])
data_X = torch.tensor(np.array(data_X), dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(-1)
data_Y = torch.tensor(np.array(data_Y), dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(-1)

class ManyToManyLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(ManyToManyLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x, teacher_forcing_ratio = 0.5, target=None):
        batch_size = x.size(0)
        outputs = torch.zeros_like(target)
        hidden = None # Starting hidden state

        input_tensor = x[:,0,:].unsqueeze(1) #initial input
        for i in range(target.size(1)):
            out, hidden = self.lstm(input_tensor, hidden)
            out = self.fc(out)
            outputs[:,i,:] = out.squeeze(1)
            teacher_force = np.random.random() < teacher_forcing_ratio
            input_tensor = target[:,i,:].unsqueeze(1) if teacher_force else out
        return outputs


model = ManyToManyLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
mse_loss = nn.MSELoss()

def custom_loss(predictions, target):
    mse = mse_loss(predictions, target)
    mean_prediction = torch.mean(predictions, dim=1)
    mean_target = torch.mean(target, dim = 1)
    mean_penalty = torch.mean((mean_prediction-mean_target)**2) # Penalizing the mean predictions being far from target
    return mse + mean_penalty * 0.1

epochs = 1000
for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    predictions = model(data_X, target = data_Y)
    loss = custom_loss(predictions, data_Y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    if (epoch+1) % 200 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
print("Example 3 Predictions:", model(data_X, target=data_Y)[0])
print("Example 3 Ground Truth:", data_Y[0])
```

This example illustrates the benefit of using teacher forcing and a custom loss function.  Teacher forcing allows for faster convergence and helps the model to learn from its mistakes. By adding a mean prediction penalty to the loss, we further discourage the network from converging on just predicting the mean. While this setup is specific to this example, a similar custom loss function can be developed based on the data and task in question.

To further improve performance in real-world scenarios, I recommend exploring advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms which allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, or methods that tackle vanishing gradients like gradient clipping. Considering data augmentation techniques is also valuable if the dataset is limited.

For additional information regarding LSTMs and sequence modeling, research material on recurrent neural networks, focusing on advanced topics, provides a strong foundation. Books and tutorials on time-series analysis and natural language processing often include comprehensive sections on LSTMs and their applications. In addition to more traditional resources, exploring research publications focusing on attention mechanisms, transformers, and advanced optimization techniques for recurrent networks would also be beneficial.
