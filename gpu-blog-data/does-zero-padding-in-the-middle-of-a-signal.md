Zero-padding in the middle of a time-domain signal fundamentally alters its frequency representation and consequently impacts the result of FFT-based convolution.  My experience working on spectral analysis for seismic data processing highlighted this precisely.  Inserting zeros mid-signal doesn't simply add silence; it introduces artificial discontinuities that manifest as significant distortions in the frequency domain, affecting the accuracy of any convolution performed using the FFT.

**1. Explanation:**

FFT-based convolution leverages the convolution theorem, which states that convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain. The process typically involves: (1) zero-padding the input signals to a length exceeding the sum of the individual signal lengths, (2) performing an FFT on each padded signal, (3) multiplying the resulting frequency-domain representations, and (4) performing an inverse FFT (IFFT) to obtain the convolved signal in the time domain.

Zero-padding *before* the signals are convolved is a standard practice to avoid circular convolution artifacts and increase the resolution of the frequency-domain representation. However, introducing zero-padding *within* a signal disrupts the temporal continuity of the data.  This discontinuity generates spurious high-frequency components during the FFT, which are not reflective of the original signal’s properties.  These artificial high frequencies then participate in the frequency-domain multiplication, ultimately contaminating the final convolved output.  The result isn't simply a lengthened signal with zeros in the middle; instead, the convolution itself is altered, possibly leading to inaccurate or meaningless results depending on the nature of the signals and the convolution operation. The severity of the distortion depends on several factors, including the length of the zero-padded segment, the signal's characteristics (e.g., frequency content, discontinuities), and the type of convolution being performed (e.g., linear, circular).

The effect is akin to introducing a sharp step function into the signal.  The Fourier transform of a step function exhibits a sinc-like behavior in the frequency domain, containing significant energy at high frequencies. This artificial frequency content, introduced by the internal zero-padding, directly contaminates the convolution.


**2. Code Examples:**

These examples illustrate the issue using Python with NumPy and SciPy.  I've opted for simplicity to clearly demonstrate the core problem; more sophisticated signal processing libraries could be used in a real-world scenario.

**Example 1:  Standard Convolution**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.fft import fft, ifft

# Two signals
signal1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
signal2 = np.array([6, 7, 8])

# Standard zero-padding for linear convolution
N = len(signal1) + len(signal2) -1
padded1 = np.pad(signal1, (0, N - len(signal1)), 'constant')
padded2 = np.pad(signal2, (0, N - len(signal2)), 'constant')

# FFT-based convolution
fft1 = fft(padded1)
fft2 = fft(padded2)
fft_mult = fft1 * fft2
conv = np.real(ifft(fft_mult))

print("Standard Convolution:", conv)
```

This shows a typical, correctly performed FFT convolution.  Note the zero-padding is at the *ends* of the signals.

**Example 2: Mid-Signal Zero-Padding**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.fft import fft, ifft

# Signal with mid-signal zero-padding
signal = np.array([1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5])

# Attempting convolution with another signal
signal2 = np.array([6, 7, 8])
N = len(signal) + len(signal2) - 1

padded_signal = np.pad(signal, (0, N - len(signal)), 'constant')
padded_signal2 = np.pad(signal2, (0, N - len(signal2)), 'constant')

fft_signal = fft(padded_signal)
fft_signal2 = fft(padded_signal2)
fft_mult = fft_signal * fft_signal2
conv = np.real(ifft(fft_mult))


print("Convolution with Mid-Signal Zero-Padding:", conv)
```

This example demonstrates the impact. The zeros inserted within `signal` introduce artifacts which distort the convolution result.


**Example 3:  Comparison with Time-Domain Convolution**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import convolve

#Original signal
signal = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
signal2 = np.array([6, 7, 8])

# Time domain convolution
time_domain_conv = np.convolve(signal, signal2, 'full')
print("Time Domain Convolution:", time_domain_conv)

#Signal with mid-padding
signal_padded = np.array([1,2,0,0,3,4,5])

#Time domain convolution with mid-padded signal
time_domain_conv_padded = np.convolve(signal_padded, signal2,'full')
print("Time Domain Convolution (mid-padded):", time_domain_conv_padded)


```
This example directly compares the results of a time-domain convolution (which doesn’t use FFTs and thus isn't affected by internal zero-padding) with the outcome from a signal containing internal zero-padding.  The difference highlights the spurious results stemming from the FFT-based approach with mid-signal zeros.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  A comprehensive textbook on digital signal processing covering the discrete Fourier transform and convolution.
*  A reference on numerical methods for signal processing, focusing on FFT algorithms and their limitations.
*  A publication or research paper specifically addressing the effects of zero-padding on FFT-based convolution.  Consider searching for papers within the context of your specific application area (e.g., image processing, seismic data analysis, etc.).  Look for articles focusing on the influence of data discontinuities on spectral analysis and the reliability of FFT-based convolutions.




In conclusion, inserting zeros within a signal *before* performing an FFT-based convolution leads to inaccurate results due to the introduction of artificial high-frequency components.  Standard zero-padding techniques should be used at the *beginning* and *end* of the signals to avoid circular convolution effects and improve frequency resolution; however, modifying a signal internally by inserting zeros will significantly affect the outcome of the FFT-based convolution.  A time-domain convolution provides a more robust alternative when dealing with signals that may have internal gaps or discontinuities.
