The observation of a constant training loss during multiclass classification, despite the model continuing to iterate through training epochs, typically signals an issue with the training process rather than inherent limitations of the learning algorithm itself. I've encountered this several times in my experience, most notably while fine-tuning a BERT model for a text categorization task where I incorrectly handled the label encoding. The issue rarely stems from a model having converged too quickly; rather, it points toward either a problem with the data, the model’s capacity, or a fundamental flaw in the training procedure itself.

**Explanation**

The training loss, quantified by functions like categorical cross-entropy for multiclass scenarios, is intended to quantify the disparity between a model’s predictions and the actual ground truth labels. For the training loss to decrease, the model’s weights must adjust such that its output probability distribution over all possible classes shifts to more closely resemble the true probability distribution (typically a one-hot encoding representing the correct class). If this loss doesn't change, several underlying causes can be at play:

1. **Data Issues:** The most common culprit is incorrect label handling. This can manifest as a total or partial detachment of the provided target variables from the input features. If, for example, labels are not one-hot encoded and remain as raw class indices while the loss function expects one-hot vectors, the gradient computation will lack the necessary direction towards correct classifications. Also, inconsistencies between the input data and labels (such as shuffled datasets without proper label re-alignment) can render training ineffective. Finally, having a poorly balanced dataset, where certain classes are vastly underrepresented, can lead to training primarily focusing on the dominant classes, resulting in little loss decrease.

2. **Model Capacity Limitations:** While less common in most deep-learning scenarios, if a model is severely underparameterized (e.g., a shallow network trying to model highly complex input patterns), it will likely plateau at a mediocre loss without converging to better representations. In those circumstances, the gradients, albeit nonzero, are ineffective in achieving significant improvement. However, in scenarios where pre-trained models are utilized, this is rarely a constraint unless they are drastically modified.

3. **Training Procedure Flaws:** Incorrect implementations of the loss function itself, while rare, can certainly lead to training stagnation. A custom loss function, especially, could have errors in its gradient implementation. Additionally, an excessively large learning rate, especially in the beginning of training, can cause the model to fluctuate around the minima, and therefore not learn effectively. In contrast, an extremely small learning rate might result in negligible parameter updates and thus little discernible change in the loss function. Similarly, poor optimizer selection and its specific parameters can contribute to stalled training. For instance, a basic Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer may not perform optimally with large batches or in complex datasets, unlike more advanced options such as Adam. Finally, issues with hardware resource constraints (e.g., running out of GPU memory during training) can result in abrupt loss values or complete halt of gradient descent, which might be mistaken for a stalled loss.

4. **Initialization Issues:** While less common with pre-trained models, random weight initializations of the model that position it far from an acceptable local minimum can also cause this effect. However, with commonly used modern deep-learning initialization techniques, such as Xavier/Glorot and He initialization, this has become less problematic unless the architecture is severely custom or extremely large.

**Code Examples and Commentary**

These examples illustrate scenarios which can lead to constant training loss and how to correct them in a Python environment using a typical deep learning library such as TensorFlow and related utilities.

**Example 1: Incorrect Label Encoding**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data for demonstration purposes
num_samples = 100
num_classes = 3
features = np.random.rand(num_samples, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, num_samples)

# Incorrect loss function
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Labels provided in integer form
model.fit(features, labels, epochs=5)
```
*Commentary:* In this example, the labels are provided as integers while using the `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss. This can seem correct since this loss is intended for integer target. However, the input data itself does not change across epochs and therefore, the loss remains close to the random accuracy for each epoch, exhibiting little change. This is because the loss function doesn't have the correct reference point to determine how inaccurate the output of the model is.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data
num_samples = 100
num_classes = 3
features = np.random.rand(num_samples, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, num_samples)
labels_one_hot = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(labels, num_classes=num_classes) # One hot encode labels

# Correct use of categorical_crossentropy
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(features, labels_one_hot, epochs=5) # Training with one-hot labels
```
*Commentary:* This corrected version uses `categorical_crossentropy` along with proper one-hot encoding of labels. Here, the correct target representation is provided, and the model learns over the epochs, with a decreasing training loss. The critical change here was using the categorical cross-entropy which requires one-hot encoded labels. If integer labels are desired while still using one-hot encoding, the alternative is to use `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` with integer labels.

**Example 2: Overly Small Model Capacity**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate complex synthetic data
num_samples = 100
num_classes = 3
features = np.random.rand(num_samples, 100) # Large input feature size
labels = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, num_samples)
labels_one_hot = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(labels, num_classes=num_classes)

# Model with extremely small capacity
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(features, labels_one_hot, epochs=5) # Limited improvement
```
*Commentary:* Here, the model has only one layer with as many output units as classes. This model would struggle to learn complex patterns in the data. The input has a large number of features (100) and a simple model will not be able to capture underlying relationships.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate complex synthetic data
num_samples = 100
num_classes = 3
features = np.random.rand(num_samples, 100)
labels = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, num_samples)
labels_one_hot = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(labels, num_classes=num_classes)

# Increase model capacity
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(features, labels_one_hot, epochs=5) # Significant improvement
```
*Commentary:* By adding a hidden layer with an activation function, the model is provided with additional capacity. Now it is capable of learning more intricate relationships within the data which directly translates to a lower loss function during training.

**Example 3: Inappropriate Learning Rate**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data
num_samples = 100
num_classes = 3
features = np.random.rand(num_samples, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, num_samples)
labels_one_hot = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(labels, num_classes=num_classes)

# Overly large learning rate
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1.0) # Exaggerated learning rate
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(features, labels_one_hot, epochs=5) # No improvement
```
*Commentary:* A learning rate that is set to 1.0 is very large and causes the model parameters to fluctuate heavily during optimization. In this case, the loss remains constant as the optimization process fails to converge.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data
num_samples = 100
num_classes = 3
features = np.random.rand(num_samples, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, num_samples)
labels_one_hot = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(labels, num_classes=num_classes)

# Reasonable learning rate
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001) # Correct learning rate
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(features, labels_one_hot, epochs=5) # Significant improvement
```
*Commentary:* Here, by reducing the learning rate to 0.001 (a much more sensible value), the training process can converge to a better solution, yielding a constantly reducing training loss.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration of this topic, I recommend examining resources focused on training neural networks, specifically covering these subject matters:

1.  **Deep Learning Textbooks:** Comprehensive textbooks covering the theoretical underpinnings of loss functions and optimization strategies provide necessary context to fully grasp the reasons behind loss plateaus. These often include discussions on proper label encoding and gradient issues.

2.  **Deep Learning Framework Documentation:** Review the official documentation for frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. The documentation provides crucial information regarding the proper usage of specific loss functions, optimizers and common practices for data handling and processing.

3.  **Online Courses and Tutorials:** There are numerous online resources covering best practices in training and debugging neural networks. Such courses often deal with common issues like constant training loss, providing hands-on solutions and techniques.

By paying careful attention to the aspects covered, constant training loss can be easily diagnosed and rectified, leading to more effective neural network models.
