The challenge of selectively masking tensor slices per row frequently arises in tasks involving variable-length sequences or structured data within batches, where padding is often employed. Instead of applying a uniform mask across an entire tensor, targeted masking ensures that only relevant portions of each row are considered during computation, preserving the integrity of the data while avoiding interference from padding or extraneous values.

Essentially, one aims to generate a mask tensor of the same dimensions as the target tensor, but populated with boolean or numerical values that delineate which elements to retain (typically represented by a 1 or 'True') and which to discard (typically represented by a 0 or 'False'). The key is to make this mask dependent on row-specific information, rather than creating a global mask applicable to all rows. This is particularly crucial when working with models that process sequential or variable-length inputs, as it prevents the model from learning patterns from artificially padded regions, which do not carry meaningful signal.

I have encountered this problem when developing a neural network model for processing time series data with varying observation lengths. The input data was represented as a three-dimensional tensor of shape `[batch_size, max_sequence_length, feature_dimension]`. Each time series within a batch had a different number of actual observations, requiring row-wise masking to avoid errors and enhance model performance.

The procedure begins by acquiring information about the valid length of each sequence. Typically, this information is provided by an auxiliary tensor that specifies the lengths or starting indices of each sequence per batch. Given this information, one can then construct the mask tensor programmatically, leveraging tensor manipulation libraries. My experience indicates that a common approach involves creating a tensor of indices representing valid positions within each sequence, followed by broadcasting these valid indices against the full tensor's length, and subsequently converting the result into a boolean or numerical mask.

I have found it advantageous to use a combination of `arange`, `reshape`, and broadcasting operations in libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Specifically, `arange` creates a sequence of numbers, which can then be reshaped to match the dimensions of the input tensor. Broadcasting allows for a comparison of the valid indices with the indices generated by `arange`, leading to the creation of the mask itself. The following are a series of examples to show how different masking approaches are implementable across various use cases.

**Example 1: Masking Variable Length Sequences**

This example demonstrates generating a boolean mask for a batch of sequences with different lengths using TensorFlow. The mask indicates which elements within each sequence are valid and which are padding.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor [batch_size, max_length, feature_dim]
input_tensor = tf.constant([
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [0, 0, 0]],  # Sequence of length 3
    [[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], # Sequence of length 2
    [[20, 21, 22], [23, 24, 25], [26, 27, 28], [29, 30, 31]] # Sequence of length 4
], dtype=tf.float32)
sequence_lengths = tf.constant([3, 2, 4], dtype=tf.int32)

batch_size = tf.shape(input_tensor)[0]
max_length = tf.shape(input_tensor)[1]

# Create a tensor of indices representing each position within each sequence
indices = tf.range(max_length)
indices = tf.reshape(indices, [1, max_length])
indices = tf.broadcast_to(indices, [batch_size, max_length])

# Create mask by comparing with valid sequence lengths
mask = tf.sequence_mask(sequence_lengths, maxlen=max_length)
mask = tf.cast(mask, tf.float32) # Convert to numerical mask for easier use

# Apply the mask to the tensor (element-wise multiplication)
masked_tensor = input_tensor * tf.expand_dims(mask, axis=-1)

print("Original Tensor:\n", input_tensor)
print("Mask Tensor:\n", mask)
print("Masked Tensor:\n", masked_tensor)
```

In this instance, `tf.sequence_mask` directly generates the boolean mask given sequence lengths. `tf.cast` converts the boolean mask to a float for element-wise operations. The mask is expanded along a dimension using `tf.expand_dims` before multiplication, matching the third dimension of the input tensor, ensuring that each feature dimension is masked equally. The output tensor has zeroed-out elements corresponding to the padded regions of the original tensor.

**Example 2: Masking Using Row-Specific Start and End Indices**

This example demonstrates a more flexible approach using row-specific start and end indices, useful when the valid data spans a non-contiguous section of each sequence. This can be common when dealing with pre-processed input data, where some portion of each sequence may contain noisy or irrelevant information. I experienced a very similar case when preparing data from scientific instruments, where each row of data had varying calibration sections to exclude.

```python
import torch

# Input tensor [batch_size, max_length, feature_dim]
input_tensor = torch.tensor([
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], # Mask 1-3 (exclusive)
    [[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18], [19, 20, 21]], # Mask 0-2 (exclusive)
    [[20, 21, 22], [23, 24, 25], [26, 27, 28], [29, 30, 31]], # Mask 2-4 (exclusive)
], dtype=torch.float32)

start_indices = torch.tensor([1, 0, 2])
end_indices = torch.tensor([3, 2, 4])

batch_size = input_tensor.shape[0]
max_length = input_tensor.shape[1]

# Create a tensor of indices representing each position within each sequence
indices = torch.arange(max_length).reshape(1, max_length).expand(batch_size, max_length)

# Create the mask: 1 if (start <= index < end), else 0.
mask = (indices >= start_indices.unsqueeze(1)) & (indices < end_indices.unsqueeze(1))
mask = mask.float()  # Convert to numerical mask for easier use

# Apply the mask to the tensor (element-wise multiplication)
masked_tensor = input_tensor * mask.unsqueeze(-1)

print("Original Tensor:\n", input_tensor)
print("Mask Tensor:\n", mask)
print("Masked Tensor:\n", masked_tensor)
```
Here, PyTorch is used to demonstrate the masking process using start and end indices. `torch.arange` and `reshape` perform a similar function as `tf.range` and `reshape`. A boolean mask is constructed using a logical AND operation between two comparisons: `indices` greater than or equal to the start and `indices` less than the end. Again, a numerical mask is produced by converting the boolean result to floats. The `.unsqueeze(-1)` operation allows for masking of the appropriate dimensions of the input tensor.

**Example 3: Masking with Sparse Data using Indices**

This example tackles a scenario where each row has a different set of valid indices instead of contiguous start/end points. This situation might occur when dealing with sparse data, where the valid elements are not located at consecutive positions.

```python
import numpy as np

# Input tensor [batch_size, max_length, feature_dim]
input_tensor = np.array([
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], # Mask indices 1, 3
    [[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18], [19, 20, 21]], # Mask indices 0, 1
    [[20, 21, 22], [23, 24, 25], [26, 27, 28], [29, 30, 31]], # Mask indices 0, 2, 3
])

valid_indices = [
    np.array([1, 3]),
    np.array([0, 1]),
    np.array([0, 2, 3])
]

batch_size = input_tensor.shape[0]
max_length = input_tensor.shape[1]

# Create an empty mask
mask = np.zeros((batch_size, max_length), dtype=float)

# Fill the mask based on the valid indices per row
for i, indices in enumerate(valid_indices):
    mask[i, indices] = 1

# Reshape mask and apply to the input
masked_tensor = input_tensor * mask[:,:,np.newaxis]

print("Original Tensor:\n", input_tensor)
print("Mask Tensor:\n", mask)
print("Masked Tensor:\n", masked_tensor)

```

In this example using NumPy, the mask is constructed iteratively. For each row, the mask is updated at specified indices with `1`, indicating valid elements. A new axis `np.newaxis` is added to the mask array to prepare it for element-wise multiplication against the 3-dimensional input. This method is especially adaptable for cases where the valid positions are not readily specified by ranges and can handle arbitrary combinations of indices.

When implementing these techniques, I recommend consulting the documentation of the respective libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy) for further details on available tensor manipulation operations and performance optimization. Resources focusing on sequence processing in neural networks often discuss various masking techniques, offering theoretical context and best practices. Books and articles on deep learning, particularly those covering recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers, provide good insights on padding and masking strategies. Always consider the computational implications when selecting a particular strategy, as broadcasting or iterative approaches might incur different overheads depending on the scale of the tensors involved. Utilizing sparse matrix operations if your data sparsity is high may lead to additional optimizations.
