TensorFlow, in its core functionality, does not inherently require a continuous internet connection for every operation after initial setup. Having spent considerable time deploying models on edge devices, I’ve observed that the primary dependency on internet connectivity occurs during the installation process and for specific functionalities, like accessing datasets hosted online. The local execution of a trained model, for example, relies solely on locally stored data and computation.

The core TensorFlow library, once installed, essentially operates as a mathematical computation engine. Operations such as tensor manipulations, gradient calculations, and model inference are carried out using locally available libraries and system resources. This includes the optimized numerical computation backends and the model weights saved to local storage after training or downloading. An internet connection becomes necessary during specific scenarios, which I will describe.

Firstly, the initial TensorFlow installation, facilitated through pip or Conda, inherently depends on an internet connection. These package managers need to reach the respective repositories to download and install the core TensorFlow package and its dependencies. This step is unavoidable for an initial setup or when updating TensorFlow to a newer version. The dependency chain, including libraries like NumPy and absl-py, also necessitates access to PyPI or the equivalent package index. This reliance on remote servers is a crucial bottleneck for offline installations or situations with restricted network access.

Secondly, model training, particularly with large datasets, often depends on remote data sources. While datasets can be pre-downloaded and used locally, many common tutorials and practical workflows leverage data hosted on cloud platforms or data repositories. The TensorFlow Datasets module, for example, facilitates easy downloading of established datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet. If not pre-downloaded or available locally, the TensorFlow runtime requires internet connectivity to fetch these datasets during training. This implies that repeated access to these remote locations would become necessary each time the pipeline attempts to access the data, affecting efficiency in environments with inconsistent internet connectivity.

Thirdly, certain functionalities offered by TensorFlow directly interact with web-based services. For example, using TensorFlow Hub to access pre-trained model architectures requires internet connectivity. TensorFlow Hub provides a centralized location for downloading pre-trained models and model components, greatly simplifying workflows by avoiding local model setup. If a pre-trained model is not already cached locally, or if a model is specified using a URL, the system will attempt to contact the server at the specified endpoint, thus requiring an active internet connection. Similarly, integrating with cloud-based training services or deployment options, such as Google Cloud AI Platform or Amazon SageMaker, also necessitates network connectivity.

Let me illustrate these points with code examples:

**Example 1: Model Inference (No Internet Required after Setup)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume a model is already trained and saved locally (my_model.h5)
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')

# Create a dummy input for prediction.
test_input = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1) # Example for a grayscale image input

# Perform inference. No internet needed here.
prediction = model.predict(test_input)
print(prediction)
```

In this example, a pre-trained model is loaded from local storage.  The `tf.keras.models.load_model()` function operates entirely offline, assuming the ‘my_model.h5’ file is present on the system.  The subsequent `model.predict()` operation performs the necessary calculations without requiring network access. This core inference functionality highlights the offline nature of TensorFlow’s computational engine when the model and associated data are local.

**Example 2: Dataset Download (Internet Required)**

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Attempt to download the MNIST dataset (requires an internet connection)
try:
  mnist_data = tfds.load('mnist', as_supervised=True, data_dir='local_mnist_data')
  print("MNIST dataset downloaded successfully!")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error downloading MNIST dataset: {e}")

```

Here, the `tfds.load('mnist', ...)` function, from the TensorFlow Datasets library, attempts to download the MNIST dataset. The `data_dir` parameter is set to `local_mnist_data` which stores the downloaded dataset locally. If the dataset is not found locally, this command requires an internet connection to download the data from the TensorFlow Datasets repository. The `try...except` block handles the potential errors that would arise if an internet connection is not available. If the download fails, then subsequent operations that require this dataset will be blocked.

**Example 3: Using TensorFlow Hub (Internet Required)**

```python
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    # Attempt to load a pre-trained image classification model from TensorFlow Hub.
    mobilenet_v2_url = "https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/classification/4"
    module = hub.KerasLayer(mobilenet_v2_url)
    print("MobileNetV2 module loaded from TensorFlow Hub successfully!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading module from TensorFlow Hub: {e}")

# Prepare an example input for the model.
image_shape = (224, 224, 3) # Input shape for MobileNetV2
dummy_image = tf.random.normal(shape=[1, *image_shape])

# If module is loaded, make a prediction.
if "module" in locals():
  result = module(dummy_image)
  print(result.shape)
```
In this case, we attempt to load the MobileNetV2 pre-trained model directly from TensorFlow Hub using its specified URL. This requires internet connectivity. Upon first execution, the model is downloaded and cached locally. However, if the model is not cached or the `hub.KerasLayer` encounters any network-related issues, an exception is raised. Once downloaded, the subsequent prediction can proceed offline with the loaded model from the cache, but the initial load depends on a stable connection.

In summary, TensorFlow operates effectively offline for most post-setup activities involving locally stored models and data. The internet dependency arises during the initial installation, when using the TensorFlow Datasets library, or when working with TensorFlow Hub or cloud services. Understanding these nuances allows for efficient planning, particularly in environments with limited or unreliable internet access.

For further understanding, I would recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation, paying special attention to the installation instructions and the sections on TensorFlow Datasets and TensorFlow Hub. Furthermore, the "Effective TensorFlow" guides offer detailed insights into optimization techniques, which could be useful when dealing with situations with limited bandwidth or needing more efficient data handling. Also, exploring tutorials and examples found in TensorFlow’s community documentation and examples will provide a practical understanding of how these functionalities are used in practice.
