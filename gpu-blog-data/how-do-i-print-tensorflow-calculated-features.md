TensorFlow's intermediate feature representations aren't directly printable in a readily interpretable format.  The challenge lies in TensorFlow's inherent focus on computation graphs, where tensors are ephemeral objects representing data flowing through operations.  Directly printing a tensor often yields a memory address or a complex data structure unsuitable for human comprehension.  To successfully print these calculated features, one needs to understand the context of tensor creation and leverage TensorFlow's functionality to extract and format the data appropriately. My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted this issue repeatedly.  Successfully handling this required meticulous attention to both the TensorFlow graph and the chosen output mechanism.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The crux of the problem lies in distinguishing between the *definition* of a tensor and its *value*.  When you define a layer in a TensorFlow model, you're essentially describing a computation, not its output. The actual numerical values associated with that tensor only exist during execution.  To print these values, you need to execute the graph (or a portion of it) and then extract the tensor's content.  This often involves running a TensorFlow session (in older versions) or utilizing Keras's `predict` or `evaluate` methods in newer TensorFlow/Keras integrations.  Furthermore, consider the tensor's dimensionality;  a single number is easy to print, but a high-dimensional tensor requires careful formatting for meaningful display.  The best approach will vary based on whether you're working within a training loop, during inference, or performing debugging.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Printing Layer Outputs During Training (using tf.GradientTape and tf.function):**

This example shows how to access and print intermediate features during the training process using `tf.GradientTape`.  This is useful for monitoring feature activations during model training and debugging.  Note that this adds computational overhead and should not be used extensively during production training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def training_step(images, labels, model):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(images)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(labels, predictions))

  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  # Access intermediate layer output - assuming model has a layer named 'my_layer'
  intermediate_features = model.layers[1](images) #Replace '1' with index of layer

  # Print a summary of the intermediate features, avoiding large outputs
  print("Intermediate Features Shape:", intermediate_features.shape)
  print("Intermediate Features Mean:", tf.reduce_mean(intermediate_features).numpy())
  print("Intermediate Features Variance:", tf.math.reduce_variance(intermediate_features).numpy())

  # ... rest of the training step (optimizer application) ...
```

**Commentary:**  This leverages `tf.function` for optimization and `tf.GradientTape` for automatic differentiation, which is essential in a training context. The code extracts features from `model.layers[1]`, replacing the index to select the desired layer.  Directly printing the entire tensor would be inefficient and impractical; hence, summarizing statistics (mean, variance, shape) provides a manageable overview. Using `.numpy()` converts the Tensorflow tensor to a NumPy array which is easily printed.

**Example 2: Printing Predictions During Inference (using Keras' `predict`):**

This approach is suited for inference, where you're interested in the model's output for a given input. It's more efficient than modifying the training loop.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... model definition ...

# Sample input data
sample_input = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)  # Example image data

#Get intermediate layer output from the model
intermediate_layer_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=model.layers[3].output) #Replace 3 with layer index
intermediate_output = intermediate_layer_model.predict(sample_input)

# Print the intermediate output, potentially slicing for larger datasets
print("Intermediate Output Shape:", intermediate_output.shape)
print("First 5 examples of intermediate output:\n", intermediate_output[0, :5, :5])

# ... further processing of predictions ...
```

**Commentary:**  This showcases the cleaner method using Keras' `predict` method.  We create a new model that only includes layers up to the desired layer.  This avoids unnecessary computation and delivers the required intermediate output directly.  The output is then printed with slicing to handle potentially large array dimensions.


**Example 3: Debugging with tf.print (for specific tensors within a computational graph):**

This technique allows you to insert print statements directly into your TensorFlow graph for debugging purposes. This is particularly useful for locating bottlenecks or understanding the flow of data within complex models.  The output will be printed to the console during execution.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_model(x):
  layer1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
  # Insert tf.print for debugging
  tf.print("Layer 1 output:", layer1)
  layer2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(layer1)
  return layer2

# ... model compilation and training ...
```

**Commentary:** `tf.print` is inserted directly within the model definition to monitor the `layer1` output. It's crucial to remember that `tf.print` is primarily a debugging tool. Its use within large-scale production training should be minimized as it can impact performance significantly.  It adds print statements to the computation graph; therefore, it's executed when the graph runs.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on building and training models.  A deep dive into the Keras API, specifically regarding model building and layer access, is also highly beneficial.  Finally, understanding NumPy array manipulation will be crucial for handling and presenting the extracted tensor data.  Familiarity with TensorFlow's debugging tools will prove indispensable during more complex model development and troubleshooting.  These resources should furnish you with the theoretical underpinnings and practical tools needed for effectively managing and presenting TensorFlow-computed features.
