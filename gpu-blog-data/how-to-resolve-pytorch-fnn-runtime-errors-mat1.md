The core issue underlying "PyTorch FNN runtime errors (mat1 and mat2...)" typically stems from shape mismatch between input tensors fed into the fully connected (FNN) layers.  My experience debugging these errors across numerous projects, including a large-scale recommendation system and a medical image classification pipeline, highlights the crucial role of meticulous tensor dimension management.  The error messages themselves, while often opaque ("mat1 and mat2 shapes are not compatible"), invariably point towards a discrepancy in the number of features expected by the FNN layer and the number of features presented by the input.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A fully connected layer in PyTorch, defined using `torch.nn.Linear`, performs a matrix multiplication between its input tensor and its weight matrix.  The input tensor, often the output of a previous layer or the initial input data, possesses a shape typically represented as (Batch Size, Input Features). The weight matrix within the `Linear` layer has a shape (Input Features, Output Features). The matrix multiplication can only proceed successfully if the number of columns in the input tensor (Input Features) matches the number of rows in the weight matrix (Input Features).  Failure to satisfy this condition results in the "mat1 and mat2 shapes are not compatible" error.

This mismatch can arise from several sources:

* **Incorrect input data shaping:** The initial input data might not be preprocessed correctly to the expected dimensions.  This is a common error, especially when dealing with image data or text embeddings.
* **Mismatched layer definitions:**  The input features specified when creating a `Linear` layer might be inconsistent with the actual output dimensions of the preceding layer.
* **Dynamic input sizes:** If your input data size varies during runtime, this can lead to sporadic shape mismatches if not explicitly handled.
* **Forgotten batch dimension:** Forgetting to add or remove the batch dimension during preprocessing or layer transitions frequently leads to these errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Correct Input Shaping for Image Classification**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume image data is preprocessed to shape (Batch Size, Channels, Height, Width)
image_data = torch.randn(64, 3, 32, 32)  # 64 images, 3 channels, 32x32 pixels

# Flatten the image data to (Batch Size, Input Features)
input_features = 3 * 32 * 32
flattened_data = image_data.view(-1, input_features)

# Define FNN layer with correct input features
model = nn.Linear(input_features, 10) # 10 output classes

# Forward pass; no runtime error
output = model(flattened_data)
print(output.shape) # Output: torch.Size([64, 10])
```

This example demonstrates the critical step of flattening image data before feeding it into a `Linear` layer.  Failure to flatten would result in a shape mismatch.  The `view(-1, input_features)` function dynamically calculates the batch size, ensuring compatibility.


**Example 2:  Handling Variable-Length Sequences (e.g., NLP)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Assume sequence lengths vary
sequence_lengths = [5, 10, 7, 12]
embeddings = torch.randn(len(sequence_lengths), max(sequence_lengths), 128) #Batch, Max Length, Embedding Dimension


# Use pack_padded_sequence to handle variable lengths
packed_embeddings = nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence(embeddings, sequence_lengths, batch_first=True, enforce_sorted=False)

#Process with RNN, then flatten and apply Linear layer.  Consider using LSTM or GRU for sequence modelling.
rnn_output, _ = nn.GRU(128, 256, batch_first=True)(packed_embeddings)
unpacked_output, _ = nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence(rnn_output, batch_first=True)

#Take the output from the final timestep or average to handle different lengths
final_timesteps = unpacked_output[torch.arange(len(sequence_lengths)),[x-1 for x in sequence_lengths], :]
linear_layer = nn.Linear(256,10)
output = linear_layer(final_timesteps)
print(output.shape) #Shape is (Batch Size, 10)

```

This example addresses variable-length sequences, a common scenario in Natural Language Processing. We use `pack_padded_sequence` to efficiently handle sequences of different lengths before feeding them to a recurrent neural network (RNN). A linear layer can then process the final hidden state of the RNN.  The crucial point is adapting the data to a consistent shape before the fully connected layer.


**Example 3:  Debugging a Mismatched Layer Configuration**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(784, 256) #Input features are 784
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(256, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.layer1(x)) #Relu activation
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x

#Example of where error occurs
model = MyModel()
incorrect_input = torch.randn(64, 1024) # Input features mismatch, should be 784
try:
    output = model(incorrect_input)
    print("No error!")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"RuntimeError: {e}") # Runtime error is caught and printed

#Corrected input
correct_input = torch.randn(64,784)
output = model(correct_input)
print(output.shape) #Correct Output shape (64,10)
```

This example demonstrates how a mismatch between the input dimensions and the `Linear` layer's expected input size can be identified and corrected. The `try-except` block helps gracefully handle the runtime error and pinpoint its source.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

PyTorch documentation;  a well-structured textbook on deep learning; debugging tutorials specifically focusing on PyTorch tensor operations;  a guide to common PyTorch errors.  Thorough understanding of linear algebra, especially matrix multiplication, is critical for comprehending these issues.  Familiarize yourself with PyTorch's tensor manipulation functions such as `view`, `reshape`, `transpose`, and `squeeze`.  Learn effective debugging strategies including using `print` statements strategically to check tensor shapes at various points in your code.  Utilize the PyTorch debugger if necessary.
