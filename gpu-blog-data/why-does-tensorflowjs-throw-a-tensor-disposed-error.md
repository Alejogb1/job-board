The root cause of the "Tensor disposed" error in TensorFlow.js when using tanh or sigmoid, but not ReLU, activation functions stems from differing memory management strategies employed by the underlying WebGL backend and the lifetime of the tensors involved.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale model deployments, particularly those involving real-time video processing, has highlighted this crucial distinction.  ReLU, being a computationally simpler function, often benefits from optimizations that allow for in-place operations, avoiding explicit tensor creation and disposal during the forward pass.  Tanh and sigmoid, however, typically require intermediate tensor allocations, increasing the likelihood of encountering disposal errors if not managed properly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow.js utilizes WebGL for accelerated computation.  WebGL's memory management is distinct from typical JavaScript garbage collection.  Tensors in TensorFlow.js are represented as WebGL textures.  When a tensor is no longer needed, it needs to be explicitly disposed of to release the associated WebGL resources.  Failure to do so leads to memory leaks and ultimately, the "Tensor disposed" error. This error arises when an operation attempts to access a tensor that has already been released from WebGL memory.

The key difference lies in how ReLU, tanh, and sigmoid are implemented at the WebGL level.  ReLU's piecewise linearity permits efficient in-place computations.  This means the operation can modify the existing tensor directly without creating a new one.  Consequently, the original tensor remains valid throughout the computation.  In contrast, tanh and sigmoid involve more complex mathematical operations.  These often necessitate the creation of temporary tensors to store intermediate results.  If these temporary tensors aren't explicitly disposed of after their use, they'll remain in the WebGL memory, even if the primary tensor is disposed of earlier in the pipeline or when the garbage collector intervenes. This leads to the "Tensor disposed" error if a later operation tries to utilize the disposed temporary tensor.  The timing discrepancy between disposal and attempted access is often subtle, manifesting inconsistently across different hardware or runtime conditions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: ReLU – In-place Operation (Reduced risk of "Tensor disposed")**

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

const a = tf.tensor1d([1, -2, 3, -4]);
const relu_a = a.relu(); //Relu can often operate in place, reducing disposal issues.

relu_a.print();
a.dispose(); // 'a' can be disposed safely; the operation likely modified 'a' directly
relu_a.dispose();
```

In this example, the ReLU operation may modify the tensor `a` directly, minimizing the risk of encountering the "Tensor disposed" error.  Disposal of `a` after the operation is generally safe because `relu_a` likely points to the same underlying WebGL data. While not guaranteed in-place, ReLU’s implementation favors this approach, reducing resource conflicts.

**Example 2: Tanh – Explicit Tensor Allocation (Increased risk of "Tensor disposed")**

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

const b = tf.tensor1d([-1, 0, 1, 2]);
const tanh_b = tf.tanh(b); // Explicit new tensor allocation for intermediate calculations

tanh_b.print();
b.dispose(); // Disposing 'b' prematurely might cause issues if tanh_b internally references data from 'b'
tanh_b.dispose();
```

Here, `tf.tanh(b)` likely creates a new tensor to store the results.  Premature disposal of `b` is significantly more likely to cause problems because `tanh_b` depends on the internal resources used during its calculation. This is because `tf.tanh` doesn't inherently support in-place operation due to the complexity of the hyperbolic tangent calculation.  Explicit memory management is crucial.


**Example 3: Sigmoid –  Potential for Intermediate Tensors (Increased risk of "Tensor disposed")**

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

const c = tf.tensor1d([ -5, 0, 5, 10 ]);
const sigmoid_c = tf.sigmoid(c); // Might involve intermediate temporary tensors

sigmoid_c.print();

// Illustrating a potential problem -  assuming an intermediate tensor isn't properly handled
// This simulation demonstrates how a delayed disposal could trigger the error.

const delayedDisposal = () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    c.dispose();
  }, 1000); //Simulating a delayed disposal, mimicking a poorly managed scenario
};

delayedDisposal();
sigmoid_c.dispose();

```

Similar to `tanh`, the `sigmoid` function may utilize temporary tensors for intermediate steps.  The `delayedDisposal` function simulates a scenario where the input tensor `c` is disposed of after a delay, potentially after the intermediate tensors used by the sigmoid operation are no longer explicitly referenced, but before the garbage collector reclaims them. This is a common cause of the "Tensor disposed" error.  Proper memory management requires explicit disposal of all tensors, even those implicitly created during operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend carefully reviewing the TensorFlow.js documentation concerning tensor management and disposal.  Pay close attention to the performance considerations section, focusing on memory management strategies and best practices for large models.  Additionally, explore the debugging tools within TensorFlow.js to help identify which tensors are being disposed of prematurely.  The TensorFlow.js API reference is indispensable for understanding the intricacies of tensor manipulation and the implications of each function call on memory usage.  Finally,  familiarity with WebGL concepts and its memory model will prove invaluable in resolving such issues.  Understanding the differences between CPU and GPU memory and the implications of data transfers will greatly assist.
