A TensorFlow `ImportError` during Bazel script execution for skip-thoughts training, particularly when the script itself appears syntactically correct, almost always stems from issues within the Bazel build environment regarding TensorFlow's location, version, or compatible dependencies. Having navigated this precise frustration multiple times while fine-tuning embedding models, the root cause rarely involves flawed model code but rather misconfigurations in how Bazel interacts with TensorFlow.

The core problem is that Bazel isolates builds into sandboxed environments, which prevent scripts from automatically accessing globally installed Python packages like TensorFlow. Consequently, unless you explicitly configure Bazel to understand where TensorFlow resides and how to incorporate it, the `import tensorflow` statement within your Python script will fail, resulting in the dreaded `ImportError`. This occurs despite TensorFlow being correctly installed and accessible via a standard Python interpreter outside of the Bazel environment. This isolation, while vital for reproducible builds, demands precise declaration of dependencies, a facet often overlooked.

To rectify this, you must instruct Bazel how to find and link to the correct TensorFlow library. This primarily involves configuring the `BUILD` file within your project's directory structure.  The `BUILD` file is where you specify dependencies, build rules, and other crucial information for Bazel to manage your project. Within this file, TensorFlow is typically declared as an external dependency, pointing Bazel to the installation path and required shared object files.  When working on a skip-thoughts training project, the `BUILD` file must define the python binary target for the training script and explicitly include tensorflow as a dependency for that target.

The `ImportError` is not always due to a complete absence of TensorFlow information; it can also arise from mismatched versions or incompatible system configurations. For instance, a project build using Bazel with a TensorFlow dependency set for version 2.10 might fail if the environment actually has version 2.12 installed. Such version discrepancies, while seemingly minor, frequently lead to import failures due to changes in TensorFlow's API and underlying libraries. Another variant of this is that when using custom built or GPU accelerated versions of Tensorflow, the Bazel configuration must correctly account for the relevant shared object or dynamic libraries. Finally, if Tensorflow is installed within a virtual environment, this virtual environment also needs to be correctly accounted for within the Bazel workspace configuration.

Here are three example `BUILD` file snippets illustrating how to resolve different scenarios of this `ImportError`:

**Example 1: Basic TensorFlow dependency using system-wide installation:**

```python
# BUILD file snippet
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/pkg:pkg.bzl", "pkg_files", "pkg_tar")
load("@rules_python//python:defs.bzl", "py_binary", "py_library")

# This target depends on the system installed tensorflow library
py_binary(
    name = "skip_thoughts_trainer",
    srcs = ["skip_thoughts_trainer.py"],
    deps = ["@org_tensorflow//tensorflow/python:tensorflow"],
    main = "skip_thoughts_trainer.py",
)

```

**Commentary:** This example assumes TensorFlow is installed system-wide and has been configured with the `tensorflow_workspace` rules. `@org_tensorflow//tensorflow/python:tensorflow` is how Bazel identifies the TensorFlow dependency, directing it to the appropriate location within the workspace defined by `tensorflow_workspace`.  The `py_binary` rule constructs an executable Python file (`skip_thoughts_trainer`) from our source code (`skip_thoughts_trainer.py`). The `deps` attribute tells Bazel to include TensorFlow's Python libraries as a necessary dependency. Note that no specific version is specified, so Bazel would use the configured default which must have been specified by a WORKSPACE file configuration.

**Example 2: Specifying a specific TensorFlow version:**

```python
# BUILD file snippet
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/pkg:pkg.bzl", "pkg_files", "pkg_tar")
load("@rules_python//python:defs.bzl", "py_binary", "py_library")

# This target depends on a specific version of tensorflow
# In your workspace this version would be defined by a versioned dependency
py_binary(
    name = "skip_thoughts_trainer",
    srcs = ["skip_thoughts_trainer.py"],
    deps = ["@org_tensorflow_2_11//tensorflow/python:tensorflow"],
    main = "skip_thoughts_trainer.py",
)
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates how to specify a version-specific TensorFlow dependency if you have different versions linked into your Bazel workspace.  Here, `@org_tensorflow_2_11//tensorflow/python:tensorflow` implies the workspace has a dependency target named `org_tensorflow_2_11` linked to a Tensorflow 2.11 installation. This level of control is crucial to avoid version conflicts that manifest as obscure `ImportError`s.  This example is especially pertinent if your skip-thoughts training depends on specific API behaviours found within a particular Tensorflow version and avoids unexpected failure by directly specifying this dependency.

**Example 3: Using a custom-built TensorFlow from local path and libraries:**

```python
# BUILD file snippet
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/pkg:pkg.bzl", "pkg_files", "pkg_tar")
load("@rules_python//python:defs.bzl", "py_binary", "py_library")


# This target links to an external prebuilt tensorflow
py_binary(
    name = "skip_thoughts_trainer",
    srcs = ["skip_thoughts_trainer.py"],
    deps = [
         ":local_tensorflow"
    ],
    main = "skip_thoughts_trainer.py",
)
# Defines an external dependency by pointing to location on disk
py_library(
   name = "local_tensorflow",
   srcs = glob(
       [
        "/path/to/my/custom/tensorflow/lib/*.so",
        "/path/to/my/custom/tensorflow/python/tensorflow/__init__.py",
        "/path/to/my/custom/tensorflow/python/tensorflow/*.py",
       ]
    ),
   includes = ["/path/to/my/custom/tensorflow/python/"]
)
```

**Commentary:** This final example deals with the situation where a custom-built TensorFlow needs to be used. Here, we bypass the standard workspace dependencies, instead, `local_tensorflow` links directly to a local installation. The `glob` function collects relevant shared objects and the python module files.  The `includes` parameter ensures that python can resolve the package structure. This approach is frequently needed when using special builds that have been optimised for specific hardware, or which include custom operations or features not available in the standard builds. It provides fine-grained control but also introduces complexity due to the need to carefully manage the specific files.

In conclusion, the `ImportError` during Bazel skip-thoughts training is almost exclusively a configuration problem within the Bazel build system rather than a flaw in the Python code itself. The solution entails carefully specifying TensorFlow as an external dependency using an appropriate method for the required setup. This could include directly linking to standard packages using workspace definitions, declaring versioned dependencies, or in cases of custom setups, incorporating specifically built libraries and python modules directly via file references. By focusing on the correct `BUILD` file configuration and ensuring consistency between the Bazel environment and the installed TensorFlow version, these import issues can be resolved efficiently.

Further guidance and detailed explanations can be found within the official TensorFlow documentation related to Bazel builds, along with resources on Bazelâ€™s official site which detail how to manage external dependencies and workspaces. Additionally, tutorials focusing on advanced Bazel configurations provide detailed practical examples. Finally, the Bazel community forums can be useful in solving more complex version and linkage issues. These resources, while lacking direct URLs here, are all readily searchable and provide a thorough understanding of this problem domain and its correct solutions.
