The observed identical metric values between Keras and scikit-learn, while seemingly coincidental, often stem from the underlying calculation methods employed, particularly when dealing with binary classification problems using similar evaluation strategies.  My experience working on large-scale fraud detection models highlighted this frequently.  In many instances, the discrepancy, or lack thereof, hinges on the precise definition and implementation of the metric, not a fundamental difference in the libraries themselves.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Both Keras and scikit-learn offer a range of evaluation metrics.  However, their core functionalities regarding metrics calculation often overlap, especially for common metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.  Scikit-learn primarily focuses on providing efficient tools for model evaluation on already-predicted data, whereas Keras, being a high-level API, often integrates metric calculation directly within the model training process.  The crucial point is that if both libraries are fed identical, pre-processed data (the true labels and the model predictions), and the metric is calculated using the same underlying formula, the resultant values will be identical.  Differences typically arise when pre-processing steps differ or when one library implicitly applies some form of data transformation not present in the other.

For instance, consider the case of calculating accuracy.  Both libraries compute accuracy as the ratio of correctly classified samples to the total number of samples.  The difference, if any, would lie in the way they handle edge cases such as empty predictions or class imbalances, though even then, well-maintained libraries like these typically adhere to standard practices.  Similarly, the precision and recall calculations rely on the true positive, false positive, and false negative countsâ€”quantities derived consistently from the same prediction data.  Discrepancies often occur due to subtle variations in how these counts are computed, particularly if dealing with multi-class problems and different averaging strategies (e.g., macro-average vs. micro-average). The AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) calculation is also prone to minor differences only when numerical instability is involved in the internal methods used for ROC curve construction.

Therefore, the perceived identical values are frequently an outcome of using consistent data and default calculation methods.  Deviations will typically appear if the prediction probabilities are not appropriately handled (e.g., thresholding for binary classifications), or if multi-class metrics are used with different averaging strategies.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Binary Classification Accuracy**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Sample data
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
y_pred = np.array([0, 1, 0, 0, 1])

# Scikit-learn
sklearn_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Scikit-learn Accuracy: {sklearn_accuracy}")

# Keras
keras_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.Accuracy()
keras_accuracy.update_state(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Keras Accuracy: {keras_accuracy.result().numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates the calculation of accuracy using both libraries.  The results should be identical because both use the standard accuracy calculation formula.  Note the explicit use of `.numpy()` in the Keras example to convert the TensorFlow tensor to a NumPy array for direct comparison.

**Example 2: Multi-class F1-Score (Micro-Average)**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Sample data (multi-class)
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])
y_pred = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2])

# Scikit-learn
sklearn_f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='micro')
print(f"Scikit-learn Micro-averaged F1-score: {sklearn_f1}")

# Keras
keras_f1 = tf.keras.metrics.F1Score(num_classes=3, average='micro') #Specify num_classes for multi-class
keras_f1.update_state(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Keras Micro-averaged F1-score: {keras_f1.result().numpy()}")
```

Here, we calculate the micro-averaged F1-score for a multi-class scenario. The `average='micro'` argument ensures consistency between the libraries.  The `num_classes` parameter in Keras is crucial for multi-class problems; omitting it might lead to unexpected behavior.

**Example 3:  AUC Calculation**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Sample Data (Probabilities needed for AUC)
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
y_pred_prob = np.array([0.2, 0.8, 0.7, 0.1, 0.9]) # Probability estimates

# Scikit-learn
sklearn_auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred_prob)
print(f"Scikit-learn AUC: {sklearn_auc}")

# Keras
keras_auc = tf.keras.metrics.AUC()
keras_auc.update_state(y_true, y_pred_prob)
print(f"Keras AUC: {keras_auc.result().numpy()}")

```

This example highlights AUC calculation. Remember that AUC requires probability estimates (not hard predictions). Both methods yield consistent results for this commonly used metric.  Note that small floating-point differences might arise due to the internal algorithms, but these are usually negligible.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of these metrics, I recommend consulting standard machine learning textbooks.  The scikit-learn documentation provides comprehensive explanations of its metric functions, including detailed descriptions of their implementations and parameter options.  Similarly, the TensorFlow/Keras documentation offers extensive information regarding its metric APIs, including details about their usage and behavior in different scenarios.  Finally, exploring research papers on model evaluation provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different metrics and their appropriate applications.  Reviewing the source code of these libraries (though potentially challenging for beginners) can provide a very granular understanding of the calculation processes.
