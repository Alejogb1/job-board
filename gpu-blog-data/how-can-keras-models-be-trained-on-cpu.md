Training Keras models across different hardware configurations, specifically CPUs and GPUs, from separate Jupyter notebooks requires careful consideration of data management and model serialization.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural network training workflows has shown that independent notebook sessions offer benefits in terms of resource isolation but necessitate robust mechanisms for data exchange and model versioning.  The primary challenge lies in managing the data pipeline efficiently and ensuring consistent model architectures across training environments.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core strategy involves training the model in a manner that is agnostic to the underlying hardware.  Keras, through its backend support for TensorFlow or Theano, abstracts away many low-level hardware details. This allows for the same model definition to be utilized on both CPU and GPU systems. However, the training process itself requires a standardized approach to data handling and model saving/loading.

The process consists of three main stages:

* **Model Definition and Data Preprocessing:**  This phase is identical for both CPU and GPU training.  The model architecture, including layer types, activation functions, and optimizers, is defined within a single Python script (ideally, this script is version-controlled).  Data preprocessing steps, such as normalization, standardization, and feature engineering, are also performed here.  This ensures consistent data is fed to the model regardless of the hardware used for training. The processed data is then saved to a persistent storage location (e.g., a shared network drive or cloud storage), accessible by both Jupyter notebooks.

* **GPU Training:** A Jupyter notebook dedicated to GPU training loads the pre-processed data from the shared location and the model definition script.  The model is compiled with the appropriate backend (TensorFlow with CUDA support) and trained using the GPU. Training progress, including metrics and loss values, should be logged regularly to a file or database accessible by the CPU training notebook.

* **CPU Training:**  This notebook also loads the pre-processed data and model definition script.  The key difference here is that the model is compiled with a CPU-only backend (or a TensorFlow backend without CUDA support).  The training process is identical in logic to the GPU notebook, but the speed will naturally be slower.  The training notebook will periodically compare its progress against the logged data from the GPU training run, allowing for an assessment of performance differences.  Crucially, the final model weights are saved to the shared storage location.

This setup allows for parallel training, leveraging the GPU's superior computational power for faster iteration and potentially a more refined model. The CPU training process serves as a fallback mechanism and a validation step, ensuring the model’s performance is not solely dependent on the GPU’s capabilities.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Model Definition and Data Preprocessing (model_def.py)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load and preprocess data
data = np.load('data.npy')
labels = np.load('labels.npy')

scaler = StandardScaler()
data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(data.shape[1],)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Save the model architecture (optional, for reproducibility)
model.save('model_architecture.h5')

# Save preprocessed data
np.save('scaled_data.npy', data)
np.save('labels.npy', labels)

```

This script handles data loading, preprocessing using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn, and model definition using Keras' sequential API. The model architecture is saved for later loading in both training notebooks. Preprocessed data is saved to disk to be accessed by both training environments.


**Example 2: GPU Training (gpu_training.ipynb)**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Load preprocessed data and model architecture
data = np.load('scaled_data.npy')
labels = np.load('labels.npy')
model = keras.models.load_model('model_architecture.h5') # or recreate from model_def.py

# Verify GPU availability (crucial!)
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Train the model on GPU
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Save the trained model
model.save('trained_model_gpu.h5')

```

This Jupyter notebook focuses on GPU training.  It explicitly checks for GPU availability using TensorFlow's API. The model is loaded from the saved architecture. The `fit` method initiates training, and the trained model is saved. Error handling for GPU unavailability could be added here for robustness.


**Example 3: CPU Training (cpu_training.ipynb)**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Load data and model architecture (same as GPU training)
data = np.load('scaled_data.npy')
labels = np.load('labels.npy')
model = keras.models.load_model('model_architecture.h5')

# Train the model on CPU
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Save the trained model
model.save('trained_model_cpu.h5')

# Compare with GPU results (example)
gpu_results = np.load('gpu_training_metrics.npy') # hypothetical file with metrics
# ... comparison logic ...
```

This notebook mirrors the GPU training notebook, but without explicit GPU checks. It loads the model architecture, trains on the CPU, and saves the trained weights.  The last section showcases the potential for comparing training metrics against the GPU training run, allowing for analysis of the differences resulting from the different hardware.  This could involve simple metrics comparison or more sophisticated statistical analysis.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For comprehensive understanding of Keras and TensorFlow, consult the official documentation.  Familiarize yourself with TensorFlow's mechanisms for GPU usage and error handling.  A deep understanding of numerical computing in Python, particularly using NumPy, is essential for efficient data management.  Explore resources detailing best practices for model serialization and version control in machine learning projects.  Finally, resources covering efficient data management and distributed training strategies will further enhance your capabilities.
