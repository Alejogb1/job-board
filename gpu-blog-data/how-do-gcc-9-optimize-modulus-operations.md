The optimization of modulus operations by GCC 9 and later versions hinges significantly on the nature of the divisor.  My experience working on performance-critical embedded systems, particularly those involving cryptographic algorithms, revealed a crucial detail:  constant divisors unlock a far greater optimization potential than variable divisors. This stems from the compiler's ability to leverage compile-time computations and replace the modulus operation with far more efficient alternatives.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core principle behind these optimizations lies in the mathematical properties of the modulo operator.  When the divisor is a compile-time constant, the compiler can perform several transformations to improve performance. The most prevalent is the replacement of the modulo operation with a combination of multiplication, bitwise operations, and subtraction.  This is particularly effective for powers of two.  If the divisor is 2<sup>n</sup>, the modulo operation is equivalent to a bitwise AND operation with (2<sup>n</sup> - 1).  This significantly reduces the computational overhead compared to the native modulo instruction.

For non-power-of-two constant divisors, GCC employs a more sophisticated approach. It utilizes techniques derived from modular arithmetic.  The compiler might pre-compute an inverse of the divisor (modulo 2<sup>n</sup>, where n is the word size) and employ a multiplication followed by a shift and potentially further corrections.  The choice of algorithm depends on the specific divisor and the target architecture.  The compiler’s internal analysis determines the most efficient approach, often leveraging its understanding of instruction latencies and throughput on the target CPU.

Variable divisors present a far more challenging optimization problem. The compiler lacks the necessary compile-time information to apply the same transformations as with constant divisors.  In such cases, the compiler will typically rely on the native modulo instruction provided by the target architecture. However, even here, there's room for optimization.  Loop unrolling and other techniques can sometimes be applied to reduce overhead, but these optimizations are far less impactful than those available with constant divisors.  Moreover, the compiler’s ability to optimize variable divisors heavily depends on the surrounding code and the overall optimization level selected.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Power-of-Two Divisor**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int x = 1025;
    unsigned int y = x % 16; // Divisor is 2^4
    unsigned int z = x & 15; // Equivalent bitwise AND operation

    printf("Modulo result: %u\n", y);
    printf("Bitwise AND result: %u\n", z);
    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:*  This demonstrates the transformation of a modulo operation with a power-of-two divisor into a bitwise AND operation. GCC will almost certainly perform this optimization at even the lowest optimization levels (-O0).  This is a very fast and efficient operation.  The generated assembly code will reflect this transformation.


**Example 2: Non-Power-of-Two Constant Divisor**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int x = 1025;
    unsigned int y = x % 13; // Constant, non-power-of-two divisor

    printf("Modulo result: %u\n", y);
    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* Here, the compiler will likely employ a more complex algorithm involving multiplication and potentially a lookup table or other pre-computed values if deemed beneficial by the cost analysis performed during compilation.  The level of optimization (-O1, -O2, -O3) will influence the sophistication of the generated code.  Higher optimization levels encourage more aggressive and potentially more complex optimizations.  Disassembly will reveal the specific technique used by the compiler.


**Example 3: Variable Divisor**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int x = 1025;
    unsigned int y = 13; // Variable divisor
    unsigned int z = x % y;

    printf("Modulo result: %u\n", z);
    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* In this instance, the compiler is highly limited in its optimization opportunities. It will probably resort to a direct use of the native modulo instruction.  While further optimizations might occur depending on the surrounding code (e.g., loop unrolling if the modulo operation is within a loop), the improvement will be less pronounced compared to the previous examples.  The absence of compile-time knowledge regarding the divisor restricts the compiler's ability to perform more elaborate transformations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would advise consulting the GCC documentation, specifically sections detailing optimization passes and the intermediate representation (IR).  A deep understanding of compiler design principles, including instruction scheduling and register allocation, is also invaluable. Furthermore, studying the assembly code generated by the compiler for various optimization levels (-O0, -O1, -O2, -O3) provides significant practical insight into the optimization strategies employed.  Exploring the intricacies of modular arithmetic and its applications in computer science will provide a solid theoretical foundation. Finally, familiarization with performance analysis tools will help to empirically validate the compiler's optimizations.  Through a combination of these approaches, one can gain a comprehensive understanding of how GCC handles modulus operations.
