TensorFlow’s implementation of class weights and focal loss addresses the common problem of class imbalance in machine learning, particularly within the context of classification tasks. I've found these techniques indispensable when dealing with datasets where one or more classes significantly outnumber others; otherwise, naive models tend to bias towards the majority class. The framework provides flexible and efficient ways to incorporate both.

Class weights adjust the contribution of each class during loss calculation. The fundamental idea is to penalize the model more heavily for misclassifications in underrepresented classes, thus effectively counterbalancing the bias towards the majority class. In contrast, focal loss modifies the standard cross-entropy loss to give more importance to difficult-to-classify samples. These samples, often located near the decision boundary, contribute more to the overall learning process.

Let's first examine how class weights are applied. Essentially, during the calculation of the loss function, each sample’s contribution is multiplied by a weight derived from the sample’s class label. TensorFlow does this seamlessly via the `class_weight` argument available in several Keras loss functions, including `CategoricalCrossentropy`, `BinaryCrossentropy`, and their sparse counterparts.

Here’s an example using `CategoricalCrossentropy`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data: 3 classes, highly imbalanced
y_true = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]])
y_pred = np.array([[0.8, 0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.7, 0.1], [0.9, 0.05, 0.05], [0.1, 0.2, 0.7], [0.7, 0.2, 0.1], [0.3, 0.6, 0.1], [0.85, 0.08, 0.07]]) # Sample predictions
num_classes = 3

# Calculate class weights
class_counts = np.sum(y_true, axis=0)
total_samples = np.sum(class_counts)
class_weights = total_samples / (num_classes * class_counts)

# Convert class weights to dictionary format for TensorFlow
class_weights_dict = dict(zip(range(num_classes), class_weights))

# Using CategoricalCrossentropy with class weights
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

# Initial loss calculation
loss_without_weights = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Loss without class weights: {loss_without_weights.numpy():.4f}")


#Loss calculation with class weights
loss_with_weights = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=tf.convert_to_tensor(
    [class_weights_dict[np.argmax(y)] for y in y_true], dtype=tf.float32))
print(f"Loss with class weights: {loss_with_weights.numpy():.4f}")
```

In the above example, I calculated weights inversely proportional to the frequency of each class.  This resulted in a higher weight being assigned to the underrepresented classes.  The class counts are derived from the `y_true` array. Before being passed to the loss function, these weights are associated with the corresponding samples in `y_true` via the `sample_weight` argument. You'll notice that the loss with class weights is different, reflecting the modified impact of each class on the total loss. The dictionary is just for mapping weights to an index, you could do something similar with a list or function.  My experiments have highlighted the crucial step of using these weights during *training*, not just testing. The `sample_weight` can also be passed directly into the `model.fit` function.

Focal loss, as I mentioned, focuses on hard examples. TensorFlow's API does not directly offer a built-in `focal_loss`, but it can be implemented through a custom loss function. It builds upon cross-entropy by adding a modulating factor that reduces the impact of easily classified samples. This modulating factor involves a parameter commonly denoted as 'gamma', and is typically greater than zero. It's a good practice to adjust gamma for the data in front of you.  The `gamma` parameter is a hyperparameter.  I’ve found typical values to fall between 0 and 5.

Here’s a custom implementation of focal loss using TensorFlow operations:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def focal_loss(y_true, y_pred, gamma=2.0, alpha=0.25):
  """
    Implementation of focal loss.
    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth labels, one-hot encoded.
        y_pred: Predicted probabilities.
        gamma: Focusing parameter.
        alpha: Weighting factor for positive examples.
    Returns:
        Tensor: Focal loss.
  """
  y_true = tf.cast(y_true, dtype=tf.float32) #Ensure types are matching
  y_pred = tf.convert_to_tensor(y_pred, dtype=tf.float32)
  epsilon = 1e-7  #Avoid log(0)
  y_pred = tf.clip_by_value(y_pred, epsilon, 1. - epsilon) #Clip to avoid error


  cross_entropy = -y_true * tf.math.log(y_pred)
  
  
  pt = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 1.0), y_pred, 1. - y_pred)
  
  alpha_factor = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 1.0), alpha, 1. - alpha)

  modulating_factor = tf.pow(1. - pt, gamma)

  focal_loss_value = tf.reduce_sum(alpha_factor * modulating_factor * cross_entropy, axis = 1)
  return tf.reduce_mean(focal_loss_value)


# Sample data, similar to previous example
y_true = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]])
y_pred = np.array([[0.8, 0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.7, 0.1], [0.9, 0.05, 0.05], [0.1, 0.2, 0.7], [0.7, 0.2, 0.1], [0.3, 0.6, 0.1], [0.85, 0.08, 0.07]])
num_classes = 3

# Calculate focal loss
loss = focal_loss(y_true, y_pred, gamma=2.0, alpha=0.25)

print(f"Focal loss: {loss.numpy():.4f}")
```

The provided code snippet demonstrates an example of a general version of the focal loss.  Note that this formulation assumes the `y_true` argument is one-hot encoded. This version also includes an `alpha` weighting factor in case we would also like to account for class imbalance via weighted loss. The `pt` variable is the probability of the correct class in each case, and the modulating factor is `(1-pt)^gamma`.  As I mentioned previously, this factor reduces the loss impact of samples with high certainty. During my experience using focal loss on several object detection projects, I've found adjusting `alpha` to sometimes be useful.

Now, here's an example of how both class weights and focal loss can be combined to train a model in a more realistic scenario. We'll use the same custom `focal_loss` implementation and integrate it into a model training process:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)), #3 classes
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

# Using the same focal loss implementation
def focal_loss(y_true, y_pred, gamma=2.0, alpha=0.25):
  y_true = tf.cast(y_true, dtype=tf.float32) #Ensure types are matching
  y_pred = tf.convert_to_tensor(y_pred, dtype=tf.float32)
  epsilon = 1e-7  #Avoid log(0)
  y_pred = tf.clip_by_value(y_pred, epsilon, 1. - epsilon) #Clip to avoid error


  cross_entropy = -y_true * tf.math.log(y_pred)
  
  
  pt = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 1.0), y_pred, 1. - y_pred)
  
  alpha_factor = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 1.0), alpha, 1. - alpha)

  modulating_factor = tf.pow(1. - pt, gamma)

  focal_loss_value = tf.reduce_sum(alpha_factor * modulating_factor * cross_entropy, axis = 1)
  return tf.reduce_mean(focal_loss_value)

# Sample data (same imbalance)
y_true = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]])
y_pred_actual = np.array([[0.8, 0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.7, 0.1], [0.9, 0.05, 0.05], [0.1, 0.2, 0.7], [0.7, 0.2, 0.1], [0.3, 0.6, 0.1], [0.85, 0.08, 0.07]])


y_true = tf.convert_to_tensor(y_true,dtype=tf.float32)
y_pred_actual = tf.convert_to_tensor(y_pred_actual,dtype=tf.float32)


# Calculate class weights
num_classes = 3
class_counts = np.sum(y_true.numpy(), axis=0)
total_samples = np.sum(class_counts)
class_weights = total_samples / (num_classes * class_counts)
class_weights_dict = dict(zip(range(num_classes), class_weights))

# Compile the model with focal loss and metrics
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=focal_loss, metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model with class weights
model.fit(
    y_pred_actual, #Sample input
    y_true,
    epochs=100,
    verbose=0,
    sample_weight=tf.convert_to_tensor([class_weights_dict[np.argmax(y)] for y in y_true.numpy()], dtype=tf.float32)
    )


print("Model training complete.")
```

In this scenario, I compiled the model using `focal_loss` and then during the call to `model.fit`, passed the class weight via the `sample_weight` argument. This method combines the benefits of both techniques. I've observed this combination to be particularly effective in scenarios with extreme class imbalance, significantly improving the model's performance on the underrepresented classes. This example demonstrates a full implementation of class weights along with custom focal loss.

For further study of these subjects, I recommend the following resources:

1.  TensorFlow's official documentation on Keras, particularly the sections on loss functions, model training, and custom loss implementations.
2.  Research papers, such as the original paper introducing focal loss. It provides a solid theoretical background.
3.  Practical articles on dealing with imbalanced datasets in machine learning.

These sources can help you solidify the practical as well as the theoretical side of class weight and focal loss, building from my explanations here.
