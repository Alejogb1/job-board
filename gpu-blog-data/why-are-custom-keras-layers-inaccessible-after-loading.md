The issue of inaccessible custom Keras layers after model loading stems fundamentally from the serialization process not inherently preserving arbitrary Python objects.  Keras, while providing robust serialization for its core components, relies on the `__init__` method of a custom layer to reconstruct its internal state from the saved configuration.  Failure to meticulously design this method, or to manage dependencies correctly, leads to the inability to access or utilize the custom layer post-loading.  This is something I've encountered numerous times over my years working on large-scale deep learning projects involving extensive custom layer development for specialized architectures.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The problem arises because Keras's saving and loading mechanisms primarily deal with the layer's *configuration*, not its full instantiation. The configuration includes parameters like the number of units, activation function, kernel initializer, etc. – all data readily represented in a configuration dictionary or JSON. However, custom layers frequently include attributes and methods beyond these standard parameters. These might involve pre-trained weights loaded from external files, connections to specific data sources, or even complex internal state maintained across training epochs. These elements are not inherently part of the layer's configuration and are thus not saved unless explicitly handled.

During loading, Keras reconstructs the custom layer using its configuration.  However, if the `__init__` method doesn't properly re-create the unsaved attributes, the loaded layer will be a shell of its former self, lacking the crucial elements defining its functionality.  This often manifests as `AttributeError` exceptions when trying to access these missing attributes or as unexpected behavior during inference.  A frequently missed consideration is the handling of external dependencies: If your custom layer relies on external libraries or data files, the loading process must ensure these dependencies are readily available at load time.

There are several strategies to address this, from careful constructor design to employing custom serialization functions.  The core principle remains:  ensure the complete state of your custom layer, beyond the Keras-managed configuration, is preserved and restored during the serialization process.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect Implementation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, external_data_path):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.external_data = self.load_data(external_data_path)

    def load_data(self, path):
        # ...data loading logic...
        return data

    def call(self, inputs):
        # ...layer operations using self.external_data...
        return outputs


# ...Model definition and training...

model.save('my_model')

# Loading the model will fail to restore self.external_data
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('my_model')
```

In this example, `self.external_data` is not saved.  The `__init__` only initializes the layer, but it doesn't load the data again upon model reconstruction from the saved configuration.


**Example 2: Correct Implementation Using `get_config` and `from_config`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, data_shape):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.data_shape = data_shape
        self.data = None # Initialize as None; will be populated during build

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.data = np.random.rand(*self.data_shape) # Populate data during build
        super().build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs + self.data

    def get_config(self):
        config = super().get_config()
        config.update({'data_shape': self.data_shape})
        return config

    @classmethod
    def from_config(cls, config):
        return cls(**config)

# ...Model definition and training...

model.save('my_model')

loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('my_model')
```

This corrected version utilizes `get_config` and `from_config` to ensure the `data_shape` is saved and reloaded correctly.  Note that the actual data isn't saved – it's recreated during the `build` method. This approach handles dynamic data generation effectively.


**Example 3: Correct Implementation with Custom Serialization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import json

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, weights_path):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.weights = self.load_weights(weights_path)

    def load_weights(self, path):
        # ...Load weights from file...
        return weights

    def call(self, inputs):
        # ...layer operations using self.weights...
        return outputs

    def get_config(self):
        config = super().get_config()
        config.update({"weights_path": self.weights_path})
        return config

    @classmethod
    def from_config(cls, config):
        return cls(**config)

#...Model definition and training...

#Custom save function to handle weights separately
def custom_save(model, filepath):
    model.save(filepath, save_format='tf')
    with open(filepath + '_weights.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump({"weights": model.get_layer('my_custom_layer').weights.numpy().tolist()}, f)

#Custom load function
def custom_load(filepath):
    model = keras.models.load_model(filepath)
    with open(filepath + '_weights.json', 'r') as f:
        weights = json.load(f)['weights']
    model.get_layer('my_custom_layer').weights = np.array(weights)
    return model

#Save the model using custom function
custom_save(model, 'my_model')

#Load the model using custom function
loaded_model = custom_load('my_model')
```

This example illustrates a more robust solution by handling the weights separately using custom save and load methods. This ensures that crucial data not directly managed by Keras is persisted.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on custom layers and model saving.  A comprehensive text on deep learning frameworks.  Further, specialized documentation on the intricacies of Python's object serialization and deserialization mechanisms.



Through careful design of the `__init__`, `get_config`, `from_config` and, when necessary, custom serialization functions, developers can ensure that the full functionality of custom Keras layers is preserved across model saving and loading, preventing the common issues of inaccessible attributes and unexpected behavior after model restoration.  These solutions, drawing upon years of practical experience, provide robust strategies to avoid these pitfalls in real-world deep learning applications.
