The OpenCL error CL_INVALID_PROGRAM_EXECUTABLE, encountered when attempting local memory access, almost invariably stems from a mismatch between the kernel's declared local memory size and the actual amount allocated by the OpenCL runtime during execution.  This discrepancy often arises from a lack of precise specification in the kernel code, or from incorrect assumptions about the device's capabilities.  In my experience debugging high-performance computing applications, particularly those leveraging image processing on heterogeneous architectures, this has been a persistent source of frustration, solvable only through a rigorous examination of kernel compilation and execution parameters.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The OpenCL runtime requires a precisely defined local memory allocation before kernel execution. This allocation is primarily governed by the `__local` qualifier in the kernel code, implicitly defining the memory space utilized within the workgroup. However, the compiler needs additional information, explicitly provided through the program’s build options, to determine the optimal workgroup size for the given device.  If the runtime detects an inconsistency—perhaps due to a device lacking sufficient local memory for the requested allocation, or a mismatch between what the kernel requests and what the compiler infers based on workgroup size—it throws the CL_INVALID_PROGRAM_EXECUTABLE error.

Several factors contribute to this problem:

* **Incorrect Workgroup Size:** The workgroup size significantly impacts the local memory allocation.  A kernel might correctly declare the local memory usage, but if the workgroup size chosen during kernel execution surpasses the device's capacity to provide the required local memory per work-item, the error arises.  This frequently occurs when assuming a default workgroup size across varying OpenCL devices.

* **Insufficient Local Memory on the Device:**  Different devices have different amounts of local memory.  A kernel designed for a high-end GPU might fail on a less powerful embedded device simply because it demands more local memory than is available.

* **Compiler Optimization Issues:**  The OpenCL compiler plays a crucial role in optimizing local memory usage. Sometimes, aggressive compiler optimizations might lead to unexpected memory allocations if the kernel code isn't explicitly clear about local memory requirements.  This often manifests as a discrepancy between the programmer's intention and the compiler's interpretation.

* **Incorrect Kernel Arguments:** While less common, incorrect kernel arguments related to workgroup sizes or data layouts can indirectly trigger this error by causing the runtime to make inaccurate local memory allocation assumptions.

Addressing this necessitates a multi-pronged approach:  meticulous kernel code, careful workgroup size selection, and explicit declaration of local memory needs.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Local Memory Allocation:**

```c++
__kernel void incorrectLocalMemory(__global const float *input, __global float *output, __local float *shared) {
    int i = get_global_id(0);
    shared[i] = input[i]; // Potential issue: if workgroup size is larger than local memory
    barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE); // Necessary synchronization
    output[i] = shared[i] * 2.0f;
}
```

In this example, the size of `shared` is implicitly determined by the workgroup size. If the workgroup size chosen at runtime is larger than the device’s local memory capacity per workgroup, `CL_INVALID_PROGRAM_EXECUTABLE` will be generated.  This code lacks explicit size specification for the local memory, making it vulnerable to this error across different devices.


**Example 2: Correct Local Memory Allocation:**

```c++
#define LOCAL_MEM_SIZE 1024 // Explicit size declaration

__kernel void correctLocalMemory(__global const float *input, __global float *output, __local float shared[LOCAL_MEM_SIZE]) {
    int i = get_global_id(0);
    if (i < LOCAL_MEM_SIZE) {
      shared[i] = input[i];
      barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE);
      output[i] = shared[i] * 2.0f;
    }
}
```

This example directly addresses the issue by explicitly defining the size of the `shared` array.  The `#define` directive allows for easy modification of the local memory size if needed. The conditional check ensures that accesses are within bounds, further mitigating potential errors.  However, it still requires the workgroup size to be less than or equal to `LOCAL_MEM_SIZE`.


**Example 3:  Handling Variable Workgroup Sizes:**

```c++
__kernel void adaptiveLocalMemory(__global const float *input, __global float *output, __local float *shared) {
    int i = get_global_id(0);
    int local_id = get_local_id(0);
    int workgroup_size = get_local_size(0);

    // Dynamic allocation based on workgroup size
    int local_mem_index = local_id % (workgroup_size / 2); //Example usage

    shared[local_mem_index] = input[i];
    barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE);

    output[i] = shared[local_mem_index] * 2.0f;
}
```

This illustrates a more sophisticated approach, where the kernel adapts to different workgroup sizes by calculating the local memory index dynamically. This approach requires careful consideration to ensure efficient usage of local memory and avoid exceeding its capacity. This method introduces complexity and necessitates a thorough understanding of how the compiler handles variable sized local memory access.  It's crucial to rigorously test this across various devices to ensure consistency.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The OpenCL specification itself provides comprehensive information on local memory management.  Consult the official documentation for in-depth details on kernel compilation, workgroup configuration, and local memory limitations.  Furthermore, I strongly advise reviewing advanced OpenCL programming tutorials and books specializing in high-performance computing.  Finally, familiarity with the OpenCL profiler provided with your OpenCL implementation can significantly aid in identifying and resolving local memory related issues by visualizing memory usage and performance bottlenecks.  Careful study of your chosen OpenCL platform's documentation regarding its specific capabilities and limitations is also essential.
