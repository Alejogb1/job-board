The appearance of `[nan]` (Not a Number) during linear regression with TensorFlow, particularly in simple models, most often stems from numerical instability during gradient calculations or parameter updates, rather than an inherent flaw in the model itself. Iâ€™ve encountered this precise issue several times in my work, particularly when dealing with datasets that haven't been properly preprocessed or when learning rates are inappropriately configured.  The core mechanism causing `nan` values is a scenario where intermediate or final calculations, frequently during backpropagation, result in operations involving infinity or undefined values (0/0), which propagate through the network as `nan`.

The most common cause is an exploding gradient. During backpropagation, gradients are calculated, representing the direction and magnitude of parameter adjustments necessary to minimize the loss. If these gradients become excessively large, due to a poorly chosen learning rate or an unsuitable loss function applied to the given data range,  the weights are updated by excessively large increments. These large updates can push the weights into regions where the loss function's gradient is even larger, potentially leading to an iterative cycle of diverging values culminating in `nan`. The sigmoid activation function, when its input grows too large, is notorious for producing near zero gradients; thus, it is less frequently the direct cause of `nan` in gradient descent compared to problems related to learning rates in the optimization itself. A poorly normalized input dataset is more likely to amplify these effects.  Large input values can trigger extremely large weights, which in turn increase the magnitude of gradients.

Another situation leading to `nan` arises from issues within the loss function calculation itself. Certain loss functions, especially when applied with no constraints on input or output range, can encounter division by zero or similarly problematic operations in their computational formulation when certain combinations of weights and inputs occur. For example, if a loss function involves taking the square root of a potentially negative quantity as a result of erroneous calculation in the current gradient descent step, or a division by a tiny number (which could result in extremely large values)  the result will be `nan`.

Let's examine some specific code examples that illustrate these issues and how to mitigate them using TensorFlow.

**Example 1: Unstable Learning Rate**

This example shows a simple linear regression model with an excessively high learning rate applied to a data set with unscaled input values. This setup is designed to demonstrably produce `nan` during training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data - unscaled features, small number of data points
X = np.array([[1000.0], [2000.0], [3000.0], [4000.0]], dtype=np.float32)
y = np.array([[5.0], [10.0], [15.0], [20.0]], dtype=np.float32)

# Model Definition
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1)])

# Loss Function and Optimizer
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1) # Extremely high learning rate

# Training Loop
epochs = 20
for epoch in range(epochs):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(X)
    loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)

  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
  if np.isnan(loss.numpy()):
        print("nan detected, training terminated")
        break
```

In this instance, with the large learning rate of `0.1`, combined with the unscaled data, the weights will tend to diverge rapidly, causing the loss to become `nan` within the first few iterations of training. This is due to the explosive nature of large weight updates derived from this over sized learning rate when applied to the unscaled values of X.

**Example 2: Stabilized Learning Rate and Scaled Data**

This code demonstrates the same linear regression example, but with the addition of input scaling and a lowered learning rate. This will prevent the appearance of `nan`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X = np.array([[1000.0], [2000.0], [3000.0], [4000.0]], dtype=np.float32)
y = np.array([[5.0], [10.0], [15.0], [20.0]], dtype=np.float32)

# Scale features
X_mean = np.mean(X)
X_std = np.std(X)
X_scaled = (X - X_mean) / X_std


# Model Definition
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1)])

# Loss Function and Optimizer
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.001)  # Moderate learning rate

# Training Loop
epochs = 20
for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(X_scaled)  # Use scaled features for training
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")

```

Here,  the input features are scaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This prevents any single input from disproportionately affecting the gradient. Further, the learning rate is lowered. The convergence is considerably smoother, and `nan` is avoided. This illustrates how data preprocessing, particularly scaling or normalization,  is as important as optimizer settings.

**Example 3: Data Preprocessing with Regularization**

In this modified example, the same data is used, with a very high initial learning rate, illustrating the use of a regularization term that avoids extreme updates of the parameter, and thus avoids `nan` values.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X = np.array([[1000.0], [2000.0], [3000.0], [4000.0]], dtype=np.float32)
y = np.array([[5.0], [10.0], [15.0], [20.0]], dtype=np.float32)

# Scale features
X_mean = np.mean(X)
X_std = np.std(X)
X_scaled = (X - X_mean) / X_std

# Model Definition
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1,kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01))])

# Loss Function and Optimizer
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)  # High learning rate, but we have l2 regularization

# Training Loop
epochs = 20
for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(X_scaled)  # Use scaled features for training
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred) + tf.reduce_sum(model.losses) # add the regularization term

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

In this example, although we use the high learning rate as before, `nan` values do not appear because we have added an L2 regularization to the kernel. Although the updates may be initially higher due to the high learning rate, this is avoided by the regularization added to the loss calculation. Regularization acts as a constraint on the learning updates, preventing them from becoming excessively large. The regularization acts to reduce the effect of higher values of the gradient with respect to a parameter.

To further explore the issue of numerical instability in deep learning, I would advise examining several resources.  Firstly, focusing on mathematical concepts of numerical analysis is highly valuable. Understanding floating-point representation limitations and propagation of errors during calculations will clarify how and why `nan` values arise. Next, it is worth looking closely at literature related to optimization techniques, in particular the different learning rate schedulers. Furthermore, delving into the intricacies of data preprocessing techniques, such as various scaling and normalization methods, is essential. Finally, exploring different regularization techniques can greatly improve model robustness and prevent `nan`.   TensorFlow's documentation also contains examples for model construction and training, including recommendations for dealing with numerical instability. This documentation also details the mathematical functions used inside of the loss and optimizer, which can explain the sources of error.
