The observed discrepancy in neural network training times between a 2070 Max-Q and a GTX 960m stems fundamentally from architectural differences and advancements in GPU technology spanning several generations.  While both are capable of parallel processing, the performance disparity arises from significant improvements in memory bandwidth, compute capabilities, and architectural optimizations present in the newer 20-series card.  My experience optimizing deep learning pipelines for various hardware configurations over the past decade has highlighted these factors repeatedly.

**1.  Architectural Advancements and Their Impact:**

The GTX 960m, belonging to the Maxwell architecture, represents a considerably older generation of NVIDIA GPUs.  It features a comparatively smaller number of CUDA cores, a lower clock speed, and a significantly reduced memory bandwidth compared to the Turing-based 2070 Max-Q.  The Turing architecture, in contrast, boasts substantial improvements in several key areas directly impacting deep learning performance.  These include:

* **Tensor Cores:**  These specialized processing units, absent in the Maxwell architecture, are optimized for matrix multiplication and other operations heavily utilized in neural network training.  Tensor Cores drastically accelerate operations like convolutional layers and matrix multiplications, which constitute the bulk of computational workload in deep learning models.  Their presence alone contributes significantly to the 2070 Max-Q's superior training speed.

* **Increased CUDA Core Count and Clock Speed:** The 2070 Max-Q possesses a considerably higher number of CUDA cores and operates at a higher clock speed than the GTX 960m.  This translates to a greater number of parallel operations performed per unit of time, leading to faster processing of training data.

* **Memory Bandwidth:**  The memory bandwidth of the 2070 Max-Q is substantially higher. This is crucial as it directly affects the speed at which data can be transferred between the GPU memory and the processing units.  Deep learning models often involve large datasets and intermediate results requiring constant data transfer, making higher memory bandwidth a critical performance factor.  Insufficient memory bandwidth on the GTX 960m can become a significant bottleneck, leading to extended training times.

* **Memory Capacity:** While not as impactful as the preceding factors, the larger memory capacity of the 2070 Max-Q allows for handling larger models and datasets without resorting to excessive swapping to system memory, further contributing to faster training.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how hardware differences manifest in practical deep learning scenarios using PyTorch.  These examples utilize simplified architectures for illustrative purposes; real-world applications would involve much larger and more complex models.

**Example 1: Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Training**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple CNN
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, 3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 7 * 7, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

# Model instantiation, optimizer and loss function (same for all examples)
model = SimpleCNN()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Training loop (simplified)
for epoch in range(10):
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

**Commentary:**  This code snippet demonstrates a basic CNN training loop. The performance difference between the 2070 Max-Q and the GTX 960m would be immediately noticeable in the time taken to complete each epoch. The 2070 Max-Q leverages its Tensor Cores and superior processing power for significantly faster forward and backward passes.

**Example 2:  Utilizing Data Parallelism with Multiple GPUs**

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data.distributed import DistributedSampler
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP

# Assuming multiple GPUs are available

# Model instantiation and wrapping with DDP
model = nn.DataParallel(SimpleCNN())

# ...rest of the training loop as in Example 1, but with distributed sampler for dataset
```

**Commentary:**  This example introduces data parallelism, distributing the training workload across multiple GPUs. While the GTX 960m would not likely benefit significantly from this due to its limitations, the 2070 Max-Q could potentially exhibit a near-linear speedup with multiple such cards (though a single 2070 Max-Q would still outperform multiple 960m).

**Example 3:  Mixed Precision Training (FP16)**

```python
# ... (Model definition from Example 1) ...

# Enable mixed precision training
scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()

# Training loop with mixed precision
for epoch in range(10):
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        scaler.scale(loss).backward()
        scaler.step(optimizer)
        scaler.update()
```

**Commentary:**  This example showcases mixed-precision training using FP16, exploiting the 2070 Max-Q's Tensor Cores' ability to efficiently handle lower-precision calculations.  The GTX 960m lacks this capability, preventing it from utilizing this performance optimization technique.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of GPU architecture and its impact on deep learning, I recommend consulting NVIDIA's official documentation on CUDA and their various GPU architectures.  Thorough exploration of PyTorch's documentation, particularly sections dealing with distributed training and mixed-precision training, is highly beneficial.  Finally, studying performance profiling techniques for identifying bottlenecks in deep learning workflows is crucial for optimal performance optimization.  Advanced texts on parallel computing and high-performance computing will further enhance understanding.
