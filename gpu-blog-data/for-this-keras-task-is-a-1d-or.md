The choice between a 1D or 2D convolutional layer in Keras hinges fundamentally on the dimensionality of the data's inherent spatial relationships.  My experience working on time-series anomaly detection and image classification projects has underscored this distinction repeatedly.  A 1D convolution is appropriate when sequential information is paramount, while a 2D convolution best handles data with spatial relationships in two dimensions.  Misapplying one for the other leads to suboptimal performance and often, to nonsensical results.  I've seen many colleagues stumble on this point, particularly when transitioning between different data modalities.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core difference lies in how each layer processes input data. A 1D convolutional layer operates on a single spatial dimension, typically time or a linear sequence.  The kernel slides along this single dimension, performing element-wise multiplications and summations to generate feature maps. This makes it ideal for analyzing sequential data like time series, audio signals, or text sequences where the order of elements carries crucial information. The kernel captures local patterns along this single axis.

In contrast, a 2D convolutional layer operates on two spatial dimensions, typically height and width, as found in images or other grid-like data structures.  The kernel moves across both dimensions, capturing patterns in both height and width.  This allows for the identification of more complex features that incorporate both spatial directions, crucial for tasks like image recognition where object boundaries and textures are important.

The selection depends entirely on the nature of your input data and the task at hand. If your data is inherently one-dimensional—a sequence of measurements over time, for instance—a 1D convolution is the correct approach. If your data exists on a two-dimensional grid—like an image—a 2D convolution is necessary.  Failing to align the dimensionality of the convolution with the dimensionality of the data will result in an ineffective model, as the convolutional filters will not be properly learning the relevant features.  During my work optimizing a speech recognition model, I initially used a 2D convolution on the spectrogram data, leading to significantly worse results than using a 1D convolution, which appropriately captured temporal patterns in the audio signal.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: 1D Convolution for Time Series Classification**

This example demonstrates the use of a 1D convolutional layer for classifying time series data representing sensor readings.  I've used this kind of architecture extensively when developing predictive models for industrial machinery.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense

# Sample time series data (shape: (number of samples, time steps, features))
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 100, 3)  # 100 samples, 100 time steps, 3 features
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # Binary classification

model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=5, activation='relu', input_shape=(100, 3)),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

Here, the `Conv1D` layer with `kernel_size=5` applies a 5-element filter along the time dimension (100 time steps).  The `MaxPooling1D` layer reduces the dimensionality, and the `Flatten` layer prepares the output for the dense classification layer.


**Example 2: 2D Convolution for Image Classification**

This demonstrates a 2D convolutional layer applied to a standard image classification problem, a task I tackled frequently during my work on autonomous vehicle perception systems.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Sample image data (shape: (number of samples, height, width, channels))
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 32, 32, 3)  # 100 samples, 32x32 images, 3 channels
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)  # 10 classes

model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This code utilizes `Conv2D` with a `kernel_size=(3, 3)`, moving across both height and width of the image.  The `MaxPooling2D` layer downsamples the feature maps, and the `Flatten` layer prepares the data for the final dense layer with a softmax activation for multi-class classification.  The `input_shape` explicitly defines the image dimensions.


**Example 3:  Incorrect Application Leading to Poor Performance**

This illustrates the pitfalls of using an inappropriate layer type. Here, we attempt to use a 2D convolution on time-series data. I encountered similar issues when experimenting with different architectural choices early in my career.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, Flatten, Dense

# Time series data (incorrectly treated as 2D)
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 100, 1)  # 100 samples, 100 time steps, 1 feature
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # Binary classification

model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(100, 1, 1)), # Incorrect input shape
    Flatten(),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

While this code runs, the `Conv2D` layer operates inefficiently.  The kernel attempts to capture spatial relationships that simply don't exist in the one-dimensional time-series data.  This will generally result in a model with poor generalization capabilities.  The key error here lies in the improper interpretation of the data's dimensionality, resulting in the use of a 2D convolutional layer where a 1D convolutional layer would be far more suitable and effective.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I would recommend consulting standard textbooks on deep learning and convolutional neural networks.  Further, carefully studying the Keras documentation on convolutional layers and reviewing examples of successful applications in relevant domains (time series analysis, image processing, etc.) would be particularly beneficial. Finally, exploring research papers that directly address your specific application domain will provide the most relevant and advanced insights.  Carefully analyzing the architectural choices made in these papers and understanding the reasoning behind them will prove invaluable.
