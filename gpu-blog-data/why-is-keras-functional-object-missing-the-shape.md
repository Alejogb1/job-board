The absence of a `shape` attribute directly on a Keras Functional model object stems from its inherent flexibility and deferred computation.  Unlike Sequential models, which linearly stack layers and thus allow for straightforward shape inference during model definition, Functional models build graphs where layer connections are explicitly defined. This graph structure means the output shape of a layer is not determined until the entire model is built and input shapes are specified.  In my experience debugging large-scale natural language processing models utilizing Functional APIs, this characteristic initially caused significant confusion before I grasped its foundational design.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Keras Functional API provides a powerful mechanism for constructing complex neural network architectures.  It leverages TensorFlow's graph computation paradigm, enabling the creation of models with arbitrary layer connections, including shared layers, residual connections, and multiple inputs/outputs.  However, this flexibility comes at the cost of immediate shape inference.  The `shape` attribute is not directly available on the model object because the model's structure alone doesn't define output shapes.  The output shape depends on the input shape fed to the model during compilation or prediction.  To obtain the shape information, one must utilize methods that explicitly trigger shape inference based on a concrete input specification.

The Keras Sequential model, conversely, provides the `shape` attribute because its linear layer arrangement allows for deterministic shape propagation during model construction.  Each layer's output shape is calculable from the previous layer's output and the layer's configuration.  The Functional API deliberately forgoes this simplifying assumption in favor of expressive architectural freedom.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating Shape Inference with `model.predict()`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

# Define the Functional model
inputs = Input(shape=(10,))
dense1 = Dense(5, activation='relu')(inputs)
outputs = Dense(1)(dense1)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Compile the model (necessary for shape inference)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Generate sample input data
sample_input = tf.random.normal((1, 10))

# Predict using the model; this triggers shape inference
predictions = model.predict(sample_input)

# Access the shape of the predictions
output_shape = predictions.shape
print(f"Output shape: {output_shape}")
```

This example demonstrates that shape information is not directly accessible from `model.shape`.  Instead, we compile the model and then use `model.predict()` with sample input data to trigger the computation graph execution. The output of `model.predict()` is a NumPy array, and its `shape` attribute provides the model's output shape corresponding to the input.  Note that compiling the model is crucial; attempting to access the shape without compilation will lead to an error.

**Example 2:  Using `model.output_shape` after model building but before compilation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Reshape

inputs = Input(shape=(784,))
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
x = Reshape((8, 8))(x)
outputs = Dense(10)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Accessing output shape without compilation - this works only if the input shapes are consistent and known.
output_shape = model.output_shape
print(f"Output shape before compilation: {output_shape}")
```

This shows that `model.output_shape` can be accessed *after* the model is defined, even *before* compilation, providing the shape of the output tensor. However, this information relies solely on the defined layers and their configurations and assumes a consistent input shape.  The output shape is inferred based on the input shape provided during model construction (in this case, `(784,)`). Any deviation in input shape during prediction would render this pre-compilation shape inference inaccurate.  This method is therefore less robust than using `model.predict()` for determining the shape.


**Example 3: Handling Multiple Outputs with Shape Inference**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

# Define a model with multiple outputs
inputs = Input(shape=(10,))
dense1 = Dense(5, activation='relu')(inputs)
output1 = Dense(1, name='output1')(dense1)
output2 = Dense(2, name='output2')(dense1)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[output1, output2])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=['mse', 'mse']) # Separate loss for each output

sample_input = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
predictions = model.predict(sample_input)

# Accessing shapes of multiple outputs
print(f"Output1 shape: {predictions[0].shape}")
print(f"Output2 shape: {predictions[1].shape}")
```

This example extends the concept to models with multiple outputs, a common scenario in multi-task learning.  The `model.predict()` method returns a list of NumPy arrays, one for each output. Each array's `shape` attribute then provides the specific output shape. This demonstrates the adaptability of the shape inference approach to complex model architectures.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, particularly the sections detailing the Functional API, is invaluable.  Thoroughly studying the TensorFlow documentation on graph computation will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play.  Reviewing tutorials and examples of complex model architectures built with the Functional API will greatly enhance practical understanding.  Finally, working through exercises focusing on building and analyzing models with varied layer configurations and input shapes will solidify the concepts.
