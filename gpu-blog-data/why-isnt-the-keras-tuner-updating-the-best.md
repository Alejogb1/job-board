The Keras Tuner's failure to update the best objective value often stems from a mismatch between the objective function defined and the tuner's optimization strategy, particularly when dealing with complex models or datasets.  In my experience troubleshooting hyperparameter optimization across numerous projects, I've observed this issue frequently arising from subtle inconsistencies in how the model's performance is measured and reported back to the tuner.  This isn't necessarily a bug within Keras Tuner itself, but rather a consequence of improper configuration and, sometimes, insufficient data exploration prior to hyperparameter tuning.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Keras Tuner, at its core, employs a search algorithm (e.g., Bayesian Optimization, Hyperband, Random Search) to explore the hyperparameter space of a given model.  It evaluates different hyperparameter configurations by training a model with each configuration and then assessing its performance based on a defined objective function.  This objective function, typically a metric like accuracy, loss, or AUC, is minimized (or maximized, depending on the configuration) to find the optimal hyperparameter set.  The "best objective value" displayed by the tuner represents the best performance encountered during the search so far.

The problem arises when the tuner receives incorrect or inconsistent feedback from the model evaluation.  This can happen for several reasons:

* **Incorrect Metric Specification:** The metric used for evaluation within the model's `compile()` method might not align with the objective function defined in the `tuner.Objective()` call.  A common mistake is specifying `'accuracy'` in `compile()` but minimizing `'loss'` in the tuner.  These metrics are often inversely correlated, leading to confusion.

* **Data Handling Issues:**  Problems in data preprocessing or handling during model training (e.g., inconsistencies in data splitting, shuffling, or augmentation) can result in varying performance across different hyperparameter configurations, obscuring the true optimal configuration.  This instability makes it difficult for the tuner to reliably identify the true best objective value.

* **Early Stopping Misconfiguration:**  If early stopping is employed during model training and the `patience` parameter is set too low, the training might halt prematurely, resulting in suboptimal performance reported to the tuner.  Conversely, a very high `patience` might extend training unnecessarily, without improving the model sufficiently.

* **Computational Resources:** Insufficient computational resources allocated to the tuning process might lead to incomplete searches or poorly trained models.  This can hinder the tuner's ability to find the true optimal hyperparameter configuration and therefore the best objective value.  This is particularly pertinent with Bayesian Optimization methods, which are computationally intensive.

* **Model Complexity:**  Highly complex models with numerous hyperparameters may require extensive search spaces and iterations before convergence to the optimal hyperparameter set is reached.  The initial results might thus appear misleading, showing a seemingly stagnant best objective value until sufficient exploration is completed.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Mismatched Metrics:**

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(hp):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=512, step=32), activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(hp.Choice('learning_rate', values=[1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4])),
                  loss='binary_crossentropy', # Loss function used for training
                  metrics=['accuracy']) # Accuracy used for evaluation during training
    return model

tuner = kt.Hyperband(build_model,
                     objective='val_loss', #Minimizing validation loss
                     max_epochs=10,
                     factor=3,
                     directory='my_dir',
                     project_name='my_project')

tuner.search_space_summary()
tuner.search(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))

best_hp = tuner.get_best_hyperparameters(num_trials=1)[0]
print(f"Best hyperparameters: {best_hp.get_config()}")
print(f"Best objective value: {tuner.results_summary().best_objective}")
```

This example demonstrates a potential issue where the model is compiled with `'accuracy'` as a metric, yet the tuner optimizes for `'val_loss'`.  While the model is trained to minimize binary cross-entropy, the tuner's feedback is based solely on validation loss, ensuring a consistent optimization process.

**Example 2: Insufficient Epochs:**

```python
# ... (same build_model function as Example 1) ...

tuner = kt.BayesianOptimization(build_model,
                                objective='val_accuracy',
                                max_trials=10,
                                directory='my_dir',
                                project_name='my_project')

tuner.search_space_summary()
tuner.search(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, validation_data=(x_val, y_val)) # Only 2 epochs

best_hp = tuner.get_best_hyperparameters(num_trials=1)[0]
print(f"Best hyperparameters: {best_hp.get_config()}")
print(f"Best objective value: {tuner.results_summary().best_objective}")
```

Here, a small number of epochs (2) might prevent the model from adequately converging, leading to inaccurate objective value reporting.  Increasing `epochs` would allow for more robust evaluation and potential improvements to the best objective value.


**Example 3: Early Stopping with Low Patience:**

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(hp):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([...]) #Same model as example 1
    model.compile(...) #Same compilation as example 1
    return model

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(build_model,
                        objective='val_loss',
                        max_trials=10,
                        directory='my_dir',
                        project_name='my_project')

early_stopping = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=1, restore_best_weights=True) #Low patience

tuner.search(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), callbacks=[early_stopping])

best_hp = tuner.get_best_hyperparameters(num_trials=1)[0]
print(f"Best hyperparameters: {best_hp.get_config()}")
print(f"Best objective value: {tuner.results_summary().best_objective}")

```

The early stopping callback with `patience=1` might terminate training prematurely, before the model reaches its optimal performance.  Increasing `patience` or carefully selecting the `monitor` metric is crucial for accurate evaluations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras Tuner documentation;  TensorFlow documentation on model building and training;  A comprehensive textbook on machine learning covering hyperparameter optimization techniques;  Research papers on Bayesian optimization and Hyperband;  Articles and tutorials on best practices for hyperparameter tuning in deep learning.  Careful review of these resources will significantly improve one's understanding of the process and aid in identifying potential sources of error.
