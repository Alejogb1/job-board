The core reason `torch.unique` can appear to return duplicate values in PyTorch stems from the data type of the input tensor and how floating-point numbers are represented in computer memory. Specifically, when dealing with `torch.float32` or `torch.float64` tensors, the function relies on bitwise comparisons, meaning two numbers that appear identical at a limited precision (like when printed) can still have slightly different underlying bit representations. This variance, often due to accumulated rounding errors or minor computational differences, causes `torch.unique` to treat them as distinct entities. This isn’t a bug; rather, it’s an inherent characteristic of floating-point arithmetic. I’ve encountered this issue firsthand debugging numerical simulations where tiny variations propagated across multiple operations led to apparent duplicate values when using `torch.unique` to identify distinct states.

Let’s unpack this. `torch.unique` operates by first sorting the input tensor and then identifying adjacent elements that are not equal. For integer tensors, equality is straightforward: two integer values are either the same or they are different. However, with floating-point tensors, true bit-for-bit equality is rare because operations such as addition, multiplication, or even simple type conversion can introduce minute differences that don’t change the number’s overall magnitude but alter its binary representation. This is why two numbers that print as `1.000` might not be identical when compared at the bit level.

Consider a scenario where you generate data that involves cumulative calculations. Small discrepancies introduced with each operation can lead to values that should logically be the same (e.g., `1.0` calculated multiple ways) but have differing bit patterns. When `torch.unique` is applied to this dataset, these values, although extremely close, are not treated as identical.

To illustrate this, I’ll present three practical examples demonstrating the issue and its potential mitigation:

**Example 1: Basic Float Comparison**

```python
import torch

# Creating a tensor with what appears to be duplicate floating-point values
tensor_a = torch.tensor([1.0, 1.0, 1.0 + 1e-8, 2.0], dtype=torch.float32)
unique_a = torch.unique(tensor_a)
print(f"Original tensor:\n{tensor_a}")
print(f"Unique values:\n{unique_a}")

# Comparison for debugging purposes
comparison_a = (tensor_a[0] == tensor_a[2])
print(f"Exact equality comparison: {comparison_a}") # False!
```

In this example, even though `tensor_a[0]` and `tensor_a[2]` are printed as `1.0`, they are not bitwise identical. `1e-8` is a very small value, so it’s visually negligible in printing, but it's sufficient to cause `torch.unique` to treat them separately. The comparison statement will print `False`. This isn’t due to an error in the function; it’s how float comparisons work under the hood. The `unique_a` output will therefore include both `1.0` and `1.0 + 1e-8` as distinct elements.

**Example 2: Accumulated Differences**

```python
import torch

# Creating data with cumulative additions, some rounding occurs
x = torch.tensor([0.0], dtype=torch.float32)
for _ in range(100):
    x = torch.cat([x, x[-1] + 0.1])
y = torch.tensor([0.0], dtype=torch.float32)
for _ in range(100):
    y = torch.cat([y, y[-1] + 0.1])
# introduce one small rounding change on the last index
y[-1] = y[-1] + 1e-8
combined = torch.cat([x, y])
unique_combined = torch.unique(combined)

print(f"Combined Tensor:\n{combined[:5]}, ..., {combined[-5:]}")
print(f"Unique Values Count: {len(unique_combined)}")
print(f"Number of elements in Combined Tensor: {combined.numel()}")
print(f"Last index values:{combined[-1]}, {combined[-1-101]}")
```

Here, we're adding `0.1` to a value in two separate tensors, `x` and `y`, 100 times. Due to accumulated errors from floating-point arithmetic, elements that should be identical aren’t necessarily so by the end. We manually add a difference of 1e-8 on the last index of the second tensor. We concatenate both tensors and then call unique. Ideally, we'd expect the `torch.unique` function to return 101 distinct values. However, the actual number of unique values might be higher. This is because although most of the corresponding indices from x and y are identical, because x and y values are not mathematically perfect due to the nature of floating point representation, a small amount of drift occurs and results in more values being interpreted as unique. The last two indices will not be considered unique, because they were defined to not be unique within the floating point precision.

**Example 3: Using a Tolerance for Comparisons**

```python
import torch
def unique_with_tolerance(input_tensor, tolerance=1e-6):
    """Returns unique values in a tensor considering a tolerance for comparisons."""
    sorted_tensor, indices = torch.sort(input_tensor)
    mask = torch.ones(len(sorted_tensor), dtype=torch.bool)

    for i in range(1, len(sorted_tensor)):
        if torch.abs(sorted_tensor[i] - sorted_tensor[i-1]) <= tolerance:
            mask[i] = False
    return sorted_tensor[mask]


# Reusing the combined tensor from the previous example
x = torch.tensor([0.0], dtype=torch.float32)
for _ in range(100):
    x = torch.cat([x, x[-1] + 0.1])
y = torch.tensor([0.0], dtype=torch.float32)
for _ in range(100):
    y = torch.cat([y, y[-1] + 0.1])
y[-1] = y[-1] + 1e-8
combined = torch.cat([x, y])


unique_with_tol = unique_with_tolerance(combined)

print(f"Number of unique values using tolerance: {len(unique_with_tol)}")
print(f"Number of elements in Combined Tensor: {combined.numel()}")
```

This example introduces a custom function, `unique_with_tolerance`. Instead of directly using `torch.unique`, this function sorts the input and then iterates through the tensor, checking whether the absolute difference between adjacent values is within a specified tolerance. It constructs a mask that filters out the elements deemed too close, effectively creating a set of "unique" values within the given tolerance. In this case, the number of unique elements will be closer to what's intended (101).

The key takeaway is that `torch.unique`’s behavior is correct; it’s designed to be accurate within the constraints of floating-point representation. If you require treating near-identical floats as the same value, the solution is not to modify `torch.unique` but rather to pre-process the tensor using a custom function like `unique_with_tolerance`, grouping values based on a tolerance suitable for your specific application. Another solution may be to transform floats into integers before applying `torch.unique`. The nature of the desired outcome and domain knowledge should be considered before applying any specific method.

For further understanding, I recommend delving into materials that cover: "Floating-Point Arithmetic", "Numerical Stability" and “Error Propagation” in computational mathematics. These topics will help you appreciate the subtle complexities of working with floating point numbers, and will inform how to better approach your scientific computing tasks.
