TensorFlow's `tf.math.unsorted_segment_max`, while powerful for aggregating data based on segmentation IDs, is not directly designed to return the *index* of the maximum element within a tensor. It operates by finding the maximum value within *segments* of a tensor, as defined by the provided segment IDs. Obtaining the index of the global maximum requires a different approach, potentially combining `tf.argmax` with careful manipulation, or using `tf.where` to identify the elements matching the overall maximum.

The challenge presented stems from the nature of `unsorted_segment_max`. This operation groups elements from a tensor according to segment IDs and then computes the maximum *value* within each segment. It discards information about the original positions of those maxima within the input tensor. Therefore, a multi-step approach involving other TensorFlow operations is necessary to achieve the desired index.

The first and arguably most straightforward method uses `tf.argmax`. If our goal is to find the index of the *global* maximum, we need the index across the entire tensor flattened. For a rank-1 tensor, the solution is direct. For tensors with higher ranks, we must first flatten the tensor and then apply `tf.argmax`. After obtaining the index from the flattened tensor, we can convert it back into the original tensor's coordinate system if necessary. This involves the `tf.unravel_index` operation. If instead we wanted the indices of *segment-wise* maxima, we would use `tf.argmax` *within* those segments (after appropriate segmentation and potentially shape manipulation), although that falls outside of the initial request.

Here's how I've approached this problem previously, working on multi-dimensional datasets in my prior machine learning projects:

**Code Example 1: Finding the global maximum index of a rank-2 tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def get_global_max_index(tensor):
  """
  Finds the index of the global maximum in a tensor.

  Args:
      tensor: A TensorFlow tensor of any shape.

  Returns:
      A tuple representing the index of the maximum value in the original tensor shape
  """
  flat_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, [-1]) # Flatten to 1D
  max_index_flat = tf.argmax(flat_tensor) # Index in flattened
  max_index = tf.unravel_index(max_index_flat, tf.shape(tensor))  # Convert to original shape index
  return max_index

# Example usage:
tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 8, 9]], dtype=tf.int32)
max_index_2d = get_global_max_index(tensor_2d)
print(f"Global max index: {max_index_2d.numpy()}") # Output: [2 2]
```

In this example, I flattened the 2D tensor into a 1D tensor using `tf.reshape`. Then, `tf.argmax` identified the index of the maximum value within the flattened tensor. Finally, `tf.unravel_index` converted this flat index back into the coordinate system of the original 2D tensor. Note, I used `tf.shape(tensor)` to make this adaptable to tensors with any number of dimensions, and the final output is a Tensor object representing the coordinates of the maximum in the original shape (using integer coordinates).

The second approach employs `tf.where`, combined with `tf.reduce_max` to locate the indices of the maximum elements. This allows for the possibility of multiple elements having the same maximum value, and thus will return *all* their indices. We must first calculate the global maximum of the tensor and then check all locations that match this value using `tf.where`.

**Code Example 2: Finding the indices of all elements equal to the maximum value in a rank-3 tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def get_all_max_indices(tensor):
  """
  Finds indices of all elements with maximum value

  Args:
    tensor: a TensorFlow tensor.

  Returns:
    A tensor containing the indices of the maximum values.
  """
  max_value = tf.reduce_max(tensor)
  max_indices = tf.where(tf.equal(tensor, max_value))
  return max_indices

# Example Usage:
tensor_3d = tf.constant([[[1,2,3], [4, 5, 6]], [[9, 8, 9], [7, 6, 5]]], dtype=tf.int32)
max_indices_3d = get_all_max_indices(tensor_3d)
print(f"All max indices: {max_indices_3d.numpy()}")
# Output: [[0 1 2] [1 0 0] [1 0 2]]
```

Here, `tf.reduce_max` computes the global maximum value within the tensor. The `tf.equal` function creates a boolean tensor indicating elements equal to this maximum. `tf.where` then returns the indices of those `True` values, representing all locations of the maximum values. This can be useful when dealing with data containing multiple instances of the maximum. The output is a tensor with shape `[number_of_maxima, rank_of_tensor]`, where each row corresponds to the indices of each maximum.

Finally, it's important to recognize the implicit limitations when using `tf.argmax` with non-unique maxima. If you only want one, arbitrarily chosen, index of the maximum value, then `tf.argmax` functions as expected; however, if multiple maxima exist, you may need to use the `tf.where` approach to get *all* indices. Using `tf.argmax` on segments of a tensor, when attempting to get per-segment indices, will be dependent on careful partitioning of the tensor using `tf.gather` or other means. This is especially true when segments are not contiguous. `unsorted_segment_max` is useful for getting the values themselves but cannot perform this indexing task.

**Code Example 3: Applying `tf.argmax` to segments of a 1D tensor after segmentation and gather**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def get_segment_max_indices(tensor, segment_ids, num_segments):
    """
    Finds the index of the maximum value *within* each segment.

    Args:
      tensor: A 1D TensorFlow tensor.
      segment_ids: A 1D tensor of segment identifiers.
      num_segments: The total number of segments.

    Returns:
      A tensor of shape [num_segments] holding the index within each segment
      of the maximum value.
    """
    segmented_max_values = tf.math.unsorted_segment_max(tensor, segment_ids, num_segments) # Get maxima for each segment
    max_indices_in_segments = []

    for i in range(num_segments):
        indices_in_segment = tf.where(tf.equal(segment_ids, i))[:,0] # Get *indices* within the *global* tensor that correspond to this segment
        values_in_segment = tf.gather(tensor, indices_in_segment) # Actual values for this segment, gathered from the global
        max_index_within_segment = tf.argmax(values_in_segment)  # Max *index within this segment* (not a global index)
        max_indices_in_segments.append(indices_in_segment[max_index_within_segment]) # get the true global index

    return tf.stack(max_indices_in_segments)

# Example usage:
tensor_1d = tf.constant([1, 4, 3, 9, 5, 2, 8, 6, 7], dtype=tf.int32)
segment_ids = tf.constant([0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], dtype=tf.int32)
num_segments = 4
segment_max_indices_1d = get_segment_max_indices(tensor_1d, segment_ids, num_segments)
print(f"Segment max indices: {segment_max_indices_1d.numpy()}")
# Output: [1 3 6 8]
```

In this third example, I've demonstrated how to obtain the indices of the maximum *within* each segment, which required us to first identify the *global* indices corresponding to each segment using `tf.where`, gather those values using `tf.gather`, and then use `tf.argmax` *locally* on that sub-tensor. This result is the index within that segment, which I then use to select the original, global index. This final output has the same shape and interpretation as the output from the previous two examples. This clearly demonstrates that `unsorted_segment_max` alone will not give the required result, and we need to perform extra operations.

In summary, directly obtaining the index of the maximum using `tf.math.unsorted_segment_max` is not feasible because it primarily deals with segmented maximum *values*, not the original indices. Alternative approaches using `tf.argmax` with flattening and `tf.unravel_index` or `tf.where` with `tf.reduce_max` provide the flexibility to find either the single global maximum or all indices where the maximum occurs. For obtaining segment-wise maxima indices, a more complex multi-step approach using gather, local max identification, and index tracking will be necessary.

For further exploration of TensorFlow operations, consult the official TensorFlow documentation available on the TensorFlow website. Additionally, resources like "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron and "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet provide valuable insights into these and related operations within the context of machine learning. Finally, I have found the TensorFlow GitHub repository, specifically the code files for the core operations, provides a level of detail not available elsewhere.
