The core challenge when reshaping a 2D array to a 3D array, particularly for compatibility with a function designed for three-dimensional input, lies in correctly interpreting the target function's expected shape. Mismatched dimensions can lead to runtime errors or unexpected algorithmic behavior. I encountered this frequently during my time developing image processing modules for a satellite imagery analysis platform. The initial image data often arrived as flattened 2D matrices of pixel intensities, whereas several key algorithms, particularly those involving convolutional neural networks, demanded 3D input with channel depth explicitly specified. This situation necessitates a transformation process, which, when handled incorrectly, results in significant issues in both training and performance.

The primary method for reshaping such arrays, leveraging Python's `NumPy` library, is through the `reshape()` function. However, understanding *how* to reshape effectively involves more than simply specifying a new tuple. The crux of the matter is understanding the meaning of each dimension in the 3D context the function requires. Consider a common scenario where the original 2D array represents a grayscale image. In this case, the 2D array's shape might be (height, width). A 3D representation often expects (height, width, channels), where ‘channels’ might be red, green, and blue for a color image, or a single channel representing grayscale intensity. If the target function expects a (batch_size, height, width) structure instead, the reshaping process changes significantly again. I found this subtle distinction particularly important when feeding data into our machine learning pipeline; failing to account for the batch dimension caused critical errors. This implies the `reshape()` operation should always be tailored to the precise dimension ordering and meanings of the target context.

To illustrate, let's consider a situation where I had a 2D array named `image_2d` representing a grayscale image with a shape of (200, 300) - 200 rows and 300 columns. If the target function requires a 3D array in the shape of (1, 200, 300), meaning one image with 200 height, 300 width, and one channel or a batch size of 1, the following code achieves the desired transformation.

```python
import numpy as np

image_2d = np.random.rand(200, 300) # Simulate a 2D grayscale image
image_3d_single = image_2d.reshape((1, 200, 300)) # Reshape to (1, 200, 300)

print(f"Original shape: {image_2d.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped shape: {image_3d_single.shape}")

```

In the above example, we are adding a new axis with a size of `1`, which could represent a batch size or a single channel. Notice that the original data elements are retained, merely reorganized into a new dimensional structure, without any changes to the values themselves. The newly formed array `image_3d_single` now adheres to the (batch_size, height, width) format that the target function expects.

Now consider the scenario where instead of adding a batch size, the function requires the 3D array to have the form of (height, width, channels) with the added dimension being the channels. If we know that this image, which is grayscale, should now have three channels, filled with the same data but representing RGB or some other multi-channel representation.

```python
import numpy as np

image_2d = np.random.rand(200, 300) # Simulate a 2D grayscale image
image_3d_channels = np.stack([image_2d, image_2d, image_2d], axis=-1) # stack into 3 channels

print(f"Original shape: {image_2d.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped shape: {image_3d_channels.shape}")
```

In this instance, rather than using `reshape()` directly, we employed `np.stack()` along a new axis. The existing 2D array is "stacked" three times to create three channels. This is equivalent to converting a grayscale image to a color image by assigning the same grayscale value to the red, green and blue channels respectively. The key difference is that we now added to the number of channels, while keeping the number of rows and columns the same. This output, `image_3d_channels`, is now the correct input structure if the target function expects an (height, width, channels) form. I used this technique regularly to generate artificial color data when the original sensor only captured monochrome images.

Furthermore, a critical error I frequently observed stems from misunderstanding which dimension should be the 'channel' dimension when a 2D array needs to become a 3D array. Let’s imagine a very specific situation. Suppose we have an array with the shape of (4, 750) that is meant to represent a dataset of time series. Where 4 refers to 4 separate series of length 750. If I need to have it as an input to a time series processing function requiring a 3D tensor of the form `(series, time, channels)`. The correct reshaping procedure will be as follows.

```python
import numpy as np

time_series_2d = np.random.rand(4, 750) # Simulate a 2D array of time series
time_series_3d = time_series_2d.reshape((4, 750, 1)) # Reshape to (4, 750, 1)

print(f"Original shape: {time_series_2d.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped shape: {time_series_3d.shape}")
```

The key takeaway from this example is the addition of a final dimension of size 1. That new dimension represents a single channel, because the input data is not yet in a multi-channel context. The data is now a series of 4 time-series samples, each with a length of 750, and in one channel. I've seen many colleagues initially treat the length of 750 as the 'channels', a misconception that invariably led to downstream errors.

Finally, it's imperative to understand that `reshape()` does not alter data but re-arranges it based on the specified dimensions. Incorrect reshapes, therefore, don’t cause errors immediately but lead to subtle errors downstream during algorithmic computations. It's vital to double-check the dimensional requirements of any target function before reshaping.

For further learning and reinforcement of these concepts, I'd recommend focusing on the official `NumPy` documentation regarding array manipulation. Material focused on basic tensor algebra and the conventions within common libraries in machine learning, deep learning and image processing can often assist in reinforcing the correct application of `reshape()`. Additionally, a deep understanding of data structures and how data is arranged in memory can lead to more intuitive reshaping procedures. Exploring tutorials and articles on the fundamental differences between different dimensionalities in array data structures can also be beneficial.
