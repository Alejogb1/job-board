The "Graph is finalized and cannot be modified" error, a common stumbling block in TensorFlow, arises precisely when one attempts to alter the computational graph after its construction phase concludes. This usually occurs within a `tf.function` when implicit graph building has taken place, or when using the now-deprecated eager execution without explicit graph management. I've encountered this issue repeatedly during the development of custom loss functions and complex model architectures where dynamic graph modifications seemed necessary, and it's a core behavior of TensorFlow that needs understanding to prevent unexpected behavior.

The root of the problem is TensorFlow's optimization strategy. During the initial, often implicit, build of a computational graph, TensorFlow meticulously records each operation, allowing the framework to optimize memory allocation, parallelize execution across different hardware, and deploy computations to specific devices like GPUs. Once this structure is solidified (finalized), it is considered immutable for efficiency reasons. Any attempt to introduce a new node or modify existing operations to the existing graph will fail, throwing the mentioned exception.

To address this, the primary strategy involves carefully controlling when the graph is built and avoiding modification within its immutable scope. This often translates into structuring code in a way that ensures all modifications are performed prior to the first execution of the function or operation triggering the finalized state. Furthermore, it often requires explicitly separating graph construction from graph execution, especially in custom use cases.

Consider first, a typical, yet flawed, scenario using `tf.function`. Suppose, for a model's internal logic, a user desires to dynamically switch between different activation functions based on a given mode, intending to define the function using `tf.function` for performance. Here’s an example of that and why it triggers the error:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def problematic_activation(x, mode):
    if mode == "relu":
        return tf.nn.relu(x)
    elif mode == "sigmoid":
        return tf.nn.sigmoid(x)
    else:
        return x

input_tensor = tf.constant([-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], dtype=tf.float32)

# First execution works, the graph is finalized based on mode = "relu"
result_relu = problematic_activation(input_tensor, "relu")
print(result_relu)

# Second execution will trigger the error
try:
    result_sigmoid = problematic_activation(input_tensor, "sigmoid")
    print(result_sigmoid)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```

In the example above, the first call to `problematic_activation` with `mode="relu"` triggers graph building, recording the `tf.nn.relu` operation. The subsequent call with `mode="sigmoid"` attempts to add an `tf.nn.sigmoid` operation, modifying the finalized graph.  This directly leads to the error because the function `problematic_activation` has its computation graph cached after the first call. The framework assumes the structure will not change after the first call to improve performance in subsequent calls. The code attempts to modify the previously finalized structure, causing the exception. The solution is not to try and modify the graph *inside* the `tf.function`, but construct the needed components *beforehand*.

A common solution involves structuring the code such that the dynamic part resides outside of the `tf.function`. This might involve passing the specific activation function as an argument and avoiding conditional statements that add distinct operations inside the function. This is achieved by pre-selecting operations outside the graph-building scope. Here's a revised version:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def select_activation(mode):
    if mode == "relu":
        return tf.nn.relu
    elif mode == "sigmoid":
        return tf.nn.sigmoid
    else:
        return lambda x: x  # identity function

@tf.function
def functional_activation(x, activation_func):
    return activation_func(x)

input_tensor = tf.constant([-1.0, 0.0, 1.0], dtype=tf.float32)

relu_func = select_activation("relu")
result_relu = functional_activation(input_tensor, relu_func)
print(result_relu)

sigmoid_func = select_activation("sigmoid")
result_sigmoid = functional_activation(input_tensor, sigmoid_func)
print(result_sigmoid)

```

In this revised example, the `select_activation` function pre-determines the appropriate activation function based on the given mode, and is *not* decorated by `@tf.function`.  The `functional_activation` function, now wrapped with `@tf.function`, simply applies the provided activation function, avoiding the graph modification problem. It builds the computation graph based on the provided operation, which is already pre-defined outside the decorated function’s scope. This allows the graph to remain static throughout execution. The logic for selection is moved to the python execution instead of TensorFlow's graph computation.

A more nuanced scenario is encountered when developing custom training loops involving dynamic graph modifications in custom models, especially when trying to adapt models mid-training, a scenario I had to deal with while training a series of stacked transformer models. Consider an adaptation of a simplified version of that specific problem:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class DynamicModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DynamicModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense_layers = []
        self.num_layers = 0

    def add_layer(self, units):
        self.dense_layers.append(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units))
        self.num_layers += 1

    @tf.function
    def call(self, inputs):
        x = inputs
        for layer in self.dense_layers:
            x = layer(x)
        return x

    @tf.function
    def train_step(self, x, y, optimizer, loss_fn):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            y_pred = self(x)
            loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)

        grads = tape.gradient(loss, self.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, self.trainable_variables))
        return loss

model = DynamicModel()

# Initial training without any additional layers
inputs = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
labels = tf.random.normal((1, 5))
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
model.add_layer(5)

loss_value = model.train_step(inputs, labels, optimizer, loss_fn)

print(f"initial loss: {loss_value}")

# Trying to add another layer after training started to adapt the model fails.
try:
   model.add_layer(2)
   new_labels = tf.random.normal((1,2))
   loss_value_new = model.train_step(inputs, new_labels, optimizer, loss_fn) # This now fails as the graph has been finalized
   print(f"Second loss: {loss_value_new}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```

In the above example, the attempt to modify the model by adding `model.add_layer(2)` after the initial call to `model.train_step`, has started building the computational graph using the model's initial state. Subsequent calls to `train_step`, which internally calls the decorated `call` function, will result in a finalized graph structure, and the attempt to use the model with an additional layer fails.

The resolution here is more intricate than before. The key is to structure the code such that model building occurs entirely before the execution of training functions and to define functions responsible for modifications that operate on model structures before they enter the training loop. A partial solution, at least on a model definition level, is to move dynamic modifications to an initial construction phase:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class DynamicModelFixed(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, initial_layers):
        super(DynamicModelFixed, self).__init__()
        self.dense_layers = []
        for layer in initial_layers:
          self.add_layer(layer)


    def add_layer(self, units):
        self.dense_layers.append(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units))

    @tf.function
    def call(self, inputs):
        x = inputs
        for layer in self.dense_layers:
            x = layer(x)
        return x

    @tf.function
    def train_step(self, x, y, optimizer, loss_fn):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            y_pred = self(x)
            loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)

        grads = tape.gradient(loss, self.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, self.trainable_variables))
        return loss

# Initial training without any additional layers
inputs = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
labels = tf.random.normal((1, 5))
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Initial layers defined before training
model = DynamicModelFixed([5])

loss_value = model.train_step(inputs, labels, optimizer, loss_fn)
print(f"initial loss: {loss_value}")


# Trying to modify the model structure will *still* fail due to tf.function caching
try:
   model.add_layer(2)
   new_labels = tf.random.normal((1,2))
   loss_value_new = model.train_step(inputs, new_labels, optimizer, loss_fn)
   print(f"Second loss: {loss_value_new}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this revised example, although the dynamic behavior is introduced into the constructor, attempting to modify the model structure after its creation still fails, as `train_step` and `call` will cache the structure based on the model's initial state. To implement dynamic modifications with `tf.function` the strategy is to create multiple `tf.function`s that are cached and use those, rather than attempting to alter the existing structure. Alternatively, a non-functional approach would be necessary.

In practice, one would pre-build a series of model architectures and use conditional logic outside of the decorated functions to switch between them. This prevents modifying an already finalized graph. Furthermore, using Keras layers for building models using model subclassing, one should be very wary of the implications of the `@tf.function` decorator, opting to move dynamic modification logic outside the scope of decorated methods or functions. While flexible for experimentation, dynamic modifications to a model's computational graph within a `@tf.function` are generally a bad practice and should be avoided for consistency and stability of training.

For additional resources, I would recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation regarding `tf.function` and graph execution, reviewing tutorials focusing on custom training loops, and studying advanced model building using Keras. Books focusing on deep learning with TensorFlow, especially those covering advanced or production deployment practices, can also prove helpful in understanding the subtle nuances of TensorFlow graph execution and avoiding these kinds of errors.
