Multiple comparisons following independent t-tests present a significant challenge for visualization, particularly when aiming for a clear representation of effect sizes alongside statistical significance.  My experience working on clinical trial data analysis highlighted this issue repeatedly, leading me to develop robust strategies for communicating these results effectively using ggplot2.  Simply plotting p-values is insufficient; a nuanced approach incorporating effect sizes and confidence intervals is crucial for conveying the true impact of each comparison.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core problem lies in the inherent limitations of representing multiple independent hypothesis tests on a single visual.  A naive approach of simply displaying p-values for each t-test alongside group means leads to a cluttered and often misleading graph. The reader is left to mentally integrate p-values, effect sizes (often implicitly assumed as the difference in means), and the inherent uncertainty associated with each test.  A superior strategy involves incorporating confidence intervals for the effect size of each comparison to simultaneously communicate both statistical significance and the magnitude of the observed differences.  Furthermore, strategically using color and faceting can improve interpretability when dealing with numerous comparisons.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the visualization of multiple t-tests using ggplot2.  They leverage the `ggpubr` package for ease of generating error bars representing confidence intervals.  I've encountered situations where custom code was necessary for advanced visualization, but these examples cover the most common scenarios. I assume the input data is a data frame with columns representing the group, the measured variable, and potentially additional grouping factors.

**Example 1:  Visualizing Comparisons Between Two Groups Across Multiple Variables**

This example assumes you've already performed your t-tests using functions like `t.test()` and have summarized your results (including confidence intervals) in a data frame.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Sample data (replace with your own results)
results <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Weight", "Height", "BloodPressure"),
  Group1Mean = c(70, 170, 120),
  Group2Mean = c(75, 175, 130),
  Difference = c(5, 5, 10),
  LowerCI = c(2, 2, 5),
  UpperCI = c(8, 8, 15),
  p_value = c(0.01, 0.03, 0.001)
)

# Create the plot
ggplot(results, aes(x = Variable, y = Difference, fill = Variable)) +
  geom_col() +  #Use geom_col for a bar chart
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = LowerCI, ymax = UpperCI), width = 0.2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") + # Adds a horizontal line at zero
  labs(title = "Comparison of Group Means Across Variables",
       x = "Variable",
       y = "Difference in Means (Group2 - Group1)",
       fill = "Variable") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")  # Optional: use a color brewer palette
```

This code generates a bar chart showing the difference in means between two groups for each variable.  Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval. The dashed line at zero helps visualize statistically significant differences (those whose confidence intervals do not include zero).  The p-values can be added as labels to the bars if needed, although excessive annotation should be avoided to maintain clarity.

**Example 2: Visualizing Multiple Pairwise Comparisons within a Single Factor**

This scenario involves comparing multiple levels of a single categorical variable.  The data requires restructuring to a "long" format.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(tidyr)

# Sample data (replace with your own)
data <- data.frame(
  Treatment = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), each = 10)),
  Response = rnorm(40, mean = c(10, 12, 15, 11), sd = 2)
)

# Perform pairwise t-tests (replace with your desired method)
pairwise.t.test(data$Response, data$Treatment, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni") -> pvals
pvals_df <- as.data.frame(pvals$p.value)
pvals_df$comparison <- rownames(pvals_df)

# Reshape the data for ggplot
data_summary <- data %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarise(mean_response = mean(Response),
              sd_response = sd(Response),
              n = n()) %>%
    mutate(se = sd_response/sqrt(n),
           ci = qt(0.975, df=n-1)*se)

data_summary$LowerCI <- data_summary$mean_response - data_summary$ci
data_summary$UpperCI <- data_summary$mean_response + data_summary$ci

#Join p-values with the summary
data_summary <- merge(data_summary, pvals_df, by.x="Treatment", by.y="row.names")

# Plot
ggplot(data_summary, aes(x = Treatment, y = mean_response, fill = Treatment)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = LowerCI, ymax = UpperCI), width = 0.2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(p.value, 3)), vjust = -0.5) +
  labs(title = "Pairwise Comparisons of Treatment Groups",
       x = "Treatment",
       y = "Mean Response",
       fill = "Treatment") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```

This example performs pairwise t-tests using `pairwise.t.test()`, applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.  The resulting p-values are then integrated into the plot.

**Example 3:  Visualizing Interactions using Faceting**


When dealing with multiple comparisons involving interacting factors, faceting provides an organized and effective way to present results.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Sample data (replace with your own)
data <- data.frame(
  Treatment = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 20)),
  Dose = factor(rep(c("Low", "High"), 20)),
  Response = rnorm(40, mean = c(10, 12, 15, 18), sd = 2)
)


# Assuming you've performed t-tests for each facet combination
results <- data.frame(
  Treatment = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 2),
  Dose = rep(c("Low", "High"), 2),
  Difference = c(2,4,6,8),
  LowerCI = c(0,2,4,6),
  UpperCI = c(4,6,8,10),
  p_value = c(0.02, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001)
)


# Plot with faceting
ggplot(results, aes(x = Treatment, y = Difference, fill = Treatment)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = LowerCI, ymax = UpperCI), width = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~ Dose) +
  labs(title = "Treatment Effect at Different Doses",
       x = "Treatment",
       y = "Difference in Means",
       fill = "Treatment") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

This example uses faceting to separate the comparisons based on the dose level, making the interpretation of the interaction effect more straightforward.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **ggplot2 documentation:**  The official documentation offers comprehensive details on all functionalities.  Mastering ggplot2 requires a thorough understanding of its grammar.
*  **R for Data Science:**  This book provides valuable context on data manipulation and visualization techniques, including more advanced ggplot2 usage.
* **Statistical methods textbooks:**  A solid understanding of statistical inference and multiple comparison procedures is essential for correct interpretation of results.


This multifaceted approach to visualizing multiple t-tests using ggplot2 allows for a more complete and informative communication of the findings.  Remember to always clearly label axes, provide a legend, and carefully choose appropriate scales to ensure accurate and unambiguous interpretation.  In cases involving a very large number of comparisons, consider alternative approaches, like clustering or heatmaps, for effective visualization.
