TensorFlow.js applications frequently cease operation or exhibit significantly degraded performance when the browser window is minimized due primarily to the browser's resource management strategies.  My experience debugging this across numerous projects points to a combination of factors, most prominently the browser's throttling of inactive tabs and the inherent computational demands of TensorFlow.js operations.

**1.  Browser Resource Management:** Modern browsers employ sophisticated mechanisms to optimize system resource utilization. When a browser tab is minimized, it's typically assigned lower priority in terms of CPU allocation and memory access. This is a deliberate design choice to prevent unresponsive behavior and improve overall system performance.  TensorFlow.js, being computationally intensive, is particularly vulnerable to this.  Operations involving large models or significant data processing become noticeably slower or entirely halted under these resource-constrained conditions. This isn't a bug within TensorFlow.js itself; it's a consequence of the operating system and browser's resource management interacting with the demands of a computationally heavy task.

**2.  Garbage Collection and Memory Leaks:** While less common, poorly managed memory within a TensorFlow.js application can exacerbate the problem.  If the application fails to properly release resources—tensors, model instances, etc.—after their use, the browser's garbage collector might be overwhelmed when resources are already limited due to minimization. This leads to increased memory pressure, potentially triggering crashes or significant performance degradation, manifesting as an apparent cessation of functionality when the window is minimized. My past experience resolving such issues involved meticulous code review, focusing on the proper disposal of TensorFlow.js objects using methods like `dispose()` for tensors and models.

**3.  Background Tab Throttling:** Browsers often throttle the activity of background tabs beyond simple resource allocation. They may reduce the frequency of JavaScript execution or completely pause it for extended periods.  This is again a browser optimization technique intended to improve battery life and system performance.  A TensorFlow.js model performing inference or training in a minimized tab might be impacted to the point of becoming completely unresponsive due to this aggressive background throttling.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Demonstrating Proper Resource Management:**

```javascript
// Load the model
const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/model.json');

// Perform inference
const predictions = model.predict(inputTensor);

// ...process predictions...

// Explicitly dispose of resources
predictions.dispose();
model.dispose();
tf.disposeVariables(); //Important for cleaning up internal variables
```

This example highlights the crucial step of explicitly disposing of TensorFlow.js objects using the `dispose()` method.  Failing to do so can lead to memory leaks, making the application more susceptible to performance issues when minimized.  The `tf.disposeVariables()` is a frequently overlooked but critical step to ensure all internal TensorFlow.js variables are released from memory.  In my experience, neglecting this line was a common source of unexplained behavior in minimized browser windows.


**Example 2: Handling Asynchronous Operations and Minimization:**

```javascript
let modelLoaded = false;

const loadModel = async () => {
  const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/model.json');
  modelLoaded = true;
  // ... further model initialization ...
};

loadModel();

// Main application loop
setInterval(() => {
  if (modelLoaded && !document.hidden) { //Check if window is visible
    // Perform inference only if model is loaded and window is visible
    // ... perform inference using the loaded model ...
  }
}, 100); // Adjust interval as needed
```

This example incorporates a check for the `document.hidden` property. This property indicates whether the page is currently hidden (e.g., the browser window is minimized or another tab is active).  By conditionally executing the inference only when the page is visible, we avoid unnecessary computation in the background, mitigating the impact of browser throttling.  Prioritizing execution only when the window is active is a robust strategy I've found effective in many real-world scenarios.

**Example 3:  Using a Web Worker for Background Tasks:**

```javascript
// In the main script:
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');

// Send data to the worker
worker.postMessage({data: inputData});

worker.onmessage = (event) => {
  // Process results from the worker
  const results = event.data;
  // ...use the results...
};


// worker.js:
onmessage = (event) => {
  const inputData = event.data.data;
  // Perform TensorFlow.js operations here
  const results = tf.tidy(() => {
    // ... TensorFlow.js operations ...
  });
  postMessage(results);
};
```

Offloading TensorFlow.js computations to a web worker can partially alleviate the impact of browser throttling. Web workers operate in a separate thread, providing a degree of isolation from the main browser thread and reducing the likelihood of performance degradation due to resource limitations.  Using `tf.tidy()` within the web worker further ensures efficient memory management.  This method requires architectural changes, but in complex applications with significant computational loads, it can be necessary. I've employed this effectively in resource-intensive applications to maintain responsiveness even in minimized windows.



**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow.js documentation.  Advanced JavaScript concepts relating to asynchronous programming and memory management.  A comprehensive guide on browser resource management and optimization techniques.  Information on web worker implementation and efficient inter-process communication.

In conclusion, the cessation of TensorFlow.js functionality in minimized browser windows stems from the interplay between browser resource management strategies and the computationally intensive nature of TensorFlow.js. Addressing this requires a combination of careful resource management within the application code, strategic use of browser features (such as checking `document.hidden`), and potentially, architectural adjustments, such as the employment of web workers for computationally heavy operations.  By understanding these factors and applying the techniques described, developers can create robust TensorFlow.js applications that maintain functionality even when the browser window is minimized.
