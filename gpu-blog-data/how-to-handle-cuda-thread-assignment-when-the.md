The fundamental constraint in CUDA programming when dealing with a large number of elements relative to available threads lies in the inherent limitation of thread block size and the grid dimension restrictions imposed by the hardware.  My experience optimizing large-scale computations on GPUs has shown that naive approaches often lead to performance bottlenecks.  Efficient handling demands a clear understanding of thread hierarchy and careful mapping of data onto threads.

**1.  Understanding Thread Hierarchy and Data Mapping:**

CUDA utilizes a hierarchical model for thread organization.  Threads are grouped into blocks, and blocks are further arranged into a grid.  The maximum number of threads per block is determined by the GPU architecture (e.g., compute capability), and the maximum grid dimensions are also architecture-specific.  When the number of elements to be processed exceeds the total number of threads within a grid, a strategy for partitioning the workload is required. This is critical for achieving optimal occupancy and throughput.

The most common approach involves dividing the total number of elements into chunks that can be handled by individual thread blocks.  Each thread block then processes a subset of the data, with individual threads within the block handling smaller portions.  The choice of block size significantly influences performance.  Too small a block size leads to underutilization of the GPU's processing capabilities, while a block size that is too large can result in register spilling and reduced performance due to limited shared memory.

**2. Code Examples Demonstrating Different Strategies:**

Let's illustrate three distinct strategies using CUDA C++.  These examples focus on a simple element-wise operation â€“ squaring each element in an array.

**Example 1: Simple Block-wise Partitioning:**

This example demonstrates a straightforward partitioning method where the number of blocks is determined by the ceiling of the total number of elements divided by the number of threads per block.  This approach assumes a uniform distribution of workload.

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

__global__ void squareArray(float *in, float *out, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        out[i] = in[i] * in[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024 * 1024 * 10; // Example: 10 million elements
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (int)ceil((double)n / threadsPerBlock);

    float *h_in, *h_out;
    float *d_in, *d_out;

    // Memory allocation on host and device
    h_in = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    h_out = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_in, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_out, n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize input data
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        h_in[i] = (float)i;
    }

    // Copy data to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_in, h_in, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Launch kernel
    squareArray<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_in, d_out, n);

    // Copy data back to host
    cudaMemcpy(h_out, d_out, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Verification (optional)
    // ...

    // Free memory
    free(h_in);
    free(h_out);
    cudaFree(d_in);
    cudaFree(d_out);

    return 0;
}
```

**Example 2: Handling Remainders with Separate Kernel Launch:**

This example addresses the issue of potential remainder elements that are not processed in the main kernel launch by adding a second, smaller kernel launch to handle these remaining elements.

```cpp
// ... (Includes and main function setup as in Example 1) ...

__global__ void squareArrayRemainder(float *in, float *out, int n) {
    int i = threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        out[i] = in[i] * in[i];
    }
}

// ... (Main function continues) ...

int remainder = n % threadsPerBlock;
if (remainder > 0) {
    squareArrayRemainder<<<1, remainder>>>(d_in + (n - remainder), d_out + (n - remainder), remainder);
}

// ... (Rest of the main function as in Example 1) ...
```


**Example 3:  Employing Shared Memory for Improved Cohesion:**

This example demonstrates leveraging shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, improving performance for data-intensive operations.  Each thread block loads a portion of the input array into shared memory before performing computations.


```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

__global__ void squareArrayShared(float *in, float *out, int n) {
    __shared__ float s_in[256]; // Assuming threadsPerBlock = 256
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int idx = threadIdx.x;

    if (i < n) {
        s_in[idx] = in[i];
        __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads load data
        s_in[idx] *= s_in[idx];
        __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads finish calculation
        out[i] = s_in[idx];
    }
}

// ... (Main function similar to Example 1, adapting the kernel launch) ...
```
