TensorFlow 1.14.0's installation within PyCharm necessitates a nuanced approach due to its end-of-life status and incompatibility with newer Python versions.  My experience troubleshooting this for various clients underscored the importance of managing virtual environments and selecting the appropriate wheel file.  Failing to do so frequently results in dependency conflicts and runtime errors.

**1.  Understanding the Constraints:**

TensorFlow 1.x, particularly 1.14.0, is no longer officially supported. This means crucial security patches and bug fixes are absent.  Consequently, installing it often requires meticulous attention to Python version compatibility.  TensorFlow 1.14.0 was primarily designed for Python 3.5-3.7. Attempting installation with Python 3.8 or later will almost certainly lead to failure.  This dictates our initial steps toward a successful installation.

**2.  Installation Procedure:**

The process involves three core phases: virtual environment creation, selecting the appropriate wheel file, and finally, installation within the PyCharm environment.

* **Phase 1: Virtual Environment Creation.** This is paramount for isolating the TensorFlow 1.14.0 installation from other projects.  Using a dedicated virtual environment prevents dependency clashes with other projects that might rely on newer TensorFlow versions or conflicting libraries.  I've witnessed numerous instances where neglecting this step led to system-wide instability.  The recommended approach utilizes `venv` (built-in to Python 3.3+) or `virtualenv` (a widely used external package).

* **Phase 2: Wheel File Selection.** Downloading the correct wheel file is crucial.  The .whl files are pre-compiled packages specific to an operating system and Python version.  Incorrectly selecting a wheel file will lead to immediate installation errors.  I strongly advise referring to the TensorFlow 1.14.0 release notes (available in archives online) to identify the correct wheel file for your operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows) and Python version (3.5, 3.6, or 3.7).  Pay close attention to the `cp37` or `cp36` etc. suffix in the filename.  This denotes the Python version.


* **Phase 3: Installation within PyCharm.**  PyCharm simplifies the process of using pip within a virtual environment.  Once the wheel file is downloaded, it can be installed directly from the terminal in PyCharm.


**3. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment using `venv` (Recommended):**

```bash
python3.7 -m venv tf114env  # Replace python3.7 with your Python 3.5-3.7 executable path
source tf114env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS;  tf114env\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

*Commentary:* This creates a virtual environment named `tf114env`. The `source` command activates it, making it the active Python environment within the terminal.  All subsequent commands will operate within this isolated environment.  Always activate the environment before installing packages.


**Example 2: Installing TensorFlow 1.14.0 from a downloaded wheel file:**

```bash
pip install /path/to/tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl  # Replace with your wheel file path
```

*Commentary:* This command assumes you have downloaded the appropriate wheel file (e.g., `tensorflow-1.14.0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl` for a 64-bit Linux system using Python 3.7).  Replace `/path/to/` with the actual directory containing the downloaded wheel file.  The `pip` command within the activated environment ensures TensorFlow 1.14.0 is installed only within that isolated environment.  Failure to do so will likely corrupt other project environments.


**Example 3: Verifying the Installation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

*Commentary:*  This Python script, executed within the activated virtual environment, verifies that TensorFlow is installed and prints the version number.  If the output correctly displays `1.14.0`, the installation was successful.  If an `ImportError` occurs, it indicates that either the installation failed or the environment is not properly activated.


**4.  Addressing Potential Issues:**

* **`ImportError: No module named 'tensorflow'`:** This error arises from either an incorrect installation path, the virtual environment not being activated, or incorrect wheel file selection.  Always double-check that your environment is activated and that the wheel file path is correct.

* **Dependency Conflicts:**  TensorFlow 1.14.0 has specific dependency requirements.  Older versions of `numpy`, `six`, and other packages might cause issues.  Attempting to install these manually may, at times, be necessary, although this should be avoided in favor of using the correct wheel file.

* **Incompatible Python Version:**  This is the most frequent cause of errors. Ensure that you are using a Python version (3.5-3.7) compatible with TensorFlow 1.14.0.  The use of a correct wheel file should obviate the need for further adjustments.


**5. Resource Recommendations:**

The official (archived) TensorFlow 1.x documentation.  The Python documentation on `venv` and `virtualenv`.  A comprehensive guide to Python package management using `pip`.


In conclusion, successfully installing TensorFlow 1.14.0 in PyCharm demands meticulous attention to detail and adherence to version compatibility.  By diligently following the steps outlined above—creating a dedicated virtual environment, downloading the correct wheel file, and verifying the installation—you can circumvent the common pitfalls associated with installing this legacy version of TensorFlow. Remember to prioritize using an appropriate and supported version of TensorFlow for new projects to avoid encountering such compatibility issues in the future.
