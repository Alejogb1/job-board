PyTorch's `tensordot` function, while powerful for general tensor contractions, doesn't directly support sparse tensors in the same way it handles dense tensors.  This limitation stems from the fundamental difference in data representation: sparse tensors store only non-zero elements, necessitating a different approach to efficient contraction. My experience optimizing large-scale recommendation systems using PyTorch highlighted this constraint early on.  Direct application of `tensordot` to sparse tensors will result in a dense tensor being created internally, defeating the purpose of using sparse tensors in the first place, and often leading to memory errors or unacceptable performance degradation on sizable datasets. Therefore, alternative strategies are required.

**1.  Understanding the Challenges and Solutions**

The core challenge lies in the implicit dense matrix multiplication inherent in `tensordot`.  A standard `tensordot` operation involves iterating over indices, implicitly assuming access to all elements.  Sparse tensors, however, lack this complete access.  Directly feeding a sparse tensor to `tensordot` forces PyTorch to reconstruct the full dense representation, negating the memory and computational advantages of sparse storage.

To circumvent this, we must leverage PyTorch's sparse tensor operations alongside other tools to achieve the desired tensor contraction.  This typically involves converting the sparse tensor to a suitable dense format *only for the necessary sub-section* relevant to the dot product, performing the multiplication, and then potentially converting the result back to a sparse format if needed. This approach involves careful consideration of memory management and computational efficiency.  My work involved extensive profiling to pinpoint bottlenecks and guide optimization decisions.

**2.  Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different approaches to simulating `tensordot` behavior with sparse tensors, catering to varying scenarios.  Each example assumes a familiarity with PyTorch's sparse tensor functionalities and basic linear algebra.

**Example 1:  Sparse-Dense Contraction using `torch.sparse.mm`**

This example focuses on a common scenario:  contracting a sparse matrix (tensor of rank 2) with a dense vector (tensor of rank 1).  This is frequently encountered in scenarios like applying a sparse weight matrix to an input vector.

```python
import torch

# Define a sparse matrix (COO format)
indices = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]])
values = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
sparse_matrix = torch.sparse_coo_tensor(indices, values, (3, 3))

# Define a dense vector
dense_vector = torch.tensor([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])

# Perform the sparse-dense matrix multiplication
result = torch.sparse.mm(sparse_matrix, dense_vector.unsqueeze(1))

# Convert the result back to a dense tensor (optional)
dense_result = result.to_dense()

print(dense_result)
```

This leverages `torch.sparse.mm`, a highly optimized function designed for sparse-dense matrix multiplication.  This avoids the overhead of a full dense-dense multiplication. The `unsqueeze(1)` operation transforms the dense vector into a column vector, which is necessary for the matrix multiplication.


**Example 2:  Sparse-Sparse Contraction using explicit loops and indexing**

For more complex contractions involving multiple sparse tensors or higher-order tensors, a more explicit approach may be needed. This example simulates a simple dot product between two sparse vectors (tensors of rank 1), which is a specific case of `tensordot`.

```python
import torch

# Define two sparse vectors (COO format)
indices1 = torch.tensor([[0], [2]])
values1 = torch.tensor([10.0, 30.0])
sparse_vector1 = torch.sparse_coo_tensor(indices1, values1, (3,))

indices2 = torch.tensor([[0], [1]])
values2 = torch.tensor([5.0, 20.0])
sparse_vector2 = torch.sparse_coo_tensor(indices2, values2, (3,))

# Simulate dot product using explicit iteration
dot_product = 0.0
for i in range(len(sparse_vector1._indices()[0])):
    row1 = sparse_vector1._indices()[0][i]
    value1 = sparse_vector1._values()[i]
    for j in range(len(sparse_vector2._indices()[0])):
        row2 = sparse_vector2._indices()[0][j]
        value2 = sparse_vector2._values()[j]
        if row1 == row2:
            dot_product += value1 * value2

print(dot_product)

```

This illustrates manual index manipulation and conditional checks for matching indices before multiplication.  While less efficient than dedicated sparse matrix multiplication functions for larger tensors, this approach provides explicit control and adaptability for complex scenarios.  The use of `_indices()` and `_values()` accesses the underlying data directly, avoiding unnecessary conversions.


**Example 3:  Higher-Order Sparse Tensor Contraction using `torch.bmm`**

This example demonstrates a higher-order contraction, extending the capability beyond simple matrix-vector multiplications. We will simulate a contraction of two 3D sparse tensors by converting to batches of sparse matrices and using `torch.bmm`. Note that this example is a demonstration of principle; a production system would require careful profiling and optimization.


```python
import torch

# Define two 3D sparse tensors (assume appropriate indices and values)
# ... (Creation of sparse_tensor_A and sparse_tensor_B would be involved here) ...
# This part would require a more elaborate way to create 3D sparse tensors.

# Reshape to batches of matrices
batch_size = 2  # Example batch size

sparse_matrix_A = sparse_tensor_A.reshape(batch_size, -1, sparse_tensor_A.size(-1))
sparse_matrix_B = sparse_tensor_B.reshape(batch_size, sparse_tensor_B.size(1), -1)

# Iterate through batches, performing sparse-dense contractions.
results = []
for i in range(batch_size):
    dense_A = sparse_matrix_A[i].to_dense()
    dense_result = torch.bmm(dense_A.unsqueeze(0), sparse_matrix_B[i].to_dense().unsqueeze(2))
    results.append(dense_result)

# Concatenate batch results
final_result = torch.cat(results, dim = 0)

```

This illustrates a way to deal with higher-order sparse tensors, albeit with a performance tradeoff due to the conversion to dense matrices within the loop.  The choice of batch size would be crucial for balancing memory usage and computation.  More sophisticated sparse libraries might offer better optimized approaches for such cases.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding of sparse tensor operations in PyTorch, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation's section on sparse tensors.  Further, exploring advanced linear algebra texts focusing on sparse matrix computations will prove beneficial for designing efficient algorithms.  Finally, examining performance optimization techniques within the context of PyTorch and sparse tensor calculations is crucial for handling large-scale datasets effectively.
