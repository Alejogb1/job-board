The core issue preventing `async with` from functioning correctly inside an `asyncio.Task` often stems from a misunderstanding of how asynchronous context managers interact with the event loop's cooperative multitasking. I encountered this exact problem when developing a high-throughput data ingestion pipeline, where I naively expected context managers managing resources within tasks to behave identically to their synchronous counterparts.

The fundamental problem lies not with `async with` itself, but with how `asyncio.Task`s are scheduled and executed relative to the asynchronous context manager's lifecycle. An `async with` statement relies on the `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods of the context manager to manage resources; typically these are things like acquiring connections, opening files, or managing locks. These methods are themselves coroutines, and thus need to be awaited. `asyncio.Task`s are similarly coroutines that the event loop needs to manage. When you mistakenly try to launch tasks that directly contain context managers that block on network operations, such as a socket, or on filesystem access, or any of the typical things that require I/O, it can lead to a deadlock, or more commonly, unexpected errors if the context manager is never completely entered into or exited from.

A direct correlation can be drawn to the behavior seen when dealing with a standard synchronous context manager inside a thread in a non-async environment. A blocked thread due to a blocked synchronous resource can impede the execution of the entire program, the problem of course is that our async environments are *also* single-threaded, but instead of a single blocking thread we get a single blocked task preventing other tasks from making progress.

The error will often surface as a failure to complete the `__aenter__` or `__aexit__` stages because the task is never truly given the necessary opportunity to advance its execution. This isn’t typically a bug in asyncio or the context manager itself, but a conceptual problem in how the task is constructed. The root cause is that you're launching the task with code that directly waits on I/O or some blocking operation, which may never yield control back to the event loop until completion (which may never happen if the `__aexit__` cannot be executed). This leads to the perception of the task "not working" when, in reality, it is simply blocked.

The critical concept to grasp is that `asyncio.Task`s, like all coroutines, should yield control back to the event loop as often as possible, particularly during potentially blocking operations. The `async with` construct, in itself, correctly yields, but only when its inner awaited functions can actually yield too. If the task's code within the `async with` blocks waiting on I/O or other blocking code, the task will cease to advance, and this can block the cleanup logic of `__aexit__`.

Let’s illustrate this with a few examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect Usage**

```python
import asyncio

class MockAsyncContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        print("Entering context")
        await asyncio.sleep(1) # Simulate blocking
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb):
        print("Exiting context")
        await asyncio.sleep(1) # Simulate blocking

async def do_something_in_context():
    async with MockAsyncContextManager():
        print("Inside context")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5) # Simulate doing work

async def main():
    tasks = [asyncio.create_task(do_something_in_context()) for _ in range(3)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, the `MockAsyncContextManager` simulates I/O with `asyncio.sleep(1)`. This `sleep` is intended to mimic the delay you might encounter during an actual I/O operation, such as awaiting a network connection response or opening a file. Inside the `main` function, I create several tasks using `asyncio.create_task` each running the `do_something_in_context` coroutine. The intention was to launch three of these asynchronous operations, and then `await` their completion using `asyncio.gather`. Because the 'blocking' sleep operations inside the `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` are correctly awaited, the program will function as expected, which can hide potential problems. However, if the sleep calls were replaced with synchronous blocking calls, we would see a deadlock. This particular example illustrates correct usage, but let us modify this now.

**Example 2: Incorrect Usage with Blocking Inside the Context**

```python
import asyncio
import time

class MockAsyncContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        print("Entering context")
        time.sleep(1) # Synchronous blocking
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb):
        print("Exiting context")
        time.sleep(1) # Synchronous blocking

async def do_something_in_context():
    async with MockAsyncContextManager():
        print("Inside context")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

async def main():
    tasks = [asyncio.create_task(do_something_in_context()) for _ in range(3)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The important change here is the use of `time.sleep(1)` inside the context manager's `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods. This call blocks the main thread, preventing any other coroutines from advancing, because `time.sleep` does not yield to the asyncio event loop. This blocking operation prevents any other tasks from being scheduled by the event loop and will appear to cause a deadlock as a result. None of the tasks can complete the entry process because they are blocked by this synchronous operation, rendering the `async with` ineffective because it is never fully entered into. You would see the `Entering context` message be printed, but the `Exiting Context` message never appears. The entire program would hang indefinitely. The fundamental problem here is that the task's execution is blocked and it cannot complete the context's entering phase because of the synchronous `sleep` call.

**Example 3: Correct Usage with Delegation**

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncResource:
    async def open(self):
        print("Opening resource")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        return self

    async def close(self):
        print("Closing resource")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

class AsyncResourceContextManager:
    def __init__(self, resource):
        self.resource = resource

    async def __aenter__(self):
        print("Context entering")
        await self.resource.open()
        return self.resource

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb):
        print("Context exiting")
        await self.resource.close()

async def use_resource_in_context():
    resource = AsyncResource()
    async with AsyncResourceContextManager(resource) as r:
      print("Using Resource")
      await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

async def main():
    tasks = [asyncio.create_task(use_resource_in_context()) for _ in range(3)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates correct usage by delegating the resource management to an actual asynchronous object. The resource's `open()` and `close()` methods are now asynchronous and yield control back to the event loop during the simulated blocking, `await asyncio.sleep(0.5)`. The `AsyncResourceContextManager` acts as a mediator between the `async with` and the resource's methods ensuring that everything operates in the asynchronous realm. With this correct usage, the program correctly enters and exits the context three times, and all tasks complete as intended.

In summary, `async with` does work within `asyncio.Task`s as designed. The issue arises when blocking operations are performed within the context manager’s `__aenter__` or `__aexit__` or inside the task, as it will not yield execution back to the event loop and thus it prevents proper scheduling. The most effective solutions often involve properly asynchronous versions of I/O operations, or correct delegation of synchronous operations to a separate thread or process. Always ensure all components inside an async context are themselves asynchronous and non-blocking.

For further study, I would suggest reviewing the asyncio documentation specifically around how coroutines are scheduled and how tasks are managed. Understanding the concept of non-blocking IO is fundamental. Additionally, exploring common patterns for building custom asynchronous context managers is important. I would recommend exploring the aiohttp library and observing how it implements asynchronous client and server connections for real world examples. Examining source code for libraries that heavily utilize async operations can also be educational.
