The `Node` object's lack of an `output_masks` attribute in Keras stems from a fundamental mismatch between the expected tensor structure and the actual output of a layer, often arising from incompatible layer configurations or the use of custom layers without proper mask propagation implementation.  This issue, encountered frequently during my work on large-scale NLP projects, highlights the crucial role of masking in sequence processing and the intricacies of Keras's backend handling.

My experience with this error primarily involves scenarios where custom layers or less common layer types were integrated into a model.  Standard Keras layers (Dense, Conv1D, LSTM, etc.) inherently handle masking, provided the input data already includes a mask tensor. However, the moment custom components or unconventional layer combinations are introduced, the automated mask propagation mechanisms may break down.  The absence of `output_masks` signals that the layer preceding the point of failure either didn't generate or forward a mask tensor correctly.

This issue is not typically encountered in simple, feed-forward neural networks.  Its prevalence increases significantly when working with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or architectures employing techniques like masking for handling variable-length sequences or padding in NLP tasks. The error is essentially a symptom of an underlying problem in data preprocessing, layer configuration, or custom layer design.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Keras backend (typically TensorFlow or Theano) relies on a mask tensor to identify valid data points within input sequences.  This is crucial when dealing with variable-length sequences where padding is used to ensure uniform batch sizes.  The mask tensor is a binary tensor of the same shape as the input data, with 1 indicating a valid data point and 0 indicating padding.  During forward propagation, Keras layers typically propagate this mask, allowing subsequent layers to ignore padded elements during computations.

The error "Node object has no attribute 'output_masks'" appears when a layer attempts to access the `output_masks` attribute of a preceding node (a layer's output), but this attribute is missing. This signifies that the mask wasn't successfully propagated through the model up to that point. The reasons for this failure are multifold:

* **Missing Input Mask:** The input data itself lacks a mask tensor. If your model is processing sequences, you must provide a mask alongside the input data, specifying which parts of the sequences are valid and which are padding.
* **Incompatible Layer Combination:**  Combining certain layer types without carefully considering mask propagation can lead to the mask being lost. For example, using a custom layer that doesn't explicitly handle masks after a layer that does.
* **Custom Layer Implementation Error:**  If you are using a custom layer, you must explicitly handle and propagate the mask tensor.  Failure to do so is the most common source of this issue.
* **Incorrect Masking Strategy:**  The way the masking is implemented (e.g., using `Masking` layers, setting `mask_zero=True` in embedding layers, or manually creating the mask tensor) might be flawed.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Missing Input Mask:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

# Input data without mask (incorrect)
input_data = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(10, 20)) # Batch of 10 sequences, length 20

model = keras.Sequential([
    Embedding(10, 128, input_length=20),
    LSTM(64),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# This will likely fail with the 'output_masks' error or a similar masking-related error
model.fit(input_data, np.random.rand(10,1))
```

**Commentary:** This example lacks an input mask. The LSTM layer expects to receive a mask to handle potential padding.  The fix is to provide a properly formatted mask tensor along with `input_data`.


**Example 2: Custom Layer without Mask Handling:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Layer

class MyCustomLayer(Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs * 2 # Simple example; no mask handling

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Masking(mask_value=0.),
    keras.layers.Embedding(10, 128, input_length=20, mask_zero=True),
    MyCustomLayer(), # Custom layer doesn't propagate mask
    keras.layers.LSTM(64),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

input_data = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(10, 20))
input_mask = np.random.randint(0,2, size=(10,20))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
# This will likely fail. MyCustomLayer needs to handle and pass the mask.
model.fit([input_data, input_mask], np.random.rand(10,1))

```

**Commentary:**  `MyCustomLayer` doesn't handle the mask.  A corrected version would need to include `self.supports_masking = True` in the class definition and implement `compute_mask` to explicitly propagate the mask:

```python
class MyCustomLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.supports_masking = True

    def call(self, inputs, mask=None):
        return inputs * 2

    def compute_mask(self, inputs, mask=None):
        return mask
```


**Example 3: Incorrect Masking Strategy:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

input_data = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(10, 20))
input_mask = np.ones((10,20)) # Incorrect: All values are 1.  No padding indicated

model = keras.Sequential([
    Embedding(10, 128, input_length=20, mask_zero=True), # mask_zero might be incorrect here
    LSTM(64),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# This will probably not produce the specific 'output_masks' error but will likely have
# masking-related issues due to the incorrect mask
model.fit([input_data, input_mask], np.random.rand(10,1))
```

**Commentary:** This example uses an incorrect mask.  `input_mask` should accurately reflect which elements in `input_data` are padding and which are valid data points.  If `mask_zero=True` in the Embedding layer is the intended masking method, then the input data should already contain zeros to represent padding, and a separate mask might not be necessary.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, particularly sections on masking and custom layer implementation, is essential.  The TensorFlow documentation (if using TensorFlow backend) provides details on tensor manipulation and masking operations within the framework.  Finally, carefully examining examples of RNN implementation with variable-length sequences in established NLP projects will greatly enhance your understanding of proper mask handling.  Consult texts on deep learning focusing on sequence modeling for a thorough theoretical grounding.
