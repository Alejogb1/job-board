The fundamental difference between using axis label number formats and `labelExpr` with `format()` lies in their scope and flexibility.  Number formats, typically accessed through chart library settings or properties, offer a pre-defined set of formatting options directly applied to the numerical data used for axis labels.  `labelExpr`, in contrast, provides a significantly more powerful, programmatic approach, allowing arbitrary manipulation and formatting of axis labels based on the underlying data. My experience working with data visualization libraries, particularly during the development of a high-frequency trading application requiring precise label representation, highlighted this distinction.  Number formats are suitable for straightforward formatting, while `labelExpr` excels when custom logic and data transformations are needed.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Axis label number formats provide a limited but convenient means to control the appearance of numerical labels on chart axes.  These usually consist of pre-defined options such as:

* **Decimal places:**  Specifying the precision of the displayed numbers.  Common options include displaying zero, one, two, or more decimal places.
* **Scientific notation:**  Representing very large or very small numbers in exponential form (e.g., 1.23e+06).
* **Currency format:**  Including currency symbols and appropriate separators.
* **Percentage format:**  Displaying values as percentages.

These options are readily accessible through the configuration settings of many charting libraries.  Their implementation is typically direct and involves setting a single property or parameter.  However, their limitations are evident when needing more sophisticated control beyond simple number formatting.


`labelExpr`, on the other hand, empowers the user with far greater flexibility. It leverages a scripting or expression language (often Javascript or a similar domain-specific language) within the charting library to define the label text dynamically for each data point.  This means labels aren't merely formatted numbers; instead, they are generated using custom expressions that can incorporate:

* **Data transformations:**  Calculations, aggregations, or logical operations on the underlying data values.
* **Conditional formatting:**  Displaying labels differently based on data conditions.
* **Data concatenation:**  Combining numerical data with strings to create more descriptive labels.
* **External data access:**  Fetching supplementary information to enrich the labels.

The `format()` function, frequently paired with `labelExpr`, is used to achieve specific number formatting within this dynamically generated label. This combination allows precise control over both the generation and appearance of each label.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate the differences with three examples, assuming a hypothetical charting library with a Javascript-like expression language for `labelExpr`.


**Example 1:  Simple Number Formatting using built-in options (no `labelExpr`)**

```javascript
// Chart configuration
chartOptions = {
  xAxis: {
    // Assuming 'numberFormat' is a built-in option for axis label formatting
    numberFormat: {
      decimalPlaces: 2,
      useThousandsSeparator: true
    }
  },
  // ... other chart options
};

// Sample data: [12345.678, 9876.123, 4321.987]
```

This example demonstrates the straightforward application of number formatting through chart library settings.  The output will show axis labels with two decimal places and thousands separators.  However, this approach lacks the ability to modify the labels beyond standard numerical formatting.


**Example 2:  Conditional Formatting and Data Transformation with `labelExpr`**

```javascript
// Chart configuration
chartOptions = {
  xAxis: {
    labelExpr: "value > 10000 ? '$' + format(value, '.2f') : format(value, '.0f')"
  },
  // ... other chart options
};

// Sample data: [12345.678, 9876.123, 4321.987, 500]
```

Here, `labelExpr` dynamically generates labels. If a data value exceeds 10000, it's formatted with two decimal places and a dollar sign. Otherwise, it's formatted with zero decimal places. This demonstrates the conditional formatting and data manipulation capabilities. The `format()` function ensures proper numerical formatting within the conditional logic.


**Example 3:  Data Concatenation and Custom Label Creation with `labelExpr`**

```javascript
// Assume data includes both numerical values ('value') and categorical values ('category')
// Sample data: [{value: 12345, category: 'A'}, {value: 9876, category: 'B'}, {value: 4321, category: 'A'}]

// Chart configuration
chartOptions = {
  xAxis: {
    labelExpr: "category + ': ' + format(value, ',.0f')"
  },
  // ... other chart options
};
```

This illustrates data concatenation.  The label for each data point combines its category and formatted numerical value, creating more informative labels (e.g., "A: 12,345", "B: 9,876").  The `format()` function ensures thousands separators are included for enhanced readability.  This level of customization is impossible using only built-in number formats.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of advanced charting and data visualization techniques, I suggest consulting the official documentation of popular charting libraries (such as those found in popular data science ecosystems).  Examining examples and tutorials focused on custom label generation and axis formatting is crucial.  Furthermore, resources focused on the specific scripting or expression language used by your chosen library will provide invaluable insights into its capabilities.  Finally, review materials covering data visualization best practices, paying attention to the principles of effective label design and readability.  This multifaceted approach will give you a solid foundation to master advanced labeling techniques.
