The error `ImportError: cannot import name 'get_config' from 'tensorflow.python.eager.context'` typically arises due to inconsistencies between the TensorFlow version installed and the code attempting to access `get_config`. Specifically, the `get_config` function, formerly residing within the eager context module, underwent changes in TensorFlow 2.x. It was moved and is no longer directly accessible through `tensorflow.python.eager.context`.

Over years of debugging TensorFlow pipelines, I've frequently encountered similar import errors. They often stem from developers migrating code from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x, or inadvertently mixing code designed for different versions. The root of this specific issue lies in how eager execution configuration is managed across different TensorFlow iterations. In TensorFlow 1.x, eager execution wasn't the default and `get_config` offered a way to access and manipulate the configuration of the runtime environment. However, with TensorFlow 2.x, eager execution is enabled by default, and the context management mechanisms were significantly refactored. The previous API was deprecated and eventually removed.

The correct approach to resolving this `ImportError` depends on what you're aiming to achieve with `get_config`. If the goal is simply to check whether eager execution is enabled, or to configure aspects of the runtime, the revised TensorFlow APIs should be used instead.

Let’s examine the different scenarios and solutions, backed by illustrative examples.

**Scenario 1: Checking if Eager Execution is Enabled**

In TensorFlow versions where `get_config` existed within `tensorflow.python.eager.context`, one might have used the following approach:

```python
# This code will fail in TensorFlow 2.x
from tensorflow.python.eager import context

config = context.get_config()
print(config.is_eager)
```

This code snippet assumes that `get_config` returns an object with an `is_eager` property, allowing one to verify if eager execution is active. As previously stated, this method fails in TensorFlow 2.x and later versions. The equivalent implementation for TensorFlow 2.x is markedly different.

The recommended method involves using `tf.executing_eagerly()`, which returns a boolean indicating the current eager execution status:

```python
# Correct way to check eager execution in TensorFlow 2.x and later
import tensorflow as tf

is_eager = tf.executing_eagerly()
print(f"Eager execution is: {is_eager}")
```

This revised approach aligns with the current TensorFlow API. It directly interrogates the runtime using the `tf.executing_eagerly()` function. No longer do you need to import and delve into internal modules like `tensorflow.python.eager.context`. This eliminates the `ImportError`.

**Scenario 2: Configuring Eager Execution (and other runtime aspects)**

Previously, configuration manipulation would involve altering parameters via methods accessible through the object retrieved from `context.get_config()`. This is no longer the case.

TensorFlow 2.x and later do not generally support runtime configuration of eager execution. It’s enabled by default, and attempts to disable it programmatically are not recommended or supported, and can introduce inconsistencies. For many advanced scenarios, TensorFlow's configuration is handled via environment variables or session creation (for TensorFlow 1.x style graph execution, which is now legacy). Direct manipulation of the runtime context via `get_config` was often discouraged even in older versions.

Let's imagine a hypothetical scenario where one used `get_config` to configure the GPU memory growth, which was *not* a typical use case, but illustrates the configuration aspect:

```python
# Incorrect attempt to configure memory growth via 'get_config' (hypothetical usage)
from tensorflow.python.eager import context

config = context.get_config()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True # This will fail. Not the correct way
```
The correct approach, when addressing GPU resource management, or other runtime settings, is to utilize the `tf.config` API.

```python
# Correct way to configure GPU memory growth
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
       for gpu in gpus:
          tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
       print("GPU memory growth enabled.")
    except RuntimeError as e:
      print(f"RuntimeError occurred during GPU config: {e}")
```

This revised code retrieves available GPUs and, if present, allows for growth. The critical change is that we avoid the deprecated `get_config` and use `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth()` instead. This leverages the intended API for managing resource allocation.

**Scenario 3: Handling Older Codebases (Legacy TensorFlow 1.x)**

There may be cases where you're working with older code bases that relied on the deprecated `get_config` pattern. Modifying these extensively might be infeasible immediately. If feasible, the ideal resolution would be to upgrade this older code, aligning with the above examples, but if immediate replacement is not possible there are workarounds.

You can isolate the code that causes this error using conditional code blocks. You could encapsulate the problematic section within a try-except block.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    from tensorflow.python.eager import context
    config = context.get_config()
    print(f"Eager execution is: {config.is_eager}")
except ImportError:
    is_eager = tf.executing_eagerly()
    print(f"Eager execution (detected with new API) is: {is_eager}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An exception occurred: {e}")

# Proceed with execution as needed
```

This example allows the code to adapt to different TensorFlow versions. When the import fails, it will switch to the newer `tf.executing_eagerly()` function. This avoids a hard failure and allows the program to continue executing. However, this approach is a temporary fix and should not be a permanent solution. It is best practice to upgrade these sections to their modern counterparts as soon as practical.

**Resource Recommendations**

For gaining a deeper understanding, I recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation. Specifically, research the changes between TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x, as these will highlight API deprecations and recommended replacements. Also, the TensorFlow tutorials focusing on eager execution and resource management can offer further insights. Detailed explanations can also be found in the official release notes for various TensorFlow versions, which often outline specific API changes and the reasoning behind them. Lastly, browsing Stack Overflow for similar cases can yield further practical insights, particularly if encountering variations of this import error. Look for solutions focusing on TensorFlow 2.x, rather than legacy implementations.
