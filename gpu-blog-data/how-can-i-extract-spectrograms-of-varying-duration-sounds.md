The core challenge in extracting spectrograms from audio files of varying durations lies not in the spectral analysis itself, but in maintaining consistent visualization parameters across different lengths.  Inconsistent parameter choices lead to spectrograms that are difficult to compare directly, obscuring meaningful differences in the underlying acoustic data.  My experience working on acoustic anomaly detection systems for industrial machinery highlighted this precisely.  Mismatched spectrogram scales frequently resulted in false positives, emphasizing the necessity of standardized processing.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Spectrogram generation involves transforming a time-domain audio signal (amplitude vs. time) into a time-frequency representation. This transformation is typically achieved using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).  The STFT divides the audio signal into overlapping short segments (windows), applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to each window to obtain its frequency spectrum. The resulting spectrogram is a visual representation of the signal's frequency content as it changes over time, often depicted as a colormap where intensity represents amplitude.

The key to handling varying durations is controlling the parameters of the STFT:

* **Window Size (N):**  This determines the frequency resolution of the spectrogram. A larger window size provides better frequency resolution but poorer time resolution.  Conversely, a smaller window improves time resolution at the cost of frequency resolution.  Choosing an appropriate window size is crucial and often requires considering the nature of the sound being analyzed.  For sounds with rapidly changing frequencies, a smaller window is preferable.

* **Hop Size (H):** This defines the amount of overlap between consecutive windows.  A smaller hop size leads to a higher time resolution spectrogram with more temporal detail, while a larger hop size reduces computational cost but sacrifices some temporal precision.  The hop size should generally be smaller than the window size; a common ratio is H = N/2 or H = N/4.

* **Window Function:** The window function applied to each segment before the FFT reduces spectral leakage, artifacts caused by the abrupt truncation of the signal.  Popular choices include Hamming, Hanning, and Blackman windows.  The optimal window function depends on the specific application, with the Hamming window often providing a good balance between time and frequency resolution.

For consistently comparable spectrograms, one must maintain a constant **spectrogram scale**. That is, despite differing durations, the x-axis (time) should represent a normalized time scale (e.g., seconds) and the y-axis (frequency) should always use the same range (e.g., 0-22kHz for human hearing).  Failure to do this can result in misinterpretations when comparing spectrograms from different audio clips.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples utilize Python with `librosa`, a powerful audio analysis library. Remember to install it using `pip install librosa`.

**Example 1: Basic Spectrogram Generation with Fixed Parameters:**

```python
import librosa
import librosa.display
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_spectrogram(audio_file, sr=22050, n_fft=2048, hop_length=512):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, sr=sr) # Load audio
    spectrogram = librosa.feature.mel_spectrogram(y=y, sr=sr, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length) #Compute Mel-spectrogram
    log_spectrogram = librosa.power_to_db(spectrogram, ref=np.max) #Convert to dB scale

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
    librosa.display.specshow(log_spectrogram, sr=sr, x_axis='time', y_axis='mel')
    plt.colorbar(format='%+2.0f dB')
    plt.title('Mel Spectrogram')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

#Example Usage
generate_spectrogram("audio1.wav")
generate_spectrogram("audio2.wav")
```

This example demonstrates a basic spectrogram generation using fixed parameters.  This approach is suitable when comparing spectrograms of sounds with similar characteristics and durations.  However, for varying durations, the time axis scale will vary.


**Example 2: Spectrogram Generation with Normalized Time Axis:**

```python
import librosa
import librosa.display
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def generate_normalized_spectrogram(audio_file, sr=22050, n_fft=2048, hop_length=512):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, sr=sr)
    spectrogram = librosa.feature.mel_spectrogram(y=y, sr=sr, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length)
    log_spectrogram = librosa.power_to_db(spectrogram, ref=np.max)

    time_axis = librosa.times_like(log_spectrogram, sr=sr, hop_length=hop_length)
    normalized_time = time_axis / time_axis[-1] #Normalize time to 0-1

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
    librosa.display.specshow(log_spectrogram, sr=sr, x_axis=normalized_time, y_axis='mel')
    plt.colorbar(format='%+2.0f dB')
    plt.title('Normalized Mel Spectrogram')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

#Example Usage
generate_normalized_spectrogram("audio1.wav")
generate_normalized_spectrogram("audio2.wav")
```

This improved version normalizes the time axis to a range of 0 to 1, regardless of the audio duration. This makes direct comparison between spectrograms of different lengths easier.


**Example 3:  Parameter Optimization for Consistent Resolution:**

```python
import librosa
import librosa.display
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def generate_consistent_spectrogram(audio_file, sr=22050, target_frames=256):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, sr=sr)
    duration = librosa.get_duration(y=y, sr=sr)
    hop_length = int(duration * sr / target_frames)
    n_fft = hop_length * 2 # common setting

    spectrogram = librosa.feature.mel_spectrogram(y=y, sr=sr, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length)
    log_spectrogram = librosa.power_to_db(spectrogram, ref=np.max)

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
    librosa.display.specshow(log_spectrogram, sr=sr, x_axis='time', y_axis='mel')
    plt.colorbar(format='%+2.0f dB')
    plt.title('Consistent Mel Spectrogram')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Example usage:
generate_consistent_spectrogram("audio1.wav")
generate_consistent_spectrogram("audio2.wav")

```

This example prioritizes consistency in the number of frames in the spectrogram ( `target_frames` ),  ensuring comparable time resolution across different lengths.  The hop length is dynamically adjusted based on the audio duration to achieve this.  While the frequency resolution will change slightly depending on the audio length, the number of time bins remains constant for easier visual comparisons.
