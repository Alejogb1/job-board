The inherent parallelism in neural network computations makes them ideally suited for acceleration via Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).  My experience optimizing large-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition highlighted this fact repeatedly.  The key lies in leveraging the massively parallel architecture of GPUs to perform matrix multiplications and other computationally intensive operations significantly faster than CPUs.  This acceleration is not merely incremental; it can reduce training times from days to hours, or even minutes, depending on the model complexity and dataset size.

**1.  Understanding GPU-Accelerated Neural Network Computation:**

The core of most neural network algorithms involves repeated matrix multiplications.  A typical feedforward network, for instance, calculates the weighted sum of inputs at each neuron, which is a matrix multiplication operation.  Similarly, backpropagation, the crucial step in training, also heavily relies on matrix manipulations.  CPUs, designed for sequential processing, struggle with these massively parallel operations. GPUs, on the other hand, possess thousands of cores capable of performing these operations concurrently.

This inherent parallel nature is exploited through libraries specifically designed for GPU programming.  CUDA (Nvidia's parallel computing platform) and OpenCL (an open standard for parallel programming) provide the necessary tools to offload neural network calculations to the GPU.  These libraries abstract away the low-level details of GPU programming, allowing developers to express computations using familiar programming constructs while letting the library handle the complex task of distributing work across GPU cores.  Furthermore, optimized libraries built upon CUDA and OpenCL, such as cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) and similar frameworks, provide highly tuned routines for common neural network operations, resulting in further performance gains.  My experience involved using cuDNN extensively for its pre-optimized kernels, which dramatically reduced development time and boosted performance.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate GPU acceleration with three examples using Python and PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework which seamlessly integrates with CUDA.  Assume we have a pre-trained model and a batch of input images.


**Example 1: Simple Matrix Multiplication:**

```python
import torch

# Assume 'A' and 'B' are tensors on the GPU
A = torch.randn(1024, 1024, device='cuda')
B = torch.randn(1024, 1024, device='cuda')

# Perform matrix multiplication on the GPU
C = torch.matmul(A, B)

# 'C' now contains the result on the GPU
print(C.device) # Output: cuda:0 (or similar)
```

This simple example demonstrates how PyTorch automatically handles GPU computations when tensors are explicitly placed on the GPU using `device='cuda'`.  The `matmul` function, optimized by PyTorch's underlying libraries (often leveraging cuDNN), performs the multiplication efficiently on the GPU.  This avoids explicit CUDA kernel writing, simplifying development.  In my work, Iâ€™ve used this approach extensively for prototyping and testing before moving on to more complex scenarios.

**Example 2:  Convolutional Layer Forward Pass:**

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch

# Define a convolutional layer
conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1).cuda() # Move to GPU

# Assume 'x' is a batch of images on the GPU
x = torch.randn(16, 3, 224, 224, device='cuda')

# Perform forward pass on the GPU
output = conv_layer(x)

# 'output' will be the result of the convolution, also on the GPU
print(output.device) # Output: cuda:0 (or similar)
```

This example showcases GPU acceleration within a convolutional layer.  The `cuda()` call explicitly moves the convolutional layer to the GPU.  PyTorch's automatic differentiation and CUDA integration handle the computationally intensive convolution operation efficiently on the GPU.  I found this approach to be incredibly efficient for large datasets and complex CNN architectures.  During my work on a real-time object detection project,  this was crucial in achieving satisfactory frame rates.

**Example 3:  Training a Neural Network with GPU Acceleration:**


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... Define your model, loss function, and optimizer ...

model = MyModel().cuda() # Move model to GPU
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss().cuda() # Move loss function to GPU
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
        inputs, labels = inputs.cuda(), labels.cuda() # Move data to GPU
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

This demonstrates GPU acceleration during the entire training process.  The model, loss function, and data are all moved to the GPU.  Backpropagation and parameter updates happen on the GPU, significantly speeding up the training process. The `train_loader` is assumed to be a PyTorch DataLoader which can handle data loading and transfer to the GPU concurrently. During a project involving a very deep recurrent network, this efficient data transfer and computation was essential for timely completion of training.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration, I recommend delving into the documentation for CUDA, OpenCL, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.  These frameworks provide comprehensive guides and tutorials on GPU programming for deep learning.  Understanding linear algebra and parallel computing concepts will also greatly aid in utilizing GPUs effectively.  Furthermore, exploring specialized hardware and software solutions tailored for deep learning, such as NVIDIA's Tensor Cores, can further enhance performance.  Finally, practical experience through working on projects and optimizing existing codebases is invaluable.
