Unified Memory in CUDA, specifically its behavior regarding page eviction and CPU access, presents a nuanced situation often misunderstood. I’ve encountered this directly while optimizing large-scale simulations across multiple GPUs in a distributed environment. The observation that unified memory pages, frequently accessed by the CPU, are not evicted from the GPU cache requires a careful look into the design and implementation of CUDA's memory management. This behavior stems from a performance optimization trade-off: prioritizing GPU-side access speed over strict memory consistency, especially within the context of a single device.

The core principle behind unified memory is to present a single, coherent address space that can be accessed by both the CPU and the GPU. This eliminates the explicit data transfers that were formerly mandatory with traditional CUDA memory models, resulting in a more streamlined development workflow. However, this ‘unified’ access is not achieved by direct, simultaneous access to shared physical RAM. Instead, CUDA utilizes a demand-paging system behind the scenes. This means memory pages, typically 4KB in size, are migrated between system RAM and GPU DRAM only when accessed. Crucially, the GPU holds a cached copy of these pages in its faster, local DRAM.

When the CPU accesses a unified memory page that currently resides in the GPU's DRAM cache, the typical expectation might be that the page is evicted, or at least flagged for eviction, to ensure CPU access speeds are not bottlenecked by the slower, bus-bound communication with the GPU. However, this is not the case. The page will remain in the GPU DRAM. There are several reasons for this design decision, all centering around performance and access patterns.

Firstly, in many typical CUDA applications, GPU access dominates, or at least significantly outweighs, CPU access to shared memory. Applications involving heavy computations, scientific simulations, image processing, or machine learning inferencing spend the majority of their time executing GPU kernels. Consequently, the likelihood that a given memory page will be reused soon by the GPU after its initial access is relatively high. Evicting the page and transferring it back to system RAM only to potentially need it again immediately is a costly process, involving latency from PCI bus transfers. Maintaining the page in the GPU cache, even when the CPU reads from it, generally maximizes overall performance.

Secondly, the CUDA runtime implements sophisticated page-fault handling and demand paging management. When a CPU reads from a unified memory page that’s residing in GPU memory, the page is automatically and implicitly transferred back to host memory. The access does not trigger an immediate invalidation on the GPU side and doesn't necessarily lead to its eviction. The runtime manages coherency and updates based on the page's access patterns, rather than through strict invalidation protocols. This "lazy" approach ensures that pages which are frequently accessed only on one side are not constantly ping-ponging between system RAM and GPU DRAM, reducing bus traffic and latency. The copy-back operation during a CPU access effectively means the CPU gets a synchronized version, but the cached version on the GPU remains, ready for GPU usage.

Finally, and perhaps counter-intuitively, keeping the data on the GPU is beneficial even when the CPU is actively writing to the memory region. The CPU does not automatically write the changes back to the GPU memory location. Subsequent GPU read accesses will implicitly transfer updated pages. The CPU-write is cached in system RAM until the next GPU read, which also ensures efficient usage of bus bandwidth. Furthermore, the GPU cache management is highly specialized and more optimized for its computational workloads. Maintaining consistency by frequently evicting pages on CPU access would require significant overhead and could interfere with existing GPU cache mechanisms designed for optimal GPU kernel performance.

Let's explore these concepts through code. Here's an example of allocating and accessing unified memory:

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int *unified_ptr;
    size_t num_elements = 1024;
    size_t size = num_elements * sizeof(int);

    cudaMallocManaged(&unified_ptr, size); // Unified memory allocation

    // Initialize on the CPU
    for(int i = 0; i < num_elements; ++i) {
        unified_ptr[i] = i;
    }

    // Launch a GPU kernel that uses unified memory
    int *device_ptr = unified_ptr; // Device pointer for the GPU
    
    cudaDeviceSynchronize(); // Wait for initialization
    
    // Simulate a CPU access later
    std::cout << "CPU: Value at unified_ptr[0]: " << unified_ptr[0] << std::endl;
  
   // Wait for CPU read to complete
   cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    cudaFree(unified_ptr);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the memory is allocated as unified. The CPU initializes the data. If the GPU accessed `unified_ptr` at this point via a kernel call, the initial data will be migrated to GPU memory. Even when the CPU subsequently accesses `unified_ptr[0]` and prints the value, the original GPU copy of the page containing that index remains on the GPU. No eviction occurs simply because the CPU read from memory.

Here's another example showcasing the implicit data transfers:

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void kernel(int* data) {
    int index = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if(index < 1024)
    {
      data[index] += 1;
    }
}


int main() {
    int *unified_ptr;
    size_t num_elements = 1024;
    size_t size = num_elements * sizeof(int);
    
    cudaMallocManaged(&unified_ptr, size);

    for (int i=0; i<num_elements; i++)
        unified_ptr[i] = i;

    // Launch the kernel which modifies data
    kernel<<< (num_elements + 255)/256, 256>>>(unified_ptr);

    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    
    std::cout << "CPU access before kernel: " << unified_ptr[0] << std::endl;

    for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; ++i) {
      unified_ptr[i] = i * 2;
    }
    
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    
     std::cout << "CPU access after update: " << unified_ptr[0] << std::endl;
    
    kernel<<< (num_elements + 255)/256, 256>>>(unified_ptr);
    
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    
     std::cout << "CPU access after second kernel: " << unified_ptr[0] << std::endl;
     

    cudaFree(unified_ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

In this expanded example, after the kernel execution, the CPU immediately accesses the modified data. Subsequently, the CPU further updates the data in a loop. The GPU kernel will pull updated values when it's invoked for the second time. The GPU does not perform writes after every change. These changes occur via implicit memory transfers at access time. The original data accessed on the GPU remains, as it's in the cached, faster GPU memory. Finally, a simplified example illustrating the write-back process to the CPU:

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void gpu_write(int* data) {
    int index = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if(index == 0)
    {
      data[0] = 42; // GPU writing to unified memory
    }
}


int main() {
    int *unified_ptr;
    size_t num_elements = 1024;
    size_t size = num_elements * sizeof(int);
    
    cudaMallocManaged(&unified_ptr, size);

    unified_ptr[0] = 0;
    std::cout << "CPU before kernel: " << unified_ptr[0] << std::endl;

    gpu_write<<<1, 1>>>(unified_ptr);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    
    std::cout << "CPU after kernel: " << unified_ptr[0] << std::endl;

    cudaFree(unified_ptr);
    return 0;
}

```

Here, the GPU writes to the first element of the unified memory. Although the CPU has accessed this memory previously, the change made by the GPU is only propagated to the CPU when the program reads the unified memory again. This delay is a key characteristic of the copy on access methodology. The GPU does not automatically update any data on a CPU-side read; it remains in the GPU's cached memory unless the GPU itself requests an update from the host.

For further learning, I recommend exploring resources on CUDA performance optimization, particularly the specifics of unified memory management. NVIDIA’s developer documentation is invaluable for precise understanding. Books dedicated to GPU programming offer deeper insights into low-level memory structures and how unified memory interacts with them. Additionally, case studies of CUDA applications can reveal practical nuances of unified memory in real-world scenarios. These combined resources will provide a complete understanding of CUDA unified memory behavior.
