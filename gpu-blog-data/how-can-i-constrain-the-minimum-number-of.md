The standard 0/1 knapsack problem allows for the selection of any number of items, including zero.  Imposing a minimum selection constraint significantly alters the problem's complexity and necessitates a modification of the dynamic programming approach commonly employed.  My experience working on resource allocation optimization problems within the context of large-scale logistics networks has directly highlighted this distinction.  Simply adding a constraint on the minimum number of items selected doesn't merely translate to a simple addition to the base algorithm; rather, it requires a fundamental restructuring to account for all valid solution spaces.

**1.  Explanation:**

The core of solving the 0/1 knapsack problem with a minimum selection constraint lies in recognizing that the standard dynamic programming approach only considers the maximum value achievable for *any* number of items up to the total number of available items. We need to adapt this to explicitly exclude solutions where the number of selected items falls below the specified minimum. This is achieved by modifying the initialization and recursive relationship within the dynamic programming table.

Let's define:

* `n`: The number of items.
* `W`: The maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.
* `w[i]`: The weight of item `i`.
* `v[i]`: The value of item `i`.
* `k`: The minimum number of items to be selected.

The standard dynamic programming solution constructs a table `dp[i][w]`, where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value achievable using the first `i` items and a maximum weight of `w`. The crucial difference with the minimum selection constraint lies in the initialization and the recursive step.

The initialization remains mostly standard, except we set all values in the first `k` columns of the first row to negative infinity (`-∞`) because it's impossible to achieve a valid solution with fewer than `k` items. This represents an infeasible solution.

The recursive relationship is then modified as follows:


`dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w - w[i]] + v[i])`  (if `w >= w[i]`)

This formula remains, selecting the maximum between not including item `i` and including it. However, only values where the number of items selected is at least `k` are considered valid solutions.  This is implicitly handled in the adapted code examples below.  The final answer will be the maximum value in the last row of the `dp` table, provided that value is not negative infinity; otherwise no solution exists satisfying the minimum selection constraint.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following Python code demonstrates three approaches to handling this constraint.  Note that these implementations are optimized for clarity and understanding rather than absolute computational efficiency.  In real-world scenarios, further optimizations may be required for large datasets.

**Example 1:  Direct Modification of Dynamic Programming**

```python
def knapsack_min_items(n, W, w, v, k):
    dp = [([-float('inf')] * (W + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(W + 1):
        dp[0][i] = -float('inf')

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(W + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            if j >= w[i-1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j - w[i-1]] + v[i-1])

    max_value = -float('inf')
    for j in range(W + 1):
        count = 0
        value = 0
        temp_weight = j
        for i in range(n,0,-1):
          if dp[i][temp_weight] > dp[i-1][temp_weight]:
            count+=1
            value += v[i-1]
            temp_weight -= w[i-1]
        if count >= k and value > max_value:
          max_value = value

    return max_value if max_value > -float('inf') else None


# Example usage
n = 5
W = 10
w = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
v = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k = 2
result = knapsack_min_items(n, W, w, v, k)
print(f"Maximum value with at least {k} items: {result}")
```

This implementation directly modifies the standard DP table, incorporating the infeasible solution representation. The post-processing step ensures only solutions meeting the minimum item count are considered.

**Example 2: Branch and Bound (Conceptual Outline)**

A Branch and Bound approach can also be applied.  Instead of constructing a full DP table, it explores the solution space, pruning branches that cannot lead to a feasible solution. The constraint on minimum items is enforced at each node of the search tree. While I have not implemented a full Branch and Bound solution here due to space constraints, I can outline the key modifications: at each step, the algorithm would track the number of items selected; branches violating the minimum items constraint would be immediately pruned.

**Example 3: Integer Linear Programming (Conceptual Outline)**

Formulation as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) provides another solution. The ILP formulation would include a constraint enforcing a minimum number of selected items in addition to the standard weight and value constraints.  This is generally handled by using an additional constraint:  `Σxᵢ >= k`, where `xᵢ` are binary variables representing whether item `i` is included (1) or not (0).   Solver libraries such as those provided in Python's `scipy.optimize` or commercial solvers like CPLEX or Gurobi can then be used to find an optimal solution. The implementation details depend on the chosen solver, but the core modeling remains the same.

In my experience, choosing the most suitable approach (dynamic programming, branch and bound, or ILP) depends heavily on the problem size and the specific characteristics of the input data. For relatively small problems, dynamic programming remains efficient.  However, for larger instances, Branch and Bound or ILP, especially when using efficient commercial solvers, often demonstrate superior performance.  Careful consideration of the computational trade-offs is crucial in determining the optimal strategy for the constraint minimum number of objects selected in the knapsack problem.
