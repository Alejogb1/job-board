The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values during hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner, while training without it proceeds normally, often stems from an interplay between the search space definition and the inherent instability of certain model architectures or optimizers under specific hyperparameter configurations.  In my experience optimizing complex convolutional neural networks for image segmentation, I've encountered this issue repeatedly. The root cause is seldom a single, easily identifiable bug but rather a confluence of factors demanding a systematic investigation.


**1. Explanation of NaN Occurrence During Keras Tuner Optimization**

Keras Tuner explores a defined hyperparameter search space, often using algorithms like Bayesian Optimization or random search.  Each trial involves creating and training a model with a unique hyperparameter combination sampled from this space.  If the search space includes parameters that destabilize the training process—for example, excessively high learning rates, inappropriate weight initialization schemes for a particular activation function, or poorly scaled input data—the model's loss function may diverge, leading to NaN values.  This divergence isn't immediate; it often manifests after several training epochs.  In contrast, when training a model with pre-defined hyperparameters (without tuning), you have complete control, likely selecting a stable configuration validated through prior experimentation.  The tuner, however, is exploring a wider range, increasing the probability of encountering unstable settings.

Furthermore, the evaluation metrics used within the Keras Tuner callback are crucial.  If the chosen metric itself can produce NaN values under certain circumstances (e.g., division by zero in a custom metric), this will propagate through the tuning process, leading to premature termination of trials or the accumulation of NaN values in the results.

The problem is exacerbated by the potentially short training epochs employed during hyperparameter tuning to conserve computational resources.  A model might exhibit instability only after many epochs, a situation the tuner might miss because its evaluation is performed on prematurely stopped training.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

**Example 1:  Unstable Learning Rate**

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def build_model(hp):
    model = keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=512, step=32),
                     activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    hp_learning_rate = hp.Choice('learning_rate', values=[1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4]) #Potentially problematic range
    model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=hp_learning_rate),
                  loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
    return model

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(build_model,
                        objective='mae',
                        max_trials=5,
                        directory='my_dir',
                        project_name='test_project')

tuner.search_space_summary()
tuner.search(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
```

This example demonstrates a potential issue with the learning rate.  A learning rate of 1e-2 might be too high for this specific model and dataset, leading to instability and NaN values during some trials.  Narrowing the search space or using a more sophisticated learning rate scheduler could mitigate this.

**Example 2:  Data Scaling Issues**

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# ... (model definition similar to Example 1) ...

#Unscaled data: potential for instability
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10) * 1000  
y_train = np.random.rand(1000, 1) * 1000

#... (tuner definition similar to Example 1) ...
```

This showcases the impact of unscaled data.  Extreme values in the input features can destabilize the optimization process, particularly with certain activation functions (like sigmoid or tanh) or optimizers sensitive to input magnitude.  Preprocessing the data with standardization or normalization before tuning is crucial.

**Example 3:  Custom Loss Function Issues**

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.math.abs(y_true - y_pred) / tf.abs(y_true)) #Potential division by zero

def build_model(hp):
    # ... (model definition similar to Example 1) ...
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss, metrics=['mae'])
    return model

#... (tuner definition similar to Example 1) ...
```

This example uses a custom loss function prone to producing NaN values if `y_true` contains zeros.  This demonstrates the importance of robust metric design.  Careful consideration of edge cases and appropriate handling of potential errors (e.g., adding a small epsilon to the denominator) are essential.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

Consult the official Keras Tuner documentation for detailed explanations of hyperparameter search algorithms and best practices.  Explore advanced topics like learning rate schedulers, weight initialization strategies, and regularization techniques.  Familiarize yourself with debugging strategies for TensorFlow/Keras models, including the use of TensorBoard for monitoring training progress and identifying potential sources of instability. Study the impact of different optimizers on model stability and convergence behavior.  Finally, explore literature on numerical stability in machine learning, focusing on the challenges associated with floating-point arithmetic.  Careful examination of your data preprocessing steps and the selection of activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions is critical for ensuring robust and stable training, both during hyperparameter tuning and standard model training.
