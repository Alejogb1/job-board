My experience working with custom training loops in TensorFlow revealed a subtlety in Keras’s default behavior that often causes confusion: the automatic averaging of loss values across batches within an epoch. This averaging, while generally beneficial for monitoring training progress, can obscure true per-batch loss dynamics and complicate specific research scenarios. The core issue is that Keras's `model.fit()` (and similar high-level abstractions) inherently compute and display the *mean* loss and metrics over all batches within an epoch. This can mask critical per-batch fluctuations or introduce unintended smoothing effects when these individual variations matter, such as in adversarial training or when analyzing convergence behavior with high variance gradients. To effectively remove this averaging, the most direct route involves sidestepping the high-level training API and utilizing a lower-level, manual training loop.

The Keras API, particularly when used with `model.compile` and `model.fit`, handles batch-level computations and accumulates them implicitly. When a loss is passed to `model.compile`, the framework automatically builds the averaging mechanism behind the scenes. Thus, the reported loss after each epoch is the average loss of all the batches in that epoch, rather than an array of losses for individual batches.  This is implemented by accumulating the loss per batch and dividing by the number of batches at the end of the epoch. Removing this requires using raw gradients and updating model parameters via a custom loop, as well as removing the loss from the default compile.

Below, I demonstrate three code examples that accomplish this, each with increasing sophistication. I'm using TensorFlow 2.x for these examples.

**Example 1: Basic Manual Training Loop without Loss Averaging**

This example demonstrates the most elementary manual training loop, stripping away all implicit loss averaging. The key idea is to iterate over batches of data, perform a forward pass, calculate the loss, compute gradients, and apply the updates to the model's parameters directly.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample Model and Data
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Dummy data
data = np.random.randn(1000, 20)
labels = np.random.randn(1000, 1)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels)).batch(32)

# Manual training loop
epochs = 2
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for step, (x_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(dataset):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            logits = model(x_batch)
            loss_value = loss_fn(y_batch, logits)

        grads = tape.gradient(loss_value, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
        print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Batch: {step}, Loss: {loss_value.numpy():.4f}")

```
In this example, I create a simple linear regression model, a dataset, and an Adam optimizer. The core of the example resides within the nested loops, where I iterate over epochs and batches. I use a `tf.GradientTape` to automatically record operations for gradient calculation. Critically, the calculated `loss_value` within this loop is the *actual* loss for *that specific batch*, without any further averaging. It is this `loss_value` that I print each step.  This approach reveals per-batch variability in training loss, something that `model.fit` hides. Note that metrics, validation, and other complexities associated with `model.fit` are absent here – they would need explicit implementation.

**Example 2: Incorporating Metric Tracking**

While removing loss averaging is the primary aim, we often require metrics to assess training efficacy. This example integrates metric computation into the loop.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample Model, Optimizer, Loss Function, Dataset as in Example 1
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

data = np.random.randn(1000, 20)
labels = np.random.randn(1000, 1)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels)).batch(32)

# Metric for tracking
mae_metric = tf.keras.metrics.MeanAbsoluteError()


# Manual training loop
epochs = 2
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for step, (x_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(dataset):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            logits = model(x_batch)
            loss_value = loss_fn(y_batch, logits)

        grads = tape.gradient(loss_value, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
        mae_metric.update_state(y_batch, logits)  # Update metric

        print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Batch: {step}, Loss: {loss_value.numpy():.4f}, MAE: {mae_metric.result().numpy():.4f}")

    mae_metric.reset_state()  # Reset metric for next epoch
```

Here, I introduce `tf.keras.metrics.MeanAbsoluteError` and track this value. The critical addition is `mae_metric.update_state(y_batch, logits)`, which updates the metric's internal state *for each batch*.  Subsequently, `mae_metric.result().numpy()` provides the *average* mean absolute error over all batches processed *up to that point* in the epoch.  Crucially, it does not average across epochs. I also include a `reset_state()` at the end of each epoch to prepare the metric for the subsequent epoch.  This demonstrates how to use metrics while avoiding the averaging of loss values.

**Example 3: Custom Loss Function and Granular Loss Analysis**

This example goes one step further and uses a custom loss function that could be designed to track each element's loss and avoid its implicit batch mean calculation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


# Sample Model, Optimizer, Dataset as in Example 1
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

data = np.random.randn(1000, 20)
labels = np.random.randn(1000, 1)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels)).batch(32)

# Custom loss function that returns losses per example
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.square(y_true - y_pred)

# Manual training loop
epochs = 2
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for step, (x_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(dataset):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            logits = model(x_batch)
            loss_values = custom_loss(y_batch, logits)
            batch_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss_values)  # Mean for the gradient
        grads = tape.gradient(batch_loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
        
        print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Batch: {step}, Example Losses: {loss_values.numpy()}")

```

Here, I defined a custom loss function, `custom_loss`. The `custom_loss` calculates the loss per individual sample within a batch, returning a *vector* of losses, rather than a scalar batch loss. This demonstrates fine grained tracking of example-wise loss. Although the gradient application happens on the mean loss, the individual loss value per example is output during training. This highlights the flexibility of manual loops and custom metrics for advanced research tasks. The `tf.reduce_mean(loss_values)` aggregates the values in order to use them for gradient calculations. It is crucial to return a single scalar for backpropagation.

These examples provide a foundation for manipulating loss handling in Keras. They illustrate how to achieve granular control over both loss and metrics. Moving away from `model.fit` requires more coding but grants greater flexibility.  For anyone delving deep into model behavior, or needing batch-specific loss access, these techniques are essential.

For further study, I suggest researching custom training loops using TensorFlow's lower-level APIs directly, examining TensorFlow's guide on custom loss function implementation, and exploring research articles on adversarial training as well as  gradient manipulation techniques, as these scenarios often necessitate the kind of fine-grained control discussed here. Examining advanced Keras examples that deal with specific types of gradients is also useful.
