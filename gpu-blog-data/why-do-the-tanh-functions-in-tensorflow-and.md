The observed discrepancies between TensorFlow's and PyTorch's `tanh` implementations stem primarily from subtle differences in numerical precision handling and, less frequently, underlying hardware-specific optimizations.  In my experience debugging performance discrepancies across deep learning frameworks, I've encountered this issue multiple times, particularly when dealing with extremely large models or datasets where minute numerical deviations can accumulate and lead to significant downstream effects.  While both frameworks aim for mathematical equivalence, their internal implementations can subtly diverge, impacting the final output, especially in edge cases involving extreme input values or those approaching the limits of floating-point representation.

**1. Explanation:**

The core function, the hyperbolic tangent, is defined mathematically as `tanh(x) = (e^x - e^-x) / (e^x + e^-x)`.  Both TensorFlow and PyTorch aim to compute this function accurately. However, the internal algorithms used to achieve this – typically involving approximations optimized for speed and numerical stability – are not identical. TensorFlow's implementation might leverage a particular optimized library or employ a different approximation strategy compared to PyTorch's implementation.  These differences, while seemingly insignificant at first glance, become relevant when considering the finite precision of floating-point arithmetic.  Floating-point numbers, being representations of real numbers with limited precision, can introduce small errors in calculations.  The accumulation of these errors across multiple operations within the `tanh` function’s internal implementation – particularly in the exponential calculations – can lead to observable disparities between the two frameworks.  Furthermore, hardware-specific optimizations, such as those utilizing SIMD instructions (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), can introduce further variations, particularly when different CPU architectures or specialized hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs) are utilized.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples highlight the potential for subtle differences.  Note that the magnitude of the discrepancy can vary depending on the input value and hardware.  The results presented are illustrative and may differ slightly on different systems.

**Example 1:  Typical Input Range**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import torch

x = tf.constant(1.0)
x_torch = torch.tensor(1.0)

tf_tanh = tf.tanh(x).numpy()
torch_tanh = torch.tanh(x_torch).numpy()

print(f"TensorFlow tanh(1.0): {tf_tanh}")
print(f"PyTorch tanh(1.0): {torch_tanh}")
print(f"Difference: {tf_tanh - torch_tanh}")
```

This example uses a typical input value within the range where both implementations generally agree closely. The difference will be minor, possibly within the tolerance of floating-point precision.

**Example 2:  Near-Zero Input**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import torch
import numpy as np

x = tf.constant(1e-10)
x_torch = torch.tensor(1e-10)

tf_tanh = tf.tanh(x).numpy()
torch_tanh = torch.tanh(x_torch).numpy()

print(f"TensorFlow tanh(1e-10): {tf_tanh}")
print(f"PyTorch tanh(1e-10): {torch_tanh}")
print(f"Difference: {tf_tanh - torch_tanh}")

#Further investigation near zero might show slight discrepancies due to different approximation methods
#around 0.  In my experience, Taylor series expansion approximations will vary subtly.
```

Inputs near zero can reveal subtle differences due to different approximation methods used for small values.  Taylor series expansions, often employed for efficiency near zero, may have slightly different truncation points or coefficients.  The discrepancy here is still likely small, but observable.


**Example 3:  Extreme Input Value**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import torch
import numpy as np

x = tf.constant(100.0)
x_torch = torch.tensor(100.0)

tf_tanh = tf.tanh(x).numpy()
torch_tanh = torch.tanh(x_torch).numpy()

print(f"TensorFlow tanh(100.0): {tf_tanh}")
print(f"PyTorch tanh(100.0): {torch_tanh}")
print(f"Difference: {tf_tanh - torch_tanh}")

# For large inputs, the difference can be slightly higher due to the limitations of floating point
# representation and the exponential function's behaviour with large arguments.  
# I've encountered this issue when using very large batch sizes and highly sensitive loss functions.
```

With extreme input values, the discrepancies might become more pronounced.  This is because the exponential function's growth for large arguments can exceed the floating-point representation's precision, leading to more significant rounding errors within the `tanh` function's calculation.  These accumulated errors are amplified in the subtraction and division operations of the `tanh` definition.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official documentation of both TensorFlow and PyTorch concerning the numerical accuracy and implementation details of their respective mathematical functions.  Furthermore, exploring academic papers on numerical computation and the implementation of elementary functions within high-performance computing libraries would provide valuable insights into the underlying complexities.  Finally, review materials on floating-point arithmetic and its limitations would be extremely beneficial.  Studying the source code (if available and accessible) of the respective libraries can reveal specific implementation details, though it requires a significant level of expertise in C++ or other languages used in these frameworks.
