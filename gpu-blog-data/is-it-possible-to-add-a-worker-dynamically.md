Dynamic worker addition is fundamentally dependent on the underlying architecture of your task processing system.  My experience across numerous large-scale data processing pipelines has shown that while the concept is straightforward, the practical implementation necessitates careful consideration of several factors, particularly concerning thread management, inter-process communication, and resource contention.  It's not a simple yes or no answer; the feasibility hinges on your chosen methodology.


**1.  Explanation: Architectural Considerations**

The possibility of dynamically adding workers is largely determined by your system's design.  In a single-threaded application, dynamic worker addition is effectively impossible without significant restructuring â€“ you are inherently limited to a single execution thread.  However, systems designed for concurrency, such as those employing multithreading or multiprocessing, offer avenues for dynamic scaling.

Multithreading, utilizing libraries like `threading` in Python or similar constructs in other languages, allows for the creation of new threads within the existing process. This approach is relatively lightweight but is constrained by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, limiting true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.  Dynamic addition here involves creating and starting new threads on demand, often triggered by an event like a queue reaching a certain threshold or a new task arriving.

Multiprocessing, using libraries like `multiprocessing` in Python, provides greater parallelism by creating separate processes.  Each process has its own memory space, bypassing the GIL limitations.  Dynamic worker addition in this context involves spawning new processes as needed.  This is more resource-intensive but offers greater scalability for CPU-bound tasks.

Finally, distributed systems, which distribute tasks across multiple machines, offer the highest degree of scalability.  In such systems, dynamic worker addition translates to adding new nodes or workers to the cluster, often managed by a task scheduler or resource manager.  This requires robust mechanisms for task assignment, load balancing, and fault tolerance.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Dynamic Thread Addition in Python (Illustrative)**

```python
import threading
import queue

task_queue = queue.Queue()
worker_count = 0

def worker_function():
    global worker_count
    worker_id = worker_count
    worker_count += 1
    print(f"Worker {worker_id}: Started")
    while True:
        try:
            task = task_queue.get(timeout=1) # timeout to avoid indefinite blocking
            #Process task
            print(f"Worker {worker_id}: Processing task {task}")
            task_queue.task_done()
        except queue.Empty:
            print(f"Worker {worker_id}: No tasks found, exiting.")
            break

def add_worker():
    new_worker = threading.Thread(target=worker_function)
    new_worker.start()
    print("New worker added.")


# Add initial workers
for _ in range(2):
    add_worker()

#Simulate tasks arriving
for i in range(10):
  task_queue.put(i)

#Add more workers based on load (Illustrative - replace with actual load monitoring)
if task_queue.qsize() > 5:
    add_worker()

task_queue.join() #Wait for all tasks to be completed
print("All tasks completed.")
```

This example demonstrates a basic mechanism.  The `add_worker` function dynamically creates and starts new threads.  A more robust implementation would incorporate load balancing and a smarter approach to determining when to add or remove workers.  Error handling and thread termination mechanisms are also crucial for production-ready code.


**Example 2: Dynamic Process Addition in Python (Illustrative)**

```python
import multiprocessing
import queue

task_queue = multiprocessing.Queue()
worker_count = 0

def worker_function(task_queue, worker_id):
    print(f"Worker {worker_id}: Started")
    while True:
        try:
            task = task_queue.get(timeout=1)
            #Process task
            print(f"Worker {worker_id}: Processing task {task}")
            task_queue.task_done()
        except queue.Empty:
            print(f"Worker {worker_id}: No tasks found, exiting.")
            break


def add_worker(task_queue):
    global worker_count
    worker_id = worker_count
    worker_count += 1
    new_worker = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker_function, args=(task_queue, worker_id))
    new_worker.start()
    print("New worker added.")

# Add initial workers
for _ in range(2):
    add_worker(task_queue)

#Simulate tasks arriving
for i in range(10):
    task_queue.put(i)

# Add more workers based on queue size
if task_queue.qsize() > 5:
    add_worker(task_queue)

task_queue.join()
print("All tasks completed.")

```

This utilizes multiprocessing, removing the GIL limitation.  The core logic remains similar to the threading example, but processes are spawned instead of threads.  This offers better scalability but comes with increased overhead for inter-process communication.


**Example 3:  Conceptual Distributed System Addition (Illustrative)**

The implementation of dynamic worker addition in a distributed system is significantly more complex and would depend heavily on the specific framework used (e.g., Apache Spark, Hadoop YARN, Kubernetes). A simplified illustration would involve a central scheduler monitoring resource utilization and task queues. Upon detecting a load increase exceeding a predefined threshold, the scheduler would provision new workers on available nodes within the cluster, assigning them tasks from the queue. This would involve intricate coordination using message queues, distributed databases, and robust error handling mechanisms for worker failures and network interruptions. The specific code would be highly framework-dependent and beyond the scope of this concise response.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend exploring publications on concurrent and distributed systems, texts on operating systems, and the documentation for specific task scheduling and distributed computing frameworks.  Examining source code of established task processing systems can provide valuable practical insights.  Understanding queuing theory is crucial for optimal resource allocation and load balancing in dynamically scaling systems.  Furthermore, books focusing on performance optimization and concurrency patterns are invaluable.  Finally, gaining familiarity with different inter-process communication mechanisms is vital for constructing robust and efficient dynamically scaling systems.
