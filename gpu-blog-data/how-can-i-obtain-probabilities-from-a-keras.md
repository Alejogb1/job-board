The core challenge in extracting probabilities from a Keras classification model stems from the fact that the raw output of most neural network layers, particularly the dense layers, is a set of logits, not probabilities. These logits are unbounded real numbers representing the model's confidence in each class before the application of an activation function that translates them to a probabilistic space. Directly interpreting these logits as probabilities will lead to incorrect conclusions.

To obtain genuine probabilities, we need to apply an appropriate activation function to the output layer of our Keras model. For multi-class classification, the standard approach is to employ the softmax activation. The softmax function transforms a vector of logits into a probability distribution, ensuring each value is between 0 and 1 and all values sum to 1. In binary classification, the sigmoid function fulfills a similar role, outputting a single probability representing the likelihood of the positive class.

Let's illustrate with a series of examples. I've worked extensively with custom image classification pipelines in the past, and these scenarios represent fairly common use cases I've encountered.

**Example 1: Multi-class Classification with Softmax**

Imagine we've trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into three distinct categories: 'cat', 'dog', and 'bird'. The final dense layer, named 'dense_final', has three nodes representing these classes. Without modification, the `model.predict()` method will output the logits. Here's how to extract probabilities using the softmax activation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Sample model architecture for demonstration
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 3)), # Example input shape
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(3, name='dense_final') # Output layer, no activation
])

# Sample input data
sample_image = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 3)

# Prediction without softmax
raw_output = model.predict(sample_image)
print(f"Raw logits output: {raw_output}")

# Apply softmax to the output layer
probability_model = keras.Sequential([model, keras.layers.Softmax()])
probabilities = probability_model.predict(sample_image)
print(f"Probabilities with softmax: {probabilities}")

# Verify that the probabilities sum to 1 (approximately)
print(f"Sum of probabilities: {np.sum(probabilities)}")
```

**Commentary:**

Here, `model` represents a basic CNN culminating in a dense layer named 'dense_final' without any inherent activation. The `raw_output` directly shows the logit values that are output by this layer. To obtain proper probabilities, we build a new `probability_model` by sequentially appending a `Softmax` layer to our original model. This is crucial for ensuring the output represents a probability distribution. The output of this model, `probabilities`, will contain the likelihood of each class. It's good practice to verify that the sum of these probabilities is close to one, confirming correct transformation into a proper probability distribution. The `name` parameter helps to understand which layer we're manipulating. In a more complex model, using layer names becomes important for pinpointing specific layers.

**Example 2: Multi-label Classification with Sigmoid**

Now, consider a scenario where the same image can be assigned to multiple labels. For example, in an image tagging system, a picture might contain both "cat" and "indoors." In such cases, we cannot use softmax, as it enforces a single label assignment. Instead, we use sigmoid activation independently on each output node.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Sample model for multi-label classification
model_multi_label = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 3)),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(2, name='dense_final_multi') # Output layer with two labels
])

# Sample input data
sample_image = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 3)

# Prediction without sigmoid
raw_output_multi = model_multi_label.predict(sample_image)
print(f"Raw logits output (multi-label): {raw_output_multi}")

# Apply sigmoid to obtain independent probabilities for each label
probability_model_multi = keras.Sequential([
    model_multi_label,
    keras.layers.Activation('sigmoid') # Important to explicitly use 'Activation' layer
])
probabilities_multi = probability_model_multi.predict(sample_image)
print(f"Probabilities with sigmoid (multi-label): {probabilities_multi}")

```

**Commentary:**

Here the `model_multi_label` produces logits for two output nodes. Critically, we append a `keras.layers.Activation('sigmoid')` layer to transform the output.  Sigmoid ensures that each value, representing a separate label probability, is between 0 and 1, independently of the other outputs. The `Activation` layer must be used in tandem with specifying the sigmoid function within it. Using the raw `tf.sigmoid` function itself would be problematic because it wouldn't properly integrate into the Keras model's computational graph. This highlights a common pitfall: directly using `tf` functions within a Keras model without careful consideration of how these functions interact within the model framework.

**Example 3: Direct Softmax in Model Definition**

It is often cleaner to directly apply the activation function within the model definition. This approach eliminates the need for creating a separate probability model and clarifies the model's architecture.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Model with softmax included directly
model_softmax_direct = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 3)),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax', name='dense_final_direct') # Softmax included here
])

# Sample input data
sample_image = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 3)

# Prediction directly with the model
probabilities_direct = model_softmax_direct.predict(sample_image)
print(f"Probabilities (direct softmax): {probabilities_direct}")

# Verify that the probabilities sum to 1 (approximately)
print(f"Sum of probabilities (direct softmax): {np.sum(probabilities_direct)}")

```

**Commentary:**

In this final example, the `softmax` activation is directly specified within the definition of the final `Dense` layer. This yields cleaner and more direct control over the output.  This is the best approach for most use-cases as itâ€™s simpler and self-documenting. The output is already probabilities, making model usage and interpretation more straightforward. This model, when using `model.predict()`, will directly output a probability distribution. It's generally preferable to configure the output layer to include the required activation when the model is created to streamline model usage.

**Resource Recommendations**

For in-depth understanding, exploring the Keras documentation concerning layers and activations is essential. Additionally, reviewing introductory texts on machine learning with a focus on neural networks will clarify the purpose of activation functions, particularly softmax and sigmoid. A solid grounding in mathematical concepts related to probability will enhance the proper interpretation of these output values. Furthermore, working through several model construction exercises involving classification (both multi-class and multi-label) will solidify understanding. Lastly, practicing with different datasets and output layers is vital to develop practical proficiency.
