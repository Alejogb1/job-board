RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) models, unlike sequence-to-sequence models with attention, are prone to skipping initial portions of an utterance, a problem often exacerbated in low-resource or noisy environments. This occurs because the model's alignment mechanism, responsible for deciding when to emit a token, is conditioned on the *past* encoder states and *past* decoder outputs. Therefore, the model may not have accumulated sufficient context to begin predicting tokens at the beginning of the audio input.

Specifically, the RNN-T architecture comprises three main components: an encoder, a prediction network, and a joint network. The encoder, typically a recurrent or transformer network, processes the audio input sequentially. The prediction network, also recurrent, generates a contextualized representation of previously predicted tokens. The joint network combines these encoded audio and prediction states to generate probabilities over the vocabulary, including the blank symbol. The blank symbol acts as a placeholder, allowing the model to advance through the audio input without emitting a token. The skipping phenomenon emerges when the joint network prioritizes blank emissions initially, delaying the onset of text prediction.

Addressing this requires strategies focused on incentivizing the model to start generating tokens earlier in the sequence. Simply increasing the likelihood of non-blank symbols isn't sufficient; it must be coupled with mechanisms that facilitate the alignment between the start of the utterance and the initial transcription.

One effective approach involves adjusting the blank emission probabilities within the joint network. During training, I've found that imposing a penalty for excessively long sequences of blank symbols encourages the model to transition towards token emissions sooner. This can be achieved by modifying the loss function. Instead of solely minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the target sequence, we incorporate an additional term that penalizes consecutive blank symbols or delayed onset of transcribed tokens.

Consider the standard RNN-T loss function, L:

`L = -log(P(y|x))`

where `y` is the target sequence, `x` is the input audio, and `P(y|x)` is the probability of `y` given `x`. This can be augmented with a penalty, `B`, which we compute as a function of the blank token probabilities or the position of the first non-blank token. The adjusted loss becomes:

`L_adjusted = L + λ * B`

where `λ` controls the weight of the penalty term. The form of `B` can vary:

**Example 1: Blank Token Probability Penalty**

This approach penalizes the model when the initial predictions are predominantly blanks. We average the probabilities of blanks within the initial time frames.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def blank_probability_penalty(logits, blank_index, window_size=10, weight=0.1):
    """
    Calculates a penalty based on initial blank token probabilities.

    Args:
        logits (torch.Tensor): Model output logits (batch_size, time, vocab_size).
        blank_index (int): Index representing the blank token.
        window_size (int): Time window to consider for the penalty.
        weight (float): Weight for the penalty term.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Computed penalty (scalar).
    """
    batch_size, time, vocab_size = logits.shape
    blank_probs = torch.softmax(logits[:, :window_size, blank_index], dim=-1) # (batch_size, window_size)
    average_blank_prob = torch.mean(blank_probs)
    penalty = weight * average_blank_prob
    return penalty

# Example Usage within a custom RNN-T loss
class CustomRNNTLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, blank_index, window_size, penalty_weight, standard_loss_fn):
         super().__init__()
         self.blank_index = blank_index
         self.window_size = window_size
         self.penalty_weight = penalty_weight
         self.standard_loss_fn = standard_loss_fn

    def forward(self, logits, targets, input_lengths, target_lengths):
         standard_loss = self.standard_loss_fn(logits, targets, input_lengths, target_lengths)
         blank_penalty = blank_probability_penalty(logits, self.blank_index, self.window_size, self.penalty_weight)
         return standard_loss + blank_penalty
```

Here, we compute the softmax probability of the blank token over a specified `window_size` of the initial time frames and use the average as a penalty. A higher average blank probability results in a higher penalty, discouraging the model from being too slow to emit transcribed text.

**Example 2: First Token Emission Time Penalty**

Another strategy involves directly penalizing the time at which the first non-blank token is generated. This pushes the model to begin decoding earlier in the sequence.

```python
import torch

def first_token_penalty(logits, blank_index, weight=0.1):
    """
    Calculates a penalty based on the time step of the first non-blank token.

    Args:
        logits (torch.Tensor): Model output logits (batch_size, time, vocab_size).
        blank_index (int): Index representing the blank token.
        weight (float): Weight for the penalty term.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Computed penalty (scalar).
    """
    batch_size, time, vocab_size = logits.shape
    probabilities = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1) # (batch_size, time, vocab_size)
    non_blank_probs = probabilities[:, :, :blank_index] # (batch_size, time, vocab_size -1)
    non_blank_probs_summed = torch.sum(non_blank_probs, dim=-1) # (batch_size, time)
    first_token_indices = torch.argmax(non_blank_probs_summed, dim=-1) # (batch_size)
    penalty = weight * torch.mean(first_token_indices.float())
    return penalty

# Example Usage within a custom RNN-T loss
class CustomRNNTLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, blank_index, penalty_weight, standard_loss_fn):
         super().__init__()
         self.blank_index = blank_index
         self.penalty_weight = penalty_weight
         self.standard_loss_fn = standard_loss_fn

    def forward(self, logits, targets, input_lengths, target_lengths):
         standard_loss = self.standard_loss_fn(logits, targets, input_lengths, target_lengths)
         first_token_penalty_val = first_token_penalty(logits, self.blank_index, self.penalty_weight)
         return standard_loss + first_token_penalty_val
```

In this implementation, we identify the index of the first time step where any non-blank token is predicted. The mean of these indices across the batch becomes the penalty; higher indices equate to a delayed first token and hence, a larger penalty.

**Example 3: Forced Alignment with Curriculum Learning**

Another technique that I have found effective involves a curriculum learning approach. The initial stages of training utilize a teacher forcing approach for the decoder by providing the model with the ground truth text sequence aligned with the audio frames.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ForcedAlignmentLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, blank_index, standard_loss_fn):
        super().__init__()
        self.blank_index = blank_index
        self.standard_loss_fn = standard_loss_fn

    def forward(self, logits, targets, input_lengths, target_lengths, aligned_targets):
       
        aligned_target_lengths = [len(t) for t in aligned_targets]
        standard_loss = self.standard_loss_fn(logits, aligned_targets, input_lengths, aligned_target_lengths)
       
        return standard_loss


# Usage example
# Assume a mechanism exists to create 'aligned_targets' by aligning the start of the targets
# with the initial portion of the input audio
def train_loop(model, optimizer, train_loader, num_epochs, blank_index, standard_loss_fn):
    forced_alignment_loss = ForcedAlignmentLoss(blank_index, standard_loss_fn)
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for batch_idx, (inputs, targets, input_lengths, target_lengths) in enumerate(train_loader):

             optimizer.zero_grad()

             aligned_targets = align_ground_truth(inputs, targets, input_lengths) #Function to create aligned target
             logits = model(inputs, input_lengths)

             loss = forced_alignment_loss(logits, targets, input_lengths, target_lengths, aligned_targets)
             loss.backward()
             optimizer.step()

             print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Batch {batch_idx} Loss:{loss.item()}")

    #After training, continue training with original targets without teacher forcing
```
The `align_ground_truth` function is a placeholder that would align the given target sequence with the input audio signal.

The initial portion of the training is done with the aligned target sequences and with gradually decreasing degree of forced alignment. The teacher forcing helps the model to learn early alignment and gradually reduces dependency on the aligned target during training. This curriculum learning process encourages the model to align the start of the utterance with the onset of transcription more effectively, thus mitigating missing initial transcriptions.

Implementing these adjustments during training is generally necessary for achieving robust models capable of transcribing utterances effectively, even when the initial frames may be corrupted or have limited information for the model. Resources such as conference publications from the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) or the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) provide extensive insights and alternative methods to address similar problems. Additionally, academic texts on deep learning for speech recognition often devote sections to the intricacies of RNN-T models and potential areas for improvement. Investigating techniques such as look-ahead decoding, scheduled sampling, and data augmentation strategies also contributes to developing more resilient systems. Finally, analysis of model attention patterns can sometimes highlight the root cause of misalignments which in turn aids in developing more effective solutions.
