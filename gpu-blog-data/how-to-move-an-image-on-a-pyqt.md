The core challenge in manipulating images on a PyQt canvas and subsequently exporting the result lies in understanding the canvas's coordinate system and how to efficiently manage the image's position data.  My experience developing image annotation tools has highlighted the importance of decoupling image manipulation from the canvas drawing operations for maintainability and performance.  Directly modifying pixel data on the canvas is generally inefficient; instead, one should manage the image's position as a separate attribute and redraw the canvas as needed.


**1.  Clear Explanation**

PyQt's `QPixmap` class represents images, and `QPainter` handles drawing operations onto widgets, including `QCanvas` (though `QGraphicsView` offers more robust capabilities for complex scenes, which I'll address later).  Moving an image entails updating its position data and then repainting the canvas to reflect the change.  Exporting the canvas as a PNG involves using `QPixmap.grabWidget()` to capture the canvas contents and then saving the resulting `QPixmap` using `QPixmap.save()`.

Efficient management of image position requires storing this data separately from the canvas itself.  This prevents unnecessary redraws of the entire canvas when only the image's position changes.  Ideally, one would use a data structure (e.g., a dictionary or custom class) to store the image's properties, including its `QPixmap` object and its x and y coordinates on the canvas.  These coordinates should be relative to the canvas's top-left corner.

When the image's position needs updating, only the relevant portion of the canvas is redrawn, leading to improved performance, especially with many images or large canvases.  This is achieved by using the `update()` method of the widget, which triggers a paint event.  The `paintEvent()` method within the custom widget class then redraws the image at its new position.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Image Movement and Export using QCanvas (Less Recommended)**

```python
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QCanvas
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPainter, QPixmap
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt

class ImageCanvas(QCanvas):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.image = QPixmap("image.png") # Replace with your image path
        self.x = 50
        self.y = 50

    def paintEvent(self, event):
        painter = QPainter(self)
        painter.drawPixmap(self.x, self.y, self.image)

    def moveImage(self, dx, dy):
        self.x += dx
        self.y += dy
        self.update() # Triggers repaint

    def exportPNG(self, filename):
        pixmap = QPixmap(self.size())
        painter = QPainter(pixmap)
        self.render(painter) # Render the canvas contents to the pixmap
        pixmap.save(filename, "PNG")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    canvas = ImageCanvas()
    canvas.resize(300, 200)
    canvas.show()
    canvas.moveImage(10, 10) # Move image 10 pixels right and down
    canvas.exportPNG("exported_image.png")
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

```

This example demonstrates basic image movement and export using `QCanvas`.  However, `QCanvas` is now largely obsolete;  `QGraphicsView` is preferred for more complex scenarios.


**Example 2: Improved Image Handling with QGraphicsView**

```python
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QGraphicsView, QGraphicsScene, QGraphicsPixmapItem
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPixmap
from PyQt5.QtCore import QPointF

class ImageGraphicsView(QGraphicsView):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        scene = QGraphicsScene()
        self.setScene(scene)
        self.image = QPixmap("image.png")
        self.imageItem = QGraphicsPixmapItem(self.image)
        scene.addItem(self.imageItem)
        self.imageItem.setPos(QPointF(50, 50))

    def moveImage(self, dx, dy):
        pos = self.imageItem.pos()
        self.imageItem.setPos(pos + QPointF(dx, dy))

    def exportPNG(self, filename):
        pixmap = QPixmap(self.scene().sceneRect().size().toSize())
        pixmap.fill(Qt.transparent) # Ensure transparency
        painter = QPainter(pixmap)
        self.scene().render(painter)
        pixmap.save(filename, "PNG")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    view = ImageGraphicsView()
    view.resize(300, 200)
    view.show()
    view.moveImage(10,10)
    view.exportPNG("exported_image_graphicsview.png")
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

This example utilizes `QGraphicsView` and `QGraphicsPixmapItem`, providing a more organized and efficient method for managing multiple images and interactions on the canvas.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Images and Advanced Features**

```python
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QGraphicsView, QGraphicsScene, QGraphicsPixmapItem
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPixmap, QColor
from PyQt5.QtCore import QPointF, QRectF

class ImageManager:
    def __init__(self, scene):
        self.scene = scene
        self.images = []

    def addImage(self, filename, x, y):
        pixmap = QPixmap(filename)
        item = QGraphicsPixmapItem(pixmap)
        item.setPos(x, y)
        self.scene.addItem(item)
        self.images.append(item)

    def moveImage(self, index, dx, dy):
        if 0 <= index < len(self.images):
            pos = self.images[index].pos()
            self.images[index].setPos(pos + QPointF(dx, dy))


class ImageGraphicsViewAdvanced(QGraphicsView):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.scene = QGraphicsScene()
        self.setScene(self.scene)
        self.imageManager = ImageManager(self.scene)
        self.imageManager.addImage("image.png", 50, 50)
        self.imageManager.addImage("image2.png", 150, 100) # Add a second image


    def exportPNG(self, filename):
        pixmap = QPixmap(self.scene().sceneRect().size().toSize())
        pixmap.fill(Qt.transparent)
        painter = QPainter(pixmap)
        self.scene().render(painter)
        pixmap.save(filename, "PNG")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    view = ImageGraphicsViewAdvanced()
    view.resize(400, 300)
    view.show()
    view.imageManager.moveImage(0, 20, 20) # Move the first image
    view.exportPNG("exported_image_advanced.png")
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

This example introduces an `ImageManager` class to efficiently handle multiple images, demonstrating a more scalable and organized approach for complex applications.  Error handling (e.g., checking for valid image indices) should be incorporated in production code.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

*   PyQt documentation: This is the primary source for understanding PyQt classes and methods.  Thoroughly reviewing the documentation for `QPixmap`, `QPainter`, `QGraphicsView`, `QGraphicsScene`, and `QGraphicsPixmapItem` is crucial.
*   "Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt" by Mark Summerfield:  This book provides comprehensive coverage of PyQt programming, including advanced topics relevant to canvas manipulation and image processing.
*   Online PyQt tutorials and examples: Numerous online resources offer tutorials and example code demonstrating various aspects of PyQt programming.  Focusing on examples related to graphics and scene management is beneficial.  Carefully evaluate the quality and relevance of these resources.  Prioritize examples that utilize `QGraphicsView` over the outdated `QCanvas`.


Remember to replace `"image.png"` and `"image2.png"` with the actual paths to your image files.  Always handle potential exceptions (e.g., file not found) in a production environment. The use of `QGraphicsView` is strongly recommended over `QCanvas` for modern PyQt applications due to its superior performance and features for handling complex graphical scenes.
