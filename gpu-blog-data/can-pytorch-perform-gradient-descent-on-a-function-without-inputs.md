PyTorch, while primarily associated with training neural networks, can indeed perform gradient descent on a function even when that function has no explicit input parameters. The critical distinction lies in the concept of trainable parameters and how PyTorch's autograd engine operates. Instead of explicit function inputs in the traditional sense, we leverage `torch.nn.Parameter` objects within the defined function to create trainable entities. Autograd tracks operations involving these parameters and calculates gradients with respect to them, even if the function itself is not called with typical input data.

Here's how it works: Traditionally, in a supervised learning setting, a loss function depends on both input data and model parameters. PyTorch computes the loss, which is a scalar, and backpropagates to obtain gradients with respect to the model's parameters. This is the mechanism by which we update the model. However, gradient descent isn't inherently tied to a specific loss relating to input data; it’s fundamentally an iterative optimization process to minimize a scalar objective. As long as this objective, our loss function, is differentiable and dependent on trainable parameters, gradient descent can proceed. These parameters are the "inputs" to the optimization, even if they're not passed as arguments to the function in the usual way.

The trick, therefore, is to define a function which, instead of taking inputs, interacts directly with `torch.nn.Parameter` objects. These are essentially tensors that are registered as model parameters and tracked by PyTorch’s autograd. The function then performs calculations based on these parameters. When the `.backward()` method is called on the result of that function, PyTorch automatically computes gradients for the specified parameters. An optimizer, such as Adam or SGD, is then used to update these parameter values using the computed gradients.

Let’s illustrate this with a series of examples.

**Example 1: Optimizing a simple scalar function**

Imagine we want to minimize a function that looks like `f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 5`. While we don't have external inputs, we create `x` as a learnable parameter.

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a learnable parameter
x = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(2.0))  # Initial guess for x

# Define the function
def function_to_minimize():
    return x**2 + 2*x + 5

# Instantiate an optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam([x], lr=0.1)

# Gradient descent loop
for i in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()   # Reset gradients
    loss = function_to_minimize() # Calculate function value, our 'loss'
    loss.backward()           # Compute gradients w.r.t. x
    optimizer.step()          # Update x based on gradients

    if i % 10 == 0:
        print(f"Iteration {i}: x = {x.item()}, Loss = {loss.item()}")

print(f"Final x: {x.item()}") # Print optimized x
```

In this example, the `function_to_minimize` does not explicitly accept an argument. Instead, it operates on the `torch.nn.Parameter x`, which is part of the computational graph. The optimizer is initialized with a list of parameters to be optimized, in this case, just `x`. Each optimization iteration resets the accumulated gradients, calculates the loss value using our function, backpropagates the error, and updates the parameter `x`. We are effectively minimizing the value of the function by iteratively adjusting `x`.

**Example 2: Optimization on a matrix parameter**

Next, we expand on this concept to a more complex situation involving a matrix. This can be particularly useful for scenarios where you have internal model parameters that do not directly relate to input data but still need to be optimized.

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a learnable matrix
matrix = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3, 3)) #Initialize a 3x3 matrix with random values

# Define the function to minimize (example: sum of squared elements)
def matrix_function():
    return torch.sum(matrix**2)

# Instantiate an optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam([matrix], lr=0.01)

# Gradient descent loop
for i in range(200):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss = matrix_function()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if i % 20 == 0:
        print(f"Iteration {i}: Loss = {loss.item()}")

print(f"Optimized Matrix:\n{matrix}")
```

Here, `matrix` is a 3x3 `torch.nn.Parameter` object, and our function `matrix_function` computes the sum of squared elements. This example showcases that the function can operate on multi-dimensional tensors as parameters. The gradient descent process will minimize the sum of squared elements in this matrix, effectively driving all the matrix elements towards zero.

**Example 3: Minimizing distance between learned parameters and a target**

This example introduces the concept of having a target to converge on, even without explicit input data, demonstrating the flexibility of this approach.

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

# Define learnable parameter vectors
vector_a = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5))
vector_b = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5))

# Define a target vector
target_vector = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])

# Define the function to minimize: the distance to the target
def vector_function():
    distance_a = torch.sum((vector_a - target_vector)**2)
    distance_b = torch.sum((vector_b - target_vector)**2)
    return distance_a + distance_b  # combined distance

#Instantiate the optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam([vector_a, vector_b], lr = 0.01)

# Gradient descent loop
for i in range(300):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss = vector_function()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if i % 30 == 0:
        print(f"Iteration {i}: Loss = {loss.item()}")

print(f"Optimized vector_a: {vector_a}")
print(f"Optimized vector_b: {vector_b}")
```

In this scenario, we are not only training on parameters that act on a function but training on two parameters to learn a target using a calculated distance. The target `target_vector` is not directly part of the computational graph for gradient descent. Rather, `vector_a` and `vector_b` are being adjusted to minimize their Euclidean distances to this fixed target. This demonstrates that parameters can be learned through indirect relationships as well.

In all three cases, the core principle remains consistent: We define parameters using `torch.nn.Parameter`, establish a differentiable function operating on these parameters, backpropagate, and then use an optimizer to update these parameters to minimize a scalar objective, all without having to explicitly pass data as input to the function. This approach demonstrates that gradient descent's applicability is much wider than just training neural networks, extending to arbitrary objective function minimization problems.

For further exploration of these topics, I would recommend focusing on the following:

*   **PyTorch documentation on `torch.nn.Parameter`**: A deep understanding of how PyTorch manages and tracks these parameters is fundamental.
*   **Resources on Autograd**: Learning about the automatic differentiation mechanism in PyTorch is crucial for grasping how gradients are computed.
*   **Optimizer documentation (`torch.optim`)**: Familiarizing yourself with the various optimizers available, including Adam and SGD, will help you make informed decisions during parameter updates.
*   **Literature on optimization algorithms:** Deepen your knowledge on the mathematical basis of gradient descent and other optimization techniques to get the best possible results when training.
