The core mechanism by which gradients are calculated for `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` hinges on its nature as a lookup operation, not a differentiable function in the traditional sense. Rather than directly computing gradients through complex mathematical transformations within the lookup, the process relies on *scatter operations* to accumulate gradients selectively. The key fact here is that only the embeddings corresponding to the *looked-up indices* are modified during backpropagation. This avoids updating all embeddings in a potentially enormous embedding matrix for every single input batch.

Let's consider a scenario where I was developing a custom sequence-to-sequence model for a sentiment analysis task, relying heavily on `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` to convert integer token IDs into dense vector representations. Understanding the gradient flow through this layer was crucial for optimizing my model's performance.

**Explanation:**

The `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` operation, during the forward pass, takes an embedding matrix (which is a trainable `tf.Variable`) and a set of indices. It returns the rows of the matrix specified by the given indices. Crucially, this operation doesn't involve any direct mathematical transformation on the embedding vectors themselves; it is a memory read operation. Therefore, calculating gradients, particularly for backpropagation, isn't about finding derivatives within the `lookup` operation, but rather about determining how the *loss signal* should be propagated to the *selected rows* in the embedding matrix.

When backpropagation occurs, the gradient of the loss with respect to the output of the `embedding_lookup` (which we can call `dL_dlookup`) becomes the starting point. This gradient is shaped the same way as the output of the lookup, meaning that each row corresponds to one of the looked-up vectors. The task is then to "scatter" these gradients back onto the corresponding rows of the embedding matrix itself. Essentially, we need to tell TensorFlow: "The gradient associated with this output vector should update *this specific row* in the embedding matrix."

This is achieved using a scatter update operation. TensorFlow does this implicitly; developers don't directly craft scatter operations. However, it's useful to understand it conceptually. Imagine having the gradients `dL_dlookup`, shaped like [batch_size, embedding_dimension]. A tensor shaped like [batch_size] holds the indices used for the lookup operation. The scatter operation takes these inputs and adds `dL_dlookup[i]` to the i-th row of the embedding matrix, for every i. Importantly, if the same index appears multiple times in the input, the corresponding gradients are *accumulated* when they are scattered onto the embedding matrix, which is crucial for proper training. Because this is done using scatter updates on a `tf.Variable`, which holds the embedding matrix, the updates are persistent and the embedding matrix's values change during training.

If an index from the input batch is not in the vocabulary, it is typically not included in the embeddings tensor, so no gradients would flow to indices that were ignored, making it inherently efficient.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: A Simple Lookup and Gradient Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define an embedding matrix (trainable variable)
embedding_dim = 3
vocab_size = 5
embeddings = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embedding_dim]))

# Indices to lookup
indices = tf.constant([0, 2, 1, 2])  # batch size 4, note that index 2 is repeated.

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  # Perform embedding lookup
  lookup_result = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embeddings, indices)
  
  # Dummy loss function: sum of squares of each lookup vector.
  loss = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(lookup_result))

# Calculate gradients
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, embeddings)

print("Embedding Matrix:\n", embeddings.numpy())
print("Lookup result:\n", lookup_result.numpy())
print("Gradients:\n", gradients.numpy())
```

*Commentary:*

This example demonstrates the basic mechanics. We create a trainable embedding matrix with random values.  The `indices` tensor specifies which rows of the embedding matrix to retrieve. The dummy loss function is merely the sum of squares of all the vectors in the lookup result. During the backpropagation, the `tape.gradient` function computes the gradient of the loss with respect to `embeddings`. You will observe that non-zero gradients are present *only* at the rows corresponding to indices 0, 1 and 2. Furthermore, the gradient at index 2 is larger because its vector was looked up twice and gradients are accumulated. The unaccessed indices (3 and 4) have zero gradients.

**Example 2: Effect of Repeated Indices**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

embedding_dim = 2
vocab_size = 4
embeddings = tf.Variable(tf.ones([vocab_size, embedding_dim])) # initialize embeddings with 1

indices = tf.constant([0, 1, 0, 2]) # index 0 is repeated
true_grads = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=tf.float32) # gradients for the looked-up rows

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    lookup_result = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embeddings, indices)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(lookup_result, true_grads)) # dummy loss to obtain specified gradients

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, embeddings)

print("Embedding Matrix:\n", embeddings.numpy())
print("Lookup result:\n", lookup_result.numpy())
print("Gradients:\n", gradients.numpy())
```

*Commentary:*

Here, we initialize the embedding vectors with 1's for simplicity. This is done so the loss corresponds to the gradients that would have been propagated backwards. The important point here is that index `0` appears twice in the `indices` tensor. The `true_grads` tensor represents the gradients that will be multiplied with the vectors during the calculation of loss, and hence become the gradients of the loss with respect to the vectors. During backpropagation the gradient associated with index `0` will be `1 + 3 = 4`, effectively accumulating the gradient contributions from multiple lookups of the same row. The values of the gradients associated with indices 1 and 2 are 2 and 4 respectively, corresponding to their values in `true_grads`, while index 3 has gradient 0 since it wasn't used.

**Example 3: Lookup within a larger context**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

embedding_dim = 5
vocab_size = 10
embeddings = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embedding_dim]))

input_sequence = tf.constant([[1, 2, 0], [4, 3, 2]])  # batch size 2, sequence length 3
mask = tf.constant([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]], dtype=tf.float32) # mask for sequence length

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  # Perform embedding lookup
  lookup_result = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embeddings, input_sequence)

  # Compute the mean of the looked-up vectors
  lookup_masked = lookup_result * tf.expand_dims(mask, -1) # apply mask to zeros
  seq_lens = tf.reduce_sum(mask, axis=1) # get number of non-masked elements
  seq_mean = tf.reduce_sum(lookup_masked, axis=1) / tf.expand_dims(seq_lens, -1) # element-wise division of summed embeddings by sequence lengths.
  
  # Dummy loss function: sum of squares
  loss = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(seq_mean))

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, embeddings)
print("Embedding Matrix:\n", embeddings.numpy())
print("Lookup result:\n", lookup_result.numpy())
print("Gradients:\n", gradients.numpy())
```

*Commentary:*

This example showcases a more complex use case, where the lookup occurs in the context of sequences. Each sequence is represented by a matrix, with each row corresponding to a sequence of token IDs, with padding done at the end. A mask is used to ignore padded values during the subsequent calculation.  We compute the mean embedding vector and then feed the mean vector to the loss function. The result is that gradients of the loss will flow back through the `mean` calculation, the masked multiplication and finally the embedding lookup. This example shows how embeddings can be integrated into larger neural network contexts and be trainable.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I would suggest consulting these resources (not provided with direct links as per requirements):

*   **TensorFlow documentation:** Specifically, the pages detailing `tf.nn.embedding_lookup`, `tf.GradientTape`, `tf.scatter_nd` and the general information on backpropagation.
*   **Deep Learning textbooks/courses:** Any fundamental material on deep learning that covers backpropagation, specifically how gradients flow through different layers. Look for sections describing how gradients behave in embedding operations and how they are implemented for sparse updates.

By combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience, and understanding that it leverages scatter operations for gradient updates, I have found it possible to make efficient use of `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` in numerous deep learning projects.
