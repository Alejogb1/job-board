The `fmin_l_bfgs_b` optimizer within scikit-learn's Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR) doesn't directly expose the adjusted kernel parameters in a readily accessible format.  My experience optimizing hyperparameters for GPR models, particularly within complex industrial applications involving sensor data fusion, highlighted this limitation.  Instead, the optimizer returns the *optimal values* of the kernel hyperparameters, not a trajectory of adjustments. This distinction is crucial for understanding what information is, and isn't, available post-optimization.  Therefore, the approach requires indirect methods to infer the impact of the optimization process.

The core challenge lies in the internal workings of `fmin_l_bfgs_b`. This limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm iteratively refines the kernel parameters by minimizing a loss function (typically negative log-likelihood).  It doesn't store the parameter values at every iteration. The final output reflects only the converged solution. However, we can gain insights through alternative strategies:

1. **Monitoring the Optimization Process:** While `fmin_l_bfgs_b` itself doesn't provide iteration-wise parameters, we can wrap the optimization within a custom function that logs the parameter values at each step. This involves creating a wrapper function that intercepts the objective function calls and stores the corresponding parameters.

2. **Analyzing the Kernel's Hyperparameter Attributes:** After optimization, the trained GPR model retains the optimized kernel parameters within its `kernel_.theta` attribute.  Analyzing these values against the initial parameters provides a measure of the adjustments made.  This provides the final state but not the iterative path.

3. **Employing Gradient-Based Methods:** Though `fmin_l_bfgs_b` is a second-order method, we could explore first-order methods (like gradient descent) which explicitly track parameter changes at each step. However, this requires a change in the optimization strategy.



**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Monitoring the Optimization Process**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import RBF
from scipy.optimize import fmin_l_bfgs_b

def optimize_and_log(obj_func, initial_theta, bounds, max_iter=100):
    """Wrapper function to log parameters during optimization."""
    theta_history = []
    def wrapped_obj_func(theta):
        theta_history.append(theta.copy())
        return obj_func(theta)
    opt_result = fmin_l_bfgs_b(wrapped_obj_func, initial_theta, bounds=bounds, maxiter=max_iter)
    return opt_result, theta_history

# Sample data (replace with your data)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = np.sin(X * 6) + np.random.randn(100) * 0.5

# Kernel definition
kernel = RBF(length_scale=1.0)
gpr = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel)

# Optimization using wrapper function
initial_theta = np.log(kernel.theta) # Log transform for bounds
bounds = [(np.log(1e-10), np.log(1e10))]
opt_result, theta_history = optimize_and_log(gpr.log_marginal_likelihood, initial_theta, bounds)

# Accessing history of parameters:  theta_history is a list of theta values at each iteration
print("Optimized theta:", np.exp(opt_result[0]))
print("Theta history:", np.exp(np.array(theta_history)))

```

This example demonstrates how to track the hyperparameter values throughout the optimization process by using a wrapper function to capture the `theta` values at each iteration of the `fmin_l_bfgs_b` algorithm.  Note the use of `np.exp()` to transform back from the log-transformed scale used within the optimizer.  The history of parameter values is then explicitly saved.


**Example 2: Analyzing Post-Optimization Kernel Attributes**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import RBF

# Sample data (replace with your data)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = np.sin(X * 6) + np.random.randn(100) * 0.5

# Kernel definition
kernel = RBF(length_scale=1.0)
gpr = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel)

# Fitting the model
gpr.fit(X, y)

# Accessing initial and optimized kernel parameters
initial_length_scale = kernel.length_scale
optimized_length_scale = gpr.kernel_.length_scale

print("Initial length scale:", initial_length_scale)
print("Optimized length scale:", optimized_length_scale)
print("Difference:", optimized_length_scale - initial_length_scale)

```

This example focuses on the post-optimization analysis. It directly accesses the optimized kernel parameters through the `gpr.kernel_` attribute, allowing a comparison with the initial parameters to quantify the adjustment magnitude.


**Example 3:  Illustrative Gradient Descent (Conceptual)**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import RBF

# ... (Sample data and kernel definition as before) ...

#Simplified Gradient Descent (For illustrative purposes only.  Inefficient for real applications)
learning_rate = 0.1
iterations = 100
theta = np.log(kernel.theta) #log transform
theta_history = [theta.copy()]

for i in range(iterations):
  grad = gpr.log_marginal_likelihood_gradient(theta)
  theta -= learning_rate * grad
  theta_history.append(theta.copy())

# Final parameters and history
print("Optimized theta:", np.exp(theta))
print("Theta History (Illustrative):", np.exp(np.array(theta_history)))

```

This example is conceptual; a full gradient descent implementation would require significantly more robust handling of step size, convergence criteria, and potentially more sophisticated line search techniques.  It serves to illustrate a fundamentally different optimization approach that offers explicit tracking of parameter changes, unlike `fmin_l_bfgs_b`. The simplicity compromises performance and stability.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   Scikit-learn documentation on Gaussian Process Regressors and kernel functions.
*   A textbook on optimization methods (covering gradient descent, BFGS, and related techniques).
*   Publications on Gaussian Process model selection and hyperparameter optimization.


In summary, obtaining the exact kernel parameter adjustments during `fmin_l_bfgs_b` optimization within scikit-learn's GPR requires a customized approach.  While direct access isn't provided, the presented strategies offer viable methods to infer the changes, either by tracking the parameters during optimization or by comparing pre- and post-optimization values. Remember that gradient-based methods require careful implementation due to the inherent complexities of optimizing GPR models.  The chosen method will depend upon the specific needs and computational resources available.
