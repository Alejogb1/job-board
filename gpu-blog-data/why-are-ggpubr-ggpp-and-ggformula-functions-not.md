The incompatibility between `ggpubr`, `ggpp`, and `ggformula` functions with `ggplotly` stems primarily from the way these packages construct and modify `ggplot2` objects and how `plotly` interprets these modified structures. Specifically, `ggplotly`, which is designed to translate `ggplot2` objects into interactive web graphics, expects a particular, relatively standard structure from the input. Functions within `ggpubr`, `ggpp`, and `ggformula` often alter this structure in ways that are not directly translatable by `plotly`'s rendering mechanisms.

My experience stems from a project involving extensive exploratory data analysis where I aimed to create interactive dashboards. I initially leveraged `ggpubr` for quickly generating publication-ready plots, then wanted to enhance them with interactivity using `ggplotly`. The failures I encountered drove my deeper understanding of the underlying issues. The root problem lies in the fact that `ggplotly` doesn't parse the modified grobs and layers generated by these packages, particularly the added geoms and statistical transformations.

Let’s unpack this with specific examples. `ggpubr`, for instance, provides functions like `ggboxplot`, `ggscatter`, and `ggbarplot` which internally construct `ggplot2` objects. While these plots *look* like standard `ggplot2` outputs, `ggpubr` often includes annotations, p-values, and other statistical results by drawing on the base plot's layer using non-standard additions. These additions might involve adding new graphical objects (grobs) that aren’t part of `ggplot2`’s core layer specification, and which `plotly` is not programmed to parse or handle. `ggplotly` relies on interpreting the plot’s aesthetic mappings, data structures, and statistical summaries inherent within the original `ggplot2` object rather than rendering them as static graphical elements. The additional grobs are simply unrecognized.

Furthermore, `ggpp` aims to enhance `ggplot2` plots with features such as fitted lines from polynomial regressions, annotations with arbitrary text and arrows, and other customizations using additional geoms and graphical manipulations. The way it computes positions and adds these elements is not consistent with the structure `plotly` expects. The underlying calculations often rely on accessing internal `ggplot2` variables and components that aren't directly exposed in the object's publicly accessible structure. `ggplotly` needs a well-defined mapping between data and visual elements, and when `ggpp` adds complex, calculated layers, it disrupts this mapping and breaks the compatibility with the plotting library.

Finally, `ggformula` acts as an interface to create `ggplot2` plots using formula syntax. It expands the formula specification into a standard `ggplot2` command. While the resulting `ggplot2` object may appear compliant, the transformations and statistical summaries might be represented internally in a format that is less straightforward for `plotly` to translate to its interactive rendering engine. Especially functions like `gf_boxplot`, `gf_point`, or `gf_histogram` from `ggformula` internally build and modify the layer structure. `plotly` often relies on directly accessing computed statistics within the layers to enable features like tooltips and hover events. If `ggformula` modifies those summaries internally, the resulting plot won’t behave correctly with `plotly`.

Let's examine these incompatibilities with code examples:

**Example 1: `ggpubr`**

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(plotly)

# Generate a simple boxplot using ggpubr
plot_pubr <- ggboxplot(iris, x = "Species", y = "Sepal.Length",
                     color = "Species", add = "jitter")

#Attempt to make it interactive
plotly_pubr <- ggplotly(plot_pubr) # This often results in an incomplete plot or an error
print(plotly_pubr)
```

Here, while `plot_pubr` displays a boxplot with jitter points correctly, the `plotly_pubr` result is either blank or might have misplaced elements, particularly the jitter points. `ggboxplot` generates additional graphical elements to display the boxplots and points using additional grobs, which `plotly` fails to parse. The annotations, while present in static plot, will not be part of the plotly object.

**Example 2: `ggpp`**

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpp)
library(plotly)

# Sample data
set.seed(42)
x <- 1:100
y <- x + x^2 + rnorm(100, 0, 1000)
df <- data.frame(x, y)

# Create a scatter plot with a trend line using ggpp
plot_ggpp <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_poly_line() +
  stat_poly_eq(aes(label = after_stat(eq.label)))

# Attempt to make it interactive
plotly_ggpp <- ggplotly(plot_ggpp) # Likely fails to render the stat_poly layers
print(plotly_ggpp)
```

In this example, `stat_poly_line` and `stat_poly_eq` from `ggpp` add a polynomial regression line and its equation to the plot. `ggplotly` struggles to accurately render the additional geoms and annotations introduced by `ggpp`, and typically leaves them out altogether or renders them incorrectly. The line and equation label will not be interactive or be rendered on the plotly object.

**Example 3: `ggformula`**

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggformula)
library(plotly)

# Create a boxplot using ggformula
plot_ggformula <- gf_boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, color = ~Species)

#Attempt to make it interactive
plotly_ggformula <- ggplotly(plot_ggformula) # May have misaligned elements or missing information
print(plotly_ggformula)
```

Here, `gf_boxplot` generates a boxplot. While `plotly` might render the basic structure of the boxplot, the nuances of the styling and internal transformations made by `ggformula` are not correctly interpreted by `ggplotly`. Specifically, `plotly` might struggle with the aesthetics applied by the function, and with tooltip information extracted from the modified summary of the plot data.

In essence, `ggplotly` expects a relatively direct mapping between aesthetic elements and the underlying data in the `ggplot2` object, while packages like `ggpubr`, `ggpp`, and `ggformula` modify those structures in less easily translatable ways. They introduce additional graphical elements and statistical summaries that are not compatible with the core interpretation that `plotly` relies upon for interactive rendering. While workarounds exist, they generally require rebuilding the plots with pure `ggplot2` functionality or using alternative approaches designed for interactivity, often losing the specific enhancements provided by the other packages.

To mitigate this issue, it's advisable to rely on `ggplot2` directly when planning to use `ggplotly`. Alternatively, consider packages like `plotly` itself for direct interactive plot creation or consider exploring `shiny` with `ggplot2` as a mechanism for interactive visualization. For understanding `ggplot2` deeper, Hadley Wickham's "ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" is an invaluable resource for understanding the core library. The official documentation for `plotly` offers guidance on creating interactive graphics directly. Lastly, experimenting with different approaches and analyzing the output structure of the created plots helps identify the exact points of incompatibility between the packages and enables you to tailor your solution appropriately.
