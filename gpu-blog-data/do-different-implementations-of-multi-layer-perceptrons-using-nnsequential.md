The core issue lies not in `nn.Sequential` itself, but in the inherent stochasticity present in training neural networks, particularly when coupled with variations in initialization strategies and optimizer hyperparameters.  My experience debugging inconsistencies in multi-layer perceptron (MLP) implementations across different frameworks reinforces this.  While `nn.Sequential` provides a structured way to define the network architecture, the final model's behavior is ultimately determined by the training process, which is sensitive to many factors beyond the architectural definition.

**1. Explanation:**

`nn.Sequential` (or its equivalents in other frameworks) simply defines a linear sequence of layers. It doesn't dictate the specific weight initialization, the choice of activation functions (beyond what's explicitly specified within the layers), the optimization algorithm, the learning rate, the batch size, or the data shuffling strategy during training. These parameters all significantly influence the final weights and therefore the model's predictions.

Two identical `nn.Sequential` models, with identical architectures, initialized with different random seeds will almost certainly converge to different solutions.  This is because the initial weight assignments create differing starting points in the loss landscape. The optimization algorithm then navigates this landscape, and different starting points lead to potentially drastically different minima.  Even with the same random seed, variations in floating-point arithmetic across hardware or differing implementations of the optimization algorithms can introduce small discrepancies that accumulate, resulting in subtly different outcomes.

Furthermore, variations in the training data (e.g., different batches presented in a different order) also contribute to these variations.  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants, commonly used for training neural networks, are sensitive to the order in which data is presented.

Therefore, observing varying results between seemingly identical MLPs built using `nn.Sequential` is expected behavior and not necessarily indicative of a bug in the implementation itself. The problem lies in understanding and controlling the variability introduced by the stochastic nature of the training procedure.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how subtle differences in training parameters lead to differing results. These examples are conceptual and will require adaptation based on the specific deep learning framework employed (PyTorch is implied by the question's use of `nn.Sequential`).

**Example 1: Impact of Weight Initialization:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Model definition (identical in both cases)
model1 = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 50),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(50, 10)
)

model2 = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 50),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(50, 10)
)


# Different weight initializations
torch.manual_seed(0) # Model 1 - seed specified
model1.apply(lambda m: nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(m.weight) if isinstance(m, nn.Linear) else None)
model1.to("cpu")

torch.manual_seed(1) # Model 2 - different seed
model2.apply(lambda m: nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(m.weight) if isinstance(m, nn.Linear) else None)
model2.to("cpu")



# ... (rest of the training loop: optimizer, loss function, data loading, etc.) ...

#Note: Identical training loops (optimizer, dataset, epochs, etc.) are used for both models
optimizer1 = optim.Adam(model1.parameters(), lr=0.01)
optimizer2 = optim.Adam(model2.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
# Training loop omitted for brevity.  Both models trained with the same data and hyperparameters excluding seed
```

In this example, the only difference lies in the random seed used for weight initialization.  Even though the model architectures and training procedures are supposedly identical, differing initial weights will yield distinct trained models.


**Example 2: Impact of Optimizer and Learning Rate:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Model definition (identical)
model1 = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 20), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(20, 1))

model2 = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 20), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(20, 1))


# Different optimizers and learning rates
optimizer1 = optim.SGD(model1.parameters(), lr=0.1)  # SGD
optimizer2 = optim.Adam(model2.parameters(), lr=0.001) # Adam - different optimizer and lr


# ... (rest of the training loop with identical datasets, epochs etc.)...
```

Here, the same architecture is trained using different optimizers (SGD vs. Adam) and different learning rates.  These choices dramatically affect the optimization trajectory, leading to different final models, even with the same initialization.


**Example 3:  Impact of Data Shuffling:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Model definition (identical)
model1 = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 20), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(20, 1))
model2 = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 20), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(20, 1))


# Identical training setups but different dataset shuffling
# ... (Data loading and preparation.  Crucially, different shuffling for each model)...

optimizer1 = optim.Adam(model1.parameters(), lr=0.001)
optimizer2 = optim.Adam(model2.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Training loop omitted for brevity - same hyperparameters but data presented in different order
```

This highlights the influence of data ordering on the training process. Even with the same optimization algorithm and learning rate, presenting the training data in a different order (e.g., different shuffling) can lead to noticeably different outcomes, particularly with stochastic optimizers like SGD.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of neural network training and the associated stochasticity, I would recommend consulting standard textbooks on machine learning and deep learning.  In addition, exploring the documentation for your chosen deep learning framework will prove invaluable for understanding the specifics of the implemented algorithms and their hyperparameters.  Finally, review papers on optimization algorithms used in deep learning to gain insight into the mathematical underpinnings of the training process.  These resources will provide a solid foundation for troubleshooting and interpreting variations in experimental results.
