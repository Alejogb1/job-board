The core issue with a Keras RNN failing to train on the entire dataset often stems from insufficient gradient propagation during backpropagation, especially when dealing with long sequences.  This isn't necessarily a bug in Keras itself, but a consequence of the vanishing gradient problem inherent in certain RNN architectures, particularly those using standard recurrent units like simple LSTMs without specialized optimizations.  My experience debugging this in large-scale NLP projects has highlighted several critical areas to examine.

**1. Understanding Gradient Vanishing and its Implications:**

The vanishing gradient problem arises from the repeated application of the activation function's derivative during backpropagation through time (BPTT).  In RNNs, the gradient for earlier time steps is computed as a product of the gradients from subsequent time steps.  If the derivative of the activation function is consistently less than one (as is the case with sigmoid and tanh), this product diminishes exponentially with sequence length.  The result is that the gradients for early time steps become vanishingly small, effectively preventing the network from learning long-range dependencies within the sequences.  This manifests as the model focusing primarily on the later parts of the sequences while neglecting the earlier, potentially crucial information.  Consequently, the model seemingly ignores a significant portion of the training data, even though the entire dataset is presented.

**2. Diagnosing and Addressing the Problem:**

The first step is to verify the dataset loading and preprocessing. Errors here can easily mask the actual problem.  I've encountered scenarios where data loading issues led to only a subset of the data being processed, misinterpreted as a training problem. Ensure your data is correctly loaded, shuffled (if necessary), and batched appropriately.  Examine the batch size â€“ excessively large batches can hinder training, as can batches that are uneven in sequence length.  Padding or truncation strategies must be carefully considered.

Next, analyze the training curves.  Examine plots of loss and metrics over epochs.  A plateauing loss function, even with a seemingly reasonable learning rate, often points towards the vanishing gradient issue.  Monitor gradients themselves during training; excessively small gradients indicate the problem.

Addressing this often involves several strategies:

* **Choosing appropriate RNN architectures:**  Using more sophisticated recurrent units like GRUs or LSTMs can mitigate the problem due to their gate mechanisms.  These gates help to control the flow of information, reducing the susceptibility to vanishing gradients.  Experimenting with different RNN cell types is crucial.

* **Optimizing the network architecture:** A deeper network is not always better.  Excessive depth can amplify the vanishing gradient problem.  Start with a smaller network and gradually increase its complexity.  Regularization techniques, like dropout, can also improve training stability.

* **Gradient Clipping:**  This technique limits the magnitude of gradients during backpropagation.  It prevents the explosion of gradients (another related problem), and it also helps to control the impact of large gradients that might otherwise overwhelm smaller gradients from earlier time steps.  This doesn't directly solve the vanishing gradient problem, but it helps to alleviate its effects.

* **Data Preprocessing:** Carefully examine your data preprocessing techniques.  Consider sequence length normalization or truncating overly long sequences to reduce computational complexity and the impact of the vanishing gradient.  Also, investigate feature scaling or normalization techniques.

**3. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three examples illustrating different approaches to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in Keras:

**Example 1: Using GRUs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU, Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    GRU(units=64, return_sequences=False, input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim)),
    Dense(units=output_dim, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

This example replaces the standard LSTM with a GRU, which often exhibits better gradient flow.  The `return_sequences=False` argument is used because we only need the output from the last time step.  Adjust `units`, `input_shape` (timesteps and input_dim), and `output_dim` to match your data.

**Example 2: Implementing Gradient Clipping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

optimizer = Adam(clipnorm=1.0) # Clipnorm set to 1.0

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=False, input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim)),
    Dense(units=output_dim, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

This example uses the Adam optimizer with `clipnorm` set to 1.0. This clips the gradient norm to a maximum value of 1.0, preventing excessively large gradients from dominating the learning process. Experiment with different clipnorm values.

**Example 3: Utilizing Bidirectional LSTMs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Bidirectional, LSTM, Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    Bidirectional(LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=False), input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim)),
    Dense(units=output_dim, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

```

Bidirectional LSTMs process the sequence in both forward and backward directions, potentially capturing more context and improving gradient flow. This can be particularly effective for sequence-to-sequence tasks.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of RNN architectures and the vanishing gradient problem, I would suggest exploring standard textbooks on deep learning and recurrent neural networks.  Specific chapters on backpropagation through time and optimization strategies would be particularly relevant.  Furthermore, review papers focusing on the improvements in recurrent unit architectures and gradient optimization techniques would be highly beneficial.  Examining the Keras documentation and its examples for advanced RNN usage is also highly recommended.  Finally, consulting research papers on applications of RNNs in your specific domain (e.g., NLP, time-series analysis) will provide insights into best practices and common pitfalls.  Careful consideration of these resources will significantly enhance your ability to diagnose and solve RNN training issues.
