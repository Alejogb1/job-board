TensorFlow 2's approach to feature column handling diverges significantly from the `tf.feature_column.input_layer` function present in TensorFlow 1.x.  My experience developing large-scale recommendation systems using both versions highlighted this crucial shift.  The concept of explicitly defining and then feeding feature columns into a dedicated input layer is largely superseded in TensorFlow 2 by a more integrated and flexible approach leveraging Keras layers and pre-processing techniques.  Instead of a single function, TensorFlow 2 utilizes a combination of layers and APIs to achieve the same functionality, offering improved control and adaptability.

This shift stems from the Keras integration within TensorFlow 2.  The Keras functional API and Sequential API provide a more streamlined pathway for building models, embedding feature engineering directly within the model architecture.  This contrasts with the somewhat separated nature of feature columns and model construction in TensorFlow 1.x.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

In TensorFlow 1.x, `tf.feature_column.input_layer` served as a bridge between pre-defined feature columns and the neural network.  You would first define your feature columns (e.g., numerical, categorical, bucketized), then pass them to `input_layer` to create a tensor suitable for feeding into the model's first layer. This approach, while functional, exhibited limitations in flexibility and integration with the broader TensorFlow ecosystem.

TensorFlow 2 eliminates this intermediary step.  Feature engineering is now typically incorporated within the model itself using Keras layers.  For numerical features, this might involve simple scaling or normalization using layers like `tf.keras.layers.Normalization`.  Categorical features are handled through embedding layers such as `tf.keras.layers.Embedding`, often preceded by tokenization or one-hot encoding using `tf.keras.layers.CategoryEncoding` or similar preprocessing techniques.  The pre-processing can be done as part of a `tf.keras.Model` with a `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline, ensuring smooth integration.

This approach offers several advantages:

* **Increased Flexibility:** The model architecture directly dictates the feature transformations, providing finer-grained control over the feature engineering process.
* **Improved Integration:** Seamless integration with the Keras API simplifies model building and deployment.
* **Enhanced Readability:** The model definition becomes more concise and intuitive, enhancing understanding and maintainability.

The equivalent in TensorFlow 2 isn't a single function but a structured approach involving the appropriate Keras layers based on feature type and desired transformations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Handling Numerical Features**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model for numerical features
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Normalization(axis=-1), # Normalizes numerical features
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) # Single output neuron for regression task
])

# Sample numerical data
numerical_data = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Fit the model
model.fit(numerical_data, tf.constant([[7.0],[10.0],[13.0]]), epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates how `tf.keras.layers.Normalization` handles scaling of numerical features directly within the model.  No separate feature column definition is needed.  The `fit` method directly accepts the numerical data.


**Example 2: Handling Categorical Features with Embedding**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a model for categorical features
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.CategoryEncoding(num_tokens=10, output_mode='one_hot'), # One-hot encoding
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(10, 8), # Embedding layer
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(), # Flattens the embedding output
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) # Single output neuron for regression task
])


# Sample categorical data (integer representation)
categorical_data = tf.constant([[1], [3], [5]])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Fit the model (assuming appropriate target data is available)
model.fit(categorical_data, tf.constant([[2.0],[5.0],[8.0]]), epochs=10)
```

Here, categorical features are handled by  `CategoryEncoding` for one-hot encoding and then an `Embedding` layer for converting the categorical data into a dense vector representation.  The embedding's output is then flattened before feeding to the dense layers.


**Example 3: Combining Numerical and Categorical Features**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a model handling both numerical and categorical features
input_numerical = tf.keras.Input(shape=(2,))
numerical_layer = tf.keras.layers.Normalization(axis=-1)(input_numerical)
input_categorical = tf.keras.Input(shape=(1,))
categorical_layer = tf.keras.layers.CategoryEncoding(num_tokens=10, output_mode='one_hot')(input_categorical)
categorical_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(10, 8)(categorical_layer)
categorical_layer = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(categorical_layer)
merged = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([numerical_layer, categorical_layer])
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')(merged)
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(dense_layer)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_numerical, input_categorical], outputs=output_layer)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Sample data (numerical and categorical)
numerical_data = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])
categorical_data = tf.constant([[1], [3], [5]])

# Fit the model (assuming appropriate target data is available)
model.fit([numerical_data, categorical_data], tf.constant([[2.0],[5.0],[8.0]]), epochs=10)
```

This example showcases the flexibility of the Keras functional API. It handles both numerical and categorical features simultaneously within a single model using appropriate layers for each feature type.  Data is fed as separate inputs based on feature type.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections detailing Keras layers and the `tf.data` API, are invaluable.  A solid grasp of fundamental linear algebra and probability theory is also crucial for effectively utilizing and interpreting the results.  Books focusing on deep learning with TensorFlow 2 will provide a broader theoretical and practical context.  I highly recommend exploring published research papers on relevant applications to gain deeper insights into advanced techniques and best practices.  The TensorFlow community forums and StackOverflow itself are excellent platforms for addressing specific implementation challenges.
