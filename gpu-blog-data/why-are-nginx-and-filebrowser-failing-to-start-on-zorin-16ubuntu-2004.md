Having spent considerable time troubleshooting similar configurations, I've observed that NGINX and FileBrowser failing to initiate on Zorin 16, which is based on Ubuntu 20.04, often stems from underlying user permissions, port conflicts, or configuration file syntax errors. A system administrator needs to methodically investigate these areas to identify the root cause.

The first area to examine is user permission and ownership of necessary files. NGINX typically operates under the `www-data` user and group, while FileBrowser might be run under a different user, depending on installation method. Inconsistent permissions between these users can prevent the services from accessing required directories or files, resulting in failure to start. Furthermore, incorrectly setting the permissions of log files, configuration files, or even the webroot directory, can manifest as startup issues. Therefore, ensuring the `nginx` user has sufficient read and execute permissions for the files it is expected to serve is paramount.

Port conflicts are another prevalent issue. NGINX commonly defaults to port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS. If another service is already bound to these ports, NGINX will fail to launch. FileBrowser, depending on its configuration, might also attempt to bind to a port that is already in use. This conflict often arises after installing or enabling other services, which are also using well known ports or have been configured with conflicting definitions. Checking the existing services using `netstat`, and verifying the listening ports is an important step.

Finally, incorrect syntax or misconfigurations within the NGINX configuration files, located under `/etc/nginx/`, are a common cause of NGINX failing to start. These configurations often involve virtual host setups, server blocks, and proxying rules which require a high level of precision, and an error in these definitions can render the NGINX service unusable. Likewise, FileBrowser's configuration file, typically `config.json` or located in `~/.filebrowser.json`, can contain syntax errors or reference incorrect file paths, leading to failure.

Let's move into some concrete examples. Assume we have a standard NGINX setup, and we want to use FileBrowser on a non-standard port 8080, behind a proxy.

**Example 1: User Permissions Issues**

```bash
# Check user and group ownership of the webroot directory
ls -la /var/www/html

# Example output might show ownership as 'user:user' rather than 'www-data:www-data'

# Change ownership to www-data for proper operation
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html

# Restart NGINX
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Here, I initially observed that the `/var/www/html` directory was owned by the current user and not `www-data`. NGINX, operating as `www-data`, could not access files in that directory. After changing the owner and group to `www-data`, NGINX could then start without issues related to file access. The `-R` flag in `chown` recursively sets the owner for all files and subdirectories. This ensures a unified ownership profile.

**Example 2: Port Conflict**

```bash
# Check which services are listening on ports 80 and 8080
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep '80\|8080'

# Example output might show another service is using port 80

# Assuming the conflicting service is Apache2, disable it:
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl disable apache2

# Check again to verify port 80 is now free
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep '80\|8080'

# Restart NGINX and FileBrowser
sudo systemctl restart nginx
# Assuming FileBrowser uses systemd, sudo systemctl restart filebrowser
```

In this case, `netstat` revealed that another process, specifically `apache2`, was listening on port 80, which NGINX also wanted to use. I proceeded to stop and disable `apache2` before attempting to restart NGINX. This resolved the port conflict and allowed both NGINX and FileBrowser, configured for another port, to launch correctly. The `grep` command filters the output of `netstat` to only display lines containing "80" or "8080".

**Example 3: NGINX Configuration Error**

Assume we have a server block configuration like the following:
```nginx
server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        }
}
```
Now assume that during an edit a closing bracket in `location` has been removed. The following error will cause NGINX to fail:
```bash
# Test NGINX configuration
sudo nginx -t
# Example output might show:
# nginx: [emerg] "}" unexpected in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com:7

# Correct the configuation
# sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com
# Add the missing closing brace

# Test again
sudo nginx -t
# nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

# Restart NGINX
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Here, the `nginx -t` command pointed to an error in the `example.com` configuration file. I edited the file to correct the syntax error. After the edit, `nginx -t` confirmed a successful test, and I could then restart the service. Always remember to test for syntax errors before attempting to restart the NGINX service.

In summary, these three scenarios—incorrect user permissions, port conflicts, and configuration errors—are common root causes for NGINX and FileBrowser failing to start. The approach is methodical, first ensuring proper file access via correct ownership, then confirming that there aren't other services interfering with the listening ports, and lastly validating the service configuration via specific testing methods provided by the respective software. Each service has its own requirements and these need to be examined case by case.

For further investigation, I recommend consulting the official NGINX documentation; this provides extensive information on syntax and configuration options. The FileBrowser project's documentation on installation, permissions, and configuration will offer insights into its specific requirements. Lastly, Ubuntu community support forums provide further assistance regarding permissions, firewall configurations, and conflicts with commonly installed software. These resources will assist in understanding the complex configuration and setup that are often required for a stable and reliable software environment.
