The primary reason `thrust::remove_if` fails to compile, given seemingly correct arguments, often stems from a type mismatch between the unary predicate’s argument and the iterator’s value type. Based on my experience optimizing parallel algorithms on heterogeneous systems, this is a prevalent issue encountered when using Thrust's higher-order functions.

Specifically, `thrust::remove_if` expects a unary predicate that accepts a value of the iterator’s value type. If the provided predicate's argument type does not *exactly* match the iterator's value type (including const-ness and potential qualification), the compiler will report a template instantiation error, often cryptic and difficult to decipher. This arises because Thrust relies heavily on compile-time type checking for performance and correctness. The template nature of `thrust::remove_if` allows it to operate on various types, but this also requires strict type adherence.

To illustrate this further, consider a scenario where I was working on a CUDA project involving particle simulations. We had a large `thrust::device_vector<float>` representing particle radii. The aim was to remove particles below a certain radius using `thrust::remove_if`. Let’s assume initially the predicate was defined using a floating point number, expecting a non-const `float`.

```cpp
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/remove.h>
#include <thrust/iterator/counting_iterator.h>

#include <iostream>

//Incorrect predicate definition, assuming radius is not const
struct RadiusPredicate_Incorrect {
  float threshold;
  RadiusPredicate_Incorrect(float threshold) : threshold(threshold) {}
  bool operator()(float radius) { return radius < threshold; }
};

int main() {
  thrust::device_vector<float> radii = {1.5f, 0.8f, 2.1f, 0.5f, 1.9f};
  float cutoff = 1.0f;
  
  //The type mismatch is here, implicit assumption radius can be modified.
  // thrust::remove_if will call the predicate with `const float& radius`
  // but the lambda expects to receive float.
  auto new_end_incorrect = thrust::remove_if(radii.begin(), radii.end(), RadiusPredicate_Incorrect(cutoff));

  std::cout << "Initial Radii: ";
  for(auto radius : radii){
      std::cout << radius << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;


  radii.resize(new_end_incorrect - radii.begin());
  
  std::cout << "Radii after Removal: ";
    for (const auto& radius : radii) {
        std::cout << radius << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This code, if compiled, will generate an error. The predicate `RadiusPredicate_Incorrect` takes a `float` by value, whereas `thrust::remove_if` passes elements by a `const float&`. This mismatch during the template instantiation causes a compilation failure. The predicate is not compatible with the actual types being accessed and modified inside thrust's algorithm. This isn't about the predicate functionality, it is about the underlying types it operates on.

The correct implementation requires the predicate to accept a `const float&` as its argument, aligning precisely with the iterator's value type and how Thrust algorithms handle data:

```cpp
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/remove.h>
#include <thrust/iterator/counting_iterator.h>

#include <iostream>

//Correct predicate definition, accepts const float reference
struct RadiusPredicate_Correct {
  float threshold;
  RadiusPredicate_Correct(float threshold) : threshold(threshold) {}
  bool operator()(const float& radius) const { return radius < threshold; }
};


int main() {
  thrust::device_vector<float> radii = {1.5f, 0.8f, 2.1f, 0.5f, 1.9f};
  float cutoff = 1.0f;

  auto new_end_correct = thrust::remove_if(radii.begin(), radii.end(), RadiusPredicate_Correct(cutoff));
    
  std::cout << "Initial Radii: ";
  for(auto radius : radii){
      std::cout << radius << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  radii.resize(new_end_correct - radii.begin());
    
  std::cout << "Radii after Removal: ";
  for (const auto& radius : radii) {
      std::cout << radius << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This corrected example defines the predicate `RadiusPredicate_Correct` that accepts `const float&`, which allows the program to compile and operate as expected. Notice also the `const` after the `operator()` definition, which is important because `thrust::remove_if` will actually use a `const` object. The predicate does not need the ability to modify `radius`, only to read it, and the compiler checks for it.

A final code example demonstrating the use of lambdas, which are often more concise when defining simple predicates, also requires that the lambda’s capture types are correct. A lambda implicitly captures by value, which can lead to similar type mismatches if the lambda expects a non-const argument. To ensure correct type matching, capture should be performed by reference (or by value if a copy is desired) and parameter type should be the correct one:

```cpp
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/remove.h>
#include <thrust/iterator/counting_iterator.h>

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    thrust::device_vector<float> radii = {1.5f, 0.8f, 2.1f, 0.5f, 1.9f};
    float cutoff = 1.0f;

    // Correct lambda capturing threshold by value and using const reference for argument
    auto new_end_lambda = thrust::remove_if(radii.begin(), radii.end(),
        [cutoff](const float& radius){ return radius < cutoff; });

    std::cout << "Initial Radii: ";
    for(auto radius : radii){
        std::cout << radius << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    radii.resize(new_end_lambda - radii.begin());

    std::cout << "Radii after Removal: ";
    for (const auto& radius : radii) {
        std::cout << radius << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
This lambda example demonstrates how to avoid type mismatch by explicitly declaring the parameter to be a `const float&` and capturing by value (or by reference if required). Using lambdas is generally more succinct and avoids the overhead of creating a custom functor struct when the predicate logic is simple.

Beyond type mismatches in the predicate, incorrect iterators, including the potential use of host iterators with device vectors, can also lead to compile-time errors or runtime issues. However, when concerning compile errors with `thrust::remove_if` in particular, the type mismatch with the predicate parameter is overwhelmingly the most common root cause, and it highlights the significance of strict type matching when using templates in C++.

For a deeper understanding of Thrust and avoiding these kinds of issues, I recommend reviewing the official Thrust documentation, which includes explanations of iterator requirements, predicate compatibility, and various algorithm behaviors. Also, exploring examples in the Thrust sample code is a practical way to learn correct usage. It's beneficial to study resources dedicated to generic programming and template metaprogramming in C++, as this will provide a broader theoretical basis for why these type mismatches are critical to the proper execution of templated code. Examining the source of standard library algorithms (such as `std::remove_if`) can also be useful for comparative understanding. Finally, spending time experimenting with small, isolated examples will provide hands-on experience that solidifies understanding of this core aspect of Thrust library use.
