The fundamental limitation preventing direct output layer reconfiguration in a TensorFlow frozen graph stems from the graph's immutable nature.  During the freezing process, the graph's structure, including the output layer's definition and connections, is solidified into a static representation. This contrasts sharply with a live TensorFlow session where dynamic adjustments are possible.  My experience with large-scale deployment of TensorFlow models, particularly in the context of real-time image classification systems, underscores this point.  Attempts to modify a frozen graph's output directly invariably lead to errors, since the frozen graph lacks the necessary computational mechanisms for dynamic graph modification.  This inherent restriction necessitates alternative strategies for achieving the desired outcome.

The primary path to achieving a modified output layer is not modifying the frozen graph itself, but rather creating a new graph that incorporates the pre-trained weights from the frozen model and a redesigned output layer. This approach leverages the power of transfer learning, effectively utilizing the learned features from the existing model while adapting its predictive capabilities.  This method is particularly efficient and minimizes training time compared to training a completely new model.

Let's delineate three approaches, with accompanying code examples illustrating the core concepts.  Note that these examples assume familiarity with TensorFlow's core APIs, including `tf.compat.v1.import_graph_def`, `tf.compat.v1.Session`, and related functions.  Adaptation for TensorFlow 2.x is straightforward, primarily involving the transition to the eager execution model and adjustments to the session management.

**Method 1:  Direct Append using tf.compat.v1.import_graph_def and new layer definition.**

This method involves importing the frozen graph as a sub-graph, defining a new output layer, and connecting it to the pre-existing output node.  This requires careful identification of the original output node's name within the imported graph.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the frozen graph
with tf.compat.v1.gfile.GFile("frozen_model.pb", "rb") as f:
    graph_def = tf.compat.v1.GraphDef()
    graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())

with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default() as graph:
    tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name="")

    # Identify the original output tensor (replace 'output_node' with the actual name)
    input_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name('output_node:0')

    # Define the new output layer.  Example: a single neuron with sigmoid activation.
    new_output = tf.compat.v1.layers.Dense(units=1, activation=tf.sigmoid)(input_tensor)

    # Initialize the session
    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
        # Perform inference using the modified graph
        # ... inference code ...
```

**Commentary:** This approach directly adds a new layer.  The efficiency depends on the complexity of the new layer and its integration with the original model's architecture.  The crucial step is correctly identifying the original output tensor name.  Errors here will result in graph connection failures.  Careful inspection of the `.pb` file's structure using tools like Netron is recommended for this step.

**Method 2:  Intermediate Feature Extraction and New Model Construction.**

In scenarios where significant alterations to the output are required, rebuilding a portion of the model proves advantageous.  This technique extracts intermediate feature representations from the frozen graph and uses them as input for a newly constructed model with the desired output configuration.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the frozen graph (same as Method 1)
# ...

with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default() as graph:
    tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name="")

    # Extract intermediate features (replace 'feature_node' with the actual name)
    intermediate_features = graph.get_tensor_by_name('feature_node:0')

    # Build a new model using the extracted features as input
    new_model_input = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=intermediate_features.shape)
    # ...add new layers here...
    new_output =  #Output of the new model
    # ...

    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
        # Run the frozen graph to get intermediate features
        features_value = sess.run(intermediate_features, feed_dict={})

        # Run the new model with extracted features
        output_value = sess.run(new_output, feed_dict={new_model_input: features_value})
```

**Commentary:** This is more flexible, allowing for significant architectural changes to the output section. It avoids directly modifying the frozen graph, reducing potential conflicts. However, it requires careful selection of the intermediate feature extraction point. The performance depends on the chosen feature layer's representational power and the new model's design.


**Method 3:  Keras Functional API and Model Loading.**

If the original model was initially built using Keras, leveraging the Keras functional API provides a more streamlined approach.  Keras offers built-in functionalities for loading pre-trained weights, simplifying the process of creating a modified model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Load the pre-trained model (assuming it's saved in h5 format)
model = keras.models.load_model("pre_trained_model.h5")

# Extract pre-trained weights
pre_trained_weights = [layer.get_weights() for layer in model.layers[:-1]] #Exclude last layer

# Create a new model with a modified output layer
new_model = keras.Sequential()
# ... add layers using pre_trained_weights ...
new_model.add(keras.layers.Dense(units=..., activation=..., weights=...))  # Modify output layer
# Compile and train the new model, only training the new output layer
# ... training code ...
```

**Commentary:**  This method is exceptionally clean and efficient if the original model was a Keras model. It leverages Keras's built-in mechanisms for weight management, simplifying the integration of pre-trained weights.  The training process can be restricted to the new output layer, significantly reducing training time.  This method is not directly applicable if the original model was not built with Keras, but the fundamental concept of extracting weights and constructing a new model remains valuable.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections on graph manipulation, model saving and loading, and transfer learning.  A thorough understanding of neural network architectures and the Keras API will further enhance one's capacity to handle such tasks.  Furthermore, exploring resources focused on model optimization and deployment will be crucial for effectively implementing these modifications in production environments.


In conclusion, while directly altering a frozen TensorFlow graph's output layer is infeasible, several methods allow for achieving the equivalent result.  The optimal approach depends on the specific requirements, the original model's architecture, and the desired extent of modification.  By carefully selecting the appropriate method and considering its limitations, one can successfully reconfigure the output layer while capitalizing on the pre-trained weights.
