The soft argmax, as opposed to the traditional argmax, yields a probability distribution over the possible indices instead of a single index corresponding to the maximum value within a tensor. This is crucial in differentiable programming, specifically when a discrete decision must be incorporated into a gradient-descent optimized network, as the argmax operation is inherently non-differentiable. Having implemented several reinforcement learning agents with complex action spaces, I've frequently relied on the soft argmax to approximate a discrete selection in a differentiable manner.

The key to implementing a soft argmax lies in applying the softmax function, typically employed for classification probabilities, to the input tensor and then deriving a weighted average of the indices based on the resulting probabilities. Let's define an input tensor *x* of shape [B, N], where B represents the batch size and N the number of possible indices. The soft argmax operation essentially calculates the expected value of the indices under the probability distribution obtained from the softmax operation. Instead of directly returning the index with the maximum value, we compute a linear combination of indices, weighted by the softmax probabilities.

The implementation in TensorFlow involves three main steps: 1) applying the softmax function along the appropriate axis (axis=1 in our case); 2) constructing a tensor of indices of the same shape as the input tensor, and; 3) calculating a weighted sum of these indices based on the probabilities produced by the softmax. Because TensorFlow operates with tensors, no loops are needed. The resulting soft argmax operation is differentiable.

Here are three illustrative examples of increasing complexity:

**Example 1: Basic Soft Argmax (1D tensor within a batch)**

This example provides the most fundamental form of soft argmax, handling a batch of one-dimensional tensors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def soft_argmax_1d(x):
    """
    Calculates the soft argmax of a 1D tensor within a batch.

    Args:
    x: A tensor of shape [B, N], where B is the batch size, and N is the number of options.

    Returns:
        A tensor of shape [B,], the soft argmax of x.
    """
    probs = tf.nn.softmax(x, axis=-1)
    indices = tf.range(tf.shape(x)[1], dtype=tf.float32)
    soft_argmax = tf.reduce_sum(probs * indices, axis=-1)

    return soft_argmax

# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                            [0.5, 1.5, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

result = soft_argmax_1d(input_tensor)
print("Soft Argmax (1D):", result.numpy())

```

This function, `soft_argmax_1d`, takes a 2D tensor as input. It applies softmax along the last axis (`axis=-1`), producing a probability distribution for each row (batch element). We then create a tensor `indices` that corresponds to the index numbers (0, 1, 2, ...), of the same length as the second dimension of the input tensor. The core of the soft argmax is `tf.reduce_sum(probs * indices, axis=-1)`, where we multiply each probability by its corresponding index and sum across the axis representing the possible choices. This results in a 1D tensor where each element represents the soft argmax value for a batch item. The example demonstrates with a 2x3 input, showing how the function returns a 1D output (shape 2) for the soft argmaxes for each row.

**Example 2: Soft Argmax with Custom Indices (Multidimensional with Specified Index Mapping)**

This example expands to a case with multidimensional tensors and allows for specifying a custom mapping of indices rather than implicit integer indexing. This scenario may appear when working with complex state spaces or action representations in reinforcement learning.

```python
def soft_argmax_custom_indices(x, indices):
    """
    Calculates the soft argmax of a tensor using custom index values.

    Args:
    x: A tensor of shape [B, N1, N2,...].
    indices: A tensor of shape [N1, N2,...] matching the shape of x excluding the batch dimension,
        containing the custom index values.

    Returns:
    A tensor of shape [B,], representing the soft argmax.
    """
    original_shape = tf.shape(x)
    x_reshaped = tf.reshape(x, [original_shape[0], -1])
    probs = tf.nn.softmax(x_reshaped, axis=-1)
    indices_reshaped = tf.reshape(tf.cast(indices, dtype=tf.float32), [-1])
    soft_argmax = tf.reduce_sum(probs * indices_reshaped, axis=-1)

    return soft_argmax


# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.constant([[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 0.0]],
                            [[0.5, 1.5], [1.0, 2.5]]], dtype=tf.float32)
custom_indices = tf.constant([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]], dtype=tf.float32)

result = soft_argmax_custom_indices(input_tensor, custom_indices)
print("Soft Argmax (Custom Indices):", result.numpy())
```

Here, `soft_argmax_custom_indices` handles an arbitrary number of dimensions in `x` after the batch size. First the input is flattened to 2D, then `softmax` is applied across the last dimension. The indices passed, of the shape of the last dimensions of x, are also reshaped to a 1D tensor, and cast to float32 for computations. Finally, the expected value calculation is performed through a dot product between the probabilities and the flattened custom indices, leading to a batch sized vector of weighted index means. The example shows its utilization on a tensor of shape (2, 2, 2) with custom indexes of shape (2, 2).

**Example 3: Soft Argmax with Temperature Scaling**

This example incorporates temperature scaling, a common technique in machine learning used to adjust the sharpness of the probability distribution, influencing the decision-making behavior. Lower temperature values make the distribution more peaked, whereas higher values flatten the distribution.

```python
def soft_argmax_temperature(x, temperature):
    """
     Calculates the soft argmax with temperature scaling.

    Args:
    x: A tensor of shape [B, N].
    temperature: A scalar value controlling the sharpness of the softmax distribution.

    Returns:
        A tensor of shape [B,], the soft argmax of x with temperature scaling.
    """
    scaled_x = x / temperature
    probs = tf.nn.softmax(scaled_x, axis=-1)
    indices = tf.range(tf.shape(x)[1], dtype=tf.float32)
    soft_argmax = tf.reduce_sum(probs * indices, axis=-1)

    return soft_argmax


# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                            [0.5, 1.5, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
temperature_val = 0.5

result_temp = soft_argmax_temperature(input_tensor, temperature_val)
print("Soft Argmax (Temperature Scaling):", result_temp.numpy())

```

The `soft_argmax_temperature` function enhances the basic soft argmax functionality with a temperature parameter. It divides the input tensor `x` by the given `temperature` before applying the softmax function. This scaling modifies the output of the softmax; as temperatures go down the output resembles a hard argmax, with a concentration of probability around the largest element. The rest of the function is similar to the first example; indices are generated and multiplied with probabilities resulting in a batch size vector. The example shows its usage with a temperature of 0.5 and identical input to the first example.

To fully understand the impact of these computations, consulting relevant textbooks and research articles is strongly recommended. Specific books covering deep learning and reinforcement learning offer comprehensive treatments of softmax, argmax and their applications to sequential decision making. Academic journals in artificial intelligence regularly feature advanced applications of soft argmax. Additionally, the TensorFlow API documentation provides in depth details on specific functions like tf.nn.softmax, tf.reduce_sum, and others used in these implementations. These resources facilitate a more detailed understanding of the underlying theory and practical use of these operations.
