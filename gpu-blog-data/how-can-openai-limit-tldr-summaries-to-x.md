The fundamental challenge in restricting a text summarization to a fixed character count, while retaining grammatical correctness, lies in balancing compression with syntactical integrity. A naive truncation of a summary to fit a character limit often results in abruptly ending sentences and lost context. As someone who developed a real-time micro-blogging service, I faced a very similar problem in constraining user posts to 280 characters while maintaining readability; the principles are surprisingly similar.

The key to generating concise, yet complete, summaries within a strict character constraint involves a multi-faceted approach combining both linguistic analysis and, when possible, API-specific tuning parameters. At its core, the process should prioritize not just raw length reduction but also ensure each component of the summary serves a purpose within the tight space available.

I will break this down into a practical approach that can be applied to summarization with OpenAI's API, though similar techniques apply to other NLP models.

Firstly, you should leverage the capabilities of the API to provide sentence-based, not just arbitrary length-based, summary outputs. Rather than relying on a post-hoc truncation, the initial summarization request should be designed to produce concise units. This is best achieved by providing explicit instructions to the API that focus on brevity and sentence structure. The `prompt` sent to the API should explicitly request summaries that adhere to character limits and are composed of complete sentences. If the target is a particularly short limit (e.g. 140 characters), you may need to encourage the use of simple language. This initial API request is the most important step. If you try to brute-force the character limit later, you'll produce much lower quality results.

Secondly, you need a function for calculating the "effective" character count, which should also account for possible UTF-8 encoding complexities. Simple `len()` functions in many languages will not accurately represent the visual width of a string, specifically those with non-ASCII characters. As such, it is important to use functions that correctly gauge the display width of each character, especially when summarizations may contain non-English language artifacts.

Thirdly, because summaries even adhering to initial character requests might still slightly exceed the desired limit, a function is needed to intelligently trim the final summary. Instead of chopping indiscriminately, this function should identify the last full sentence that fits within the character constraint. If no complete sentence fits, then it must be handled carefully, which might involve falling back to a very short summarization. I'll demonstrate this in code below.

Here are three Python code examples illustrating these principles, using `openai` library:

**Example 1: Basic Prompt Construction and API Call**

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY" # Replace with your actual API Key

def generate_summary(text, max_chars):
    prompt = f"Summarize the following text in complete sentences, limiting the summary to {max_chars} characters:\n\n{text}\n\nSummary:"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003", # Or your preferred model
        prompt=prompt,
        temperature=0.0, # Reduce randomness for more consistent lengths
        max_tokens=500 # Limit total tokens for cost control
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

example_text = """
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a classic sentence that showcases all the letters of the alphabet. In addition, it is often used for typing speed tests. This is because all the letters of the alphabet are in it. 
"""
max_characters = 100

summary = generate_summary(example_text, max_characters)
print(f"Summary: '{summary}'")
print(f"Length: {len(summary)}")
```

In this example, the `prompt` explicitly instructs the API to return a summary composed of complete sentences within a specified character count. The temperature is set to `0` to encourage more deterministic and predictable summaries of a targeted length. You'll note that, while the API is instructed to limit the summary to 100 characters, it may still output something slightly over that number. This is because it will prefer complete sentences rather than abrupt truncation, so further character constraint will be required.

**Example 2: Trimming Function**

```python
import re

def trim_summary(summary, max_chars):
    if len(summary) <= max_chars:
        return summary

    sentences = re.split(r'(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)(?<=\.|\?)\s', summary)  # Split into sentences
    trimmed_summary = ""
    for sentence in sentences:
        if len(trimmed_summary) + len(sentence) <= max_chars:
             trimmed_summary += sentence + " "
        else:
            break

    return trimmed_summary.strip()


example_summary = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It is used in many typing tests. It includes all letters."
max_chars_trim = 80

trimmed_summary = trim_summary(example_summary, max_chars_trim)
print(f"Trimmed Summary: '{trimmed_summary}'")
print(f"Length: {len(trimmed_summary)}")

```

This code defines the `trim_summary` function which splits the initial API response into sentences based on proper punctuation, and iterates through the sentences to fit them inside of the prescribed character limit. It is important that the splitting regex is robust and handles common edge cases such as abbreviations. When the limit is about to be exceeded, the function stops appending further sentences and returns the last validly sized sentence. This is not an exact solution. For instance, if a single sentence exceeds the limit, then the `trim_summary` will simply return an empty string. In more complex production systems, you would either have to re-request the API at a more limited size, or rely on a local model to perform the summarization. This also assumes that every sentence can be split by `.`, `?`, etc. More complex parsing is often needed in production.

**Example 3: Combined Function and Handling Edge Cases**

```python
def generate_and_trim_summary(text, max_chars):
    summary = generate_summary(text, max_chars + 30) # Add a buffer
    trimmed_summary = trim_summary(summary, max_chars)

    if not trimmed_summary:  # Handle case where no sentence fits
        prompt = f"Summarize the following text in under {max_chars} characters:\n\n{text}\n\nSummary:" # Redo with aggressive summarization
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            model="text-davinci-003",
            prompt=prompt,
            temperature=0.1,
            max_tokens=100
        )
        trimmed_summary = response.choices[0].text.strip()
        trimmed_summary = trim_summary(trimmed_summary, max_chars)

    return trimmed_summary

example_text_long = """This is a very long piece of text. It goes on and on. It has many sentences. It talks about many different things. There are many important details. It is truly massive. This sentence is also really long. Here's a tiny one. See!"""
max_chars_combined = 50

final_summary = generate_and_trim_summary(example_text_long, max_chars_combined)
print(f"Final Summary: '{final_summary}'")
print(f"Length: {len(final_summary)}")
```

This example combines the prior functions to create a more robust summarization pipeline. First, we request a summary with a buffer on the character limit which is then passed to the `trim_summary` function. If this function fails to return any text due to an overlong single sentence, then the system falls back to aggressively requesting a summary that is *under* the requested character limit, and this is trimmed again. The API call is also made more aggressive using a higher temperature and a more restrictive token limit. This is designed to encourage the API to create a response that is much shorter. This solution isn't perfect – the API is still nondeterministic – but it is far more robust than simply truncating the output.

For further exploration, I recommend the following resources (but please note that I won't provide any links):

*   Publications and academic research in natural language processing and text summarization – focus on sentence extraction algorithms and extractive versus abstractive summarization strategies. These can be particularly helpful when you wish to produce results without relying heavily on closed-source APIs.
*   Documentation and tutorials from companies like OpenAI, Cohere, and Google. These will teach you how to use their APIs effectively, and learn about specific parameters and features relating to text summarization.
*   Study implementations of summarization within projects like the `transformers` library from Hugging Face. These can illustrate how modern summarization algorithms are put into practice.
*  Explore linguistic textbooks focusing on sentence structure and grammar, this will help you with developing better post-processing logic for ensuring your summary is always of high quality.

In conclusion, limiting TL;DR summaries to a fixed number of characters while maintaining grammatical correctness is best achieved by first leveraging API capabilities, then robustly handling edge cases post-hoc using a sentence-aware truncation algorithm. This method ensures that even highly constrained summaries convey their message in a clear and coherent manner, even when faced with the inherent limitations of deterministic algorithms.
