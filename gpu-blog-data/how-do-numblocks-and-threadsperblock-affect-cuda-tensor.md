CUDA Tensor Core performance is profoundly impacted by the configuration of `NumBlocks` and `ThreadsPerBlock`, with their optimal selection being highly workload-dependent rather than a universal constant. My experience developing custom kernels for large-scale matrix multiplication on NVIDIA GPUs has shown that blindly increasing these parameters leads to diminishing returns and can even degrade performance due to resource contention. Specifically, efficient utilization hinges on maximizing occupancy while ensuring adequate work per thread.

The core relationship stems from how the CUDA programming model maps blocks of threads onto Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). Each SM has a finite set of resources, including shared memory, registers, and execution units. `ThreadsPerBlock` defines the number of threads within a single block, directly influencing the amount of shared memory and registers consumed by that block. Conversely, `NumBlocks` determines how many blocks are launched, indirectly impacting the overall workload distribution across the available SMs. Achieving optimal Tensor Core performance requires a careful balancing act between keeping SMs fully occupied and avoiding resource exhaustion within individual SMs.

A low `ThreadsPerBlock` might not utilize the full computational potential of an SM, leaving execution units idle. Conversely, an excessively large `ThreadsPerBlock` can oversubscribe SM resources, leading to reduced register availability, potential spilling into local memory (a slow access), and lower overall occupancy. Low occupancy means that the SM cycles are wasted waiting for threads rather than executing instructions. Similarly, a low `NumBlocks` may not provide enough workload to keep all SMs active on a multi-SM GPU, limiting the performance scalability. A very high `NumBlocks` without sufficient work per block can also cause overhead due to excessive context switching. Tensor Cores are specialized units optimized for specific matrix operation dimensions. If the dimensions are not multiples of the Tensor Coreâ€™s requirements, the performance can be significantly reduced or the cores will not be used at all.

The selection process begins with understanding the specific computational demands of the kernel and the hardware limitations. For a matrix multiplication operation, the goal is to partition the matrices into smaller sub-matrices, often referred to as tiles or fragments, that can be efficiently processed by the Tensor Cores. The size and shape of these fragments, along with the matrix dimensions, provide constraints on `ThreadsPerBlock`.  I typically strive for a block size that provides sufficient threads to keep a Tensor Core occupied, and that also maximizes occupancy within the SM.

Consider the following examples illustrating the interaction between `NumBlocks` and `ThreadsPerBlock` in a simplified context. We will explore different settings of `ThreadsPerBlock`, always ensuring that the total number of threads `NumBlocks` * `ThreadsPerBlock` is roughly constant. This simplified model can be expanded to understand complex performance trade-offs.

**Example 1: Suboptimal Threading**

```c++
// Example 1: Suboptimal Block Configuration
__global__ void matrix_multiply_example1(float* a, float* b, float* c, int rows, int cols, int k) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < rows && col < cols) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            sum += a[row * k + i] * b[i * cols + col];
        }
        c[row * cols + col] = sum;
    }
}

// Launch Configuration
const int rows = 1024;
const int cols = 1024;
const int k = 1024;

dim3 threadsPerBlock(16, 16); // A small block size
dim3 numBlocks((cols + threadsPerBlock.x - 1) / threadsPerBlock.x,
              (rows + threadsPerBlock.y - 1) / threadsPerBlock.y);

matrix_multiply_example1<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(a_d, b_d, c_d, rows, cols, k);
```

In this first example, a `threadsPerBlock` of 16x16 is chosen. While this configuration is valid and will execute the intended matrix multiplication, the `ThreadsPerBlock` is too small. In scenarios with significant resource requirements, such as extensive shared memory usage within a kernel, this can lead to underutilized SM resources. The low number of threads in each block does not provide enough work for all the execution resources in the SM. A low occupancy implies the SM is not working at its full capacity.

**Example 2: Improved Threading with Increased `ThreadsPerBlock`**

```c++
// Example 2: Improved Block Configuration
__global__ void matrix_multiply_example2(float* a, float* b, float* c, int rows, int cols, int k) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < rows && col < cols) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            sum += a[row * k + i] * b[i * cols + col];
        }
        c[row * cols + col] = sum;
    }
}


// Launch Configuration
const int rows = 1024;
const int cols = 1024;
const int k = 1024;
dim3 threadsPerBlock(32, 32); // A larger block size, more threads per block
dim3 numBlocks((cols + threadsPerBlock.x - 1) / threadsPerBlock.x,
              (rows + threadsPerBlock.y - 1) / threadsPerBlock.y);

matrix_multiply_example2<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(a_d, b_d, c_d, rows, cols, k);
```

Here, the `threadsPerBlock` is increased to 32x32. This improves performance by allowing more work to be assigned to an SM. The goal was to increase the number of active threads in the SM and subsequently increase occupancy. If the kernel was primarily computational with minimal shared memory usage, this configuration will likely perform better than the first example, as it drives higher occupancy and achieves more compute per SM. However, this example does not use Tensor Cores, making performance less than ideal. For optimal use of Tensor Cores, block size would need to be carefully tailored to Tensor Core requirements, such as multiples of 16 or 32 depending on the specific operation. This example shows how changing `ThreadsPerBlock` can increase occupancy and performance if other factors are not limited.

**Example 3: Example with Tensor Core considerations**

```c++
// Example 3: Example focused on Tensor Cores
__global__ void matrix_multiply_example3(half* a, half* b, half* c, int rows, int cols, int k) {

  int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if( row >= rows || col >= cols) return;
    half sum = 0.0f;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i += 16) {
      half tile_a[16];
      half tile_b[16];
        for(int j = 0; j < 16; ++j){
            tile_a[j] = a[row*k + i + j];
            tile_b[j] = b[(i+j)*cols+ col];
        }
      // Tensor Core Operation Here (simplified)
      for(int m = 0; m < 16; ++m){
          sum += tile_a[m] * tile_b[m];
      }

    }
  c[row * cols + col] = sum;
}

// Launch Configuration
const int rows = 1024;
const int cols = 1024;
const int k = 1024;
dim3 threadsPerBlock(32, 8); // Block size that aligns with tensor core
dim3 numBlocks((cols + threadsPerBlock.x - 1) / threadsPerBlock.x,
              (rows + threadsPerBlock.y - 1) / threadsPerBlock.y);

matrix_multiply_example3<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(a_d, b_d, c_d, rows, cols, k);
```

This final example uses half-precision floating points (`half`) which are commonly used with Tensor Cores. The key here is the loop over `k` by steps of 16, this allows the simulated use of tensor core, in practice this code would need to be replaced by intrinsic instructions which are specific to the tensor cores. The `threadsPerBlock` is carefully selected to be 32x8. Choosing block size which aligns with the tensor cores is key to achieving optimal performance. The example shows the importance of tailoring the code and thread configuration to make use of the specific hardware on the NVIDIA GPU.

These examples clearly show that neither parameter operates in isolation.  Tuning `NumBlocks` and `ThreadsPerBlock` is an iterative process that requires experimentation, as the optimal settings are intimately tied to both the application and the target GPU architecture.

To deepen understanding, I recommend exploring resources that discuss CUDA occupancy, memory hierarchy, and Tensor Core programming models. The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation provides a comprehensive overview of these concepts. Resources focused on GPU architecture and performance analysis, such as those discussing warp execution and memory access patterns, are equally useful. Understanding these factors is paramount for effectively leveraging Tensor Cores, and in general, achieving peak performance on NVIDIA GPUs. Benchmarking and performance analysis tools are essential parts of the process. Performance testing should be done and analyzed carefully. Performance of the code can vary significantly based on the hardware and input size. Profiling the performance is an important step to make sure that the code is working correctly and is achieving optimal results.
