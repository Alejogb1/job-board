The inherent challenge in counting unique lines from a live log file, grouped by date and time, lies in the continuous nature of the data stream.  `tail -f` provides the continuous monitoring, but efficient unique line counting requires buffering and robust date/time parsing to avoid race conditions and inaccurate counts.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in high-volume server monitoring led me to develop a solution leveraging `awk`, `sort`, and `uniq`.  The key is to efficiently process chunks of the log stream while maintaining data integrity.

**1.  Explanation:**

The approach involves using `tail -f` to monitor the log file.  However, instead of directly processing each line as it arrives, we buffer the output into manageable chunks using `sed`. This buffered output is then piped to `awk` for date/time parsing and unique line identification.  `awk` formats the output to include the date and time, facilitating subsequent sorting and counting.  Finally, `sort` groups lines by date and time, and `uniq -c` counts the unique entries within each group.

The crucial component is the `awk` script.  This script needs to accurately extract the date and time from each log line.  The specific format of the date and time will depend on your log file, and therefore this portion must be adapted accordingly. I've encountered numerous log formats across different systems (Apache, Nginx, custom applications), and successfully adapted the `awk` script accordingly.  Assume, for the purpose of these examples, a common log format including a timestamp at the beginning of each line,  e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` followed by a message.  The `awk` script will extract this timestamp and use it as a key for grouping.

Error handling, especially regarding unexpected log line formats, is critical. My experience shows that a robust solution should include mechanisms to handle lines that do not conform to the expected format, preventing errors and ensuring the process continues without interruption. This is typically addressed within the `awk` script itself using conditional statements and error handling constructs.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Basic Unique Line Counting (Assumes YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS timestamp):**

```bash
tail -f /path/to/logfile | sed '$!N;s/\n/&&/;D' | awk '{date_time = $1 " " $2; line = $0; unique_lines[date_time, line]++;} END {for (key in unique_lines) print key, unique_lines[key]}' | sort | uniq -c
```

*   `tail -f /path/to/logfile`: Monitors the log file for changes.
*   `sed '$!N;s/\n/&&/;D'`: Buffers the output in blocks, preventing `awk` from processing individual lines too rapidly.  This is especially important for high-volume logs. This sed command reads two lines at a time before processing, reducing the overhead on awk.
*   `awk '{date_time = $1 " " $2; line = $0; unique_lines[date_time, line]++;} END {for (key in unique_lines) print key, unique_lines[key]}'`: Extracts the date and time (assuming the first two fields), creates a composite key combining date/time and the full line, and increments the count for each unique combination. Finally, it iterates through the array and prints the date/time and the associated count.
*   `sort`: Sorts the output by date and time, crucial for grouping.
*   `uniq -c`: Counts the occurrences of each unique line within the sorted output.

**Example 2: Handling Log Lines without Timestamps:**

This example demonstrates adaptation for log files without a consistently formatted timestamp at the beginning of each line.  Instead, it defaults to grouping by line content only, which might be suitable if date/time information is embedded within the log message itself or unavailable.

```bash
tail -f /path/to/logfile | sed '$!N;s/\n/&&/;D' | awk '{line = $0; unique_lines[line]++;} END {for (key in unique_lines) print key, unique_lines[key]}' | sort | uniq -c
```

Note the simplification of the `awk` script, omitting date/time extraction.  The `unique_lines` array is indexed directly by the entire line.

**Example 3:  Improved Error Handling and Log Line Parsing:**

This example incorporates error handling and a more robust parsing scheme, making it more resilient to variations in log line format.

```bash
tail -f /path/to/logfile | sed '$!N;s/\n/&&/;D' | awk 'BEGIN {FS=" ";} {if (NF >= 2) {date_time = $1 " " $2;  line = $0; unique_lines[date_time, line]++;} else {print "Invalid log line: " $0 >> "/tmp/log_errors.txt";}} END {for (key in unique_lines) print key, unique_lines[key]}' | sort | uniq -c
```

*   `BEGIN {FS=" ";}`: Sets the field separator to a space, improving parsing flexibility.
*   `if (NF >= 2)`: Checks if there are at least two fields (date and time assumed).
*   `print "Invalid log line: " $0 >> "/tmp/log_errors.txt"`:  Handles lines without sufficient fields, redirecting them to an error log file for later review.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The GNU `awk` manual: Essential for understanding `awk`'s capabilities and syntax.
*   The `sed` manual: Covers the powerful stream editing commands available in `sed`.
*   A comprehensive guide on regular expressions:  Crucial for flexible pattern matching in log file parsing.  Regular expressions can vastly enhance the adaptability of the awk script to handle variations in log line formats.
*   A good text editor with syntax highlighting:  For easier development, debugging, and maintenance of the `awk` scripts.

This response provides a solid foundation. Remember that adaptation based on your log file's specific format is crucial.  Consider further enhancements, such as implementing more sophisticated date/time parsing using `strftime` within `awk`, adding more robust error handling, and possibly employing a more sophisticated buffering mechanism depending on the volume and complexity of your log data.  Testing these scripts thoroughly with sample log data is essential before deploying them in a production environment.
