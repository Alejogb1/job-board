The core challenge in time series forecasting with TensorFlow, when aiming to prevent data leakage from labels into the input features, lies in the careful construction of the input pipeline and the model architecture itself.  My experience working on high-frequency financial predictions taught me the hard way that even seemingly minor oversights in data preparation can lead to significant overfitting and ultimately, poor generalization on unseen data.  Failing to properly separate input and output during data preprocessing will invariably lead to a model that memorizes the target instead of learning the underlying temporal patterns.  This response will address this by illustrating the correct methodology for constructing training data and deploying it within TensorFlow models.

**1.  Clear Explanation of the Problem and Solution**

The problem stems from the inherent sequential nature of time series data.  A naive approach might simply shift the time series to create input-output pairs. For example, if we have a sequence [a, b, c, d, e], one might create an input [a, b, c, d] and output [e].  However, this approach fails if the output (e) is directly or indirectly included in the calculation of input features (a,b,c,d).  This is data leakage â€“ the model is "cheating" by utilizing future information.  To avoid this, all features used in the input must be strictly predetermined and independent of the target variable at the prediction time.

The solution involves a meticulously designed data preprocessing step.  This step must ensure that the input features are constructed exclusively from information available *prior* to the time point at which the prediction is being made.  This entails identifying all potentially problematic features, and either removing them from consideration or constructing substitutes using only past information.  The choice between removal or substitution depends on the nature of the feature and its importance in the modeling process.

For example, if a feature represents a rolling average of the past three observations, it's inherently safe.  Conversely, a feature derived from a future value, even indirectly, is unacceptable.  Another crucial consideration is how the model architecture handles the temporal dependencies.  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are natural fits for time series data due to their ability to capture long-range temporal patterns without explicit feature engineering.  However, even with LSTMs, careful construction of the input remains paramount.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

These examples demonstrate the preprocessing and modeling steps using TensorFlow/Keras.  Each example progressively tackles more complex scenarios.

**Example 1: Simple Time Series with Lagged Features**

This example uses a simple lagged feature approach.  Let's assume our time series is represented by a single variable: `data`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

data = np.random.rand(100) # Example data

def create_dataset(data, lookback):
  Xs, ys = [], []
  for i in range(len(data)-lookback):
    Xs.append(data[i:(i+lookback)])
    ys.append(data[i+lookback])
  return np.array(Xs), np.array(ys)

lookback = 10
X, y = create_dataset(data, lookback)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.LSTM(50, input_shape=(lookback, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100)
```

This code explicitly avoids data leakage by creating lagged features.  The `lookback` parameter determines how many previous time steps to use as input.  The output is the next time step.  Crucially, no future information is used.

**Example 2: Multiple Features with Feature Engineering**

This example demonstrates handling multiple features, some of which may require engineering to ensure past-only information.  Assume we have features `feature1`, `feature2`, and a target `target`.

```python
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature1': np.random.rand(100),
    'feature2': np.random.rand(100),
    'target': np.random.rand(100)
})

# Data preprocessing: scaling and lag creation
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'target']])
lookback = 10

X, y = [], []
for i in range(len(scaled_data)-lookback):
    X.append(scaled_data[i:i+lookback, :2]) # Only past feature1 & feature2
    y.append(scaled_data[i+lookback, 2]) # Future target

X, y = np.array(X), np.array(y)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(50, input_shape=(lookback, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100)

```
Here,  we explicitly select only `feature1` and `feature2` for the input, ensuring the target variable is excluded.  The `MinMaxScaler` normalizes the data, a common practice in time series analysis.

**Example 3: Handling External Regressors**

This example incorporates external regressors, which represent information not directly from the time series itself.  Careful attention must be paid to ensure these regressors also don't contain future information.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
time_series = np.random.rand(100,1)
external_regressors = np.random.rand(100,3) # Assume 3 external regressors
lookback = 10

X, y = [], []
for i in range(len(time_series)-lookback):
    X.append(np.concatenate((time_series[i:i+lookback], external_regressors[i:i+lookback]), axis=1))
    y.append(time_series[i+lookback])

X, y = np.array(X), np.array(y)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.LSTM(50, input_shape=(lookback,4)), # 1 time series + 3 external regressors
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100)
```

This example shows that external regressors are treated as additional input features, but their selection must ensure they are entirely independent of the future target values.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of time series forecasting using TensorFlow and Keras, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation and tutorials.  Furthermore, dedicated textbooks on time series analysis and forecasting provide a solid theoretical foundation.  Finally, research papers focusing on LSTM architectures and their application to time series problems offer valuable insights into advanced techniques.  Examining example projects and code repositories publicly available can also help solidify understanding and offer practical application examples.  Careful study of these resources will significantly enhance one's ability to design effective and robust time series forecasting models.
