The limitations encountered when training small neural networks (<2k parameters) with Keras optimizers stem not from the network size itself, but rather from the interplay between optimizer hyperparameters, learning rate scheduling, and the inherent properties of the loss landscape for such minimally parameterized models.  My experience working on resource-constrained embedded systems solidified this understanding.  While larger networks might benefit from sophisticated optimization strategies and complex learning rate schedules to navigate intricate loss landscapes, smaller networks often exhibit simpler, potentially flatter, surfaces.  This can lead to situations where default optimizer settings, designed for larger, more complex models, prove overly aggressive or inefficient.

**1.  Explanation:**

Keras optimizers, like Adam, RMSprop, and SGD, employ adaptive learning rates and momentum mechanisms. These are particularly effective in higher-dimensional parameter spaces, smoothing out the optimization path and aiding convergence.  However, with a small number of parameters, the search space is significantly reduced. The inherent stochasticity within mini-batch gradient descent, even with sophisticated optimizers, can lead to oscillations or premature convergence in these reduced spaces.  The default learning rates, typically suited for larger networks with potentially noisy gradients, might be far too high for a small network, resulting in the optimizer "overshooting" the optimal parameter values. This often manifests as the loss function failing to decrease monotonically, instead exhibiting wild fluctuations or stagnating at suboptimal levels.

Furthermore,  the interaction between momentum and the small parameter count becomes critical.  Momentum, while generally beneficial, can become detrimental in low-dimensional spaces if the optimizer gains excessive velocity, causing it to persistently overshoot the minimum.  The accumulated momentum from previous gradient updates might outweigh the gradient signal itself, leading to instability.

Finally, the choice of loss function plays a crucial role.  Non-convex loss functions, common in many machine learning tasks, can possess multiple local minima.  For larger networks, the probability of settling into a poor local minimum is generally lower due to the higher dimensionality. However, this probability increases for smaller networks.  An overly aggressive optimizer, driven by an inappropriate learning rate, might get trapped in a poor local minimum, appearing to reach a limit while still far from the global optimum.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate potential issues and their remedies using the Adam optimizer.  These examples assume a simple binary classification task with a small, fully-connected network.


**Example 1:  Default Adam, Excessive Learning Rate:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

#Small network definition
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Default Adam, prone to oscillations or divergence
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training - potential for instability
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)
```

This example demonstrates the potential for instability with default Adam. The learning rate might be too high for this small network, leading to oscillations or divergence.  I have encountered this scenario numerous times while fine-tuning models for extremely limited hardware.


**Example 2: Reduced Learning Rate:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

#Small network definition (same as above)
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Adam with reduced learning rate
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.0001)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training - more stable
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)
```

Here, we explicitly reduce the learning rate. This simple adjustment often proves effective in stabilizing the training process for small networks.  Experimentation with even lower rates might be necessary.  This was a common debugging step in my work.


**Example 3:  Adam with Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ReduceLROnPlateau

#Small network definition (same as above)
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Adam with learning rate reduction on plateau
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Learning rate scheduler
lr_scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.1, patience=5, min_lr=1e-6)

# Training with scheduling
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), callbacks=[lr_scheduler])
```

This example incorporates a learning rate scheduler (`ReduceLROnPlateau`). This allows the optimizer to dynamically adjust the learning rate based on validation loss.  If the loss plateaus, the learning rate is reduced, helping to escape from potential local minima and prevent overshooting. I found this approach particularly helpful for these kinds of scenarios.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of optimization algorithms, I recommend studying the original research papers for Adam, RMSprop, and SGD.  Furthermore, a comprehensive text on numerical optimization techniques will provide a strong theoretical foundation. Finally, texts covering deep learning theory and practice will offer insights into the behavior of optimizers within the context of neural network training.  A thorough grasp of these principles is crucial for effectively tackling the challenges posed by training small networks.
