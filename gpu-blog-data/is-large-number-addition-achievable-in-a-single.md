The feasibility of large number addition within a single FPGA clock cycle hinges critically on the word size and available FPGA resources.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing on Xilinx Virtex-7 and UltraScale+ devices has shown that while theoretically possible for smaller numbers, achieving this for truly "large" numbers – say, exceeding 64 bits –  in a single clock cycle is generally impractical without significant compromises.  The inherent limitations of carry propagation and the finite routing resources within the FPGA fabric pose substantial challenges.

**1.  Explanation of the Fundamental Limitation:**

The core problem lies in the fundamental nature of addition.  Even with carry-lookahead adders (CLAs), which significantly reduce the critical path delay compared to ripple-carry adders (RCAs), the time required for addition scales logarithmically with the number of bits.  While CLAs are significantly faster than RCAs for large numbers, they still require multiple logic levels for signal propagation to resolve the carry bits for the most significant bits (MSBs).  The depth of these logic levels directly translates to clock cycle time requirements.  FPGA resources are structured as a fabric of logic cells interconnected by routing channels.  As the number of bits increases, the required logic cell count and the complexity of interconnections grow, making it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to meet the timing constraints for a single-cycle operation at typical FPGA clock frequencies.  Furthermore, the physical limitations of signal propagation across the FPGA chip, including delays through routing resources, further constrain the achievable clock speed.

Consider a 1024-bit addition.  A naïve implementation using a ripple-carry adder would have a critical path of 1024 logic levels, which is prohibitively long.  Even with a CLA, the critical path, though considerably shorter, still comprises multiple logic levels, necessitating a slower clock speed or sophisticated pipeline techniques to meet timing closure.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different approaches and their limitations:

**Example 1:  Ripple-Carry Adder (VHDL)**

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity rca is
  generic (DATA_WIDTH : integer := 32);
  port (
    a, b : in unsigned(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
    sum : out unsigned(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
    carry_out : out std_logic
  );
end entity rca;

architecture behavioral of rca is
  signal carry : unsigned(DATA_WIDTH downto 0);
begin
  carry(0) <= '0';
  sum <= a + b + carry(0);
  carry_out <= carry(DATA_WIDTH);
end architecture behavioral;
```

This simple ripple-carry adder is suitable only for small word sizes due to its long critical path (proportional to `DATA_WIDTH`).  For larger `DATA_WIDTH`, it will fail timing closure in almost all scenarios unless a drastically reduced clock frequency is used.


**Example 2: Carry-Lookahead Adder (VHDL - simplified)**

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity cla is
  generic (DATA_WIDTH : integer := 32);
  port (
    a, b : in unsigned(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
    sum : out unsigned(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
    carry_out : out std_logic
  );
end entity cla;

architecture behavioral of cla is
  --Implementation of CLA logic would be significantly more complex here,
  -- involving generation of propagate and generate signals. This is a simplified example.
  -- A full CLA implementation would require significant code.
  signal carry : unsigned(DATA_WIDTH downto 0);
begin
  --Simplified CLA logic - replace with full implementation
  carry(0) <= '0';
  sum <= a + b + carry(0);
  carry_out <= carry(DATA_WIDTH);

end architecture behavioral;
```

This example only outlines a carry-lookahead adder. A fully functional CLA implementation would be much more complex, involving the generation of propagate and generate signals,  but still likely wouldn't suffice for truly large numbers in a single cycle on a typical FPGA.  The complexity grows with increasing `DATA_WIDTH`, impacting the critical path and making single-cycle operation challenging.


**Example 3: Pipelined Adder (VHDL - conceptual)**

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity pipelined_adder is
  generic (DATA_WIDTH : integer := 1024);
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    rst : in std_logic;
    a, b : in unsigned(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0);
    sum : out unsigned(DATA_WIDTH-1 downto 0)
  );
end entity pipelined_adder;

architecture behavioral of pipelined_adder is
  --Implementation of a pipelined CLA or other adder structure.  Requires multiple registers to break down the critical path.
  --This example is highly simplified and omits crucial details.  A real implementation would involve several pipeline stages.
begin
  --Register stages for pipelining
  --... (Pipelining logic omitted for brevity) ...
end architecture behavioral;
```

This example demonstrates the use of pipelining, a standard technique to improve clock frequency by breaking down the critical path into smaller segments separated by registers. Pipelining would allow for a higher clock frequency, though at the cost of latency (the result would be available after multiple clock cycles). Pipelining is the practical solution for high-performance large number arithmetic on FPGAs.  It is not a single-cycle solution, however.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of high-speed arithmetic in FPGAs, I recommend consulting texts on digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms and high-performance computing (HPC) on FPGAs.  A strong grasp of digital logic design and VHDL or Verilog is crucial.  Understanding different adder architectures, including carry-lookahead, carry-save, and carry-propagate adders, is essential.  Finally, familiarity with FPGA architecture, specifically the placement and routing aspects that heavily impact timing closure, is paramount.
