TensorFlow, by default, often distributes operations across available GPUs without explicit user control over the placement of gradient computations. This can lead to unexpected performance bottlenecks, especially when a specific GPU has more available resources or a unique architecture that favors particular operations. To address this, I've found through years of experience in model training that explicit device placement using TensorFlow's mechanisms is crucial for optimized performance and reproducible experiments.

The core principle revolves around controlling where operations, including gradient calculations, are executed. TensorFlow’s operation placement is influenced by several factors, including the `tf.device` context manager, resource assignment through `tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices`, and, sometimes implicitly, by the characteristics of the operations themselves. The challenge is ensuring that the gradient-related operations – those generated during the backpropagation process – are also placed on the target GPU. When training large models, it's not enough to place the forward pass calculations on the desired device; you must also dictate the gradients' location. Otherwise, you might find your backward pass, and thus the optimizer's application of those gradients, hopping devices, severely impacting performance.

The most direct approach for pinning gradients involves utilizing `tf.device` to wrap the gradient computation context explicitly. This ensures that the operations performed to calculate the gradients associated with a variable are executed on a specified GPU. You need to do this inside your custom training loop because that is where you will use automatic differentiation with `tf.GradientTape`, which is where gradients are calculated.

Let’s examine a scenario where a model is trained on a single GPU, specifically `GPU:0`, and all gradient calculations should occur there.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Ensure only the first GPU is visible. This is important for reproducibility, but
# only if you have more than one GPU
tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')[0], 'GPU')

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, kernel_initializer='ones', use_bias=False)

    def call(self, x):
        return self.dense(x)


model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Define the loss function
loss_object = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

def train_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_object(labels, predictions)

    # explicitly place all gradient calculations on 'GPU:0'
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss


# Generate some dummy data
inputs = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
labels = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

for epoch in range(100):
    loss = train_step(inputs, labels)
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")

print(f"Final Weights {model.trainable_variables[0].numpy()}")
```

In this example, the `tf.device('/GPU:0')` context ensures that the `tape.gradient()` call and, consequently, the backward pass computations, are restricted to the designated GPU. Without this context, the `tape.gradient()` operation might be placed on a different GPU, or on the CPU, if available. Critically, I use `tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices` to isolate the first GPU. This is a useful tool for ensuring that the code behaves consistently when run on systems with varying configurations.

For a more complex scenario, consider a multi-GPU setup where model parallelization is used, and each model replica needs its gradients calculated on its corresponding GPU. Here is an example of a simplified version of the logic to demonstrate the pinning:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

num_gpus = 2 # Assuming two GPUs available
if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) < num_gpus:
  raise ValueError("Not enough GPUs available")
gpu_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(gpu_devices, 'GPU')

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, kernel_initializer='ones', use_bias=False)

    def call(self, x):
        return self.dense(x)


models = [SimpleModel() for _ in range(num_gpus)]
optimizers = [tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01) for _ in range(num_gpus)]
loss_object = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

def train_step(inputs, labels):
    losses = []
    grads = []

    for i in range(num_gpus):
        input_slice = inputs[i::num_gpus]
        label_slice = labels[i::num_gpus]

        with tf.device(f'/GPU:{i}'): # Pin the calculations to different GPUs
            with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
                predictions = models[i](input_slice)
                loss = loss_object(label_slice, predictions)
            gradients = tape.gradient(loss, models[i].trainable_variables)
        losses.append(loss)
        grads.append(gradients)
    # Apply the gradients in each replica
    for i in range(num_gpus):
        optimizers[i].apply_gradients(zip(grads[i], models[i].trainable_variables))


    return losses



# Generate some dummy data
inputs = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0],[4.0], [5.0], [6.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
labels = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0],[8.0], [10.0], [12.0]], dtype=tf.float32)


for epoch in range(100):
  losses = train_step(inputs, labels)
  avg_loss = tf.reduce_mean(losses)
  print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {avg_loss.numpy()}")

print(f"Final weights on GPU0: {models[0].trainable_variables[0].numpy()}")
print(f"Final weights on GPU1: {models[1].trainable_variables[0].numpy()}")

```

Here, within the loop, each portion of the data is processed on a dedicated GPU, and gradient calculations associated with each model instance are explicitly pinned to their corresponding GPU using `tf.device(f'/GPU:{i}')`. This is a crucial aspect of data parallelism and requires each replica to perform computations, including gradient calculation, independently on its assigned device.

An edge case arises with operations that TensorFlow might automatically place on the CPU. If a complex, custom operation is used that TensorFlow does not have a GPU-accelerated implementation, it will default to the CPU, even if you request it with a `tf.device` context manager. The gradients from such operations, if they participate in backpropagation, will then originate on the CPU.  For these, it is often necessary to manually implement a custom GPU kernel. However, I am not aware of a universal way to force TensorFlow to keep these gradient calculations on the GPU, other than by providing a GPU implementation of the operation.

The following example shows that even if we wrap the gradient calculation in `tf.device`, if the operation is not available on the target device, then the gradient calculation is performed elsewhere:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Ensure only the first GPU is visible. This is important for reproducibility, but
# only if you have more than one GPU
tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')[0], 'GPU')

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, kernel_initializer='ones', use_bias=False)

    def call(self, x):
        # this operation has no GPU implementation by default
        return tf.math.angle(x+tf.complex(0.0, 1.0))

model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Define the loss function
loss_object = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

def train_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_object(labels, predictions)

    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

# Generate some dummy data
inputs = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
labels = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]], dtype=tf.float32)


for epoch in range(100):
    loss = train_step(inputs, labels)
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")

print(f"Final Weights {model.trainable_variables[0].numpy()}")

```

In this example, the operation `tf.math.angle` does not have a GPU implementation and will thus be executed on the CPU, even though the gradient calculation was explicitly wrapped in a `tf.device` block. This can be verified using the tensorflow logging tools, or by using other tools such as NVIDIA's `nsight`. This is an important consideration because forcing operations onto the GPU when they do not have an optimized implementation can dramatically decrease performance.

For further exploration, consider resources that delve into distributed training using TensorFlow. These often contain detailed guidance on device placement strategies. I have found it particularly useful to examine the official TensorFlow tutorials on multi-GPU training and the documentation on `tf.distribute.Strategy`.  These provide comprehensive examples and best practices for managing device placement in complex training scenarios. Research papers on hardware-aware deep learning can further illuminate the relationship between operation placement and performance. Consulting those would be useful in understanding the underlying principles of GPU architecture and the effects on computation. Also, review the TensorFlow API documentation thoroughly, especially regarding `tf.device`, `tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices`, and `tf.distribute`.
