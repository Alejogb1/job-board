SQL database rows are fundamentally structured data residing within a persistent storage system, typically managed by a database server process. They are not inherently objects or data structures that Node.js, or any other application environment, can directly access. Instead, access requires a communication layer facilitated by database drivers. This separation is crucial for security, data integrity, and performance.

The core issue is that Node.js, being a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code, operates entirely separately from the database server. Database servers, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server, run as independent processes, often on separate machines. They understand and manipulate SQL and the underlying data storage mechanisms. Node.js itself does not possess this capability. It only has the ability to execute JavaScript code and interact with the operating system and network interfaces. To retrieve SQL rows, we must establish communication, execute queries against the database, and then receive the results.

This communication happens via a database driver specific to each database type. The driver acts as a translator, taking high-level commands from Node.js (usually in the form of methods or functions that encapsulate SQL) and translating them into low-level network instructions that the database server understands. Conversely, the database server returns results in a format that the driver can parse and convert into data structures digestible by Node.js, typically JavaScript objects or arrays.

Without this explicit communication and translation, SQL rows are essentially inaccessible from Node.js. Node.js code cannot directly read the database files or memory where the rows reside. It's an intentionally designed architecture to avoid direct access and maintain data integrity. The isolation also promotes a modular architecture, allowing database servers to be swapped out with minimal impact on the Node.js application code, provided the interface provided by the driver is consistent. The abstraction layer provided by the driver also prevents exposing details of the database implementation to Node.js, which maintains consistency between versions of the same database system.

The process typically involves the following steps: establishing a connection to the database using a driver, executing a SQL query through the driver's API, receiving the results from the server, and processing the received data as JavaScript objects. The driver handles network communication, data serialization, and deserialization required for these operations.

Here are three code examples using `node-postgres` driver, illustrating the necessary steps for accessing SQL rows, along with comments to detail each stage. `node-postgres` is a common library for interfacing Node.js with PostgreSQL databases.

**Example 1: Simple SELECT Query**

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'your_username',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'your_database',
  password: 'your_password',
  port: 5432,
});

async function fetchUsers() {
  let client;
  try {
    client = await pool.connect(); // Acquire a database client connection from the pool.
    const res = await client.query('SELECT id, username FROM users'); // Execute the query.
    console.log(res.rows); // Access the rows of the result.
    // Output is an array of objects: [{ id: 1, username: 'user1' }, { id: 2, username: 'user2' }...]
    // The database row data has been converted to Javascript objects.
  } catch (err) {
      console.error('Error executing query:', err);
  } finally {
    if (client) {
      client.release(); // Release the client back to the pool.
    }
  }
}

fetchUsers();
```

In this example, a connection pool is used to manage connections to the database. This is common practice as it is more efficient than opening and closing connections for every query. The `pool.connect()` acquires a client which is then used to execute a SQL query.  The `res.rows` property contains the result set, an array of JavaScript objects where each object maps to a row and each key corresponds to the column name. The client is then released back to the pool after execution.

**Example 2: Prepared Statements and Parameters**

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'your_username',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'your_database',
  password: 'your_password',
  port: 5432,
});


async function findUserById(userId) {
  let client;
  try {
    client = await pool.connect();
    const res = await client.query(
      'SELECT id, username, email FROM users WHERE id = $1',
       [userId]
    ); // Use a prepared statement with parameter $1.
    if (res.rows.length > 0) {
      console.log('User found:', res.rows[0]);
      //  Output is an object { id: 1, username: 'user1', email: 'user1@example.com' }
    } else {
      console.log('User not found');
    }
  } catch (err) {
      console.error('Error executing query:', err);
  } finally {
      if (client) {
        client.release();
      }
  }
}
findUserById(2);
```
This example illustrates prepared statements, a crucial feature for preventing SQL injection and improving efficiency, especially for frequent queries.  The `$1` represents a placeholder for the parameter which is supplied as an array in the second argument to the `query()` function. The returned result is an object matching the retrieved row.

**Example 3: Inserting and Retrieving Data**

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
    user: 'your_username',
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'your_database',
    password: 'your_password',
    port: 5432,
});

async function createUser(username, email) {
  let client;
  try {
      client = await pool.connect();
    await client.query(
      'INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ($1, $2)',
      [username, email]
    ); // Insert a new user
    const res = await client.query(
        'SELECT id, username, email FROM users WHERE username = $1 AND email = $2',
         [username, email]
    );
    if (res.rows.length > 0) {
        console.log('Inserted user:', res.rows[0]); // Retrieve the inserted user
        //  Output object: { id: 3, username: 'newuser', email: 'newuser@example.com' }
    } else {
      console.log('User insert failed');
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error executing query:', err);
  } finally {
    if (client) {
      client.release();
    }
  }
}

createUser('newuser', 'newuser@example.com');
```

This example demonstrates both inserting data into the database and then retrieving the inserted record.  The SQL `INSERT` statement is executed, followed by a `SELECT` statement to fetch the newly inserted record and verify successful creation. The ability to perform both write and read operations is integral to working with a SQL database in Node.js.

To summarize, SQL rows are not directly accessible in Node.js because of architectural separation between the Node.js runtime environment and the database server. Communication is achieved through database drivers that act as translators and bridges between the two environments. These drivers handle all the necessary data transformations between JavaScript objects and the database's binary formats. The provided examples show how queries are executed, data is retrieved and processed, and demonstrate basic interaction with a PostgreSQL database in a Node.js environment.

For further study, I would recommend exploring resources focusing on database interaction with Node.js, specifically around database drivers, connection pooling strategies, SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries, and data modeling concepts. Look for tutorials and documentation specific to the database of choice like PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQL Server.
Understanding the concepts of relational database management, SQL syntax, transaction management, and the performance implications of query design will also contribute to writing efficient and secure database interactions in Node.js.
