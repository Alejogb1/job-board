The core reason PyTorch, and indeed most modern deep learning frameworks, employ mini-batch gradient descent instead of batch gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent stems from a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy of the gradient estimate.  In my experience optimizing large-scale models for image recognition and natural language processing, this trade-off has consistently proven crucial for achieving both reasonable training times and satisfactory convergence.

Let me clarify: while batch gradient descent calculates the gradient using the *entire* training dataset, and stochastic gradient descent uses only *one* data point at a time, mini-batch gradient descent strikes a balance. It computes the gradient using a small, randomly selected subset (the mini-batch) of the training data. This seemingly minor alteration offers significant advantages.

**1. Computational Efficiency:** Processing the entire dataset in batch gradient descent is computationally expensive, especially for large datasets common in deep learning. Memory limitations become a critical bottleneck.  I recall a project involving a 100GB dataset where batch gradient descent was simply infeasible.  Mini-batch gradient descent, however, allows us to process the data in manageable chunks.  The computational cost per iteration is significantly reduced because we're working with a smaller subset of data.  This directly translates to faster training times, particularly noticeable in distributed training environments.

**2. More Accurate Gradient Estimation:** Stochastic gradient descent, while computationally efficient, suffers from high variance in gradient estimates.  The gradient calculated from a single data point is noisy and can lead to erratic updates, hindering convergence.  Mini-batch gradient descent mitigates this issue by averaging the gradients across multiple data points within the mini-batch.  This averaging effect significantly reduces the noise, resulting in a more stable and accurate gradient estimate, leading to smoother and more reliable convergence.

**3. Escape from Saddle Points and Local Minima:**  In high-dimensional parameter spaces typical of deep learning models, the loss function often exhibits many saddle points â€“ flat regions where the gradient is near zero, but not necessarily at a minimum.  Stochastic gradient descent tends to get stuck in these regions, hindering optimization. Mini-batch gradient descent, due to the inherent noise introduced by the random sampling of mini-batches, helps to escape these saddle points and explore the parameter space more effectively, ultimately leading to better solutions.

Now, let's illustrate this with code examples:

**Example 1: Batch Gradient Descent (Illustrative, not practical for large datasets)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Sample data and model (replace with your actual data and model)
X = torch.randn(1000, 10)
y = torch.randn(1000, 1)
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Batch Gradient Descent
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

This example demonstrates the basic principle of batch gradient descent.  Note that the `backward()` call computes the gradient for the entire dataset.  For larger datasets, this would be highly inefficient and potentially lead to memory errors.

**Example 2: Stochastic Gradient Descent**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Sample data and model (as before)
# ...

# Stochastic Gradient Descent
for epoch in range(100):
    for i in range(len(X)):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(X[i].unsqueeze(0)) #Process one data point at a time
        loss = criterion(outputs, y[i].unsqueeze(0))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

This code showcases stochastic gradient descent. Each data point triggers a separate gradient calculation and update. The high variance in updates is a noticeable drawback in practice, leading to unstable training.

**Example 3: Mini-batch Gradient Descent**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Sample data and model (as before)
# ...
batch_size = 32

# Mini-batch Gradient Descent
for epoch in range(100):
    for i in range(0, len(X), batch_size):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        batch_X = X[i:i + batch_size]
        batch_y = y[i:i + batch_size]
        outputs = model(batch_X)
        loss = criterion(outputs, batch_y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

This example demonstrates mini-batch gradient descent. The training data is processed in batches of size 32. This balances the computational efficiency of stochastic gradient descent with the stability of batch gradient descent.  The choice of `batch_size` is crucial and often requires experimentation.  I've found that values between 32 and 512 frequently yield good results, but this depends heavily on the dataset size and model complexity.

In conclusion, PyTorch's reliance on mini-batch gradient descent is a deliberate design choice grounded in the need for efficient and stable training of deep learning models.  The careful selection of mini-batch size is an important hyperparameter influencing training performance, and adjusting this parameter often forms a significant part of my model optimization workflow.
