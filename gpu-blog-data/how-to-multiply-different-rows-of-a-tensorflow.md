Multiplying different rows of a TensorFlow matrix by different scalars requires careful consideration of tensor broadcasting and element-wise operations. I've encountered this scenario numerous times in my work on custom loss functions and dynamic layer scaling for deep learning models. The key is aligning the scalar multipliers with the matrix structure to leverage TensorFlow’s optimized operations. Directly applying scalar multiplication to the entire matrix would scale every element uniformly; thus, a row-specific operation needs a more precise approach.

The core principle involves creating a vector of scalar multipliers that has the same number of elements as the matrix has rows. TensorFlow then employs broadcasting rules, effectively expanding the scalar vector into a matrix of the same shape, facilitating element-wise multiplication. The element-wise operation then applies the appropriate multiplier to each corresponding row.

Consider a scenario where we wish to scale each row of a matrix based on a specific value, perhaps from a learned parameter or derived from other calculations. This often occurs when creating attention mechanisms or applying per-example weighting in machine learning contexts.

Here’s a practical implementation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def scale_rows(matrix, scalars):
  """Scales each row of a matrix by a corresponding scalar.

  Args:
      matrix: A TensorFlow tensor representing the matrix.
      scalars: A TensorFlow tensor representing the scalar multipliers.

  Returns:
      A TensorFlow tensor representing the scaled matrix.
  """
  scalars_reshaped = tf.reshape(scalars, (-1, 1))
  scaled_matrix = matrix * scalars_reshaped
  return scaled_matrix

# Example usage
matrix = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
scalars = tf.constant([0.5, 2.0, 1.0], dtype=tf.float32)

scaled_result = scale_rows(matrix, scalars)
print(scaled_result)

```

In this code, the `scale_rows` function takes the matrix and a vector of scalars as input. The scalars are reshaped from a vector into a column vector using `tf.reshape(scalars, (-1, 1))`. This reshaping is crucial; broadcasting in TensorFlow will expand this column vector across the columns of the matrix, applying the correct scalar to each row. The `*` operator then performs element-wise multiplication, scaling each row accordingly. The provided example demonstrates usage with a 3x3 matrix and a corresponding vector of three scalars.

Another common need arises when dealing with dynamically sized batch inputs. Here, it's imperative that the scalar vector has the same first dimension as the input matrix. If not, a mismatch in shape would result in a broadcasting error. The following code exemplifies handling variable batch sizes with dynamic scalars:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def scale_rows_dynamic(matrix, scalars):
  """Scales each row of a matrix by a corresponding scalar, handles dynamic batch.

  Args:
      matrix: A TensorFlow tensor representing the matrix (batch dimension first).
      scalars: A TensorFlow tensor representing the scalar multipliers (batch dimension first).

  Returns:
       A TensorFlow tensor representing the scaled matrix.
  """
  matrix_shape = tf.shape(matrix)
  batch_size = matrix_shape[0]
  scalars_reshaped = tf.reshape(scalars, (batch_size, 1))
  scaled_matrix = matrix * scalars_reshaped
  return scaled_matrix


# Example with dynamic batch size
matrix_dynamic = tf.constant([[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], [[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]], dtype=tf.float32)
scalars_dynamic = tf.constant([[0.5], [2.0]], dtype=tf.float32) # scalars needs to be a column vector here
scaled_dynamic = scale_rows_dynamic(matrix_dynamic, scalars_dynamic)
print(scaled_dynamic)


matrix_dynamic_2 = tf.constant([[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]]], dtype=tf.float32)
scalars_dynamic_2 = tf.constant([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]], dtype=tf.float32)
scaled_dynamic_2 = scale_rows_dynamic(matrix_dynamic_2, scalars_dynamic_2)
print(scaled_dynamic_2)
```

This `scale_rows_dynamic` function utilizes `tf.shape(matrix)[0]` to extract the batch size from the input matrix. This allows the code to handle tensors with varying leading dimensions, often found in mini-batch training scenarios. The reshaping of the scalar vector is explicitly constrained using this dynamic dimension. The input `scalars` are here defined as a column vector. Note how the operations work as a batch, where each batch of matrix is multiplied by the corresponding scalar.

Finally, scenarios may present the scalars as a 2D tensor with potentially more columns. If the intent is to multiply each *row* of the input matrix by the *corresponding row* of scalars, broadcasting the scalars becomes critical to match the matrix’s structure. This is shown in the code below:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def scale_rows_with_column_scalar(matrix, scalars):
  """Scales each row of a matrix by a corresponding row of scalars.

  Args:
      matrix: A TensorFlow tensor representing the matrix.
      scalars: A TensorFlow tensor representing the scalar multipliers.

  Returns:
      A TensorFlow tensor representing the scaled matrix.
  """
  
  scaled_matrix = matrix * scalars
  return scaled_matrix


# Example usage
matrix_2 = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
scalars_2 = tf.constant([[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [2.0, 2.0, 2.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

scaled_result_2 = scale_rows_with_column_scalar(matrix_2, scalars_2)
print(scaled_result_2)


matrix_3 = tf.constant([[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]], [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]]], dtype=tf.float32)
scalars_3 = tf.constant([[[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [2.0, 2.0, 2.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]], [[0.1, 0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.2, 0.2], [0.3, 0.3, 0.3]]], dtype=tf.float32)

scaled_result_3 = scale_rows_with_column_scalar(matrix_3, scalars_3)
print(scaled_result_3)
```

Here, `scale_rows_with_column_scalar` directly performs the scaling using the element-wise multiplication operator when the `scalars` tensor has the same number of columns as the matrix. Broadcasting enables TensorFlow to align the rows of the `scalars` tensor correctly with the `matrix`.

For further exploration, I suggest reviewing resources focusing on TensorFlow's broadcasting rules and element-wise operations, specifically the documentation related to `tf.reshape` and `tf.multiply`. Also, examination of tutorials on common neural network architectures using TensorFlow, especially custom layers and loss functions, can provide additional context on these kinds of operations. It is also often helpful to look into practical applications involving attention mechanisms, which frequently make use of these multiplication strategies. These resources together provide a solid background for performing such scalar multiplications in complex TensorFlow workflows. Understanding this enables more fine-grained control over numerical computations and parameter interactions within the framework.
