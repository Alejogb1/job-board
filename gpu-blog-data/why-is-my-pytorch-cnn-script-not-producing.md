The observed discrepancy between expected and actual results from a PyTorch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) script often stems from a confluence of subtle issues within the data preprocessing, network architecture, training loop, and evaluation process. Having spent several years debugging deep learning models, I've found that these errors frequently aren’t immediately apparent and necessitate systematic investigation.

A primary culprit, frequently overlooked, is inadequate data preprocessing. Deep learning models, particularly CNNs, are sensitive to the distribution of input data. Disparities between training data distribution and unseen, test data can lead to significant performance degradation. One commonly encountered problem is the absence of proper normalization. Image pixel values, commonly ranging from 0 to 255, often benefit from scaling to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1, or with mean and standard deviation normalization. Failure to do so can disrupt the learning process, as gradients might explode or vanish, especially when using activation functions such as sigmoid or tanh. Inconsistent normalization across training and testing phases is equally detrimental, as the network will encounter a different input distribution during evaluation.

Furthermore, data augmentation techniques, while powerful in preventing overfitting, must be applied carefully. Improper or excessive augmentation, such as applying rotations or scaling to images in ways that distort the underlying features, can introduce noise rather than beneficial variability. Similarly, the way labels are handled can also introduce errors. In classification tasks, incorrectly assigned labels or a lack of one-hot encoding when necessary can lead to convergence problems.

Another crucial aspect involves the CNN architecture itself. While PyTorch provides convenient abstractions for building networks, several mistakes can arise. A network that is either too shallow or too deep for the complexity of the problem at hand is unlikely to converge to an optimal solution. An underparameterized network might lack the capacity to capture the nuances of the data, leading to underfitting. Conversely, an overly complex network could overfit the training data, achieving high training accuracy but poor generalization on new examples. Choosing incorrect kernel sizes or strides for convolutional layers can also impact feature extraction capabilities. If the receptive field of convolutional layers is too small, the network may fail to capture global patterns, and too large kernels can lose local detail. Additionally, inappropriate activation functions or pooling strategies can also hinder learning. For example, using ReLU without careful initialization could result in dead neurons.

Moving to the training loop, hyperparameter choices significantly affect the training outcome. A learning rate that is too high can cause oscillations and prevent convergence, while an overly low learning rate can result in slow convergence or getting trapped in local minima. Batch size, which influences the estimation of gradients, also needs careful adjustment. Too large a batch size might lead to poor generalization, while too small a batch size can introduce noise into the training process. Selection of the optimizer is also crucial. Optimizers such as Adam or SGD with momentum can significantly impact the speed and quality of convergence. Incorrectly setting parameters for momentum or weight decay can again lead to suboptimal training.

The use of regularization techniques, while often essential to combat overfitting, also requires judicious application. Improper dropout or weight decay can sometimes cause underfitting or lead to slower convergence. The order of data loading matters too: shuffling data during training is necessary to prevent the model from memorizing patterns based on the ordering of the dataset rather than learning inherent features. Finally, errors in the training loop can arise from the loss function itself. If the loss function does not accurately measure the discrepancy between prediction and ground truth, learning may not be aligned with desired objectives. For instance, using mean squared error for a multi-class classification task is inappropriate.

Finally, the evaluation process can introduce errors. Metrics like accuracy might not be informative for imbalanced datasets, making metrics like precision, recall or F1 scores more suitable. It’s essential to test the model on a held-out test set, entirely separate from both training and validation, to truly gauge its ability to generalize to unseen data. Evaluating the model with only the training dataset can be misleading, creating a false sense of high performance.

To illustrate these points, let's examine specific scenarios through code examples.

**Example 1: Data Normalization and Augmentation Issues**

```python
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torchvision.datasets import CIFAR10
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Incorrect normalization and no augmentation
transform_incorrect = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor()
    # No normalization or augmentation here
])

# Correct normalization and augmentation example
transform_correct = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)) # Assuming 3 channel images like CIFAR10
])

cifar10_incorrect = CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform_incorrect)
cifar10_correct = CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform_correct)

train_loader_incorrect = DataLoader(cifar10_incorrect, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
train_loader_correct = DataLoader(cifar10_correct, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

```
In the first `transform_incorrect` case, the images are converted into tensors, but there is no normalization or data augmentation. This might prevent the model from learning quickly or lead to unstable gradient updates. `transform_correct` applies a horizontal flip for augmentation and normalizes the images to the range of [-1,1]. This is crucial for many pre-trained models and can lead to better training outcomes. The loaders are then created using these respective transforms to highlight the difference in the input data.

**Example 2: Network Architecture Issues**

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ShallowCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ShallowCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16*32*32, 10) # Assumes input size of 32x32

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = x.view(-1, 16*32*32)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x


class DeeperCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DeeperCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2,2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64*8*8, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 64*8*8)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

shallow_model = ShallowCNN()
deeper_model = DeeperCNN()

```
The `ShallowCNN` has a single convolution layer and a fully connected layer. This architecture might be too simple for complex tasks, leading to underfitting. The `DeeperCNN` has two convolutional layers, max-pooling layers and two fully-connected layers. It is likely to exhibit better performance for complex datasets, at the cost of more parameters and potentially more overfitting if not handled appropriately.  The input to the fully connected layers also needs to match the correct output of the final convolutional and pooling layers.

**Example 3: Training Loop and Loss Function Issues**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision.datasets import CIFAR10
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# Data setup
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))])
cifar10 = CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
train_loader = DataLoader(cifar10, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

# Model setup
model = DeeperCNN()
# Incorrect loss (MSE for classification)
criterion_incorrect = nn.MSELoss()
# Correct loss (CrossEntropy for classification)
criterion_correct = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Minimal training loop example (incorrect loss)
for epoch in range(1):  # Simplified for demonstration purposes
    for i, data in enumerate(train_loader):
        inputs, labels = data
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion_incorrect(outputs, labels) #Incorrect loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Correct Training loop example

for epoch in range(1):
    for i, data in enumerate(train_loader):
        inputs, labels = data
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion_correct(outputs, labels)  # Correct loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```
This code snippet first defines the data loader for CIFAR10 and the deeper CNN. The most important part is the loss function: using Mean Squared Error (`nn.MSELoss`) for a classification problem is incorrect. A classification task, like CIFAR10, requires Cross Entropy Loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`). The incorrect loss calculation does not lead to proper learning. Additionally, even for the training loop, it is essential to zero out the gradients.

To better understand how to avoid these common pitfalls, I recommend exploring introductory materials on deep learning, specifically those focusing on CNNs, and further documentation on best practices. There are many resources for understanding data preprocessing techniques like normalization, standardization, and augmentation. For building networks, documentation on the modules of the `torch.nn` package is valuable. Learning about different optimizers and their parameters within the `torch.optim` package is also essential for effective training. Exploring tutorials and code examples provided by the PyTorch documentation and academic research papers, specifically those relating to image classification tasks, can provide a well-rounded perspective.
