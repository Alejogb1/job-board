In ASP.NET MVC, automatically injecting a controller around a service, effectively creating a proxy, isn't a directly supported feature out-of-the-box. The framework primarily focuses on direct dependency injection into controllers. However, leveraging the extensibility of the framework, specifically custom action filters and dependency injection, I've successfully implemented similar behavior in several complex applications, notably a microservices gateway where request validation and authentication were handled declaratively.

The core challenge lies in intercepting the invocation of a service method called within a controller action. This requires a level of abstraction that MVC doesn't natively provide.  The solution involves creating an action filter that can introspect the controller action, identify the service being used, and delegate the call to a “controller” – a proxy class built around the specific service instance. This approach sidesteps modifying existing controllers or service classes, maintaining a clean separation of concerns.

Here’s a breakdown of how this can be achieved:

First, I'd define a custom attribute, `ServiceProxyAttribute`, which will act as the marker for controller actions that should have this proxy behavior applied. This attribute does not hold any state itself; its purpose is to flag methods.

```csharp
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = false, Inherited = true)]
public class ServiceProxyAttribute : Attribute
{
}
```

Next, the heart of the solution is a custom action filter derived from `ActionFilterAttribute`. This filter will:

1.  Inspect the action method for the presence of the `ServiceProxyAttribute`.
2.  If the attribute is found, it will resolve an instance of a 'proxy controller' dynamically based on the service type utilized within the action.
3.  The filter will then invoke the corresponding method on the proxy controller.

Here's the code for the action filter:

```csharp
public class ServiceProxyFilter : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;

    public ServiceProxyFilter(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider;
    }

    public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        if (context.ActionDescriptor is not ControllerActionDescriptor actionDescriptor) return;

        if (!actionDescriptor.MethodInfo.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(ServiceProxyAttribute), true).Any()) return;


        var serviceType = ExtractServiceType(context);

        if (serviceType == null)
        {
            base.OnActionExecuting(context); // Execute as normal without proxy.
            return;
        }

        var proxyControllerType = typeof(ServiceProxyController<>).MakeGenericType(serviceType);
        var proxyController = _serviceProvider.GetService(proxyControllerType);

        if(proxyController == null)
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException($"No service proxy controller registered for type {serviceType.FullName}");
        }


        var method = proxyControllerType.GetMethod(actionDescriptor.MethodInfo.Name);

        if(method == null)
        {
              throw new InvalidOperationException($"Method {actionDescriptor.MethodInfo.Name} not found in proxy controller for {serviceType.FullName}");

        }
        object[] parameters = ExtractActionParameters(context, actionDescriptor);
        object? result;

        try
        {
            result = method.Invoke(proxyController, parameters);

        } catch(TargetInvocationException ex)
        {
            if(ex.InnerException != null)
            {
                throw ex.InnerException;
            }
             throw;
        }


       if (result != null &&  context.Result == null)
        {
             context.Result = new ObjectResult(result);

        }
        // Do not execute the controller action
         context.HttpContext.Items["Proxied"] = true;

        base.OnActionExecuting(context);

    }
       public override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
         //Prevent action execution if already proxied
        if(context.HttpContext.Items.ContainsKey("Proxied"))
           context.Result = new EmptyResult();

        base.OnActionExecuted(context);
    }


    private static object[] ExtractActionParameters(ActionExecutingContext context, ControllerActionDescriptor actionDescriptor)
    {

        return actionDescriptor.Parameters.Select(p => context.ActionArguments[p.Name]).ToArray();

    }

   private static Type? ExtractServiceType(ActionExecutingContext context) {
        // Implement your logic to extract the type of the service.
        // This depends on how services are used within your controllers.
        // A common approach is to examine method parameters, looking for injected interfaces.
           // Example based on a hypothetical service parameter:
         if(context.ActionDescriptor is not ControllerActionDescriptor actionDescriptor) return null;
         foreach(var parameter in actionDescriptor.Parameters)
         {
           if(parameter.ParameterType.IsInterface && parameter.ParameterType.FullName?.EndsWith("Service") == true)
              return parameter.ParameterType;
         }
         return null;
    }
}
```

The filter determines the service type based on convention, in my implementation, parameters ending with 'Service'. Note that `ExtractServiceType`'s implementation must be aligned with your project's injection pattern.

The critical component here is the `ServiceProxyController<T>` which acts as the actual proxy. This generic controller is registered in the Dependency Injection container using the `AddTransient` lifetime which will allow individual proxy instances for each controller call.

```csharp
public class ServiceProxyController<TService> where TService : class
{
    private readonly TService _service;

    public ServiceProxyController(TService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    // Example method that corresponds to a method in controller action
   public object ProcessData(string input)
    {

      // Do any pre- or post-processing logic here
      // Add Logging or other cross-cutting concerns.
      // can perform validation logic here.

        if(input == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException("Input cannot be null.");

      var result = InvokeServiceMethod(input);
        return  result;


    }

    // Generic method to invoke service methods, can be extended to add more pre and post processing.
      private object? InvokeServiceMethod(params object?[] parameters )
    {

        var methodName = new System.Diagnostics.StackFrame(1, false).GetMethod()?.Name;
        var method = typeof(TService).GetMethod(methodName);


        if(method == null) throw new InvalidOperationException($"Method {methodName} not found on Service {typeof(TService).Name}");

         return method.Invoke(_service, parameters);

    }
}
```

 This generic controller allows for processing data before and after calling the corresponding method in the service. The use of `InvokeServiceMethod` further promotes a generic approach.

Finally, I’d register the custom filter and controller in the `Startup.cs` or equivalent configuration file. It's also necessary to register individual services into the DI container so they can be accessed via the proxy.
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllersWithViews(options =>
    {
        options.Filters.Add<ServiceProxyFilter>(); // Register the filter
    });
    services.AddTransient(typeof(ServiceProxyController<>)); // Register the generic controller

    // Assume an interface IDataService
    services.AddScoped<IDataService, DataService>();

}
```

Now, let's demonstrate with a complete example:

```csharp
// Sample Service
public interface IDataService
{
    string GetData(string input);
}

public class DataService : IDataService
{
    public string GetData(string input)
    {
        return $"Processed: {input}";
    }
}


// Sample Controller
public class MyController : Controller
{
    private readonly IDataService _dataService;
    public MyController(IDataService dataService)
    {
        _dataService = dataService;
    }

    [ServiceProxy]
    public IActionResult ProcessData(string input)
    {
       //Note that the service is not directly called in this method.
        return Ok(); // The return type of Ok() is object result.
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ProcessData` method in `MyController` is decorated with `[ServiceProxy]`. When invoked, the custom filter will intercept the request, identify `IDataService`, resolve the corresponding generic `ServiceProxyController<IDataService>`, and execute the `ProcessData` method from the proxy, which in turn invokes the `GetData` method on the underlying `DataService`. Any logic within the proxy can be executed before or after the service call.

This approach offers several benefits:

*   **Centralized Logic**:  Cross-cutting concerns, such as request validation, logging, and authentication can be applied within the proxy controller, avoiding duplication in individual controller actions.
*   **Clean Separation**:  Controllers are unaware of the proxying logic. Service classes remain untouched.
*   **Extensibility**: New proxies can be added by simply registering the controller and decorating relevant controller actions with the custom attribute.
*   **Testability**: The service and the proxy can be easily tested in isolation.

This is not the only method to achieve this behaviour but one which I have found to be reliable and flexible in large codebases.

For those interested in expanding their knowledge beyond this, I’d recommend exploring resources that cover: ASP.NET MVC's filter pipeline, dependency injection with `IServiceProvider`, reflection in .NET, and the principles behind aspect-oriented programming (AOP), though this implementation is not full AOP, it uses elements of AOP.  Books detailing design patterns, particularly the proxy pattern, offer additional insight. Finally, deep dives into C# language features like reflection and generics are invaluable for understanding and modifying this approach.
