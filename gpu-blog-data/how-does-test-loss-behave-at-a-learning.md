The behavior of test loss at a learning rate of zero is straightforward: it remains constant.  This stems from the fundamental principle that a learning rate of zero effectively disables the gradient descent optimization process.  No weight updates occur; the model's parameters remain frozen at their initial values throughout the training process.  I've encountered this scenario numerous times during my work on large-scale image classification projects, often while debugging hyperparameter optimization routines.  Understanding this behavior is critical for avoiding misinterpretations of training dynamics.

My experience shows that the initial model performance, entirely dictated by the randomly initialized weights, directly determines the test loss at a zero learning rate. This test loss will remain unchanged regardless of the number of epochs processed.  Any perceived fluctuations are generally attributable to numerical precision limitations in the computational environment, rather than an actual alteration in the model's predictive capability.  Therefore, observing a constant test loss during training with a zero learning rate provides a crucial sanity check: it confirms that the training loop is correctly implemented and the learning rate parameter is accurately passed to the optimizer.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The learning rate (η) in gradient descent algorithms governs the magnitude of weight adjustments during training.  The weight update rule is typically expressed as:

`w_new = w_old - η * ∇L(w_old)`

where:

* `w_new` represents the updated weights.
* `w_old` represents the current weights.
* `η` is the learning rate.
* `∇L(w_old)` is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights.

When η = 0, the update rule simplifies to:

`w_new = w_old`

This means the weights remain unchanged for each iteration. The model's parameters are effectively frozen at their initial, randomly assigned values. Consequently, the model's predictions on the test set remain constant throughout the training process, resulting in a flat, unchanging test loss curve.

This behavior contrasts sharply with scenarios using a non-zero learning rate.  With a positive learning rate, the model's weights are iteratively adjusted based on the gradient, leading to a hopefully decreasing test loss as the model learns from the training data.  A poorly chosen learning rate, however, can lead to oscillations or failure to converge, complexities absent in the zero learning rate case.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples utilize TensorFlow/Keras for clarity, but the underlying principle applies universally across different deep learning frameworks.

**Example 1:  Illustrating Constant Test Loss**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
X_test = np.random.rand(50, 10)
y_test = np.random.randint(0, 2, 50)

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(10,))
])

# Compile the model with a learning rate of zero
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.0),
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), verbose=0)

# Observe the validation loss (test loss)
print(history.history['val_loss']) # This will show a near-constant value across epochs.
```

This code demonstrates a simple binary classification task. The crucial element is the `learning_rate=0.0` in the optimizer's initialization. The output `history.history['val_loss']` will show a nearly constant array because the model's weights never change. Minor variations might arise due to floating-point arithmetic precision.

**Example 2: Comparing Zero and Non-Zero Learning Rates**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ... (Data generation and model definition as in Example 1) ...

# Train with learning rate 0.0
model_zero = tf.keras.models.clone_model(model) # Clone to maintain identical initial weights
model_zero.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.0),
                   loss='binary_crossentropy',
                   metrics=['accuracy'])
history_zero = model_zero.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), verbose=0)


# Train with a non-zero learning rate
model_nonzero = tf.keras.models.clone_model(model)
model_nonzero.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01),
                      loss='binary_crossentropy',
                      metrics=['accuracy'])
history_nonzero = model_nonzero.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), verbose=0)

# Plot the validation loss for comparison
plt.plot(history_zero.history['val_loss'], label='Learning rate = 0.0')
plt.plot(history_nonzero.history['val_loss'], label='Learning rate = 0.01')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Validation Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This example expands on the previous one by training the same model with both a zero and a non-zero learning rate. The plot visually demonstrates the constant validation loss for the zero learning rate case and the change in validation loss for the non-zero case.

**Example 3: Handling potential numerical instability**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# ... (Data generation and model definition as in Example 1) ...

#Using a more numerically stable optimizer
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0),
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), verbose=0)

#Inspect the loss.  While still essentially constant, the use of Adam may reduce numerical noise.
print(history.history['val_loss'])
```
This example highlights the use of Adam optimizer which is generally more numerically stable than SGD.  While the fundamental behavior (constant loss) remains the same, a more robust optimizer might lead to a slightly smoother, less noisy, constant loss curve.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).  A comprehensive textbook on machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques will be beneficial.  Furthermore, research papers on the convergence properties of various optimization algorithms will deepen your understanding.  Specifically focusing on the mathematical derivation of gradient descent and its variants will prove helpful. Finally, review the literature on numerical stability in deep learning.
