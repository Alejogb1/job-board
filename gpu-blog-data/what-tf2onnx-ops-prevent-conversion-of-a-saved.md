TensorFlow's `tf2onnx` converter, while powerful, isn't a universal bridge; certain TensorFlow operations lack direct counterparts in the ONNX specification, resulting in conversion failures. Over years of working with different model architectures, I've consistently encountered these incompatibility issues and developed strategies for mitigation. The primary hurdles often involve dynamic behaviors and TensorFlow-specific constructs not directly expressible in ONNX's more static computation graph framework.

Specifically, many problems stem from operations that introduce control flow not easily translated to ONNX. Unlike TensorFlow, which supports imperative-style execution with conditional statements and loops within the graph, ONNX prefers a purely data-driven, static graph. This means that `tf.while_loop`, `tf.cond`, and operations that fundamentally depend on runtime values are primary culprits. While sometimes these operations can be traced through during conversion if their conditions are constant, this becomes a major impediment with dynamic inputs or loops depending on input shape.

Furthermore, TensorFlowâ€™s flexibility in defining custom operations adds another layer of complexity. If a SavedModel utilizes custom TensorFlow ops (either through registered kernels or from external libraries), `tf2onnx` will be unable to convert them unless a corresponding ONNX implementation is provided, which is rarely the case out-of-the-box. In the absence of a matching ONNX definition, `tf2onnx` simply won't know how to represent the computation. Operations which also frequently cause issues are those involved in list manipulations, variable-length sequences, and some complex tensor manipulations. These often have no analogous direct mappings within ONNX.

Finally, specific numerical operation implementations can sometimes vary significantly between the two frameworks, leading to unsupported behaviors. Floating-point precision and specialized optimization techniques specific to certain platforms, utilized by TensorFlow, can also cause discrepancies when ported to ONNX, if conversion is even possible.

Let me elaborate through some practical examples.

**Example 1: `tf.while_loop`**

The following TensorFlow snippet utilizes `tf.while_loop` to repeatedly update a tensor until a certain condition is met. This is a common pattern in recurrent neural networks or algorithms requiring iterative computations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def loop_body(i, a):
  return i + 1, tf.add(a, 1)

def condition(i, a):
  return tf.less(i, 5)

initial_i = tf.constant(0)
initial_a = tf.constant(1)
loop_vars = [initial_i, initial_a]

final_i, final_a = tf.while_loop(condition, loop_body, loop_vars)

# Further code using final_a...
```

The `tf.while_loop` introduces a control flow dependency. During conversion, `tf2onnx` will struggle to represent this loop as a static graph construct. It cannot know how many times the loop executes without evaluating the condition during execution. While some cases of `tf.while_loop` might translate if the loop bound and condition are based on constants, dynamic input dependencies almost always cause issues. In essence, the dynamic looping behavior of the `tf.while_loop` doesn't map onto the static, fixed structure of an ONNX graph. This usually results in an error message indicating `tf.while_loop` is not a supported op.

**Example 2: `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` with Dynamic Indices**

This example demonstrates a common use of `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`, where the indices used to update the tensor might be dynamically calculated from an input.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume input_indices are dynamically generated or read from file.

indices_shape = tf.constant([2,1],dtype = tf.int64)
indices = tf.reshape(tf.constant([0, 2]), indices_shape)  # Static index for demonstration
updates = tf.constant([10,20],dtype = tf.float32)
shape = tf.constant([4], dtype = tf.int64)
tensor = tf.zeros(shape, dtype = tf.float32)

updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor, indices, updates)

#Further code using updated_tensor...
```

`tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` itself is representable in ONNX when the `indices` tensor is static or known at graph construction time. However, if these `indices` depend on runtime input data, and thus have a dynamic shape, the conversion to the ONNX representation will be difficult. This operation requires knowing where to write within the target tensor based on the index, which is challenging when that index is not a fixed value but instead a variable. The conversion process frequently generates an unsupported operation error when indices have such dynamic nature, or the operation has a different signature than what is expected.

**Example 3: Custom TensorFlow Ops**

Suppose a TensorFlow model utilizes a custom op implemented via a C++ kernel and registered in TensorFlow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a hypothetical custom operation called 'CustomOp' is registered
# and loaded into the TF session.

@tf.function
def model(input_tensor):
  output = tf.raw_ops.CustomOp(input=input_tensor, parameter=1.0) # Imaginary custom op.
  return output


input_data = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
output = model(input_data)
# Export the tf model
```

Since `CustomOp` is a TensorFlow-specific operation, ONNX won't have any predefined operation to represent it. In order to handle custom ops, a corresponding ONNX custom op implementation would need to be provided to `tf2onnx`, alongside any necessary shape and type inference functions. Otherwise, `tf2onnx` cannot effectively translate this to a standard ONNX graph. This results in the inability of tf2onnx to convert the model due to the unrecognized operation, throwing an appropriate error. Even if a custom ONNX op implementation is provided, its correctness must be guaranteed to match the TensorFlow behavior.

In summary, while `tf2onnx` has broad coverage of TensorFlow operations, certain categories like dynamic control flow operations (`tf.while_loop`, `tf.cond`), dynamically indexed scatter/gather operations (`tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`, and custom TensorFlow ops present significant challenges. Successfully navigating these obstacles typically requires adapting the TensorFlow model architecture to favor statically expressible constructs or utilizing alternative techniques.

Regarding resources, the official TensorFlow documentation provides a detailed list of available operations and their respective functionalities. The ONNX documentation is essential for understanding the capabilities and constraints of the ONNX format.  The `tf2onnx` project documentation and issues on their Github repository is also essential for current information and how to circumvent known issues, if possible. Exploring discussions on forums related to TensorFlow and ONNX can often provide insights into practical workarounds for specific issues. Understanding the capabilities of each format is crucial for effective model design. Finally, careful code design during model development, keeping ONNX export in mind, usually saves much time in model deployment.
