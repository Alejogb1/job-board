The premise of the question is incorrect.  BERT encoder layers are, by design, trainable.  My experience developing and deploying large language models, including several variations of BERT for diverse tasks ranging from sentiment analysis to question answering, firmly establishes this. The confusion likely stems from a misunderstanding of the model's lifecycle and the distinction between pre-training and fine-tuning.

**1. Explanation:**

BERT, a Transformer-based model, comprises several encoder layers stacked sequentially.  Each layer consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network.  These layers contain numerous parameters – weights and biases – that are adjusted during training to minimize a defined loss function.  The pre-training phase, where BERT learns general language representations on a massive text corpus (like Wikipedia), involves training all these layers.  The resulting pre-trained model is then often fine-tuned for a specific downstream task.  This fine-tuning step usually involves unfreezing all or a subset of the encoder layers to adapt the pre-trained representations to the new task.  Therefore, asserting that BERT encoder layers are *non-trainable* is inaccurate.  They are fundamentally trainable during both pre-training and, typically, fine-tuning.  A model with untrainable encoder layers would be essentially static and incapable of learning from data.  This misconception likely arises from scenarios where layers are *frozen* during fine-tuning for specific reasons – resource limitations, preventing catastrophic forgetting, or transfer learning strategies focusing only on adapting specific output layers.  However, this freezing is a deliberate choice, not an inherent property of the model.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the trainability of BERT encoder layers using the Hugging Face Transformers library.  These examples are simplified for clarity and assume familiarity with Python and PyTorch/TensorFlow.  Real-world applications would include more sophisticated hyperparameter tuning and potentially custom data loaders.

**Example 1: Fine-tuning with all layers trainable (PyTorch):**

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer, AdamW
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Prepare data (replace with your actual data loading)
# ...

# Set all parameters to be trainable
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True

# Optimizer
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

# Training loop
# ...
```

*Commentary:* This code snippet explicitly sets `requires_grad = True` for all model parameters, ensuring that all BERT encoder layers are trainable during the fine-tuning process.  This is the standard approach if one wants to leverage the full capacity of the pre-trained model for a new task.


**Example 2: Fine-tuning with only some layers trainable (TensorFlow/Keras):**

```python
from transformers import TFBertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer
import tensorflow as tf

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
model = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Prepare data (replace with your actual data loading)
# ...

# Freeze encoder layers (example: freezing the first 8 layers)
for layer in model.bert.encoder.layer[:8]:
    layer.trainable = False

# Compile the model
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=5e-5)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training loop
# ...
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates how to selectively freeze layers.  Here, the first eight encoder layers are set to `trainable = False`, while the remaining layers are trainable. This approach is useful when aiming to reduce computational cost or prevent overfitting by focusing the adaptation on the later layers, which are more task-specific.  The choice of which layers to freeze depends on the specific task and dataset.  My experience has shown that carefully selecting which layers to freeze can significantly improve performance in specific situations with limited data.


**Example 3:  Transfer learning with only the classifier layer trainable (PyTorch):**

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer, AdamW
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Prepare data (replace with your actual data loading)
# ...

# Freeze all encoder layers
for param in model.bert.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Only train the classifier layer
for param in model.classifier.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True

# Optimizer
optimizer = AdamW(model.classifier.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

# Training loop
# ...
```

*Commentary:*  This example freezes all encoder layers, training only the classifier layer. This is a common transfer learning strategy where the pre-trained BERT model acts as a fixed feature extractor. The classifier is trained to map the fixed features learned by BERT to the target task. This is suitable when the new task is significantly different from those seen during pre-training or when computational resources are limited.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet;  "Attention is All You Need" (the original Transformer paper);  "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"; several relevant research papers on transfer learning techniques for NLP.  Furthermore,  thorough exploration of the Hugging Face Transformers documentation is invaluable.  Working through the tutorials and examples provided there has been instrumental in my own development.  Studying the source code of well-established NLP libraries will also provide significant insights.  Finally,  actively engaging with online communities and forums focused on deep learning and natural language processing can provide valuable knowledge and aid in troubleshooting.
