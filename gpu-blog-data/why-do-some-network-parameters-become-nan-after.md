The presence of NaN (Not a Number) values in model parameters after an optimizer step in PyTorch, specifically in the context of gradient descent, invariably stems from numerical instability during the backpropagation process, leading to mathematically undefined results. This instability typically arises when loss gradients either explode to extraordinarily large magnitudes or collapse to zero, resulting in division by zero or other problematic mathematical operations during weight updates.

Let's break down the underlying causes. During the forward pass of a neural network, the input data propagates through the layers, producing an output and subsequently a loss value. In the backpropagation phase, this loss is differentiated with respect to the network's parameters via the chain rule to determine how much each parameter contributed to the overall loss. These derivatives are what we call gradients. If these gradients become either excessively large or excessively small, floating-point arithmetic can exhibit pathological behavior. A typical sign of a large gradient is the presence of 'inf' values, which, when combined with any number, particularly a very small one during multiplication or division, can result in a NaN value. Smaller gradients leading to an 'underflow' of a floating point number towards zero can likewise produce unstable behavior in optimization.

Specifically, NaN values emerge when a weight update involves something like a 'division by zero' within the optimizer’s update mechanism. For instance, Adam's optimizer involves calculating moving averages of squared gradients; if any squared gradient in the denominator becomes zero during its moving average accumulation while the numerator is non-zero, the division results in a NaN. Similarly, if the loss function itself calculates values beyond the range that floating-point numbers can represent, then the backpropagation process will transmit NaN values backward and contaminate weight gradients.

Now, consider situations that exacerbate gradient instability. Deep neural networks, with their many layers, are especially prone to gradient vanishing or exploding. When gradients are multiplied many times across layers during backpropagation, this multiplication, if the intermediate values are much less than or greater than 1, can cause gradients to rapidly diminish or grow to magnitudes that exceed the range of representable numbers. Activation functions also play a critical role. While functions like sigmoid or tanh are common, their derivatives can become very small, especially near the extremes of their input ranges. This can diminish gradients propagating through layers leading to vanishing gradient problems, which, paradoxically, can also lead to underflows resulting in NaNs when combined with other numerical instability during optimization.

Moreover, when using techniques like mixed-precision, the reduced precision (e.g. float16) can further exacerbate numerical instability. Smaller numbers become 'zeroed out' due to their smaller representation, and the range limitations of float16 can push otherwise reasonable numbers to infinity.

Let's analyze three specific scenarios through the lens of code examples.

**Code Example 1: Unstable Loss Function**

This example illustrates a scenario where the loss function itself can produce NaNs, which propagate through the computation graph and to the model parameters.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.sigmoid(self.linear(x))

model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Create input data with potential for overflow in loss function
x = torch.randn(1, 10) * 1000
y = torch.tensor([1.0])


for i in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(x)
    # Loss function with potential for overflow (using log on small values)
    loss = -y * torch.log(output) - (1-y) * torch.log(1 - output)

    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        if torch.isnan(param).any():
            print(f"NaN detected in {name}")
            break
```
In this case, we simulate a situation where the `x` input has excessively large values, and the sigmoid function maps the linear projection to the edge of its [0,1] output range, resulting in an output very close to 0. The binary cross entropy loss function computes `-log(output)`. When `output` is close to 0, the resulting `-log(output)` will become very large, and when combined with the backpropagation of the derivative `-1/output` to the previous layer, the gradients will rapidly expand, potentially leading to a NaN. While log(0) is undefined, this condition is bypassed due to the floating-point implementation, still resulting in the instability described previously. The result is that parameters will contain NaNs after only a few optimizer steps.

**Code Example 2: Exploding Gradients**

Here we demonstrate how a poorly initialized weight and a chain of operations can exacerbate exploding gradients, ultimately leading to NaNs.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class DeepModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DeepModel, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(10, 50)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(50, 50)
        self.layer3 = nn.Linear(50, 1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.layer1(x))
        x = self.relu(self.layer2(x))
        return self.layer3(x)

model = DeepModel()

# Initialize weights to large values
for param in model.parameters():
    param.data.uniform_(1,10)


optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

x = torch.randn(1, 10)
y = torch.randn(1,1)

for i in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(x)
    loss = criterion(output, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        if torch.isnan(param).any():
            print(f"NaN detected in {name}")
            break
```
In this example, each layer’s weights are randomly initialized to relatively large values. Since the ReLU activation always outputs positive numbers, each linear transformation in the forward pass can result in very large intermediate values which are further multiplied during the backward pass, ultimately exploding gradients. The large learning rate amplifies this effect during optimization, leading to a rapid increase in parameter values and the ultimate appearance of NaNs within the model's weights.

**Code Example 3: Adam Optimizer and Numerical Imprecision**

Here we show how numerical imprecision in the Adam optimizer's update equation can also generate NaNs.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class AnotherModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(AnotherModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
      return self.relu(self.linear(x))

model = AnotherModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

x = torch.randn(1, 10)
y = torch.randn(1,1)

for i in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(x)
    loss = criterion(output,y)
    loss.backward()

    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        param.grad.data *= 1e-50 #scale down the gradients
    optimizer.step()
    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
       if torch.isnan(param).any():
           print(f"NaN detected in {name}")
           break
```
In this example, we artificially force the gradients to be extremely small. Because the Adam optimizer uses a moving average of the squared gradients in the denominator of its weight update equation, extremely small gradients accumulate, resulting in a moving average very close to zero. At the same time, the gradients in the numerator can be non-zero which leads to numerical instability during division and resulting NaN values. This scenario also demonstrates why clipping the gradients in the forward pass may not prevent NaNs, as the problem could also be caused by the optimizer state itself.

To prevent these issues, several techniques are commonly applied. Proper weight initialization, such as Xavier or Kaiming initialization, helps to avoid overly large or small initial weight values. Gradient clipping limits the magnitude of gradients during backpropagation to prevent exploding gradient issues. Employing batch normalization can help stabilize training by normalizing layer inputs and preventing the propagation of small/large values from previous layers. Finally, exploring more robust optimizers, such as AdamW, can further improve convergence. Using stable loss functions that don't involve log operations or very small denominators may be considered as well. Finally, if using mixed precision, switching to full precision during problematic phases may also prove helpful.

For further reading on these topics, I recommend exploring resources covering numerical stability in deep learning, different weight initialization techniques, gradient clipping strategies, normalization methods (batch, layer, and group normalization), and the mathematical foundation of different optimization algorithms. Texts that provide a solid introduction to the mathematics of optimization and the basics of deep learning, including its practical aspects, provide a strong foundational understanding of how these problems occur and how to mitigate them.
