The `cocoEval.summarize()` function returning a mean Average Precision (mAP) of -1 invariably indicates a failure in the evaluation process within the COCO API.  This isn't a simple bug; it stems from a mismatch, inconsistency, or error in one of several critical stages: data preparation, prediction formatting, or the evaluation parameters themselves.  In my experience troubleshooting object detection model evaluations using the COCO API, I've encountered this issue repeatedly, and the root cause is rarely immediately obvious.  A methodical approach focusing on the interaction between your predictions and the ground truth annotations is crucial.

**1. Understanding the COCO Evaluation Pipeline:**

The COCO evaluation pipeline rigorously checks the format and content of both your predicted bounding boxes and the ground truth annotations.  Any deviation from the expected structure, particularly concerning class IDs, bounding box coordinates, and confidence scores, will lead to an mAP of -1. The process involves several steps:

* **Data Loading:**  The `cocoGt` object loads the ground truth annotations, validating their structure.  Incorrect JSON formatting, missing fields, or inconsistent class ID mappings can halt the process at this stage.

* **Prediction Loading:** The `cocoDt` object loads your model's predictions.  This is frequently the source of the problem.  The COCO API expects predictions to be in a specific JSON format, precisely mirroring the structure of the ground truth annotations, including fields like `image_id`, `category_id`, `bbox`, and `score`.  Even minor inconsistencies, such as mismatched data types or array dimensions, will result in an unsuccessful evaluation.

* **Matching and Scoring:** The core of the evaluation compares your predictions to the ground truth annotations.  This involves assigning predicted boxes to ground truth boxes based on Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds.  Incorrect bounding box coordinates or category IDs will lead to poor or no matches, ultimately affecting the precision and recall calculations.

* **Summarization:** Finally, `cocoEval.summarize()` aggregates the results into various metrics, including mAP.  An mAP of -1 signals a failure in the preceding steps, preventing the generation of meaningful performance metrics.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's examine three scenarios where `cocoEval.summarize()` might yield an mAP of -1, illustrating how to identify and correct the issues.

**Example 1: Mismatched Category IDs:**

```python
# Incorrect: Category IDs in predictions don't match ground truth
predictions = [
    {'image_id': 1, 'category_id': 10, 'bbox': [10, 10, 100, 100], 'score': 0.9}, # Incorrect category ID
    {'image_id': 1, 'category_id': 2, 'bbox': [150, 150, 50, 50], 'score': 0.8}
]

# ... (COCO API setup and evaluation code) ...

cocoEval.evaluate()
cocoEval.accumulate()
cocoEval.summarize()  # Returns mAP = -1
```

**Commentary:** The `category_id` 10 in the prediction might not exist in the ground truth annotations. This mismatch prevents the algorithm from accurately matching predictions to ground truth boxes, leading to an mAP of -1.  Careful examination of your category ID mappings and ensuring consistency between your ground truth and prediction data is paramount.  A simple check using `set(gt_category_ids) == set(pred_category_ids)` (where `gt_category_ids` and `pred_category_ids` are the sets of category IDs from ground truth and predictions, respectively) can help detect this.

**Example 2: Incorrect Bounding Box Format:**

```python
# Incorrect: Bounding box format is inconsistent
predictions = [
    {'image_id': 1, 'category_id': 1, 'bbox': [10, 10, 100, 100], 'score': 0.9},
    {'image_id': 1, 'category_id': 2, 'bbox': (150, 150, 50, 50), 'score': 0.8} # Tuple instead of list
]

# ... (COCO API setup and evaluation code) ...

cocoEval.evaluate()
cocoEval.accumulate()
cocoEval.summarize()  # Returns mAP = -1
```

**Commentary:** Here, the second prediction uses a tuple for `bbox` instead of the expected list. Inconsistent data types within the predictions can lead to evaluation failures.  Strict adherence to the COCO annotation format is critical. Ensure all bounding boxes are represented consistently as lists (e.g., `[x, y, w, h]`).

**Example 3: Missing 'score' Field:**

```python
# Incorrect: Missing 'score' field in predictions
predictions = [
    {'image_id': 1, 'category_id': 1, 'bbox': [10, 10, 100, 100]}, # Missing 'score'
    {'image_id': 1, 'category_id': 2, 'bbox': [150, 150, 50, 50], 'score': 0.8}
]

# ... (COCO API setup and evaluation code) ...

cocoEval.evaluate()
cocoEval.accumulate()
cocoEval.summarize()  # Returns mAP = -1
```

**Commentary:** The first prediction omits the `score` field, a mandatory element representing the confidence of the prediction.  The COCO evaluation requires a confidence score for each prediction.  The absence of this field will cause a failure.  Thoroughly validate the structure and completeness of your predictions against the COCO annotation format.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend reviewing the official COCO API documentation thoroughly. Pay close attention to the expected format of the annotation and prediction JSON files.  Utilize a JSON validator to confirm the structural correctness of your data.  Debugging tools like `print()` statements strategically placed within your evaluation code can pinpoint the exact stage where the error originates.  Finally, comparing your prediction JSON against a known good example from a working evaluation can be invaluable.  Systematic checks for consistency in data types, field names, and category IDs will be your best allies in resolving this issue.  Remember, meticulous attention to detail is key when working with the COCO API.
