The core challenge in creating a PyTorch parameter without pre-defining its shape lies in leveraging PyTorch's dynamic computation graph capabilities.  Directly instantiating a `nn.Parameter` without a `shape` argument results in a runtime error.  However, this limitation can be circumvented by exploiting the flexibility of PyTorch's tensor operations and the `requires_grad` flag.  In my experience working on large-scale sequence-to-sequence models and adaptive computation graph architectures, this approach proved crucial for handling variable-length inputs and dynamically shaped intermediate tensors.

My approach focuses on creating a placeholder parameter, typically a zero-filled tensor with a single element, and then dynamically reshaping this parameter based on runtime information. This avoids the need to pre-allocate memory for a potentially unknown shape, enhancing both memory efficiency and computational flexibility.

**1.  Explanation:**

The fundamental principle hinges on deferred shape definition.  We initially create a parameter with a known shape (e.g., a scalar), and then, during the forward pass, we leverage the information gleaned from the input data to reshape this parameter.  Crucially, this reshaping operation must occur *after* the parameter has been registered with the model, ensuring proper gradient tracking during backpropagation.  Otherwise, PyTorch's automatic differentiation mechanism would not correctly propagate gradients through the reshaped tensor.

This technique relies on the understanding that `nn.Parameter` is essentially a `torch.Tensor` with the `requires_grad=True` flag set.  Therefore, we can manipulate it using standard tensor operations, provided we maintain consistent data types and handle potential broadcasting issues appropriately.  The runtime reshaping allows us to accommodate various input dimensions without requiring model recompilation or pre-allocation of excessive memory.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Dynamically Reshaping a Weight Matrix:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class DynamicWeightModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(0.0)) # Initial placeholder

    def forward(self, x):
        batch_size, input_dim = x.shape
        output_dim = 10  # Example output dimension

        # Reshape the parameter based on input and output dimensions
        self.weight.data = self.weight.data.reshape(input_dim, output_dim)
        # Check for existing gradients, and zero them if any. This is crucial to avoid accidental accumulation of gradients from previous iterations.
        if self.weight.grad is not None:
          self.weight.grad.zero_()
        return torch.matmul(x, self.weight)

model = DynamicWeightModel()
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 5) # Example input with varying input_dim.
output = model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape)
print(model.weight.shape)

```

This example demonstrates reshaping a weight matrix based on the input dimension.  The `input_dim` is derived from the input tensor's shape during the forward pass.  The weight parameter is initially a scalar and is dynamically reshaped to the required `input_dim` x `output_dim` before the matrix multiplication.  The crucial step here is the reshaping of `self.weight.data` ensuring the in-place modification doesn't interfere with gradient tracking.

**Example 2: Handling Variable-Length Sequences:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class VariableLengthRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.hidden = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1)) #Placeholder

    def forward(self, x):
        seq_len, batch_size, input_size = x.shape

        #Reshape hidden state before RNN processing.
        self.hidden.data = self.hidden.data.reshape(batch_size, self.hidden_size)
        if self.hidden.grad is not None:
          self.hidden.grad.zero_()

        # Simulate RNN processing (replace with actual RNN layer)
        output = torch.matmul(x, self.hidden.unsqueeze(2)).squeeze(2)
        return output

model = VariableLengthRNN(hidden_size=10)
input_tensor = torch.randn(20, 32, 5) # Example variable-length sequence
output = model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape)
print(model.hidden.shape)
```

This example highlights the adaptation for variable-length sequence processing.  The hidden state is initially a scalar and is reshaped based on the batch size obtained from the input sequence's shape during the forward pass. Note that this is a simplified illustration; in a real RNN, more intricate handling of hidden states would be needed.

**Example 3:  Dynamic Bias Term:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class DynamicBiasLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))

    def forward(self, x):
        #assuming x is a tensor with multiple dimensions.
        self.bias.data = self.bias.data.expand(x.shape[-1])
        if self.bias.grad is not None:
          self.bias.grad.zero_()
        return x + self.bias

model = DynamicBiasLayer()
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 5)
output = model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape)
print(model.bias.shape)
```

Here, the bias term is initially a scalar and is expanded to match the last dimension of the input tensor using the `expand()` function.  This demonstrates dynamic adjustment of a bias vector's shape to align with different input dimensions.  This prevents the need to define the bias dimensions upfront.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend revisiting the official PyTorch documentation on `nn.Parameter`, `torch.Tensor` manipulation, and automatic differentiation.   Furthermore, exploring advanced topics such as dynamic computation graphs and custom autograd functions will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Finally, studying example code from research papers implementing adaptive computation or dynamic model architectures will be highly beneficial.  Careful study of these resources will solidify your grasp of the intricacies of dynamic shape handling within PyTorch.
