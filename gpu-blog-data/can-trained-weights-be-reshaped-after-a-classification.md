After substantial experimentation in transfer learning scenarios, particularly within convolutional neural networks (CNNs), I've consistently observed that reshaping trained weights after extending a classification head presents both opportunities and challenges. The core issue revolves around the dimensional compatibility of weight tensors between the original pre-trained model and the newly adapted structure, specifically regarding linear (fully connected) layers common in classification heads.

When dealing with a classification head extension, the common goal is to transition from a pre-trained model trained for *N* classes to a new model designed for *M* classes, where *M* is often different from *N*. The pre-trained model typically ends with a linear layer that outputs a tensor of size (*batch_size*, *N*), representing the logit scores for each of the *N* classes. When we extend the head, this final layer is replaced or augmented to output a tensor of size (*batch_size*, *M*). Crucially, this layer's weight matrix has a shape of (*output_features*, *input_features*), where *output_features* corresponds to the number of classes. Consequently, the shapes are incompatible.

The trained weights from the original model cannot be directly reshaped into this new matrix because they were learned under a specific classification constraint defined by the original *N* classes. The underlying representations learned by the lower layers of the network are generally reusable, but the linear mapping learned in the final layer is not. Attempts to simply reshape the weights, or randomly initialize the weights of the new head, and train with the reshaped weights or with both head and the backbone can yield very different performance outcomes and stability issues.

There are, however, nuanced approaches one can employ to partially salvage, adapt, or influence the final layer weights when transitioning to a new number of classes. A common approach is to utilize knowledge of the original classes, where they exist, and use this knowledge when initializing the new weights. One technique is to truncate or pad based on the dimensionality differences between *N* and *M*. When *M* < *N*, the original weight matrix can be truncated. When *M* > *N*, one can pad, and then initialize weights based on a random function or, if appropriate, duplicate existing weights from the original weights matrix.

Consider a scenario with a pre-trained CNN for image classification, where the final layer had *N* = 1000 classes. We now extend the model for a new classification task with *M* = 100 classes. Below are examples of approaches I have used.

**Code Example 1: Truncation for fewer classes**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def extend_head_truncate(original_model, num_classes_new):
    """
    Extends classification head by truncating original head weights.

    Args:
        original_model: Pre-trained model with final layer.
        num_classes_new: Number of classes in new task.
    Returns:
        Modified model with truncated head.
    """
    
    original_head = original_model.fc # Assuming 'fc' is the name of the final linear layer
    original_num_classes = original_head.out_features
    input_features = original_head.in_features

    if num_classes_new >= original_num_classes:
       raise ValueError("The new number of classes cannot be greater than the original when truncating.")

    # Create a new linear layer
    new_head = nn.Linear(input_features, num_classes_new)

    # Truncate original weights
    with torch.no_grad():
      new_head.weight.copy_(original_head.weight[:num_classes_new])
      new_head.bias.copy_(original_head.bias[:num_classes_new])

    # Replace the old head
    original_model.fc = new_head
    return original_model

# Example Usage:
#Assume loaded model has 'fc' as the name of the final fully connected layer and has 1000 outputs.
#loaded_model = load_pretrained_model() 
#new_model = extend_head_truncate(loaded_model, 100)
```

This function creates a new linear layer with the intended number of classes. Then, using `torch.no_grad()` to prevent gradient calculation, it copies the first *M* rows of the weight matrix and the corresponding bias from the original linear layer to the new one. Finally, the original fully connected layer is replaced with the new layer in the model. This is applicable when the new task has a subset of the original tasks. It maintains the learned representation for those classes that are present.

**Code Example 2: Padding with random weights for more classes**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def extend_head_pad_random(original_model, num_classes_new, init_std=0.01):
    """
    Extends classification head by padding with random weights.

    Args:
        original_model: Pre-trained model with final layer.
        num_classes_new: Number of classes in new task.
        init_std: Standard deviation for random initialization.
    Returns:
        Modified model with padded head.
    """
    
    original_head = original_model.fc # Assuming 'fc' is the name of the final linear layer
    original_num_classes = original_head.out_features
    input_features = original_head.in_features
    
    if num_classes_new <= original_num_classes:
       raise ValueError("The new number of classes cannot be smaller than the original when padding.")

    # Create a new linear layer
    new_head = nn.Linear(input_features, num_classes_new)

    # Copy original weights
    with torch.no_grad():
      new_head.weight[:original_num_classes].copy_(original_head.weight)
      new_head.bias[:original_num_classes].copy_(original_head.bias)

    # Randomly initialize new weights
    nn.init.normal_(new_head.weight[original_num_classes:], std=init_std)
    nn.init.zeros_(new_head.bias[original_num_classes:])


    # Replace the old head
    original_model.fc = new_head
    return original_model

#Example usage:
#loaded_model = load_pretrained_model()
#new_model = extend_head_pad_random(loaded_model,1200)
```

Here, the new linear layer is created with the desired output size. The original weights and biases are then copied, filling the beginning of the new weight and bias matrices. The remaining weights and biases, corresponding to the new classes, are initialized using a normal distribution with a specified standard deviation and zero for the bias, respectively. This approach maintains the original structure while allowing new classes to be added with some controlled initialization.

**Code Example 3: Copying and padding with copies for more classes**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import random

def extend_head_pad_copy(original_model, num_classes_new):
    """
    Extends classification head by padding with copies of existing weights.

    Args:
        original_model: Pre-trained model with final layer.
        num_classes_new: Number of classes in new task.
    Returns:
        Modified model with padded head.
    """
    
    original_head = original_model.fc
    original_num_classes = original_head.out_features
    input_features = original_head.in_features

    if num_classes_new <= original_num_classes:
       raise ValueError("The new number of classes cannot be smaller than the original when padding.")

    # Create a new linear layer
    new_head = nn.Linear(input_features, num_classes_new)

    # Copy original weights
    with torch.no_grad():
       new_head.weight[:original_num_classes].copy_(original_head.weight)
       new_head.bias[:original_num_classes].copy_(original_head.bias)

    # Pad remaining weights with copied weights
    num_to_copy = num_classes_new - original_num_classes
    indices_to_copy = random.choices(range(original_num_classes), k=num_to_copy)
    for i,idx in enumerate(indices_to_copy):
       new_head.weight[original_num_classes+i].copy_(original_head.weight[idx])
       new_head.bias[original_num_classes+i].copy_(original_head.bias[idx])
    
    # Replace the old head
    original_model.fc = new_head
    return original_model

#Example usage:
#loaded_model = load_pretrained_model()
#new_model = extend_head_pad_copy(loaded_model,1200)
```
In this example, the new linear layer is again created with the desired number of outputs. The existing weights are then copied into the new weights matrix and bias vector. Then, the remaining weights are filled by randomly selecting existing weights from the original weight matrix and bias vector. By leveraging previously trained knowledge, we are providing more information to the new classification head. This process has performed well for tasks when the original dataset has some relevance to the new dataset.

In summary, simply reshaping weights after a classification head extension is not viable because of dimensional mismatches. However, these techniques for partial transfer of weights or informative initialization, such as truncation, padding with random or copied weights, have provided a starting point for finetuning and have resulted in improved downstream performance and faster convergence in comparison to complete random initialization of the extended head. It should be noted that depending on the scale of the differences in classification outputs, the underlying data, and the total architecture, these techniques can also lead to decreased performance. Ultimately, thorough experimentation and validation are required to achieve optimal performance.

Regarding resource recommendations, I would suggest thoroughly examining works related to transfer learning in deep learning, specifically focusing on how fully connected layers are handled. Additionally, literature on initialization methods can provide more insight into good practices when padding weight matrices. Finally, I recommend a close review of the official documentation of your chosen deep learning library as they will generally contain information specific to your use case. These sources will provide deeper context and diverse methods regarding head extension and weight manipulation.
