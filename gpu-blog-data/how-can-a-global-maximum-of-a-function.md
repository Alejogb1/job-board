The inherent challenge in locating the global maximum of a function lies in the potential for multiple local maxima, which can trap gradient-based optimization algorithms.  My experience optimizing complex energy models for power grid simulations has underscored the crucial need for robust strategies that transcend the limitations of local searches.  A multifaceted approach, combining informed initialization, exploration of the search space, and verification techniques, is essential for reliable global maximum identification.

**1.  Explanation of Approaches**

Finding a global maximum is fundamentally different from finding a local maximum.  Local maximum algorithms, such as gradient ascent, will converge to the nearest peak, which may not be the global maximum.  To address this, we must incorporate strategies that systematically explore the entire search space or employ methods less susceptible to being trapped in local optima.  These strategies generally fall into two categories: deterministic and stochastic methods.

Deterministic methods, such as exhaustive search, guarantee finding the global maximum (provided the search space is finite and sufficiently sampled) but suffer from computational intractability for high-dimensional functions. They become exponentially more expensive as the number of dimensions increases.

Stochastic methods, on the other hand, offer a trade-off between computational cost and the certainty of finding the global maximum. They utilize randomness to explore the search space and escape local optima.  Genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization are examples of stochastic techniques.  These methods do not guarantee finding the global maximum, but their probability of success increases with computational resources and careful parameter tuning.

The choice of method heavily depends on the characteristics of the function: its dimensionality, continuity, differentiability, and the availability of analytical derivatives.  For highly complex, non-differentiable functions, stochastic methods are often preferred due to their robustness.  For simpler, differentiable functions, gradient-based methods augmented with global search strategies can be effective.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Exhaustive Search (for a simple, low-dimensional function)**

This approach is computationally expensive but guarantees finding the global maximum within a defined search space.  It's suitable only for low-dimensional problems.

```python
import numpy as np

def exhaustive_search(func, bounds, step):
    """
    Finds the global maximum of a function using exhaustive search.

    Args:
        func: The function to optimize.
        bounds: A list of tuples, each defining the lower and upper bounds for a dimension.
        step: The step size for the search.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the global maximum value and the corresponding input values.
    """
    best_x = None
    best_y = -np.inf

    ranges = [np.arange(b[0], b[1] + step, step) for b in bounds]
    for x in np.array(np.meshgrid(*ranges)).T.reshape(-1, len(bounds)):
        y = func(x)
        if y > best_y:
            best_y = y
            best_x = x

    return best_y, best_x


# Example usage:
def example_func(x):
    return -(x[0]-2)**2 - (x[1]-3)**2  # Simple negative quadratic

bounds = [(-5, 5), (-5, 5)]
step_size = 0.1
max_value, max_point = exhaustive_search(example_func, bounds, step_size)
print(f"Global Maximum: {max_value} at x = {max_point}")

```

**Example 2: Gradient Ascent with Random Restarts**

This improves upon basic gradient ascent by incorporating multiple starting points to mitigate the risk of getting stuck in local maxima.


```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def gradient_ascent_restarts(func, bounds, restarts=10):
    """
    Finds the global maximum using gradient ascent with multiple random restarts.

    Args:
        func: The function to optimize (must be differentiable).
        bounds: A list of tuples, each defining the lower and upper bounds for a dimension.
        restarts: The number of random restarts.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the global maximum value and the corresponding input values.
    """
    best_x = None
    best_y = -np.inf

    for _ in range(restarts):
        x0 = np.random.uniform(low=[b[0] for b in bounds], high=[b[1] for b in bounds])
        result = minimize(lambda x: -func(x), x0, method='L-BFGS-B', bounds=bounds) #minimize negative to find maximum
        if -result.fun > best_y:
            best_y = -result.fun
            best_x = result.x

    return best_y, best_x

# Example usage (using the same example_func):
max_value, max_point = gradient_ascent_restarts(example_func, bounds, restarts=20)
print(f"Global Maximum (Gradient Ascent): {max_value} at x = {max_point}")

```


**Example 3:  Simulated Annealing**

Simulated annealing is a stochastic method that probabilistically accepts worse solutions early in the search, allowing it to escape local optima.  It requires careful tuning of the cooling schedule (controlling the probability of accepting worse solutions).


```python
import numpy as np
import random

def simulated_annealing(func, bounds, initial_temp, cooling_rate, iterations):
    """
    Finds the global maximum using simulated annealing.

    Args:
        func: The function to optimize.
        bounds: A list of tuples defining the search space boundaries.
        initial_temp: Initial temperature.
        cooling_rate: Cooling rate (between 0 and 1).
        iterations: Number of iterations.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the global maximum and its corresponding point.
    """

    dim = len(bounds)
    current_x = np.random.uniform(low=[b[0] for b in bounds], high=[b[1] for b in bounds])
    current_y = func(current_x)
    best_x = current_x
    best_y = current_y
    temp = initial_temp

    for _ in range(iterations):
        neighbor_x = current_x + np.random.normal(scale=0.5, size=dim) #Example neighborhood generation; adjust as needed.
        neighbor_x = np.clip(neighbor_x, [b[0] for b in bounds], [b[1] for b in bounds]) #Ensure within bounds.
        neighbor_y = func(neighbor_x)

        delta_e = neighbor_y - current_y
        if delta_e > 0 or random.random() < np.exp(delta_e / temp):
            current_x = neighbor_x
            current_y = neighbor_y

        if current_y > best_y:
            best_x = current_x
            best_y = current_y

        temp *= cooling_rate

    return best_y, best_x

# Example Usage
initial_temp = 100
cooling_rate = 0.95
iterations = 1000
max_value, max_point = simulated_annealing(example_func, bounds, initial_temp, cooling_rate, iterations)
print(f"Global Maximum (Simulated Annealing): {max_value} at x = {max_point}")


```


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration, I recommend consulting numerical optimization textbooks focusing on global optimization techniques.  Specifically, texts covering  derivative-free optimization, stochastic global optimization, and the theoretical underpinnings of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms would be beneficial.  A strong understanding of probability and statistics will also prove invaluable.  Finally, familiarity with numerical computation libraries such as NumPy and SciPy in Python is crucial for practical implementation and testing.
