Direct compatibility between CUDA 9.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (specifically, MSVC 15.4) is constrained by specific toolchain requirements and compiler configurations, and it's more nuanced than a simple "yes" or "no." My experience migrating a large-scale physics simulation code base away from CUDA 7.5 several years ago taught me the importance of carefully examining the supported toolchain configurations documented by NVIDIA. While technically MSVC 15.4 can *build* CUDA applications targeting devices compatible with CUDA 9.0, there are known compiler compatibility issues and required adjustments which often lead to build errors, runtime crashes, or subtle performance degradations.

The core issue stems from the specific version of the MSVC toolset used by the CUDA toolkit during compilation of the host-side C++ code (CPU code). CUDA 9.0, released in 2017, is officially designed to be used with specific versions of the Visual Studio toolchain. While the host compiler and C++ standard library provided with MSVC 15.4 are relatively modern, they aren't necessarily the *exact* toolchain the CUDA 9.0 toolkit was compiled and tested against. Mismatches in the ABI (Application Binary Interface) between the compiler used to build the CUDA runtime and the host compiler used to build the host application often lead to incompatibilities. These problems can manifest as link errors during the build process, or more insidiously as undefined behavior during runtime, which can be exceedingly difficult to debug. The critical takeaway here is: while Visual Studio 2017 as a shell can be made to function with CUDA 9.0, it's the *specific toolchain* version, namely the Microsoft C/C++ Compiler toolset, that matters. MSVC 15.4 generally falls outside the explicitly validated and supported configurations.

The primary challenge arises in the use of the NVIDIA CUDA compiler, `nvcc`. When `nvcc` compiles CUDA code, it actually performs a two-step compilation process. First, it compiles the `.cu` files into intermediate PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) code which is sent to the GPU at runtime. Second, it extracts the host-side code and then invokes the MSVC compiler to compile it into object files which are eventually linked together into the final executable. It's during this second step where compatibility with the host compiler matters the most. The CUDA toolkit includes a bundled version of the MSVC toolchain it expects to use. If you attempt to override this and force `nvcc` to use an unsupported version of MSVC (such as 15.4's specific toolchain, which may be `v141`), it might result in compilation failures or, worse, runtime incompatibilities.

To illustrate, consider a simple CUDA program:

```c++
// simple_kernel.cu

#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addArrays(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    float *a, *b, *c;
    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

    a = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    b = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    c = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(float));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        a[i] = i;
        b[i] = i * 2;
    }

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    addArrays<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

    cudaMemcpy(c, d_c, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        printf("c[%d] = %f\n", i, c[i]);
    }

    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);
    free(a);
    free(b);
    free(c);

    return 0;
}
```
In this simple example, `nvcc` will attempt to use a host compiler. If the host compiler is not compatible (for instance, MSVC 15.4's specific toolchain being used with CUDA 9.0), you might encounter linker errors involving missing libraries, type mismatch errors, or other subtle undefined behaviors. When compiling this, I have seen firsthand that forcing the use of a different MSVC toolchain using `nvcc` command-line arguments or project configurations leads to a cascade of such problems.

A second example highlighting potential issues involves interoperability with system libraries:

```c++
// cuda_with_system_lib.cu
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <algorithm>


__global__ void vector_add(int* a, int* b, int* c, int size) {
    int index = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (index < size) {
        c[index] = a[index] + b[index];
    }
}

int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    std::vector<int> a(size);
    std::vector<int> b(size);
    std::vector<int> c(size);

    for(int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
      a[i] = i;
      b[i] = i*2;
    }

    int* d_a, * d_b, * d_c;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, size * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, size * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, size * sizeof(int));

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, a.data(), size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, b.data(), size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    vector_add<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, size);

    cudaMemcpy(c.data(), d_c, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        std::cout << "c[" << i << "] = " << c[i] << std::endl;
    }

    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);

  return 0;
}
```
Here the program uses `std::vector`, a C++ standard library component that relies on a specific ABI. If the compiler used to build the CUDA runtime and the one used to build the host application aren't compatible, data structures from the C++ library (such as `std::vector`) may be passed incorrectly between the host and the device due to subtle layout differences, leading to erroneous computations or crashes at runtime that do not manifest during compilation. Specifically, mismatches in the compiler's C++ standard library implementation can lead to issues with `std::vector`'s internal structure and how it interacts with the CUDA API, leading to problems such as memory corruption, incorrect data passing between CPU and GPU, or unexplainable crashes. In my experience, these issues tend to surface only during rigorous runtime testing under load, making them very challenging to diagnose.

Finally, a third example shows how this extends to larger applications with multiple translation units:

```c++
// shared.h
#pragma once

void someFunction();
```

```c++
// shared.cpp
#include "shared.h"
#include <iostream>

void someFunction() {
    std::cout << "Some shared function" << std::endl;
}
```

```c++
// cuda_main.cu
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>
#include "shared.h"

__global__ void emptyKernel() {}

int main() {
    emptyKernel<<<1,1>>>();

    someFunction(); // Calling shared host code

    return 0;
}
```

Here the shared functionality lives in a separate cpp file. When `nvcc` compiles `cuda_main.cu`, it needs to compile both `shared.cpp` and `cuda_main.cu`. If the compiler used by `nvcc` is forced to be incompatible with the compiler used to build `shared.cpp` (again, MSVC 15.4) the result can be linker errors or subtle runtime problems. For instance, `someFunction()` may be called incorrectly due to mismatched name mangling or calling conventions. Such issues are notoriously difficult to track down. I've seen how even seemingly harmless changes to build configurations or compiler versions can create these problems. The most telling symptom has been seemingly random crashes or corrupt outputs from device computations due to improper memory access or calling convention mismatches when mixing separately compiled units.

For concrete guidance, I would recommend consulting the NVIDIA CUDA documentation specifically for CUDA 9.0. Within that documentation, look for the sections that clearly list "Supported Compiler Versions" or similar terminology. Refer to Microsoft's documentation for supported toolchain versions with each Visual Studio release as well to verify compatibility. These resources often have tables of tested toolchain versions, along with specific warnings about incompatibilities. In my experience, relying directly on the manufacturerâ€™s resources for information on supported toolchains and compiler flags, is much more reliable than assuming backward compatibility across arbitrary compiler versions. Additionally, examining release notes and forums specific to NVIDIA and Microsoft can often turn up anecdotes and fixes to compatibility issues, although those are less reliable than official documentation.
