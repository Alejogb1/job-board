The absence of file names and line numbers in stack traces originating from a sandboxed AppDomain is fundamentally a consequence of how the common language runtime (CLR) manages security and code execution within those isolated environments.  In my experience debugging enterprise-level applications leveraging AppDomains for plugin architectures and secure code execution, I’ve encountered this limitation repeatedly.  The core issue stems from the optimization strategies employed by the JIT compiler when dealing with partially trusted code running in a sandboxed context.


**1. Explanation of the Underlying Mechanism**

The CLR employs several security mechanisms to prevent malicious code loaded into a sandboxed AppDomain from compromising the integrity of the main application. One key aspect is the control over code access security (CAS).  When a sandboxed AppDomain is created, permissions are explicitly defined, restricting the actions the code within that AppDomain can perform. This includes limitations on file access, network access, and other potentially harmful operations.

The omission of file names and line numbers from stack traces is a direct consequence of the JIT compiler's optimization techniques and the reduced visibility enforced by the sandbox.  For performance reasons, the JIT compiler often removes debugging symbols—information that directly links compiled code back to its source code—from code running within a low-trust AppDomain. These symbols are crucial for generating stack traces that include file names and line numbers.  Removing them minimizes the potential attack surface by obscuring the internal structure of the application’s code from a potentially malicious plugin.  The sandbox environment prioritizes security over detailed debugging information.

Furthermore, the security manager actively restricts access to critical system information, including the file system.  Even if debugging symbols were present, the sandboxed code wouldn't have the necessary permissions to access the file system metadata required to populate the stack trace with file paths.  The goal is to prevent a compromised plugin from accessing and exploiting information about the main application's file structure.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the challenges and potential workarounds:

**Example 1:  Illustrating the Problem**

```C#
// Main application
AppDomain sandbox = AppDomain.CreateDomain("Sandbox", null, new AppDomainSetup { ApplicationBase = "plugins" });
try
{
    object result = sandbox.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap(typeof(Plugin).Assembly.FullName, typeof(Plugin).FullName).Unwrap();
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error in sandboxed code: " + ex.Message);
    Console.WriteLine("Stack Trace: " + ex.StackTrace); //Notice the lack of file path and line number information.
}
AppDomain.Unload(sandbox);


// Plugin code (Plugin.cs within the "plugins" directory)
public class Plugin : MarshalByRefObject
{
    public object Execute()
    {
        throw new Exception("An exception occurred in the plugin.");
    }
}
```

This code demonstrates a simple scenario where a plugin throws an exception. The stack trace from the caught exception within the main application will likely lack detailed information due to the sandbox’s security restrictions.

**Example 2:  Utilizing Debug Mode and Symbol Files**

This example requires that you compile the plugin with debugging symbols (using `/debug` flag during compilation) and ensure that those symbols are accessible during debugging.  Even then, the sandbox's security restrictions might still limit the information available.

```C#
// Main application (with adjustments for debug mode)
// ... (AppDomain creation remains unchanged) ...
//  ... (Exception handling remains unchanged) ...
//  However, during debugging within a Visual Studio or similar IDE
//  with the debug symbols loaded,  some additional contextual information
//  might be available within the debugger's interface, though the stack trace itself may not display
//  the full details.
```

This approach attempts to circumvent the limitations but doesn't guarantee full file path and line number recovery in all circumstances.  The success heavily depends on the specific security policy of the sandbox and the debugging tools.


**Example 3:  Custom Exception Handling within the Plugin**

This approach involves carefully handling exceptions within the sandboxed plugin itself, providing more informative exception messages that include contextual data, such as mimicking a file path.  This is a mitigation strategy rather than a solution to the core problem.

```C#
// Plugin code (modified Plugin.cs)
public class Plugin : MarshalByRefObject
{
    public object Execute()
    {
        try
        {
            //Simulate operations that might throw exceptions;
            //Note:  File IO is limited in this environment.
            //The simulated path is a stand-in for demonstration purposes
            throw new Exception("Simulated error at 'Plugins/MyPlugin.cs:15'");

        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            //Additional details are included within the exception message
            throw new Exception("Plugin error: " + ex.Message, ex);
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we add contextual information within the exception message itself which might provide some debugging insight.  However, this is a workaround, not a fix for the lack of accurate file path information from the CLR's stack trace mechanism within the sandbox.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a comprehensive understanding of AppDomain security and the CLR's internal workings, I recommend reviewing the official Microsoft documentation on .NET security and the common language runtime.  Furthermore, consulting advanced debugging resources, particularly those focused on managed code debugging, will be valuable.  A deep dive into the specifics of JIT compilation and its optimization techniques will illuminate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed behavior.  Studying security-focused literature on application plugin architectures is crucial for a holistic understanding of the trade-offs between security and debugging in such contexts.  Finally, exploring the workings of the security manager within the CLR will provide important insights into the restrictions imposed on sandboxed code.
