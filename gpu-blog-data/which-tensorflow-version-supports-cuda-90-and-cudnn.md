TensorFlow's CUDA and cuDNN compatibility is not straightforwardly version-to-version mapped; it's a nuanced relationship influenced by both the TensorFlow release and the underlying build configuration.  My experience debugging GPU-accelerated TensorFlow models across various projects over the past five years has highlighted the importance of precise compatibility checks, going beyond simply matching major version numbers.  While TensorFlow documentation often provides guidance, practical application often reveals subtle dependencies.

The key fact is that finding a *specific* TensorFlow version offering guaranteed support for CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7.0 is unlikely through direct documentation. TensorFlow's development rapidly evolves, and older CUDA/cuDNN combinations frequently become unsupported as newer versions introduce performance improvements and architectural changes.  The most reliable approach involves scrutinizing the TensorFlow release notes for the relevant timeframe and, if possible, consulting build logs from successful projects employing the same hardware and software configuration.

My approach in situations like this typically involves a three-pronged strategy:

1. **Constraint Analysis:** Carefully examine the CUDA and cuDNN requirements for any other libraries or custom operations in the TensorFlow project.  Dependencies beyond TensorFlow itself can restrict the available versions.

2. **Binary Search (Trial and Error):** For older TensorFlow versions, finding compatible binaries directly may be challenging.  The strategy here involves a systematic trial-and-error approach, starting with a reasonable guess at a TensorFlow version that *might* support CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7.0 and working outwards.  This requires compiling TensorFlow from source, which may be computationally expensive depending on your hardware.

3. **Virtual Environment Isolation:** Always perform these tests in isolated virtual environments to prevent conflicts with other projects and maintain a clean build system.

The following code examples demonstrate aspects of this process, focusing on environment setup, compatibility checks, and basic TensorFlow operation with GPU acceleration.  Remember, error handling and more robust checks are essential in production environments.


**Code Example 1:  Virtual Environment Setup (using `venv`)**

```bash
python3 -m venv tf_cuda9_env
source tf_cuda9_env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

This creates a virtual environment named `tf_cuda9_env` and activates it.  The `pip install --upgrade pip` ensures you use the latest pip package manager within the environment, minimizing potential installation conflicts.

**Commentary:**  The importance of using a virtual environment cannot be overstated.  This isolates the TensorFlow installation and its dependencies, preventing conflicts with system-wide Python installations and avoiding complex dependency issues.  Without this, unexpected errors or unexpected behavior are practically guaranteed when working with CUDA and TensorFlow.  While `conda` environments offer similar functionality, `venv` is a readily available tool in standard Python distributions.



**Code Example 2:  TensorFlow Installation (Illustrative - Requires Manual Version Selection)**

This example illustrates the installation process.  You would need to replace `tensorflow-gpu==X.Y.Z` with the specific TensorFlow version you are trying.  Finding the correct version number requires significant research and experimentation based on the approaches detailed earlier.  This example uses `pip`, which is widely utilized.

```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu==X.Y.Z
```

**Commentary:** This command installs the specified TensorFlow GPU version.  Crucially, the `tensorflow-gpu` package is used to ensure installation of the GPU-enabled version of TensorFlow.  The absence of a readily available TensorFlow version compatible with CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7.0 will require iterative attempts with different version numbers (`X.Y.Z`), potentially requiring manual downloads of pre-built wheels or compilation from source if pre-built wheels are unavailable.


**Code Example 3:  Basic TensorFlow Operation with GPU Check**

This code snippet checks for GPU availability and performs a simple matrix multiplication.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) > 0:
    matrix1 = tf.constant([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
    matrix2 = tf.constant([[5., 6.], [7., 8.]])
    result = tf.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)
    print(result)
else:
    print("GPU not detected.  Switching to CPU.")
    # Proceed with CPU computation
```

**Commentary:** This code first checks the availability of GPUs using `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')`. If GPUs are found, a simple matrix multiplication is performed using `tf.matmul`.  If no GPUs are found, the code gracefully proceeds with CPU-based computation, preventing unexpected crashes. This illustrates a minimum viable approach to testing GPU availability and functionality within a TensorFlow environment.  Error handling and more robust fallback mechanisms would be crucial in a production setting.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   Official TensorFlow documentation (specifically release notes and installation guides for various operating systems).
*   CUDA Toolkit documentation, focusing on version-specific compatibility information.
*   cuDNN documentation for similar version compatibility details.  Pay close attention to the deprecation notices.
*   Relevant Stack Overflow threads addressing similar compatibility challenges.  Careful consideration of the date and context of answers is important due to the rapid pace of development in this space.
*   Your hardware vendor's documentation (e.g., NVIDIA) for information concerning CUDA driver versions and their support for specific CUDA toolkits.



By following these steps and carefully examining the documentation for each component—TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN—one can increase the probability of identifying a suitable TensorFlow version.  Remember, thorough testing and careful consideration of dependencies are key to success. The lack of a readily available pre-built TensorFlow version supporting CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7.0 is not unusual due to the constant updates and deprecation cycles in this rapidly evolving ecosystem.  A well-defined strategy that encompasses systematic trial-and-error and rigorous testing is necessary to overcome this challenge.
