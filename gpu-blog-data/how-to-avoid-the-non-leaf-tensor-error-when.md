The core challenge when optimizing both model parameters and custom learnable parameters within a PyTorch framework arises from the automatic differentiation engine's expectation that all optimized tensors should be leaf nodes in the computation graph. A non-leaf tensor, by definition, is one that has resulted from an operation on other tensors, and thus possesses a history of gradient computations, precluding its direct use in the optimizer’s update step. This error typically surfaces when custom learnable parameters are either directly derived from model outputs or are modified using operations that break their leaf status before being passed to the optimizer. My experience, particularly during a project involving adaptive convolutional kernels, has shown that meticulous parameter management is critical to avoid this specific pitfall.

The error manifests because `torch.optim` updates parameters in place. A parameter that is not a leaf node has already had gradient computations attached. The optimizer expects to modify the tensor's underlying storage directly, without interference from existing gradients. When a tensor loses its leaf status, usually through an in-place operation or being an output of some operation, the gradients are tied to the operation that produced the tensor, not just the tensor’s value itself. Thus, an attempt to update such a tensor directly using the optimizer leads to a conflict.

The key to resolving this involves ensuring that custom learnable parameters remain leaf tensors, are properly included in the optimizer, and their gradients flow appropriately. Generally, there are three practical approaches: (1) defining custom parameters as explicit `nn.Parameter` instances, (2) ensuring they are not inadvertently altered through operations, and (3) if absolutely necessary, detaching the tensor from the computation graph before passing it to the optimizer. Let’s examine each of these with examples.

**Example 1: Defining Custom Parameters Correctly**

The most robust and recommended strategy is to declare the custom learnable parameters as instances of `torch.nn.Parameter`. This effectively registers them as part of the module's trainable parameters. Consider the following scenario where I'm trying to create a trainable bias for each filter in a convolutional layer's output. Incorrectly, I might try something like this:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class IncorrectCustomParameterModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_filters):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, num_filters, kernel_size=3)
        self.custom_bias = torch.zeros(num_filters) # Incorrect: Not an nn.Parameter

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        return x + self.custom_bias.view(1, -1, 1, 1) # Incorrect: Loss of leaf node status


model = IncorrectCustomParameterModel(16)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)
target_tensor = torch.randn(1, 16, 30, 30) # Example matching the conv output

try:
    output = model(input_tensor)
    loss = loss_fn(output, target_tensor)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
except RuntimeError as e:
   print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
```

This will result in a `RuntimeError` stating that a non-leaf tensor was used in the optimizer. The problem is that `self.custom_bias` was just a regular PyTorch tensor, not a parameter registered with the module. Its direct usage within the forward pass transformed it into a non-leaf node. The corrected version uses `nn.Parameter`:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class CorrectCustomParameterModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_filters):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, num_filters, kernel_size=3)
        self.custom_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(num_filters)) # Correct: Declared as nn.Parameter

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        return x + self.custom_bias.view(1, -1, 1, 1)

model = CorrectCustomParameterModel(16)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)
target_tensor = torch.randn(1, 16, 30, 30)

output = model(input_tensor)
loss = loss_fn(output, target_tensor)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

print("Optimization step executed successfully.")
```
Here, using `nn.Parameter` explicitly informs PyTorch that `self.custom_bias` is a trainable part of the model. The optimizer now has complete access and control over its gradient updates, and the loss computation can propagate gradients through the custom parameter.

**Example 2: Avoiding In-place Operations**

Another critical situation occurs when a custom parameter, initially defined as a leaf node, is modified in place, causing it to lose its leaf status. In my experiments with feature normalization, I inadvertently updated scale parameters with an in-place operation:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class InplaceNormalizationModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_filters):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, num_filters, kernel_size=3)
        self.scale = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(num_filters))

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        # Intentional in-place modification (Incorrect)
        self.scale.data += 0.1 # Incorrect: In-place update
        x = x * self.scale.view(1, -1, 1, 1)
        return x

model = InplaceNormalizationModel(16)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)
target_tensor = torch.randn(1, 16, 30, 30)

try:
    output = model(input_tensor)
    loss = loss_fn(output, target_tensor)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
except RuntimeError as e:
   print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
```
The statement `self.scale.data += 0.1` modifies `self.scale` in-place, rendering it a non-leaf tensor. To avoid this, we should use a non-in-place version:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class NonInplaceNormalizationModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_filters):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, num_filters, kernel_size=3)
        self.scale = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(num_filters))

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        # Correct non-in-place update
        updated_scale = self.scale + 0.1
        x = x * updated_scale.view(1, -1, 1, 1)
        self.scale.data = updated_scale.data # Ensure scale is updated
        return x


model = NonInplaceNormalizationModel(16)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)
target_tensor = torch.randn(1, 16, 30, 30)

output = model(input_tensor)
loss = loss_fn(output, target_tensor)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

print("Optimization step executed successfully.")
```
In this revised version, the updated scale is calculated as a new tensor `updated_scale`, and `self.scale` is reassigned the `updated_scale.data`. This leaves `self.scale` as a leaf node, while still allowing us to modify it during the forward pass, addressing the non-leaf error.

**Example 3: Detaching for complex computations**

Sometimes custom learnable parameters need to be used in ways that will always make them non-leaf, like creating a dynamic input for another model. If a parameter must be modified by a complex operation within the forward pass that inevitably strips it of leaf node status, the `detach()` method offers a solution. However, this must be used judiciously because it breaks gradients. This technique should only be applied to a copy of the tensor before the computation that should not be part of the optimization, allowing optimization to continue while avoiding errors.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class DetachParameterModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_filters):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, num_filters, kernel_size=3)
        self.alpha = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(1))

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        # Detaching a clone so we can use the alpha parameter to modify conv output
        detached_alpha = self.alpha.clone().detach()
        modified_x = x * detached_alpha
        return modified_x


model = DetachParameterModel(16)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)
target_tensor = torch.randn(1, 16, 30, 30)

output = model(input_tensor)
loss = loss_fn(output, target_tensor)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

print("Optimization step executed successfully.")
```

Here the `self.alpha` parameter's derivative is not part of the calculation on the `x` tensor. This prevents it from losing its leaf status during the gradient propagation. Note the optimization still updates `self.alpha` based on the loss on the final output. The detach step ensures the gradient of the modified `x` tensor doesn't back propagate into the copy of `self.alpha`

**Resource Recommendations**

To further understand these concepts, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation, especially sections dealing with automatic differentiation, parameters, and optimizers. Detailed tutorials on custom layer implementation, and discussions around backpropagation are useful. Furthermore, exploring examples in PyTorch's official examples repository provides invaluable context. Additionally, seeking out tutorials specifically discussing advanced techniques for handling custom parameters will add depth to this knowledge base.
