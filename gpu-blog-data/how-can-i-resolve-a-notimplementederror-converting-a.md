The `NotImplementedError` during symbolic tensor conversion within a recurrent neural network (RNN) typically stems from the incompatibility between the chosen backend (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and the specific operations performed on the symbolic tensors, often within a custom layer or function.  This incompatibility manifests when the backend's automatic differentiation mechanisms encounter an operation it cannot translate into a differentiable computation graph.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale NLP projects has highlighted the critical role of carefully examining the custom operations and ensuring their compatibility with the chosen framework's automatic differentiation capabilities.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core of the problem lies in the fundamental difference between eager execution and symbolic computation within deep learning frameworks.  Eager execution evaluates operations immediately, while symbolic computation constructs a computational graph first and then executes it.  RNNs, inherently sequential in nature, heavily rely on symbolic computation for efficient gradient calculations through backpropagation through time (BPTT).  When a custom operation or a library function is used within an RNN, the framework's automatic differentiation engine attempts to trace the computation graph.  If the engine encounters an operation it cannot differentiate – due to its inherent nature, lack of registered gradients, or incompatibility with the underlying backend – a `NotImplementedError` is raised.

This usually occurs in situations where:

* **Custom Layers/Functions:** You've implemented a custom layer or function that performs operations not directly supported by the automatic differentiation system. This is common when using specialized mathematical functions or algorithms not pre-integrated into the framework.

* **Unsupported Operations:** The custom operation involves an operation (e.g., certain bitwise operations, highly specialized mathematical functions) not natively supported by the backend's gradient computation.

* **Tensor Type Mismatch:** The tensors involved might have a data type (e.g., `tf.string`, unsupported custom types) that the automatic differentiation system cannot handle.

* **Library Conflicts:**  Interactions between different libraries or versions might lead to conflicts, resulting in the inability to properly trace the computational graph.

Resolving this error requires meticulously examining the code for any non-differentiable operations, identifying the problematic sections, and either replacing them with differentiable alternatives, implementing custom gradient functions, or switching to a framework or backend that explicitly supports the operations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Custom Activation Function without Gradient**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomActivation(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.sign(inputs) # Non-differentiable at 0

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
    MyCustomActivation(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# This will likely raise a NotImplementedError during training
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(...)
```

This code demonstrates a scenario where a custom activation function, `tf.math.sign`, which is non-differentiable at zero, is used within an LSTM layer.  During backpropagation, the framework cannot compute gradients for this operation, leading to the error. The solution is to replace `tf.math.sign` with a differentiable approximation, such as a smoothed sign function or a suitable alternative.


**Example 2:  Incorrect Tensor Type**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

inputs = tf.constant(["hello", "world"], dtype=tf.string) # Incorrect dtype
lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64)(inputs) # Error here
```

In this example, the input tensor `inputs` is of type `tf.string`, which is not directly compatible with LSTM layers.  TensorFlow's LSTM expects numerical input. The solution involves preprocessing the inputs, potentially converting them into numerical representations (e.g., embeddings).


**Example 3:  Implementing a Custom Gradient**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def my_custom_op(x):
    def grad(dy):
        return dy * tf.math.exp(-x**2) # Custom gradient function
    return tf.math.tanh(x), grad

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return my_custom_op(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
    MyCustomLayer(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
```

Here, we define a custom operation `my_custom_op` with its corresponding gradient using `tf.custom_gradient`. This explicitly defines how gradients should be computed for this operation, circumventing the automatic differentiation system's limitations.  This approach is suitable when dealing with operations that aren't directly supported by automatic differentiation but for which gradients can be manually defined.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a more thorough understanding of automatic differentiation, consult advanced deep learning textbooks.  Focus on sections explaining computational graphs, backpropagation, and the implementation specifics of automatic differentiation within the chosen deep learning framework.  The official documentation of your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, etc.) is crucial for understanding the supported operations and how to implement custom gradients.  Finally, carefully review tutorials and examples focusing on creating and utilizing custom layers and functions within RNN architectures. These resources will equip you with the knowledge to diagnose and resolve similar errors effectively.
