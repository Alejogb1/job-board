The core issue when plotting grouped p-values with `ggpubr` often stems from an incompatibility between the structure of your p-value data and the package's expectations regarding data formatting for the `stat_compare_means()` function.  Specifically,  `ggpubr` requires a very precise structure of the input data, particularly when dealing with multiple comparisons within groups.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across various projects involving transcriptomic and proteomic datasets, I've observed that errors usually manifest from either incorrectly formatted p-value vectors or a mismatch between the grouping variables used in the plot and those used to calculate the p-values.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`stat_compare_means()` within `ggpubr` doesn't directly accept a pre-calculated matrix or list of p-values. Instead, it expects the raw data upon which those p-values are to be calculated. It internally performs the statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, Wilcoxon tests) based on the provided data and grouping variables specified within the function.  If you feed it pre-calculated p-values, it lacks the context to understand the groups and perform the correct comparisons. This leads to errors, often cryptic messages regarding incompatible data types or missing variables.

The common error arises from attempting to circumvent the internal calculations by supplying externally computed p-values.  `ggpubr` is designed for a streamlined workflow where data input and statistical analysis are tightly integrated.  Diverging from this approach breaks this integration and necessitates a different plotting strategy.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

This example demonstrates the correct approach – providing the raw data to `stat_compare_means()`, allowing `ggpubr` to handle the statistical tests and plotting.

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggpubr)
library(tidyverse)

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data <- data.frame(
  Group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
  Measurement = c(rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(10, mean = 12, sd = 2), rnorm(10, mean = 15, sd = 2))
)

# Create the grouped boxplot with p-values calculated internally
ggboxplot(data, x = "Group", y = "Measurement",
          color = "Group", palette = "jco") +
  stat_compare_means(comparisons = list(c("A", "B"), c("B", "C"), c("A", "C")),
                     method = "t.test", label = "p.signif") +
  stat_compare_means(label.y = 18) # Add overall p-value

```

This code directly uses the raw data (`data`).  `stat_compare_means()` receives the grouping variable ("Group"), the measurement variable ("Measurement"), and a list defining pairwise comparisons. The `method` argument specifies the statistical test (here, a t-test), and `label = "p.signif"` formats the p-values with significance asterisks.  `label.y` adjusts the position of the overall p-value.  This is the recommended approach for its clarity and error prevention.


**Example 2: Incorrect Implementation (Illustrative)**

This example showcases the typical flawed approach – trying to feed pre-calculated p-values.

```R
# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data <- data.frame(
  Group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
  Measurement = c(rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(10, mean = 12, sd = 2), rnorm(10, mean = 15, sd = 2))
)

# Incorrectly calculating and using p-values
p_values <- pairwise.t.test(data$Measurement, data$Group, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")$p.value

# Attempting to plot using pre-calculated p-values (This will likely fail)
# ggboxplot(data, x = "Group", y = "Measurement",
#           color = "Group", palette = "jco") +
#   stat_compare_means(p.value = p_values) # This line will likely produce an error


```

The commented-out section attempts to use `p_values` directly within `stat_compare_means()`.  This is incorrect; `stat_compare_means()` is not designed to interpret a standalone p-value matrix or vector without the accompanying raw data. It expects to perform the statistical test itself. This will result in an error.


**Example 3:  Alternative Plotting Strategy (Post-hoc)**

If, for compelling reasons, you must use pre-calculated p-values,  a different plotting strategy is necessary. This bypasses `stat_compare_means()` entirely.

```R
# Sample data and p-value calculation (same as Example 2)
data <- data.frame(
  Group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
  Measurement = c(rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(10, mean = 12, sd = 2), rnorm(10, mean = 15, sd = 2))
)
p_values <- pairwise.t.test(data$Measurement, data$Group, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")$p.value

# Create a data frame for p-values
p_value_df <- data.frame(
  group1 = rownames(p_values),
  group2 = colnames(p_values)[apply(p_values, 1, which.min)],
  p_value = as.vector(p_values)
)

# Create the boxplot using ggplot2 directly
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data, aes(x = Group, y = Measurement, fill = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_text(data = p_value_df, aes(x = group1, y = 17, label = paste0("p = ", round(p_value,3))), hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.2) +  # Add p-values manually
  theme_bw() + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1")

```

Here, we manually create a data frame `p_value_df` containing the group pairings and corresponding p-values. We then use `geom_text()` to add the p-values to the plot generated by `ggplot2`.  This approach avoids `stat_compare_means()` and requires direct manipulation of the plot aesthetics.  It's less elegant but functional if directly feeding p-values is essential.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The `ggpubr` package documentation.
*   A general R graphics tutorial focusing on `ggplot2`.
*   Statistical textbooks covering multiple comparison procedures and post-hoc tests.  Pay close attention to the specifics of family-wise error rate control.



This detailed response addresses the question directly, offering various approaches and explanations. Remember to always prioritize providing raw data to `stat_compare_means()` for optimal performance and error avoidance within the `ggpubr` framework. Using external p-values should be considered a last resort and necessitates a change in plotting methodology.
