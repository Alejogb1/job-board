The inherent complexity of large T-SQL scripts often stems from a lack of modularity, hindering maintainability, reusability, and performance.  My experience optimizing database systems has shown that decomposing monolithic T-SQL scripts into smaller, well-defined stored procedures and functions dramatically improves these aspects.  This response details a systematic approach to refactoring, along with illustrative code examples drawn from my work on a large-scale financial transaction processing system.


**1.  Strategic Decomposition:**

The key to successful decomposition lies in identifying logical units within the larger script.  This necessitates a thorough understanding of the script's functionality.  Begin by examining the script for distinct operations or processes.  Each identifiable logical unit should ideally perform a single, well-defined task. This principle of single responsibility is crucial for building robust and maintainable code.

For example, consider a large script that processes incoming transactions: it might include data validation, record insertion, update operations, and finally, logging.  These four steps represent natural candidates for individual stored procedures.  Data validation, for instance, can be encapsulated in a separate procedure that checks constraints, data types, and business rules. This enhances readability and enables easier debugging and testing.

Furthermore, the decomposition process should consider data dependencies.  Procedures should be structured in a way that minimizes dependencies and enables parallel execution where appropriate.  Procedures that depend on the output of other procedures should be sequenced appropriately.  Careful planning in this phase significantly impacts overall performance.

**2. Code Examples:**

Let's illustrate this with three code examples. We'll assume our initial monolithic script processes customer orders, encompassing order validation, inventory update, and order confirmation email sending.

**Example 1: Monolithic Script (Illustrative, not optimized)**

```sql
-- Original monolithic script (poor practice)
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Validation
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID AND Active = 1)
BEGIN
    --Inventory Update
    UPDATE Inventory SET Quantity = Quantity - @Quantity WHERE ProductID = @ProductID;
    IF @@ROWCOUNT = 0
    BEGIN
        ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
        RAISERROR('Insufficient inventory', 16, 1);
    END;
    --Order Insertion
    INSERT INTO Orders (CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity, OrderDate) VALUES (@CustomerID, @ProductID, @Quantity, GETDATE());
    --Email Sending (Simplified)
    EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail @profile_name = 'OrderConfirmation', @recipients = @CustomerEmail, @subject = 'Order Confirmation';
    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    RAISERROR('Invalid Customer', 16, 1);
END;
```

**Example 2:  ValidatedOrder Stored Procedure**

```sql
-- Stored Procedure for Order Validation
CREATE PROCEDURE ValidateOrder (@CustomerID INT, @ProductID INT, @Quantity INT)
AS
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID AND Active = 1)
        RAISERROR('Invalid Customer', 16, 1);
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Inventory WHERE ProductID = @ProductID AND Quantity >= @Quantity)
        RAISERROR('Insufficient Inventory', 16, 1);
END;
```

**Example 3: UpdateInventory and InsertOrder Stored Procedures**

```sql
-- Stored Procedure for Inventory Update
CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateInventory (@ProductID INT, @Quantity INT)
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE Inventory SET Quantity = Quantity - @Quantity WHERE ProductID = @ProductID;
    IF @@ROWCOUNT = 0
        RAISERROR('Inventory update failed', 16, 1);
END;

-- Stored Procedure for Order Insertion
CREATE PROCEDURE InsertOrder (@CustomerID INT, @ProductID INT, @Quantity INT)
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Orders (CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity, OrderDate) VALUES (@CustomerID, @ProductID, @Quantity, GETDATE());
    SELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY() AS OrderID; -- Return OrderID for subsequent use.
END;
```

The refactored code uses three stored procedures: `ValidateOrder`, `UpdateInventory`, and `InsertOrder`.  This improves readability, allowing for individual testing and easier maintenance. Error handling is also more localized and specific.  The email sending functionality, while simplified in the example, could also be encapsulated within its own stored procedure, further enhancing modularity.  The use of `SCOPE_IDENTITY()` in `InsertOrder` allows for retrieving the newly inserted order ID for potential use in subsequent procedures.


**3.  Resource Recommendations:**

To further enhance your understanding of T-SQL optimization and stored procedure design, I recommend consulting the official SQL Server documentation on stored procedures and functions.  Thoroughly study the concepts of transactions, error handling, and indexing.  Explore advanced techniques such as using temporary tables for intermediate results and optimizing queries for performance.  Consider studying design patterns applicable to database development to refine your approach to creating modular and efficient database solutions.  Finally, a thorough grasp of SQL Server Profiler capabilities will significantly aid in analyzing and optimizing your SQL scripts and stored procedures.


**4.  Considerations for Functions:**

While stored procedures are ideal for encapsulating complex logic and potentially multiple statements, scalar-valued functions are suitable for encapsulating single-value computations.  For instance, a function could be created to calculate the total order value, given the order details.  This would be more efficient than embedding such calculations within a larger stored procedure.  Similarly, table-valued functions can be used to return result sets based on input parameters. This can be beneficial when dealing with repeated queries that operate on subsets of data.  However, be mindful of the limitations of functions, particularly the restrictions on modifications made within the function's scope.

The application of functions versus stored procedures depends largely on the complexity of the task and the required data manipulation.  Functions shine in providing reusable computations within a larger context, whereas stored procedures provide the structure for larger procedural blocks of T-SQL code.

In conclusion, breaking down large T-SQL scripts into smaller, well-defined stored procedures and functions is a critical step towards creating maintainable, scalable, and performant database applications.  This methodical approach, coupled with a deep understanding of database design principles, will significantly improve your overall efficiency and the quality of your database solutions.  Remember that careful planning and understanding of data dependencies are paramount for successful decomposition.
