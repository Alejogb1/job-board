The efficacy of a channels-first approach in Keras depends heavily on the specific hardware and the nature of the data.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects at a major tech firm revealed a clear pattern: while TensorFlow (upon which Keras is built) can often benefit from channels-first data ordering on CPUs, the advantage frequently disappears—and sometimes even reverses—on modern GPUs. This stems from the memory access patterns and architectural optimizations within these processors.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The channels-first approach (NCHW – Number of samples, Channels, Height, Width) places the channel dimension before the spatial dimensions (height and width) in a tensor. Conversely, the channels-last approach (NHWC – Number of samples, Height, Width, Channels) puts the channels dimension last.  The impact of this seemingly minor change in data ordering hinges on memory access.

CPUs generally benefit from a channels-first approach because it allows for better cache utilization. When processing an image, the CPU typically accesses pixels sequentially.  With channels-first, consecutive memory accesses retrieve related pixel values (e.g., all red values for a patch of the image), leading to improved data locality and reduced cache misses.  This is particularly advantageous for smaller images or when memory bandwidth is a limiting factor.

GPUs, however, employ massively parallel processing architectures. Their strengths lie in vector and matrix operations. While a channels-first arrangement might offer slight theoretical advantages in some specific convolutional operations, the impact is often minimal, especially with modern GPUs designed for efficient memory access regardless of the data layout.  Furthermore, the overhead incurred in data reshaping or transposing, which is necessary to switch between channels-first and channels-last during model building and inference, might outweigh any performance gains realized from the optimized memory access.  In my experience optimizing image recognition models for deployment on TPUs, for instance, I found that the overhead associated with channel swapping consistently outweighed minor improvements in inference time achieved through channels-first ordering.

Finally, the specific Keras backend (TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK) can also influence the optimal choice. While TensorFlow's optimized kernels might partially compensate for less-ideal memory access patterns in certain cases, the impact is generally minor compared to the hardware architecture.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate how to define a CNN model in Keras using both channels-first and channels-last data ordering.  Note that the `data_format` parameter within the `Conv2D` layer controls the data layout.

**Example 1: Channels-Last (NHWC)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model_nhwc = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1), data_format='channels_last'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2), data_format='channels_last'),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model_nhwc.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example showcases a simple CNN using the default channels-last data format. This is generally the preferred and most readily compatible setting across various Keras backends and hardware.  The `input_shape` explicitly defines the expected image dimensions, including the channel dimension as the last element.

**Example 2: Channels-First (NCHW)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model_nchw = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(1, 28, 28), data_format='channels_first'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2), data_format='channels_first'),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model_nchw.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example mirrors the previous one, but explicitly sets the `data_format` to `channels_first`.  Notice the change in `input_shape`: the channel dimension is now the first element.  This requires pre-processing your data accordingly, which can add overhead.

**Example 3: Data Preprocessing for Channels-First**

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume 'x_train' is your training data in NHWC format (e.g., (60000, 28, 28, 1))
x_train_nchw = np.transpose(x_train, (0, 3, 1, 2)) # Transpose to NCHW

# Now 'x_train_nchw' is ready for use with the 'model_nchw' defined above
```

This illustrates the necessary data transformation. Using `numpy.transpose`, we rearrange the axes to shift the channel dimension to the front.  This operation is computationally expensive, and the time spent on this transformation should be considered when assessing the overall performance benefits (or lack thereof) of the channels-first approach.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of the underlying memory access patterns and hardware architectures, I strongly recommend consulting the official documentation for your chosen Keras backend (TensorFlow, in particular).  A thorough exploration of the performance optimization guides provided by the backend's developers will offer crucial insights into the practical implications of data ordering.  Furthermore, a solid grasp of linear algebra and parallel computing principles will prove beneficial in comprehending the nuances of this optimization strategy.  Finally, performing benchmark tests on your specific hardware with representative datasets is the ultimate method to determine the optimal approach for your exact use case.  Systematic experimentation and detailed performance analysis are crucial in discerning whether channels-first yields any significant improvement or, in many cases, introduces a net performance loss.
