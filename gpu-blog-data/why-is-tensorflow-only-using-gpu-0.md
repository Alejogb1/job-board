TensorFlow, by default, often restricts its operations to the first detected GPU (GPU 0) due to a combination of environment configuration, resource management strategies, and underlying software architecture. This behavior stems from the way TensorFlow initializes its compute devices and is designed to promote stability and predictable execution in single-GPU scenarios. However, this default restriction is often undesirable when multiple GPUs are available and can be easily modified using various configuration settings.

The primary reason for this default single-GPU behavior is TensorFlow's resource placement algorithm. When no specific placement is enforced through code or environment variables, TensorFlow adopts a strategy where all operations are assigned to the first available GPU it identifies. This minimizes the complexity associated with managing multiple GPUs, and avoids assumptions about user preferences regarding GPU allocation in diverse hardware setups. Essentially, unless explicitly instructed otherwise, TensorFlow treats the system as if only one GPU exists.

Furthermore, the automatic GPU detection process in TensorFlow relies on underlying CUDA or ROCm libraries, and it's conceivable that initial discovery might privilege device 0. If a system has heterogeneous GPUs, or driver configurations are not entirely consistent, TensorFlow may encounter unexpected behaviors if it tries to automatically utilize all available GPUs without explicit guidance. As such, a single GPU default offers a safer initial state from a library development perspective.

Beyond these default behaviors, it's useful to appreciate how TensorFlow manages devices internally. It uses a device string identifier like '/GPU:0' to denote GPU zero. When defining a computation graph, each node or operation is assigned to a specific device. When no device is explicitly assigned, TensorFlow will default to placing that operation on the first GPU it has identified. This device placement behavior is crucial to understanding why we observe the usage of only GPU 0.

To control which GPUs TensorFlow uses, I have found three techniques to be most effective in my work on distributed deep learning training. The first involves setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable, which directly influences the GPUs visible to TensorFlow. The second is using the `tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices` API to programmatically control GPU visibility within a TensorFlow script. Lastly, the `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` allows easy distributed training, though in that context, manual device assignment is not common, as the strategy manages the distributed placement on available resources. Each of these approaches allows for precise management and optimization of GPU usage.

Consider this example illustrating how `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` can affect TensorFlowâ€™s behavior. Let's assume a system has four GPUs (numbered 0 to 3). If I run a TensorFlow script without setting any environment variables, it will naturally select GPU 0. However, if I set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2` before executing the script, TensorFlow will only see and use GPU 2, as the environment variable effectively masks other GPUs.

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf

# Simulate system having four GPUs 0, 1, 2, and 3.
# Setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is done in the shell, not inside Python.
# os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "2" # This would not be effective within the script.

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  print(f"Number of GPUs detected: {len(gpus)}")
  for gpu in gpus:
    print(f"GPU Name: {gpu.name}")
else:
  print("No GPUs detected.")

# Some computation to show device usage.
a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
c = tf.matmul(a, b)

print(f"Result of matrix multiplication: \n{c}")
print(f"Operation 'matmul' is placed on device: {c.device}")

```

This code snippet first attempts to list the GPUs that TensorFlow can see. When the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable is not set, or it includes device 0, the code will output "GPU Name: /physical_device:GPU:0". However, with the variable set to `2`, the code will output "GPU Name: /physical_device:GPU:0", where, in fact, this name refers to physical GPU 2. The matrix multiplication is executed on whichever GPU TensorFlow perceives as device 0 after the visibility is set using the environment variable. This highlights the direct influence `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` has on TensorFlow's device discovery process and consequently, its use of GPUs.

A more programmatic approach is to use `tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices`. Instead of relying on environment variables which must be set externally, the visibility of specific GPUs can be controlled directly in the TensorFlow script. This provides more flexibility for device selection on a script-by-script basis.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume system has four GPUs 0, 1, 2, and 3.
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
  # Make only GPU 1 visible.
  tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(gpus[1], 'GPU')
  logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
  print(f"Number of logical GPUs available: {len(logical_gpus)}")
  for gpu in logical_gpus:
      print(f"Logical GPU: {gpu}")
else:
  print("No GPUs detected.")

# Some computation to show device usage.
a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
c = tf.matmul(a, b)

print(f"Result of matrix multiplication: \n{c}")
print(f"Operation 'matmul' is placed on device: {c.device}")
```

This code explicitly makes only GPU with index 1 visible to TensorFlow by using `tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices`. When executed, TensorFlow will create a single logical GPU that will be used for all computations. While the physical GPU is the second one in the system, TensorFlow will use the logical GPU 0 to perform the matmul operation. This makes the script's reliance on `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` obsolete, giving more flexibility to users.

Finally, when wanting to perform distributed training using multiple GPUs, `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` can be employed. In this case, the strategy automatically distributes the data and calculations across available GPUs; therefore it is less about managing the individual assignment and more about enabling parallel processing.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
  a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
  b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
  c = tf.matmul(a, b)

print(f"Result of matrix multiplication: \n{c}")
print(f"Operation 'matmul' is placed on device: {c.device}")
print(f"Number of replicas available {len(strategy.extended.worker_devices)}")

```

This code demonstrates using the mirrored strategy where multiple GPUs will be used to perform the operations, and they will be synced. When executing this code on a system with several GPUs, the matrix multiplication will be performed on all the available devices. The printed device will output a composite device, indicating that the result was assembled from different GPUs. The `strategy.extended.worker_devices` list gives visibility into the resources utilized by the mirrored strategy. Note that while this approach doesn't directly show explicit control over GPU allocation like the prior examples, it efficiently utilizes all available GPUs for distributed computations without manual intervention.

For further understanding, I would strongly recommend consulting the TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections concerning device placement, GPU configurations, and the use of distribution strategies. The TensorFlow performance guide provides invaluable insights into optimizing code for GPUs. Finally, delving into the CUDA or ROCm documentation specific to the GPU hardware in use can greatly assist in diagnosing driver related issues.
