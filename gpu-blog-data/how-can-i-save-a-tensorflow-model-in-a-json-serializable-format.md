TensorFlow models, by their nature, are not directly serializable into JSON due to their complex structure, which includes weights, biases, graph definitions, and potentially custom objects. The challenge lies in representing this architecture and its associated data in a text-based, universally interpretable format like JSON. The straightforward approach of attempting to serialize a model object directly will invariably result in `TypeError` exceptions due to the presence of non-serializable data types like NumPy arrays and TensorFlow tensors. However, we can achieve a form of model persistence compatible with JSON through careful selection of what we serialize. Instead of saving the *model* itself, I've found success in saving metadata and architecture specifications, then separately persisting the trained weights.

To elaborate, I've often structured my model saving process into two distinct stages. First, I define the model architecture using either TensorFlow's `tf.keras.Sequential` or the functional API, and I store this architecture in a JSON-compatible dictionary format. This approach requires careful handling of layers and their configurations. I find it’s most reliable to extract layer names, types, and their configurable parameters (like filters in convolutional layers, or units in dense layers) and convert them to primitive data types that JSON can handle directly. These parameters are usually numerical, strings, or booleans. Then, I utilize the Keras API for saving the model’s weights. These weights can then be stored either as a NumPy array or as a set of tensors, depending on what I need for my specific applications. I typically prefer saving to the NumPy array. I then save these arrays as separate files. Finally, to restore the model from JSON, I first build the model based on the saved JSON configuration, and then load in the saved weights from the separate file into the newly constructed model.

Here's an example of how to convert a simple `Sequential` model's architecture into a JSON-compatible dictionary:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import json
import numpy as np

def model_to_json_compatible(model):
    config = {
        'layers': []
    }
    for layer in model.layers:
        layer_config = {
            'name': layer.name,
            'class_name': layer.__class__.__name__
        }
        if hasattr(layer, 'get_config'):
            layer_config.update(layer.get_config())
        config['layers'].append(layer_config)
    return config

# Example Model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Convert model config to JSON-compatible dict
json_config = model_to_json_compatible(model)
print(json.dumps(json_config, indent=4))

# Save to a JSON file (Optional)
with open('model_architecture.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(json_config, f, indent=4)

# Save weights separately
weights = model.get_weights()
for i, w in enumerate(weights):
  np.save(f"weight_{i}.npy", w)
```

In this code, I've defined a function `model_to_json_compatible` which iterates through each layer of the supplied Keras model. Inside the loop, it extracts the layer's name, class name, and then calls the `get_config()` method if it exists. The result is a nested dictionary with layers and their properties which can easily be handled by the standard Python JSON library. I then save the model weights separately to a series of NumPy file which can be loaded back into a model that is built according to the configuration. I included an optional save to file for the architecture.

To reconstruct the model from the saved JSON config and weight files, use this approach:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import json
import numpy as np


def model_from_json_compatible(config):
    layers = []
    for layer_config in config['layers']:
        layer_class = getattr(tf.keras.layers, layer_config['class_name'])
        kwargs = {k: v for k, v in layer_config.items() if k not in ('name', 'class_name')}
        layer = layer_class(**kwargs)
        layers.append(layer)

    return tf.keras.Sequential(layers)

# Load model config from JSON (or from file)
json_config_load = {
   'layers': [
        {'name': 'dense_2', 'class_name': 'Dense', 'units': 64, 'activation': 'relu', 'use_bias': True,
         'kernel_initializer': {'class_name': 'GlorotUniform', 'config': {'seed': None}},
         'bias_initializer': {'class_name': 'Zeros', 'config': {}}, 'kernel_regularizer': None,
         'bias_regularizer': None, 'activity_regularizer': None, 'kernel_constraint': None,
         'bias_constraint': None},
        {'name': 'dropout_1', 'class_name': 'Dropout', 'rate': 0.2, 'noise_shape': None, 'seed': None},
        {'name': 'dense_3', 'class_name': 'Dense', 'units': 10, 'activation': 'softmax', 'use_bias': True,
         'kernel_initializer': {'class_name': 'GlorotUniform', 'config': {'seed': None}},
         'bias_initializer': {'class_name': 'Zeros', 'config': {}}, 'kernel_regularizer': None,
         'bias_regularizer': None, 'activity_regularizer': None, 'kernel_constraint': None,
         'bias_constraint': None}
    ]
}


# Build model architecture from JSON config
model_reconstructed = model_from_json_compatible(json_config_load)

# Load weights from npy file
loaded_weights = []
for i in range(len(model_reconstructed.get_weights())):
    loaded_weights.append(np.load(f"weight_{i}.npy"))

# Set weights into reconstructed model
model_reconstructed.set_weights(loaded_weights)

# Verify model
model_reconstructed.build((None, 784))
model_reconstructed.summary()
```

This second code snippet implements `model_from_json_compatible`, which takes in the previously saved dictionary. For each layer, it dynamically constructs the layer objects using `getattr` and unpacks the config using the splat operator. The resulting list of layers is then passed to the `Sequential` constructor to rebuild the model architecture. After this, the saved weights are loaded from the saved numpy files and passed to the `set_weights` method to restore the trained state of the model. The `build` method is used before `summary` because the model's architecture has not yet been fully realized by an input shape.

It’s important to note that this strategy is more tailored for Keras models, and might need adjustments if custom layers or complex models with non-standard configurations are in use. For example, you may need to add more complex handling of layers or even custom serialization methods of config files.

For more intricate models, especially those using the functional API or those containing custom layers, the approach may need refinement. I've found that you might need a dedicated function that can iterate through all layers, extract their properties, and then translate each layer to a JSON-friendly object. When you are dealing with custom layers, you must include their `get_config()` method to be called by the `model_to_json_compatible` function. If you do not, then you will not have the configurations necessary to initialize it with the model from the JSON. Similarly, if you have custom losses, metrics, or optimizers, you will need to build custom methods to make them JSON serializable as well.

I would strongly advise consulting TensorFlow’s official documentation for best practices regarding model persistence. Also, books focusing on deep learning, especially those that have chapters dedicated to TensorFlow and Keras, often have examples and guidelines for model saving. Articles in technical blogs related to machine learning engineering sometimes contain advanced techniques for model management including serializations. For example, the "TensorFlow Developer's Guide" details numerous ways to save models. In addition, the "Deep Learning with Python" book can be helpful when it comes to using Keras.
