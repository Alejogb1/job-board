Fragment shader output variables, often used for intermediary calculations before writing to the final output color, can lead to performance bottlenecks in WebGL/OpenGL, especially on less powerful hardware.  My experience optimizing shaders for mobile platforms has consistently highlighted this.  While seemingly convenient for complex shading calculations, the implicit memory writes associated with these variables introduce overhead that can significantly impact frame rates, particularly when dealing with high-resolution textures or computationally intensive fragment shaders.  This inefficiency stems from the fact that fragment shaders operate on a per-pixel basis, and the extra memory access for these temporary variables adds up rapidly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue isn't the use of variables *per se*, but the unnecessary creation and manipulation of intermediate variables in the fragment shader's output stage.  The fragment shader pipeline has a well-defined sequence:  input from textures and varying variables, calculations, and finally, writing to the fragment color output.  Introducing temporary output variables disrupts this flow.  These variables reside in memory that might be less optimized for high-speed access than registers used during internal shader calculations.  While modern GPUs have sophisticated register allocation, excessive output variables can still overflow this capacity, forcing spilling to slower memory. This spilling to and from memory generates significant overhead, especially noticeable on resource-constrained mobile GPUs.  Furthermore, the memory writes associated with these temporary variables increase bandwidth consumption, potentially becoming a bottleneck in the rendering pipeline.

The optimal approach focuses on minimizing the number of writes to memory within the fragment shader. The ideal scenario is to perform all necessary calculations and directly output the final pixel color in a single write operation to `gl_FragColor` (or its equivalent in WebGL2).  This minimizes memory access, leading to improved performance.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Use of Fragment Output Variables**

```glsl
#version 300 es
precision mediump float;
out vec4 FragColor;
out vec4 tempColor; // Inefficient temporary output variable

in vec2 uv;
uniform sampler2D texture1;
uniform sampler2D texture2;

void main() {
    vec4 color1 = texture(texture1, uv);
    vec4 color2 = texture(texture2, uv);

    tempColor = color1 + color2; // Unnecessary write to memory
    FragColor = tempColor * vec4(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0); // Another write
}
```

This example showcases inefficient use.  `tempColor` is an unnecessary intermediary variable. The addition and scaling could be performed in a single assignment to `gl_FragColor`.

**Example 2: Efficient Implementation (Direct Output)**

```glsl
#version 300 es
precision mediump float;
out vec4 FragColor;

in vec2 uv;
uniform sampler2D texture1;
uniform sampler2D texture2;

void main() {
    vec4 color1 = texture(texture1, uv);
    vec4 color2 = texture(texture2, uv);

    FragColor = (color1 + color2) * vec4(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0); // Direct output
}
```

This version directly computes the final color and assigns it to `FragColor`, eliminating the overhead associated with the temporary output variable.

**Example 3:  Managing Complexity with Intermediate Variables (Within Registers)**

```glsl
#version 300 es
precision mediump float;
out vec4 FragColor;

in vec2 uv;
uniform sampler2D texture1;
uniform sampler2D texture2;

void main() {
    vec4 color1 = texture(texture1, uv);
    vec4 color2 = texture(texture2, uv);
    vec4 result;

    result = color1 + color2;
    result *= vec4(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0);
    result = pow(result, vec4(2.2)); // Complex operation, but still in registers.

    FragColor = result; // Final output
}

```
This example illustrates a scenario where intermediate variables are beneficial.  Instead of writing them to output, they are contained within the shader's register space. Complex operations can be broken down into smaller steps using local variables, improving code readability without sacrificing performance.  The key here is keeping these variables within the register file, avoiding memory writes. The complexity warrants local variables for clarity, but the final output is still a single write.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The OpenGL specification, particularly sections covering the fragment shader pipeline and memory management, are crucial.  A solid understanding of GPU architecture and shader optimization techniques is essential for addressing this type of performance issue.  Books on real-time rendering and GPU programming will provide valuable insights into shader optimization strategies.  Furthermore, profiling tools for WebGL/OpenGL will assist in identifying performance bottlenecks within your specific application.  These tools are vital in accurately pinpointing the source of performance issues, guiding you toward optimized solutions.  Finally,  consulting documentation for your specific GPU hardware can shed light on its specific limitations and optimal memory usage patterns.  Understanding the capabilities and limitations of your target hardware is critical for efficient shader design.
