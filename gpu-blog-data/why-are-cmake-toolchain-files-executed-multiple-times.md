The root cause of CMake toolchain files' multiple executions often stems from the recursive nature of CMake's project processing, particularly when dealing with nested projects or subdirectories containing their own CMakeLists.txt files.  My experience working on large-scale embedded systems projects, involving numerous libraries and third-party dependencies, has consistently highlighted this behavior.  Understanding the underlying mechanism is crucial for efficiently managing build configurations and avoiding unexpected build failures.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

CMake's build system operates by traversing a directory tree, processing each `CMakeLists.txt` file encountered.  Crucially, when a `CMakeLists.txt` file includes a toolchain file using the `include()` command, that toolchain file's commands are executed within the context of the current directory.  This is essential for customizing the build process for each project or subproject.  However, if a project has subdirectories also containing `CMakeLists.txt` files,  CMake will recursively descend into these subdirectories.  Each `CMakeLists.txt` file encountered, even if it does not explicitly include the toolchain file, may inherit the toolchain configuration either through its parent directory or through a separate, potentially implicit, inclusion mechanism.  This recursive processing leads to the repeated execution of the toolchain file's commands.

Consider a scenario where a toolchain file sets environment variables or defines compiler flags. If the toolchain file is included in a top-level `CMakeLists.txt` and a subdirectory's `CMakeLists.txt`, the environment variables and compiler flags will be set twice â€“ once for the top-level project and again for the subproject.  This duplication isn't inherently flawed; it allows for distinct, per-project configurations even if a shared toolchain provides a foundation.  However, it's critical to recognize this behavior to avoid potential conflicts or unintended consequences, especially when using toolchain files that perform actions with side effects, such as modifying cached variables.

The repeated execution is not necessarily a bug; it's a fundamental consequence of CMake's design, facilitating modularity and flexible build configurations.  However, inefficient or poorly designed toolchain files can exacerbate this behavior, potentially leading to performance issues or build errors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Project with Subdirectory:**

```cmake
# Top-level CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProject)

include(mytoolchain.cmake) # Toolchain inclusion

add_executable(myexe main.cpp)

add_subdirectory(subdir)
```

```cmake
# subdir/CMakeLists.txt
add_library(sublib sub.cpp)
# Implicit inheritance of toolchain settings from parent
```

```cmake
# mytoolchain.cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -O3 -Wall")
message("Toolchain file executed")
```

In this example, `mytoolchain.cmake` will be executed twice: once by the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` and implicitly by the subdirectory's `CMakeLists.txt` which inherits the settings.  The message will be printed twice, demonstrating the repeated execution.

**Example 2: Explicit Inclusion in Subdirectory (Potential Problem):**

```cmake
# Top-level CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProject)

include(mytoolchain.cmake)

add_subdirectory(subdir)
```

```cmake
# subdir/CMakeLists.txt
include(mytoolchain.cmake) # Explicit inclusion, potential for conflict
add_library(sublib sub.cpp)
```

```cmake
# mytoolchain.cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -O3 -Wall")
message("Toolchain file executed")

#Potential problem:  Modifying a cached variable here is risky.
set(MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE "value") # Modifying a cached variable.
```

Here, `mytoolchain.cmake` is explicitly included in both the top-level and subdirectory's `CMakeLists.txt`.  This can lead to problems if the toolchain file modifies CMake cached variables; setting `MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE` twice would likely lead to a warning if not handled carefully.

**Example 3:  Conditional Inclusion to Mitigate Repeated Execution:**

```cmake
# Top-level CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProject)

include(mytoolchain.cmake)

add_subdirectory(subdir)
```

```cmake
# subdir/CMakeLists.txt
if(NOT TOOLCHAIN_INCLUDED)
  include(mytoolchain.cmake)
  set(TOOLCHAIN_INCLUDED TRUE)
endif()
add_library(sublib sub.cpp)

```

```cmake
# mytoolchain.cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -O3 -Wall")
message("Toolchain file executed")
```

This example showcases a way to mitigate the repeated execution. By using a variable `TOOLCHAIN_INCLUDED` as a flag, we ensure the toolchain file is only included once within the entire build process.  This approach is particularly helpful when dealing with complex project structures.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend reviewing the official CMake documentation thoroughly. Pay close attention to the sections on toolchains,  `include()` command semantics, and variable scoping.  Further, exploring advanced CMake techniques such as using `cmake_policy()` to manage compatibility across different CMake versions can be beneficial.  Finally, understanding the implications of cached variables and how to manage them effectively is essential for robust and reliable build systems.  These resources, coupled with careful attention to the recursive nature of CMake's build process, will allow for the effective management of toolchain files in complex projects.
