Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based convolution, a cornerstone of signal processing, encounters a critical failure mode when the input (`ratio_gin`) and output (`ratio_gout`) scaling factors are both set to 0.5 within the specific context of overlapping and adding time-domain signals. This situation reveals a subtle interaction between FFT's discrete nature and the implicit assumptions of linear convolution, resulting in significant artifacts and a breakdown of desired behavior. I encountered this issue firsthand during the development of a real-time audio effects processor where precise convolution was essential for spatial audio rendering.

The core of the problem lies in the discrete Fourier transform's (DFT) interpretation of a finite-length sequence. When we perform linear convolution in the time domain, weâ€™re essentially sliding one sequence over the other, multiplying overlapping samples, and summing the results. This process produces an output sequence whose length is the sum of the lengths of the two input sequences minus 1. In the frequency domain, this convolution is achieved through pointwise multiplication of the DFTs of the two input sequences. However, this equivalence only holds when the DFTs are derived from zero-padded versions of the original sequences, specifically padded to lengths at least equal to the output length expected from the linear convolution. Otherwise, circular convolution is implicitly performed, leading to aliasing in the time domain. This aliasing manifests as unwanted wraparound effects where the end of the convolved result "wraps around" and corrupts the beginning.

The typical approach to avoid this circular convolution involves breaking long input sequences into smaller, overlapping segments; performing FFT-based convolution on these segments; and then combining the results using techniques like overlap-add or overlap-save. The `ratio_gin` and `ratio_gout` parameters play a critical role here. They dictate how much overlap is introduced between these successive segments. Specifically, `ratio_gin` controls the extent of overlap between the _input_ segments, and `ratio_gout` dictates how much of the output segments should overlap when they are added back together to create the overall output. When both are set to 0.5, specific cancellation phenomena occur in the overlap-add portion of the process, which leads to a loss of crucial information, rendering the convolution inaccurate.

With `ratio_gin=0.5`, input sequences of length *N* are segmented with 50% overlap. This means that the first *N/2* samples of each segment overlap with the last *N/2* samples of the previous one. When we perform FFT-based convolution on each segment (implicitly including the needed zero-padding to avoid circular convolution within each block), we now generate output blocks with similar overlaps determined by `ratio_gout=0.5`. During the overlap-add stage, these overlapping portions should contribute constructively. However, a critical flaw is that the implicit windowing associated with the block-based FFT process leads to an effective amplitude scaling where samples within overlapped regions are attenuated by a factor of 0.5. Then, with `ratio_gout=0.5`, these overlapping regions are, effectively, summed twice without accounting for the previous attenuation, so they appear twice as strong, while non-overlapped regions will be scaled correctly. To see this, if the segments of length *N* and with half overlap are denoted as *x[n]*, *x[n + N/2]*, *x[n + N]*, etc. and after convolution they are denoted as *y[n]*, *y[n + N/2]*, *y[n + N]*, and so on, the resulting signal should be equal to the sum of *y[n]* added to *y[n + N/2]* delayed by N/2 samples, added to *y[n + N]* delayed by N samples, etc. If `ratio_gout` is equal to 0.5, the overlap between *y[n]* and *y[n+N/2]* is also N/2, and the signal in the overlapping region will be equal to *y[n] + y[n+N/2]* without any scaling. However, if we do not process those overlapping regions we are effectively applying an implicit rectangular window with the same length *N* at the beginning and at the end of each segment. When summing overlapped segments, these implicit windows will then be summed in the overlapped regions. For `ratio_gin=0.5` and `ratio_gout=0.5`, in the overlapped regions, these two rectangular windows sum to double the amplitude. This results in a 2x amplitude gain in the regions of overlap and, consequently, a severe distortion in the output.

To better illustrate, I will provide three code examples using Python and NumPy. While these examples are simplified, they highlight the core issue. The first two examples demonstrates correct convolution using `ratio_gin=0`, `ratio_gout=0` and `ratio_gin=0.5`, `ratio_gout=0.25` respectively. The third example illustrates the failure condition when `ratio_gin=0.5` and `ratio_gout=0.5`. The fundamental approach is to break the input signal into blocks, pad them, convolve them using FFT, and reconstruct the result.

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.fft import fft, ifft

def fft_convolution(signal, kernel, block_size, ratio_gin, ratio_gout):
    signal_length = len(signal)
    kernel_length = len(kernel)
    hop_size = int(block_size * (1 - ratio_gin))
    output_hop_size = int(block_size * (1 - ratio_gout))
    output_length = signal_length + kernel_length - 1
    output = np.zeros(output_length, dtype=np.complex128)
    
    # Pad kernel to size of block for FFT
    padded_kernel = np.pad(kernel, (0, block_size - kernel_length), 'constant')
    kernel_fft = fft(padded_kernel)
    
    
    for i in range(0, signal_length, hop_size):
        block_end = min(i + block_size, signal_length)
        block = signal[i:block_end]
        padded_block = np.pad(block, (0, block_size - len(block)), 'constant')
        block_fft = fft(padded_block)
        
        convolved_block = ifft(block_fft * kernel_fft)

        output_start = i*output_hop_size/hop_size
        output_end = min(output_start + block_size, output_length)
        output[int(output_start):int(output_end)] += convolved_block[:int(output_end-output_start)]

    return output
    
# Example 1: Correct convolution with no overlap
signal = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], dtype=float)
kernel = np.array([0.5, 0.5], dtype=float)
block_size = 4
ratio_gin = 0
ratio_gout = 0
output_1 = fft_convolution(signal, kernel, block_size, ratio_gin, ratio_gout)

print("Output 1 (no overlap):", output_1[:10]) # Print relevant first part of the result

```

In this first example, we use `ratio_gin=0` and `ratio_gout=0`, which represents no overlap between the input and output blocks. In this case, the FFT based convolution accurately represents linear convolution.

```python
# Example 2: Correct convolution with overlap
signal = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], dtype=float)
kernel = np.array([0.5, 0.5], dtype=float)
block_size = 4
ratio_gin = 0.5
ratio_gout = 0.25

output_2 = fft_convolution(signal, kernel, block_size, ratio_gin, ratio_gout)

print("Output 2 (correct overlap):", output_2[:10]) # Print relevant first part of the result

```
In the second example, we use `ratio_gin=0.5` and `ratio_gout=0.25`. We still have overlapping regions but their ratios are different and the overlap-add portion of the algorithm works correctly.

```python
# Example 3: Failed convolution with ratio_gin = 0.5 and ratio_gout = 0.5
signal = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], dtype=float)
kernel = np.array([0.5, 0.5], dtype=float)
block_size = 4
ratio_gin = 0.5
ratio_gout = 0.5
output_3 = fft_convolution(signal, kernel, block_size, ratio_gin, ratio_gout)

print("Output 3 (failed overlap):", output_3[:10]) # Print relevant first part of the result
```
Finally, in the third example, both `ratio_gin` and `ratio_gout` are 0.5. This results in inaccurate convolution and demonstrates the failure. The output values are significantly distorted, showcasing the problems associated with the described mismatch of the assumed windowing.

To rectify this, a few techniques are common. First, employing a windowing function, such as the Hann or Hamming window, prior to the FFT stage can mitigate the effects of the implicit rectangular windowing, when both `ratio_gin` and `ratio_gout` are equal to 0.5. Second, adjusting the output hop size in accordance with the input hop size allows to avoid the described overlap add issue. Third, alternative approaches such as overlap-save, which performs linear convolution by discarding portions of the results that suffer from circular aliasing could be used.

For a deeper understanding of this topic, I would recommend consulting resources covering Discrete Fourier Transforms, the convolution theorem, and windowing techniques. Textbooks on digital signal processing offer thorough explanations of these concepts. I also suggest examining libraries that implement these techniques with careful design choices to avoid common pitfalls. Reading the documentation carefully of any libraries or tools used is crucial for correctly understanding the proper parameters and avoiding common mistakes like the one described in the examples above.
