The absence of input names in a TensorFlow SavedModel is often a consequence of how the model was exported, specifically regarding the use of `tf.function` and the handling of function signatures.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous large-scale deployments has shown that neglecting explicit signature definition within the `tf.function` decorator is the most frequent culprit.  The SavedModel's meta-data, essential for reconstructing the model's input/output structure, relies on this information, and its absence leads to the observed problem.  This issue isn't inherently a bug but a result of a best-practice oversight.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow SavedModels store the model's architecture and weights efficiently for deployment and reuse.  Crucially, they rely on metadata to define the input and output tensors.  When constructing a model, particularly one using `tf.function` for performance optimization, TensorFlow leverages the function's signature to infer this metadata. If this signature isn't explicitly defined or correctly inferred, the SavedModel will lack information on input names, resulting in an incomplete representation hindering its effective loading and usage in downstream tasks.  This is distinct from the issue of missing tensors; the tensors might exist within the SavedModel, but their association with meaningful names within the input layer is absent, rendering them inaccessible through conventional methods. The problem stems from the disconnect between the computational graph TensorFlow generates during execution and the formal description required for loading and serving.

The `tf.function` decorator, while enhancing performance, can sometimes obfuscate the input/output relationships, especially when dealing with complex models or nested functions.  Without explicit signature declaration, TensorFlow's default inference might fail to capture the complete input specification, leading to the missing names.  This often happens when using keyword arguments within the `tf.function` or when dynamic tensor shapes are involved, resulting in TensorFlow's inability to statically determine the input structure.

In contrast, models built without `tf.function` or those with properly defined signatures within `tf.function` usually export with complete input and output name information. This is because the explicit signature provides a concrete blueprint for TensorFlow to follow during the saving process.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Export (Missing Input Names)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_model(x, y):
  return x + y

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=None, outputs=my_model) #Note: Missing input specification

tf.saved_model.save(model, "my_model_incorrect")
```

In this example, the `tf.keras.Model` lacks explicit input definition. The `tf.function` lacks a signature, leaving the input tensor names undefined within the SavedModel.  Attempting to load this model will likely result in difficulty accessing the input tensors using named arguments.


**Example 2: Correct Export (Explicit Signature)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function(input_signature=(
    tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 10], dtype=tf.float32, name='input_x'),
    tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 10], dtype=tf.float32, name='input_y')
))
def my_model(x, y):
  return x + y

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,), name='input_x'),
                               tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,), name='input_y')],
                       outputs=my_model)

tf.saved_model.save(model, "my_model_correct")
```

This example demonstrates the correct approach. The `tf.function` decorator includes an `input_signature` argument, explicitly defining the input tensor shapes, data types, and importantly, their names (`input_x`, `input_y`).  Furthermore, the `tf.keras.Model` uses `tf.keras.Input` to explicitly define the input layers with specified names. This precise specification ensures the SavedModel contains the necessary metadata for unambiguous input access.


**Example 3:  Using Keras Functional API (Implicit Signature Handling)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_x = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,), name='input_x')
input_y = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,), name='input_y')
output = tf.keras.layers.Add()([input_x, input_y])
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_x, input_y], outputs=output)

tf.saved_model.save(model, "my_model_keras")
```

The Keras Functional API handles input naming more naturally. Defining the input layers with explicit names (`input_x`, `input_y`) automatically propagates this information to the SavedModel, even without explicitly using `tf.function` and its input signature.  This approach offers a cleaner and more intuitive method to ensure proper input name preservation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on SavedModel, specifically the sections dealing with `tf.function`, `tf.TensorSpec`, and the Keras Functional API, should provide further clarification and guidance.  Furthermore, examining the TensorFlow source code related to SavedModel export and metadata generation can offer a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Consulting other TensorFlow tutorials and examples focusing on model exporting and deployment will prove valuable for practical application of these concepts. Finally, actively searching relevant Stack Overflow questions and answers, filtering by TensorFlow version compatibility, can help in resolving specific scenarios and workarounds.
