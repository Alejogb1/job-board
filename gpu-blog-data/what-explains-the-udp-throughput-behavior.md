The observed throughput of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) connection is fundamentally determined by the interplay of network conditions, application-level factors, and the inherent characteristics of UDP itself.  My experience troubleshooting high-performance video streaming applications revealed this isn't simply a matter of raw bandwidth; it's a complex interplay of factors affecting packet loss, latency, and the sender's ability to adapt.  Unlike TCP, UDP's lack of inherent congestion control and retransmission mechanisms necessitates a deeper understanding of these contributing elements to effectively predict and manage throughput.

**1.  Clear Explanation of UDP Throughput Behavior:**

UDP throughput, expressed as bits or bytes per second, represents the effective rate at which data is successfully transferred and received.  Unlike TCP, which employs a sliding window mechanism and acknowledges received packets, UDP transmits packets independently.  This means a packet lost in transit is not automatically retransmitted; the receiver simply doesn't receive it. Consequently, throughput in UDP is directly affected by the packet loss rate.  Even with ample bandwidth available, high packet loss significantly reduces the effective throughput.

Latency, the time delay between packet transmission and reception, also plays a crucial role.  High latency extends the time it takes for the sender to receive feedback (if any is implemented), which can lead to underutilization of available bandwidth.  Imagine a scenario where the sender's buffer fills up due to slow acknowledgement or the absence thereof; packets then face queuing delays before being transmitted. This effectively reduces throughput.

Network congestion is another major factor. In congested networks, packets experience queuing delays and increased packet loss probabilities.  UDP's lack of inherent congestion control mechanisms means it's vulnerable to these effects.  This is particularly pronounced in scenarios with numerous UDP flows competing for bandwidth, like in real-time gaming or live video streaming.

Finally, the application's sending strategy impacts throughput.  The sending rate, buffer size, and any implemented congestion avoidance mechanisms (which are application-specific for UDP) directly influence the amount of data successfully delivered.  A sender might overwhelm the network by sending too many packets too quickly, leading to increased packet loss and reduced throughput. Conversely, a conservative sender may underutilize the available bandwidth.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different scenarios impacting UDP throughput.  These are simplified representations; real-world implementations often involve more complex error handling and network monitoring.

**Example 1: Basic UDP Sender (Python):**

```python
import socket

def udp_sender(host, port, data):
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    sock.sendto(data.encode(), (host, port))
    sock.close()

# Example usage:
host = '192.168.1.100' #Replace with destination IP
port = 5005
message = "This is a test message."
udp_sender(host, port, message)

```

This basic example shows a UDP sender.  Note the absence of any error handling or flow control.  The throughput achievable with this will be limited by network conditions and the receiving end's capacity.  Packet loss would go unnoticed.


**Example 2: UDP Sender with Basic Retransmission (C++):**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
  int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
  sockaddr_in server_addr;
  server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
  server_addr.sin_port = htons(5005);
  inet_pton(AF_INET, "192.168.1.100", &server_addr.sin_addr); //Replace with destination IP

  char message[] = "Hello, UDP!";
  int n = sendto(sockfd, message, strlen(message), 0, (sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));

  //Illustrative retransmission - a real implementation requires acknowledgment mechanisms
  if (n < 0) {
      std::cerr << "Error sending data." << std::endl;
      sendto(sockfd, message, strlen(message), 0, (sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)); //Simple retransmission attempt
  }

  close(sockfd);
  return 0;
}
```

This C++ example adds a rudimentary retransmission attempt upon sending failure.  This is a highly simplified illustration; practical retransmission requires robust mechanisms to handle dropped packets effectively and avoid unnecessary retransmissions in the face of transient network issues.  The throughput improvement will depend heavily on the accuracy of the error detection.


**Example 3: UDP Sender with Packet Sequencing (Java):**

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class UDPSender {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket();
        InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("192.168.1.100"); //Replace with destination IP
        int port = 5005;

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            String message = "Packet " + i;
            byte[] buffer = message.getBytes();
            DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length, address, port);
            socket.send(packet);
        }

        socket.close();
    }
}
```

This Java example introduces packet sequencing.  While it doesn't explicitly handle retransmissions, the sequencing allows the receiver to detect missing packets, improving the debugging and monitoring process.  However, this doesn't solve the core issue of lost packets impacting throughput.  A sophisticated system would correlate sequence numbers with time stamps to infer packet loss rates and dynamically adjust the sending rate.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of network programming and UDP specifics, I suggest consulting a comprehensive networking textbook focusing on the internet protocol suite.  Furthermore, a detailed study of operating system documentation related to socket programming, including specifics on socket options and buffer management, is highly beneficial.  Finally, reviewing publications on congestion control algorithms, even if those primarily target TCP, can offer valuable insight into the broader principles applicable to data transmission optimization.  These resources provide foundational knowledge, enabling more informed analysis and design of robust, high-throughput UDP applications.
