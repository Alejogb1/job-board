The impact of IF/ELSE logic within JCL (Job Control Language) sorting, specifically concerning the SORT utility, is indirect; it doesn't directly influence the sorting algorithm itself.  The IF/ELSE constructs reside within the programs *processed* by the SORT utility, rather than within the SORT utility's control statements.  My experience working on large-scale mainframe batch processing systems over the last fifteen years has frequently involved optimizing such processes, and this nuance is crucial for understanding performance implications.  The effect is primarily felt through data transformation and selection before and after the sorting operation, influencing the volume and characteristics of the data the SORT utility handles.

**1.  Explanation of Indirect Influence:**

The SORT utility in z/OS primarily operates on sequential data sets.  JCL directs the SORT utility to read input, sort based on specified keys, and write output.  The IF/ELSE logic is usually contained within programs preceding or succeeding the SORT step.  These programs might:

* **Pre-sort filtering:**  An IF/ELSE structure in a pre-sort program can filter the input data, selecting only relevant records before they enter the sorting process. This significantly impacts the size of the dataset the SORT utility handles, directly affecting processing time and resource consumption.  Filtering out irrelevant data reduces I/O operations and overall execution time.

* **Post-sort processing:** Similarly, an IF/ELSE structure in a post-sort program can process the sorted data based on specific conditions.  This might involve conditional updates, record selection based on sorted order (e.g., selecting top N records), or aggregation operations. This doesn't alter the sorting itself but affects how the sorted data is used downstream.

* **Key generation/modification:**  The IF/ELSE construct might reside within a program that generates or modifies the sort keys. This affects how the SORT utility orders the data. A complex conditional key generation can introduce overhead, impacting the total processing time.  However, the core sorting algorithm remains unchanged; the change lies in the data it is presented with.

It's important to note that JCL itself doesn't feature IF/ELSE statements in the same way as procedural programming languages. The conditional logic lives within the programs called by the JCL, influencing the data flow into and out of the SORT step.  Inefficient pre- or post-processing, stemming from poorly structured IF/ELSE blocks, will magnify the impact on overall job performance.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples use COBOL, a common language in mainframe environments, for illustration.  Assume a file `INPUT.DAT` containing customer records with fields `CUSTOMER-ID`, `ORDER-AMOUNT`, and `ORDER-DATE`.

**Example 1: Pre-sort filtering based on order amount:**

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. PRE-SORT-FILTER.
       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
       INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.
       FILE-CONTROL.
           SELECT INPUT-FILE ASSIGN TO "INPUT.DAT".
           SELECT OUTPUT-FILE ASSIGN TO "FILTERED.DAT".
       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.
       FD  INPUT-FILE.
       01  INPUT-RECORD.
           05  CUSTOMER-ID    PIC 9(9).
           05  ORDER-AMOUNT   PIC 9(7)V99.
           05  ORDER-DATE     PIC 9(8).
       FD  OUTPUT-FILE.
       01  OUTPUT-RECORD.
           05  CUSTOMER-ID    PIC 9(9).
           05  ORDER-AMOUNT   PIC 9(7)V99.
           05  ORDER-DATE     PIC 9(8).
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01  WS-THRESHOLD PIC 9(5) VALUE 1000.
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           OPEN INPUT INPUT-FILE OUTPUT OUTPUT-FILE.
           READ INPUT-FILE AT END MOVE 1 TO EOF-SWITCH.
           PERFORM UNTIL EOF-SWITCH = 1
               IF ORDER-AMOUNT > WS-THRESHOLD THEN
                   WRITE OUTPUT-RECORD FROM INPUT-RECORD
               END-IF
               READ INPUT-FILE AT END MOVE 1 TO EOF-SWITCH
           END-PERFORM.
           CLOSE INPUT-FILE OUTPUT-FILE.
           STOP RUN.
```
This COBOL program filters records with `ORDER-AMOUNT` exceeding 1000, reducing the input to the subsequent SORT step.


**Example 2: Post-sort selection of top N records:**

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. POST-SORT-SELECTION.
       ... (File descriptions and data declarations similar to Example 1) ...
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
           01  WS-TOP-N PIC 9(3) VALUE 10.
           01  WS-COUNTER PIC 9(3) VALUE 0.
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           OPEN INPUT INPUT-FILE OUTPUT OUTPUT-FILE.
           READ INPUT-FILE AT END MOVE 1 TO EOF-SWITCH.
           PERFORM UNTIL EOF-SWITCH = 1 OR WS-COUNTER = WS-TOP-N
               WRITE OUTPUT-RECORD FROM INPUT-RECORD
               ADD 1 TO WS-COUNTER
               READ INPUT-FILE AT END MOVE 1 TO EOF-SWITCH
           END-PERFORM.
           CLOSE INPUT-FILE OUTPUT-FILE.
           STOP RUN.
```
This program, executed *after* sorting, selects only the first 10 records (assuming they are already sorted in descending order of `ORDER-AMOUNT`), thus utilizing the sorted output selectively.

**Example 3: Key modification using IF/ELSE:**

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. KEY-MODIFICATION.
       ... (File descriptions and data declarations similar to Example 1) ...
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           OPEN INPUT INPUT-FILE OUTPUT OUTPUT-FILE.
           READ INPUT-FILE AT END MOVE 1 TO EOF-SWITCH.
           PERFORM UNTIL EOF-SWITCH = 1
               IF ORDER-AMOUNT > 5000 THEN
                   MOVE "HIGH" TO OUTPUT-RECORD-KEY
               ELSE
                   MOVE "LOW" TO OUTPUT-RECORD-KEY
               END-IF
               WRITE OUTPUT-RECORD FROM INPUT-RECORD
               READ INPUT-FILE AT END MOVE 1 TO EOF-SWITCH
           END-PERFORM.
           CLOSE INPUT-FILE OUTPUT-FILE.
           STOP RUN.
```
This program modifies the sort key based on `ORDER-AMOUNT`, effectively creating two categories ("HIGH" and "LOW") for sorting. The sorting logic itself is dictated by the SORT utilityâ€™s JCL parameters, however, this program influences *which* data is sorted by creating a simpler key structure.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of JCL and SORT utility, I recommend consulting the official z/OS documentation.  Further, a strong grasp of COBOL or another suitable mainframe programming language is indispensable.  Finally, practical experience with mainframe batch processing, including performance tuning techniques, greatly enhances comprehension in this area.  These resources should equip you to approach more complex scenarios where the interplay between IF/ELSE constructs and JCL SORT becomes critical.
