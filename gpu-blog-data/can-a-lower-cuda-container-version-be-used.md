The core incompatibility lies not in the CUDA toolkit version itself, but in the driver version's relationship to both the host and the container.  My experience troubleshooting GPU deployments in large-scale data centers has shown that while a lower CUDA container *can* run on a higher host CUDA version, success hinges entirely on driver compatibility.  The container's runtime environment needs a driver that's compatible with *both* the container's CUDA toolkit and the host system's CUDA driver.  Attempting to circumvent this often leads to runtime errors, silent failures, or unpredictable behavior.

Let's clarify the different components:

1. **Host CUDA Version:** This is the CUDA toolkit version installed on the underlying operating system.  It dictates the maximum capability available to the system.

2. **Host Driver Version:** This is the NVIDIA driver installed on the OS.  It provides the interface between the CUDA toolkit and the GPU hardware.  It must be compatible with the host CUDA version.

3. **Container CUDA Version:** This is the CUDA toolkit version within the Docker (or other containerization system) environment.  This version dictates the CUDA APIs and libraries available within the container.

4. **Container Driver Version:** Although less explicitly defined, the container implicitly uses the host driver. The container *does not* install its own separate driver.  This is a critical point often overlooked.

The compatibility issue arises if the host driver's capabilities are insufficient for the host CUDA version *or* the container CUDA version.  A common scenario is a newer host CUDA version requiring a more recent driver.  The container, however, might be built with an older CUDA toolkit that expects an older, but compatible, driver. If the host driver is too new, the container will fail due to lacking required backward compatibility, even though the host driver ostensibly *supports* the older CUDA version in a native context.

This scenario is often observed when deploying legacy applications requiring older CUDA toolkits in modern environments. For example, I once encountered a situation where a container using CUDA 10.2 failed to launch on a system with CUDA 11.6, even though the host driver was a version officially claiming support for CUDA 10.2. The problem stemmed from driver changes introduced between the versions that were not backwards-compatible at the low level necessary for the application within the container.

Here are three code examples illustrating different aspects of this challenge:

**Example 1:  Successful Container Launch (Compatibility Achieved)**

```python
# Inside the Dockerfile
FROM nvidia/cuda:10.2-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu18.04

# ... other Dockerfile instructions ...

#  Assumptions:
#  - Host system has a driver compatible with both CUDA 10.2 and 11.6 (e.g., a very recent driver).
#  - CUDA 10.2 application code is compiled within the container.
```

This example showcases a scenario where the driver installed on the host machine is sufficiently new to support both the host CUDA 11.6 and the container's CUDA 10.2.  The success depends on the host driver having the necessary backward compatibility layers.


**Example 2:  Failed Container Launch (Driver Incompatibility)**

```python
# Dockerfile (attempting to use an incompatible driver)
FROM nvidia/cuda:11.2-devel-ubuntu20.04

# ... other Dockerfile instructions ...

# Assumptions:
# - Host system has a driver ONLY compatible with CUDA 11.x (older driver).
# - Application expects CUDA 11.2 within the container.
```

In this scenario, even though the container and the host both use CUDA 11.x versions, if the host's driver is too old to support the features used by the CUDA 11.2 runtime within the container, the application will fail.


**Example 3:  Environment Variable Control (Partial Mitigation)**

```bash
# Host system command to run the container
nvidia-docker run --rm -e LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib64 \
    <container_image_name>
```

This example attempts to explicitly set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to prioritize libraries from the CUDA 10.2 installation within the container, potentially helping resolve path conflicts. However, this is not a reliable fix for driver-level incompatibilities. Driver issues cannot be solved purely by manipulating environment variables.  This may resolve minor conflicts but will generally fail if the underlying driver is truly incompatible.

In conclusion,  using a lower CUDA container version with a higher host CUDA version is possible, but only under strict compatibility conditions relating to the NVIDIA driver on the host.  Prioritizing the latest driver that is still compatible with both the host and container CUDA versions is paramount.  Always carefully review the NVIDIA driver release notes and CUDA compatibility matrix to prevent runtime failures.  Comprehensive testing before deployment is crucial, and using a robust containerization strategy that minimizes driver-level interactions is strongly advised.  Consult the official NVIDIA documentation and consider using tools designed for managing CUDA deployments in a complex environment for comprehensive guidance.
