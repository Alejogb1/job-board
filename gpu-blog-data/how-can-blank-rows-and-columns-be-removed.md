Within the constraints of a Keras Sequential model, manipulating the shape of input data to remove blank rows or columns presents a challenge, as these models expect fixed-size inputs. The Sequential model itself operates on a defined sequence of layers, each performing a transformation on the data, and doesn't allow for dynamic reshaping based on input content. Direct removal of blank rows and columns within the model is not a viable approach; preprocessing of the input array *before* it enters the model is essential. My experience building a model to analyze spectral imaging data highlighted this very issue, where variations in the measurement area often resulted in extraneous zeroed rows and columns.

The key lies in understanding that reshaping and slicing operations should be conducted *prior* to feeding data into the `model.fit()` or `model.predict()` methods. Keras layers are designed for learning and transformation, not for pre-processing data anomalies of this nature. The core task involves using NumPy or similar tools to locate and discard these blank dimensions before they reach the Keras model. Therefore, I'd outline a strategy that hinges on efficient pre-processing, assuming we're working with NumPy arrays or a similar data representation that can be easily sliced and indexed.

The procedure fundamentally involves identifying the rows or columns that contain only zero or null values (or a predefined 'blank' placeholder), and then creating a new array excluding those dimensions. The `numpy.all()` and `numpy.any()` functions, combined with logical indexing, prove to be crucial in this process. Specifically, the strategy involves: 1) calculating the sum (or an alternative aggregation metric) along each row or column; 2) identifying which rows or columns have a sum of zero (or less than a predefined threshold); and 3) constructing a new array from the non-blank indices of the original array. This three step method provides a robust solution.

Now let's illustrate this with some code examples. Assume the data is represented as a 2D NumPy array.

```python
import numpy as np

def remove_blank_rows(data):
    """Removes blank rows from a 2D NumPy array.

    Args:
        data: A 2D NumPy array.

    Returns:
        A new NumPy array without blank rows.
    """
    row_sums = np.sum(np.abs(data), axis=1)
    non_blank_rows = row_sums > 0
    return data[non_blank_rows]


# Example Usage
example_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                        [0, 0, 0],
                        [4, 5, 6],
                        [0, 0, 0]])
cleaned_array = remove_blank_rows(example_array)
print("Array after removing blank rows:\n", cleaned_array)
# Output: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]
```
This function efficiently checks for rows with all zero elements and creates a new array containing only non-blank ones. The `np.abs()` is there to handle negative numbers as blank; if all are zero, then it is blank, irrespective of their sign. The `row_sums` variable calculates the sum of the absolute values in each row. The core of this function is the logical indexing, where `data[non_blank_rows]` creates a new array containing the rows where the corresponding element in `non_blank_rows` is `True`. The logical indexing is both efficient and succinct.

Next, here's the complementary function for removing blank *columns*, which follows the same logic but applies it across the other axis.

```python
def remove_blank_columns(data):
    """Removes blank columns from a 2D NumPy array.

    Args:
        data: A 2D NumPy array.

    Returns:
        A new NumPy array without blank columns.
    """
    column_sums = np.sum(np.abs(data), axis=0)
    non_blank_columns = column_sums > 0
    return data[:, non_blank_columns]


# Example Usage
example_array = np.array([[1, 0, 3, 0],
                        [4, 0, 6, 0],
                        [7, 0, 9, 0]])
cleaned_array = remove_blank_columns(example_array)
print("Array after removing blank columns:\n", cleaned_array)
# Output: [[1 3] [4 6] [7 9]]
```
This `remove_blank_columns` function operates virtually identically to the row counterpart, with the key difference being the specification of `axis=0` within the `np.sum` function. This is what changes the aggregation from rows to columns. The return statement employs logical indexing against columns, providing a cleaned array containing only non-blank columns. The example array shows how effectively this function removes columns consisting of exclusively zeros.

Finally, to combine these and showcase both steps, we can define a function that removes both blank rows *and* columns:
```python
def remove_blank_dimensions(data):
    """Removes blank rows and columns from a 2D NumPy array.

    Args:
        data: A 2D NumPy array.

    Returns:
        A new NumPy array without blank rows or columns.
    """
    cleaned_data = remove_blank_rows(data)
    cleaned_data = remove_blank_columns(cleaned_data)
    return cleaned_data

# Example usage:
example_array = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 1, 2, 3, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 4, 5, 6, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
cleaned_array = remove_blank_dimensions(example_array)
print("Array after removing blank rows and columns:\n", cleaned_array)
# Output: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]
```
The `remove_blank_dimensions` function encapsulates both of the previous functions to perform the complete clean up. It first removes the rows and then removes the columns, in that specific order. It should be noted that depending on the data, running column and row cleanup multiple times might be needed to remove all blanks. The order of cleaning (rows first, then columns) may also matter.

These functions should be called *before* passing the processed data into the Keras model. I've used these types of functions extensively when working with heterogeneous image data where blank regions could be prevalent. Failure to remove blank rows or columns could lead to unexpected results in a trained model, especially in cases where these blank regions might unintentionally contribute to pattern recognition during the training phase.

For further learning, I would highly recommend consulting resources on NumPy array manipulation techniques, specifically how to perform efficient vectorized operations. Understanding logical indexing and axis control in NumPy is central for this problem. Additionally, exploring libraries like SciPy, specifically its signal processing capabilities, might help in the broader context of data cleaning and preprocessing in scientific computing tasks, especially with datasets that have similar structures to the spectral data mentioned in the opening. While libraries dedicated specifically to "blank removal" are not likely, understanding these foundations will provide a strong base for this data preprocessing problem. I also suggest exploring practical tutorials on data preparation for deep learning; they often have specific code examples on preprocessing tasks. This knowledge, gained from experience and applied from a range of resources, forms the basis of my approach to preprocessing arrays before feeding them into Keras sequential models.
