PyTorch tensors, fundamentally, do not possess “parameters” in the trainable sense if they are not explicitly wrapped within a `nn.Parameter` object or used within a model that will track gradients. However, the question suggests creating a tensor structure that can *later* accommodate parameters, a concept frequently encountered in initializing model components or constructing more complex data flows. We can achieve this by creating tensors with zero elements or pre-allocated memory of the correct shape and data type. These initially "empty" tensors will then serve as placeholders that will eventually hold model weights or biases.

Here’s the breakdown of how to effectively create such tensors, drawing on experience from various deep learning projects:

**1. Creating Tensors with Zero Elements (Empty)**

One common approach involves creating tensors that have no actual data, often denoted as having a size of zero along one or more dimensions. PyTorch allows this through shape specification. Crucially, a tensor with zero elements will not allocate any memory for storing values. This approach is most beneficial when you need to define the structure of your tensors but don't want to store any initial values. Consider a scenario where you're building a dynamically sized recurrent neural network. You know the tensor dimensions for each step but the values will be filled in iteratively through the forward pass.

   ```python
   import torch

   # Example 1: Empty tensor of a specific shape.
   empty_tensor_1 = torch.empty(0, 3, dtype=torch.float32)
   print(f"Shape of empty_tensor_1: {empty_tensor_1.shape}")  # Output: Shape of empty_tensor_1: torch.Size([0, 3])
   print(f"Number of elements in empty_tensor_1: {empty_tensor_1.numel()}") # Output: Number of elements in empty_tensor_1: 0

   # Example 2: Empty tensor with multiple dimensions.
   empty_tensor_2 = torch.empty(2, 0, 4, dtype=torch.int64)
   print(f"Shape of empty_tensor_2: {empty_tensor_2.shape}") # Output: Shape of empty_tensor_2: torch.Size([2, 0, 4])
   print(f"Number of elements in empty_tensor_2: {empty_tensor_2.numel()}") # Output: Number of elements in empty_tensor_2: 0
   ```

   **Commentary:**
    -  `torch.empty()` is the key function used here. We specify the desired shape using a tuple.
    - The tensors created with `torch.empty()` do not hold any initial values. The data stored in this uninitialized memory is meaningless and should not be used before being populated.
    - The `numel()` method confirms that the tensors contain zero elements, despite the defined shapes. This allows for operations that may require specific tensor dimensions without allocating actual memory for values initially.

**2. Pre-allocating Memory with Uninitialized Data**

   Sometimes, you need to allocate the memory upfront without assigning specific values. PyTorch provides the `torch.empty()` function which allocates the memory for the specified shape but does not initialize the tensor. It is efficient if the plan is to overwrite this memory later (e.g. loading pretrained weights or when performing some operation on the tensor).

   ```python
   # Example 3: Pre-allocated tensor with uninitialized data.
   preallocated_tensor = torch.empty(5, 10, dtype=torch.float64)
   print(f"Shape of preallocated_tensor: {preallocated_tensor.shape}")  # Output: Shape of preallocated_tensor: torch.Size([5, 10])
   print(f"Number of elements in preallocated_tensor: {preallocated_tensor.numel()}")  # Output: Number of elements in preallocated_tensor: 50
   print(f"Example data in preallocated_tensor:\n{preallocated_tensor[0:2,0:2]}") # Output: Example data in preallocated_tensor: tensor([[5.5012e-38, 5.5011e-38], [5.5011e-38, 5.5010e-38]], dtype=torch.float64)
   ```

   **Commentary:**
    - The `preallocated_tensor` is not empty in terms of the number of elements; it has 5x10=50 elements. However, it's 'empty' in the sense that the tensor values are meaningless until assigned specific values.
    - Inspecting the content of `preallocated_tensor` reveals arbitrary numbers. This behavior is important to understand as this data isn’t suitable for computations without intentional initialization.

**3. Practical Use-Cases and Considerations**

   - **Dynamic Model Construction:** When building neural network layers with variable sizes, you can create empty tensors with dynamically calculated dimensions as placeholders. During model setup you might calculate the shape of a feature map from previous layers. The empty tensor is created based on this dynamically obtained shape and used in the next forward pass.
   - **Lazy Initialization:** Sometimes, we postpone initializing a tensor with actual data until absolutely necessary. This tactic can be useful when only a portion of model parameters or layers are used during training, so initialization is done on demand.
   - **Pre-allocation for Performance:** Pre-allocating memory using `torch.empty()` can improve performance in some scenarios by avoiding repeated memory allocation during iterative computations. This can improve efficiency in complex data processing or simulation loops.
    - **Gradient Tracking:** Remember that the tensors created this way are just containers. For them to become part of the parameter-tracking system within PyTorch (for learning), you typically have to either explicitly wrap them using `nn.Parameter` or include them in a model defined using `nn.Module`.

**Resource Recommendations**

*   **The Official PyTorch Documentation:** The most authoritative source for understanding all tensor-related functionalities. Specifically focus on the documentation for `torch.empty`, `torch.Tensor`, and `nn.Parameter`.
*   **Deep Learning with PyTorch Textbooks:** Several textbooks cover PyTorch in detail, with explanations on tensor creation, manipulation, and usage within neural networks. Examples of these would be books focusing on practical applications of PyTorch.
*   **Practical Tutorials and Courses:** Many online tutorials and courses (such as fast.ai or those available on Coursera and Udacity) offer a practical approach to understanding tensor operations within the context of deep learning projects. Look for modules that cover foundational concepts in PyTorch.

**Summary**

  Creating PyTorch tensors without initial parameters involves understanding the different approaches to allocating or not allocating memory. We can use `torch.empty()` to either create containers with a zero size and no allocated values, or to pre-allocate memory with uninitialized values, depending on our immediate requirements. These methods form crucial building blocks in a broader deep learning workflow and provide considerable flexibility during model creation, especially when dealing with dynamic or large-scale networks. Crucially, these “empty” tensors must be correctly incorporated within the parameter-tracking mechanism of the PyTorch framework when the goal is to make them trainable.
