The core issue when evaluating a custom Gym environment hinges on the fidelity between its state space, action space, and reward function and the actual task the agent should solve. I've frequently encountered situations where a seemingly well-defined environment fails to produce an optimal policy because of subtle discrepancies between the abstract representation and the concrete problem.

A custom Gym environment attempts to translate a complex real-world challenge into a simplified, discrete space suitable for reinforcement learning. The effectiveness of this translation determines whether the learned policy generalizes correctly to the intended behavior. Therefore, a critical evaluation must focus on these three areas.

First, the state space needs to capture all the information necessary for the agent to make an informed decision. If any relevant aspect is omitted from the observed state, the agent's policy will inevitably be sub-optimal. Conversely, an overly complex state space can hinder learning by introducing unnecessary noise or increasing the dimensionality of the problem. My experience suggests that starting with a minimal state space and progressively adding information based on performance analysis is a pragmatic approach. This reduces the risk of state-space related issues.

Second, the action space must correspond to the actual actions the agent can perform within the real world. The number of actions, their nature (discrete vs. continuous), and their granularity all influence the training process. Using a coarse discretization of the action space can limit the agent’s ability to reach the optimum. For instance, I recall a control problem that used a limited number of predefined angles for a robotic arm’s motion. The policy learned successfully avoided obstacles but failed to achieve precise movements. Later, we switched to a continuous action space and obtained far better results. Overly complex action spaces, on the other hand, are more challenging to explore.

Finally, the reward function must accurately reflect the desired behavior and guide the learning process. A poorly designed reward function can lead the agent towards unintended goals. In one instance, a simplistic reward system for a navigation task rewarded an agent for moving towards a target without penalizing it for collisions with obstacles. Consequently, the learned behavior was not to navigate safely to the target, but rather to simply reach the target quickly, which resulted in constant collisions. Designing a good reward function requires both understanding the problem and the potential consequences of that reward function.

The alignment of the state space, action space, and reward function must be carefully reviewed to verify they represent the essence of the target problem.

Here are three practical examples to illuminate potential problems and solutions:

**Example 1: Overly Simplified State Space**

Let's consider a simulated warehouse inventory management environment. Assume the goal is to maximize profit by strategically purchasing and selling goods. An initial approach might use a state space consisting solely of:

```python
import gym
import numpy as np

class SimpleInventoryEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleInventoryEnv, self).__init__()
        self.inventory_level = 50  # Initial inventory
        self.max_inventory = 100
        self.action_space = gym.spaces.Discrete(3)  # 0: buy, 1: hold, 2: sell
        self.observation_space = gym.spaces.Box(low=0, high=self.max_inventory, shape=(1,), dtype=np.int32)

    def reset(self, seed=None, options=None):
        super().reset(seed=seed)
        self.inventory_level = 50
        return np.array([self.inventory_level], dtype=np.int32), {}

    def step(self, action):
        if action == 0 and self.inventory_level < self.max_inventory:
            self.inventory_level = min(self.max_inventory, self.inventory_level + 20) #Buy
        elif action == 2 and self.inventory_level > 0 :
            self.inventory_level = max(0, self.inventory_level - 20)  #Sell

        reward = 1 if action == 2 else 0

        terminated = self.inventory_level == 0 #Simple termination, no relevant business logic
        truncated = False #simple
        return np.array([self.inventory_level], dtype=np.int32), reward, terminated, truncated, {}
```

In this simplistic environment, the state only represents the current inventory. It disregards crucial aspects, such as demand for goods, current market price, and holding costs. Consequently, the policy will be limited. The agent cannot optimize purchasing or selling strategies because it doesn't have the required contextual information. The environment is, in effect, underspecified. This would result in a sub-optimal policy. This can be improved by introducing demand and price information into the state representation.

**Example 2: Inappropriate Action Space**

Consider a robotic arm tasked with moving a block to a target location. A naive action space could be:

```python
import gym
import numpy as np

class BlockPlacementEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        super(BlockPlacementEnv, self).__init__()
        self.target_location = np.array([5, 5], dtype=np.int32)
        self.block_location = np.array([0,0], dtype=np.int32) #Start location
        self.max_position = 10
        self.action_space = gym.spaces.Discrete(4) # 0: up, 1: down, 2: left, 3: right
        self.observation_space = gym.spaces.Box(low=0, high=self.max_position, shape=(2,), dtype=np.int32)

    def reset(self, seed=None, options=None):
        super().reset(seed=seed)
        self.block_location = np.array([0,0], dtype=np.int32)
        return self.block_location, {}

    def step(self, action):
        if action == 0 and self.block_location[1] < self.max_position:
            self.block_location[1] += 1 #up
        elif action == 1 and self.block_location[1] > 0:
            self.block_location[1] -= 1 #down
        elif action == 2 and self.block_location[0] > 0:
            self.block_location[0] -= 1 #left
        elif action == 3 and self.block_location[0] < self.max_position:
            self.block_location[0] += 1 #right

        reward = 1 if np.array_equal(self.block_location, self.target_location) else 0 #simple reward

        terminated = np.array_equal(self.block_location, self.target_location) #Termination
        truncated = False #simple

        return self.block_location, reward, terminated, truncated, {}
```
Here, the action space consists of moving the arm in one of four cardinal directions by a fixed unit. This discrete action space makes it hard to explore precisely the target location. The arm may require numerous steps to move even in the correct direction. A more effective approach would be to have the action space represent continuous forces or velocities applied to the arm, allowing for finer control. The discrete action space limits the optimal policy space, while a continuous action space, even with limitations, more adequately captures the potential behavior in a physical environment.

**Example 3: Misaligned Reward Function**

Finally, consider a simulated trading environment where the aim is to maximize profit over a certain period. A poorly conceived reward function could be:

```python
import gym
import numpy as np

class SimpleTradingEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleTradingEnv, self).__init__()
        self.starting_capital = 1000
        self.current_capital = self.starting_capital
        self.price = 100 #Initial price
        self.action_space = gym.spaces.Discrete(3)  # 0: Buy, 1: Hold, 2: Sell
        self.observation_space = gym.spaces.Box(low=0, high=np.inf, shape=(1,), dtype=np.float32)

    def reset(self, seed=None, options=None):
        super().reset(seed=seed)
        self.current_capital = self.starting_capital
        self.price = 100
        return np.array([self.price], dtype=np.float32), {}


    def step(self, action):
        previous_price = self.price
        self.price += np.random.normal(0,1) #Simple price evolution
        if action == 0 and self.current_capital > self.price: #Buy if money and not bankrupt
          self.current_capital -= self.price
        elif action == 2 and self.current_capital > 0 : #Sell if money
          self.current_capital += self.price

        reward = self.current_capital - self.starting_capital #Simple reward function

        terminated = False
        truncated = False
        return np.array([self.price], dtype=np.float32), reward, terminated, truncated, {}

```

The reward function here only focuses on the total capital at the end of a step, incentivizing the agent to just execute a single trading action. This reward function does not effectively encourage strategies, such as buying low and selling high, or considering transaction costs. This might cause the agent to trade unnecessarily, leading to less profitability. A better reward function would consider the profit made during each transaction, the risk taken, and the time spent in the market. Also consider other measures, such as the Sharpe ratio. The reward should reflect not just the capital gained, but the strategies employed to reach that capital. This single metric would guide the training process inefficiently.

To verify whether a custom environment accurately reflects the desired goal, one should perform systematic testing. It is beneficial to observe the agent's behavior after training and identify weaknesses in performance, which can then be traced back to either the state space, action space, or reward function. A systematic approach, coupled with thorough analysis, provides the confidence necessary in the environment.

For further information, consult resources covering reinforcement learning environment design, focusing on state representation, action space design, and reward shaping. Consider delving into books or courses that cover applied reinforcement learning, which include case studies that discuss these issues. A careful review of examples of RL environment creation would benefit someone in their understanding. Specifically, documentation on the Gym environment library’s API itself is beneficial.
