The absence of gradient calculations when labels are provided often stems from a mismatch between the expected input format of the loss function and the actual output of the model.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on large-scale image classification projects, specifically when transitioning between different deep learning frameworks or when implementing custom loss functions.  The core problem lies in the automatic differentiation process, which relies on the ability to trace the computational graph and compute gradients based on the defined dependencies.  If the labels are not correctly integrated into this graph, no gradients will flow back through the network.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The forward pass of a neural network involves propagating input data through layers to produce predictions.  The backward pass, or backpropagation, calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters. These gradients are then used to update the parameters during training using an optimization algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.  When labels are provided, the loss function quantifies the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the ground truth.  The critical element here is the *differentiability* of this loss function and its connection to the model’s output.

A common cause of this issue is a failure to incorporate the labels correctly into the loss function calculation.  Many loss functions, such as cross-entropy for classification or mean squared error for regression, explicitly require labels as input to calculate the loss.  If the labels are not properly passed to the loss function, or if the loss function is not correctly defined to utilize them, the automatic differentiation mechanism cannot establish the necessary dependencies, resulting in a zero gradient.  This frequently manifests as a constant loss value or an inability to update model weights during training.

Another potential problem arises from using incorrect data types.  Inconsistent data types between model outputs, labels, and the loss function's input requirements can lead to unexpected behavior.  For example, providing integer labels to a loss function expecting floating-point numbers might cause the automatic differentiation engine to fail or produce incorrect gradients.  Similarly, using a loss function incompatible with the model’s output (e.g., a binary cross-entropy loss with a multi-class output) will lead to an inability to calculate gradients.

Finally, it’s essential to check for numerical instability.  Extremely large or small values in the loss calculation, often caused by incorrect scaling or data preprocessing, can sometimes lead to numerical issues that prevent gradient calculation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Label Handling in PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Model
model = nn.Linear(10, 2)

# Loss function (incorrect handling of labels)
def incorrect_loss(output, labels):
  return torch.mean(output) # Ignores labels

# Data and Labels
inputs = torch.randn(64, 10)
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (64,))

# Optimizer
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  outputs = model(inputs)
  loss = incorrect_loss(outputs, labels) #Labels are ignored!
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
  print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This example demonstrates a situation where the loss function ignores the labels, leading to no gradient calculation related to the true targets. The `incorrect_loss` function only averages the model’s output, making it independent of the ground truth `labels`.


**Example 2: Data Type Mismatch in TensorFlow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')])

# Data and Labels (incorrect data type for labels)
inputs = tf.random.normal((64, 10), dtype=tf.float32)
labels = tf.constant([0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1] * 6, dtype=tf.int32) #Incorrect type

# Loss function
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

# Optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(10):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(labels, outputs) # Possible type error here
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

Here, the potential problem is the data type mismatch between the labels (integers) and the expected input of the categorical cross-entropy loss, which typically expects one-hot encoded vectors or probabilities (floating-point numbers). This might lead to a failure in gradient calculation or unexpected results.  Converting `labels` to one-hot encoding using `tf.one_hot` would rectify this.


**Example 3:  Numerical Instability due to Scaling Issues**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Model (simple for demonstration)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])

# Data with extreme values
X = np.array([[1e10], [1e-10]])
y = np.array([[1e10], [-1e10]])

# Loss function
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training loop
for i in range(10):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(X)
    loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
  grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
  print(f"Iteration {i+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

This example uses data with extremely large and small values.  The significant difference in magnitude between `X` and `y` can introduce numerical instability, potentially hindering the gradient calculation or leading to very slow convergence.  Proper data scaling using techniques like standardization or normalization is crucial here.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation and backpropagation, I recommend consulting standard deep learning textbooks covering these topics.  Furthermore, the official documentation for the chosen deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow) provides invaluable insights into loss functions, optimizers, and debugging techniques.  Finally, exploring research papers on numerical stability in deep learning is beneficial for understanding how to mitigate issues related to gradient calculation in challenging scenarios.  These resources will enable you to thoroughly debug issues concerning gradient calculation.
