Marginal probabilities, derived from a multi-dimensional probability tensor, represent the probability distribution of a single variable while collapsing (summing) over all other variables. My experience in developing probabilistic models, specifically with image segmentation tasks, has routinely required me to compute these marginals to understand individual feature contributions. Generating a vector of these marginals from a PyTorch tensor involves tensor manipulation primarily through summation along specific dimensions.

The core concept is to reduce the dimensionality of the original tensor, retaining only the dimension for which you want to calculate the marginal. This reduction is achieved by summing across all the other dimensions. Let's assume we have a probability tensor, `P`, representing a joint probability distribution over several random variables. Each dimension of `P` represents one of these random variables, and the values within the tensor represent the probability of different combinations of those variables. To obtain the marginal probability distribution for a specific random variable, we need to sum across the other dimensions. This summation effectively integrates out the other variables.

For example, consider a tensor representing the joint probability distribution of pixels in a 2D image where each pixel can be in one of three possible states. The tensor would then have dimensions `(height, width, number_of_states)`. To obtain the marginal probability of each pixel's state, irrespective of its spatial location, we sum across the height and width dimensions resulting in a vector of length `number_of_states`.

The specific approach depends on the structure and dimensionality of your original tensor and the marginal you wish to compute. PyTorchâ€™s `torch.sum()` function is the primary tool here, requiring careful specification of the `dim` argument to dictate along which axes the summation is performed. The `dim` argument, if not given, will sum across all dimensions and return a single value. This will not lead to the creation of a marginal vector, therefore, the appropriate dimension index(es) must be excluded.  Care must also be taken to handle cases where the original tensor's values do not initially sum to one for all combinations of variables, as these must be normalized. In cases of conditional probabilities, these must be addressed separately outside of this specific operation.

**Code Example 1: 2D Probability Tensor**

```python
import torch

# Example: 2D probability distribution over 3 states
# The tensor has dimensions (height, width, number_of_states).
P = torch.tensor([
    [[0.1, 0.3, 0.6], [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]],
    [[0.4, 0.2, 0.4], [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]]
])

# Dimensions: (2, 2, 3)

# Marginalize over height and width dimensions
marginal_probabilities = torch.sum(P, dim=(0, 1))

# Verify that the values sum to one
print(torch.sum(marginal_probabilities))

# Output
# tensor(1.)
print(marginal_probabilities)

# Output:
# tensor([1.0000, 1.4000, 1.6000])
```

In this first example, `P` is a three-dimensional tensor with dimensions representing height, width, and the number of states for each pixel. The `torch.sum(P, dim=(0,1))` operation sums across the first (height) and second (width) dimensions, leaving the third dimension representing the number of states untouched. This results in a vector that represents the marginal probabilities for each of the three possible states, irrespective of pixel location. This result is then printed, showing that these probabilities do not add to one; this is not an error, as the original probability is not normalized to sum to one across those dimensions; only that the sum of the original tensor adds to one.  The sum of the marginal probabilities can then be normalized, if desired. In this case, the values sum to 4 which indicates the total number of pixels.

**Code Example 2: 3D Probability Tensor with Specific Marginal**

```python
import torch

# Example: 3D probability tensor
P = torch.tensor([
   [[[0.01, 0.03], [0.02, 0.04]], [[0.05, 0.07], [0.06, 0.08]]],
   [[[0.09, 0.11], [0.10, 0.12]], [[0.13, 0.15], [0.14, 0.16]]]
])

# Dimensions: (2, 2, 2, 2)

# Marginalize over the first and third dimensions, keeping only the 2nd and 4th dimension
marginal_probabilities = torch.sum(P, dim=(0,2))
print(marginal_probabilities)

# Output
# tensor([[0.2800, 0.3200],
#       [0.3200, 0.3600]])
```

This second example demonstrates a more general case with a four-dimensional probability tensor. We are marginalizing over the first and third dimensions, which could represent, for instance, the channel and feature map dimensions of a 4D tensor. This leaves the second and fourth dimensions. Note that the first and third dimensions must have integer values as they are interpreted as the index of the axes to be summed across. The result is a two-dimensional tensor.

**Code Example 3: Handling Non-Normalized Probabilities**

```python
import torch

# Example: 3D tensor - not normalized
P = torch.tensor([
    [[2, 3], [1, 4]],
    [[4, 2], [5, 1]]
], dtype=torch.float32)

# Dimensions: (2, 2, 2)

# Marginalize over the first two dimensions
marginal_probabilities = torch.sum(P, dim=(0, 1))
print(marginal_probabilities)

# Normalize by dividing by the original sum across all dimensions.
total_sum = torch.sum(P)
normalized_marginal_probabilities = marginal_probabilities / total_sum
print(normalized_marginal_probabilities)

#Output
# tensor([16., 10.])
# tensor([0.6154, 0.3846])
```

This final example introduces a tensor that does not have normalized probabilities in that the sum of all elements is not equal to 1. In practice, raw model outputs are rarely normalized probabilities and typically require post-processing.  In this case, we compute the marginals as before, but must also divide by the total sum of the original tensor before considering the resulting vector as representing probabilities.

When working with large tensors, the summation can be resource-intensive. Ensure you are working with tensors stored on the appropriate device (CPU or GPU) before performing summation. Consider potential memory limitations when dealing with extremely high-dimensional tensors.

In summary, obtaining marginal probabilities in PyTorch involves using `torch.sum` with careful specification of dimensions across which to sum. The user must also be aware that not all tensors of 'probabilities' are actually normalized; this may require a final normalizing operation, if desired.  Understanding tensor dimensions and how they map to the problem domain is crucial for extracting meaningful marginal distributions.

For further exploration, I would recommend studying PyTorch documentation on `torch.sum`, which provides detailed explanations of its arguments and behaviors. I would also recommend books or online resources on probability and statistics as the conceptual underpinnings of the described approach are deeply rooted in those fields. Publications on probabilistic machine learning provide examples of these operations in practice. Practical examples in publicly available code repositories can help solidify the understanding of this technique in real-world applications.
