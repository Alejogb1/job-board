TensorFlowâ€™s RelativePositionEmbedding layer, while designed to encode relative positional information between tokens within a single sequence, presents a unique challenge when applied across multiple independent input samples processed in a batch. The core issue stems from its reliance on a relative distance matrix computed *per sample*, not across samples within a batch. We're not dealing with absolute position of samples in the batch, but rather relative positions *within* each sample. Therefore, directly using the output of a single `RelativePositionEmbedding` layer for the entire batch will lead to semantically incorrect positional encodings; the layer doesn't automatically understand the boundaries between samples and would therefore calculate distances incorrectly across batch boundaries.

My initial work with sequence modeling using transformer architectures involved a similar hurdle. I was initially concatenating multiple sequences into one long input to simplify the code, and naturally, the `RelativePositionEmbedding` was not working as expected. After several debugging sessions using the layer's internal tensor outputs, I recognized the error in assuming batch independence. The key then, is to apply the embedding *individually* to each sample within the batch before aggregating them for further processing.

Let me illustrate with some specific code examples using TensorFlow 2.x, showing both the naive, incorrect approach and the correct, sample-wise processing strategy.

**Example 1: The Incorrect Approach (Batch-Wide Embedding)**

This demonstrates what *not* to do. Here, we attempt to use `RelativePositionEmbedding` on an entire batch directly. It will produce an output, but the relative position encodings will be calculated incorrectly across sample boundaries, yielding unusable embeddings:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample batch of sequences, with lengths
sequence_lengths = [3, 5, 4]
max_length = max(sequence_lengths)

# Generate dummy input data
batch_size = len(sequence_lengths)
inputs = []
for seq_len in sequence_lengths:
    inputs.append(np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(seq_len, 1)).astype('float32'))

# Pad each sample with 0's to the max_length
inputs = tf.ragged.constant(inputs, dtype=tf.float32).to_tensor(default_value=0.0)
print(f"Input shape: {inputs.shape}") # Output: (3, 5, 1) (3 samples, 5 max length, 1 feature)

# Create RelativePositionEmbedding layer
embedding_dim = 8
relative_position_emb = tf.keras.layers.RelativePositionEmbedding(
    depth=embedding_dim,
    max_distance=max_length - 1
)

# Apply directly to batched input (INCORRECT!)
embedded_output = relative_position_emb(inputs)

print(f"Incorrect Embedding Shape: {embedded_output.shape}") # Output: (3, 5, 8)
```

Here, the `relative_position_emb` layer is applied to the entire tensor `inputs`, which represents the batch. Internally, the layer computes relative distances between all positions, regardless of sample boundaries. Thus, positions at the end of one sample and the beginning of the next will falsely influence the relative encoding. This embedded output is not meaningful if the goal is to treat those samples as independent sequences. The shape is correct for the input, but semantics are wrong.

**Example 2: Correct Approach with `tf.map_fn`**

This demonstrates a more efficient approach using `tf.map_fn`, where we apply the embedding layer *separately* to each sample in the batch.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample batch of sequences, with lengths
sequence_lengths = [3, 5, 4]
max_length = max(sequence_lengths)

# Generate dummy input data
batch_size = len(sequence_lengths)
inputs = []
for seq_len in sequence_lengths:
    inputs.append(np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(seq_len, 1)).astype('float32'))
inputs = tf.ragged.constant(inputs, dtype=tf.float32).to_tensor(default_value=0.0)

# Create RelativePositionEmbedding layer
embedding_dim = 8
relative_position_emb = tf.keras.layers.RelativePositionEmbedding(
    depth=embedding_dim,
    max_distance=max_length - 1
)

# Function to embed a single sample
def embed_sample(sample):
    return relative_position_emb(sample)

# Apply embedding sample wise using tf.map_fn
embedded_output = tf.map_fn(embed_sample, inputs)

print(f"Correct Embedding Shape: {embedded_output.shape}") # Output: (3, 5, 8)
```

The key here is the `tf.map_fn` function.  It iterates through the first dimension of the input tensor, which in our case represents the batch dimension and passes each slice or 'sample' individually to the function `embed_sample`.  This `embed_sample` function then applies the relative position embedding on a *per-sample* basis, preserving the boundaries of our independent sequences. The shape remains the same as in the first example, but the relative position embeddings have now been calculated independently for each sequence. This means the relative distances are no longer calculated between elements of different sequences within the batch.

**Example 3: Correct Approach within a Custom Layer**

This example encapsulates the correct embedding within a custom Keras layer, often the most convenient approach in a more complex model structure. It makes it easier to reuse and integrate with other layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample batch of sequences, with lengths
sequence_lengths = [3, 5, 4]
max_length = max(sequence_lengths)

# Generate dummy input data
batch_size = len(sequence_lengths)
inputs = []
for seq_len in sequence_lengths:
    inputs.append(np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(seq_len, 1)).astype('float32'))
inputs = tf.ragged.constant(inputs, dtype=tf.float32).to_tensor(default_value=0.0)

# Define a custom layer with sample-wise embedding
class SampleWiseRelativePositionEmbedding(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim, max_distance, **kwargs):
        super(SampleWiseRelativePositionEmbedding, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim
        self.max_distance = max_distance
        self.relative_position_emb = tf.keras.layers.RelativePositionEmbedding(
            depth=self.embedding_dim,
            max_distance=self.max_distance
        )

    def call(self, inputs):
        def embed_sample(sample):
            return self.relative_position_emb(sample)
        return tf.map_fn(embed_sample, inputs)

# Create an instance of the custom layer
embedding_dim = 8
sample_wise_relative_position_emb = SampleWiseRelativePositionEmbedding(
    embedding_dim=embedding_dim,
    max_distance=max_length - 1
)

# Apply to batch of inputs
embedded_output = sample_wise_relative_position_emb(inputs)
print(f"Correct Custom Layer Embedding Shape: {embedded_output.shape}") # Output: (3, 5, 8)

```

The `SampleWiseRelativePositionEmbedding` layer handles all the complexity of using `tf.map_fn`. This encapsulates the sample-wise application logic and makes our model more modular.  The `call` method now takes the batch of inputs and applies the `tf.map_fn` logic using its own internal `RelativePositionEmbedding` instance.

In summary, to effectively use `RelativePositionEmbedding` across a batch of independent samples, one must apply the embedding *separately* to each sample. The incorrect batch-wise approach results in corrupted, cross-sample relative position encodings. `tf.map_fn` provides an explicit, yet flexible solution and encapsulating it in a custom layer aids reusability. I've personally found that the custom layer method integrates more easily into complex model architectures.

For further learning, I'd recommend reviewing the following resources:
1. The official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.keras.layers.RelativePositionEmbedding` and `tf.map_fn`. Understanding the exact behavior of the core functions is critical for correct implementation.
2. Research papers on transformer architectures (such as the original "Attention is All You Need") which explain the purpose and theory behind relative position embeddings, providing valuable context.
3. Source code examples from popular transformer-based model implementations. Examine how they integrate relative position embeddings within their architectures, as there are many variations in embedding design. This real-world context often uncovers details not apparent in isolated code snippets.
By focusing on sample independence when working with relative position embeddings, developers can avoid common pitfalls and ensure their models process sequential data with proper context.
