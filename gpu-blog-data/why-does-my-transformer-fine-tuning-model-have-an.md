The error "forward() got an unexpected keyword argument 'labels'" during Transformer fine-tuning stems from a mismatch between the expected input arguments of your model's `forward()` method and the arguments you're providing during the training loop.  This usually arises from inconsistencies between the model architecture and the training framework's expectations, often involving how loss calculation and backpropagation are handled.  I've encountered this numerous times while working on large-scale sentiment analysis projects involving BERT and RoBERTa, and the solution invariably involves examining the model's `forward()` definition and the training script's data pipeline.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `forward()` method in a PyTorch model defines the forward pass, detailing how input data is processed to produce predictions.  When fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer, you generally expect the `forward()` method to accept input tokens, attention masks (for variable-length sequences), and potentially token type IDs.  It *should not* directly accept `labels` as an input argument.  Instead, the `labels` are used *after* the `forward()` pass to compute the loss. The error suggests your custom training loop or a modification to the pre-trained model's `forward()` method is directly passing `labels` as an argument to the `forward()` function itself, which is incorrect.  The labels are used to calculate the loss function, a separate step following the prediction generation within the `forward()` method. This calculation should occur outside the model’s `forward()` method and typically involves utilizing a loss function like CrossEntropyLoss in PyTorch.

The issue might be present in one of three places:

* **Incorrectly Modified `forward()` method:** You might have directly added a `labels` parameter to the `forward()` method during customization, either intentionally or unintentionally.
* **Incompatible Training Loop:** Your training loop may be passing the `labels` argument to the model's `forward()` call instead of using them to compute the loss separately.
* **Incorrect Model Loading:** The model might not be loaded correctly leading to a modified `forward()` method unintentionally.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect `forward()` Method**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, pretrained_model):
        super().__init__()
        self.transformer = pretrained_model
    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask, labels): # Incorrect: labels should NOT be here
        outputs = self.transformer(input_ids, attention_mask)
        logits = outputs.logits
        loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(logits, labels) # Incorrectly computed loss here
        return loss # Incorrectly returning the loss from the forward method

# ... later in training loop ...
model = MyTransformer(pretrained_model)
loss = model(input_ids, attention_mask, labels)  # Incorrect: labels passed directly to forward()
```

This example demonstrates the incorrect placement of the `labels` argument. The `labels` should not be part of the `forward()` method.  Instead the loss should be computed using a loss function like `CrossEntropyLoss` after the `forward()` method executes.


**Example 2: Correct `forward()` Method and Training Loop**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

class MyTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, pretrained_model):
        super().__init__()
        self.transformer = pretrained_model

    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs = self.transformer(input_ids, attention_mask)
        return outputs.logits

# ... later in training loop ...
model = MyTransformer(AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased"))
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

# ... in training iteration ...
optimizer.zero_grad()
logits = model(input_ids, attention_mask)
loss = criterion(logits, labels)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

Here, the `forward()` method only takes the necessary inputs (`input_ids` and `attention_mask`). The loss calculation happens separately using the `criterion` (CrossEntropyLoss) after the `forward` pass.


**Example 3: Handling potential issues with pretrained model loading**


```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

try:
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
except RuntimeError as e:
    if "Unexpected keyword argument" in str(e):
        print("Error loading pretrained model. Check model architecture and configuration.")
        # Handle the error appropriately, potentially by loading a different model or adjusting parameters
        #  or raising a custom exception providing details about the failure
    else:
        raise e # re-raise the original exception if it's not related to keyword arguments

# ... proceed with training loop as in Example 2
```

This example shows how to handle potential errors during loading of pretrained models.  It checks for the specific "Unexpected keyword argument" error and provides a mechanism to handle it gracefully.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation.  The documentation for the specific Transformer library you are using (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers).  A good introductory text on deep learning and neural networks.  Consider exploring advanced topics like model customization and fine-tuning best practices in relevant research papers.

By carefully examining the `forward()` method and the training loop, ensuring that the labels are processed correctly outside the `forward()` method and that the model loading process is successful, you can effectively resolve the "forward() got an unexpected keyword argument 'labels'" error.  Remember to always verify your model’s input expectations and align your data handling accordingly.
