A TensorFlow generator, specifically one created using `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator`, might appear to be executing before you anticipate because TensorFlow eagerly executes the underlying Python generator when it creates the `Dataset` object, rather than deferring its execution until the dataset is iterated upon. This behavior stems from the framework's design to optimize data pipelining by preprocessing or prefetching data ahead of model training, which necessitates an initial evaluation of the generator’s output to determine the output shapes and types. I have frequently observed this during the transition from simple data loaders to more robust `tf.data.Dataset` pipelines for large image datasets.

The core issue is that `tf.data.Dataset` requires knowledge of the output structure of the generator to build its internal representation. When using `from_generator`, TensorFlow does not simply hold onto a reference to the generator function. Instead, it calls the generator once, using it to infer the structure of the data it will yield (shape, type). This initial execution helps TensorFlow create efficient iterators capable of parallelizing data processing and feeding it seamlessly to the model. It is not the act of training but dataset creation that triggers the initial call of the generator. The generator should ideally yield data in a format consistent with what is defined within the `output_signature` argument. The lack of or inconsistency in data structure within the output signature causes issues during the initial call of the generator or during data fetching within a pipeline. This leads to issues like data type or shape mismatches. This initial execution might surprise users who expect lazy evaluation similar to Python generators on their own.

Let's consider some scenarios. First, a very simple generator that yields a sequence of integers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def integer_generator():
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Generating integer: {i}")
        yield i

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
    integer_generator,
    output_types=tf.int32
)

print("Dataset created, but not iterated yet.")

for element in dataset:
    print(f"Received element: {element}")
```

In this case, the print statements inside `integer_generator` will execute immediately after `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` is called, not when the loop over the dataset is reached. I've noticed this is frequently a source of confusion when first working with TensorFlow data pipelines. The output reveals that generator executions prints are printed before "Dataset created" and before any value is received from the iterator. This demonstrates the eager behavior during dataset creation. The generator is called during dataset creation. The `output_types` argument is necessary, informing TensorFlow about the expected data type. If omitted, the program might fail because TensorFlow will attempt to infer it from the first generated value. This automatic type inference, while convenient in simple cases, can be problematic when dealing with more complex or nested data structures.

Now, let’s examine a situation where we yield more complex data: NumPy arrays representing image data with associated labels. This is common when creating image classification pipelines.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def image_label_generator():
  for i in range(2):
    image = np.random.rand(64, 64, 3).astype(np.float32)
    label = np.random.randint(0, 10)
    print(f"Generating image-label pair: {i}")
    yield image, label

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
    image_label_generator,
    output_types=(tf.float32, tf.int32),
    output_shapes=((64, 64, 3), ())
)

print("Dataset with image and labels created.")

for image, label in dataset:
    print(f"Received image with shape: {image.shape}, and label: {label}")
```

Similar to the previous example, the generator's print statements will execute before the “Dataset with image…” message appears. However, in this case, the `output_shapes` argument is also provided to the dataset constructor, indicating the shape of the generated arrays. This is essential for building a correct dataset structure, particularly when performing operations like batching or shuffling. Without it, TensorFlow would still try to run the generator to infer the shape but, during pipeline execution, it would raise an error related to unknown or ambiguous shapes. Also, without the `output_types` argument, TensorFlow will attempt to infer this from a single iteration. If not done correctly the datatypes can also cause issues later in the pipeline. Failing to specify the correct output shape or type will result in an error during the initial generator execution, or later during the pipeline execution, preventing the creation of a workable dataset.

Finally, consider a case where the generator itself utilizes a pre-existing dataset or resource, for example, reading data from disk.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os

def file_reading_generator(file_list):
    for filepath in file_list:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
             print(f"Processing file: {filepath}")
             data = file.read().strip()
             yield np.array([float(x) for x in data.split(',')], dtype=np.float32)

# Create dummy files for demonstration
os.makedirs("data_files", exist_ok=True)
with open("data_files/data1.txt", "w") as f: f.write("1.0,2.0,3.0")
with open("data_files/data2.txt", "w") as f: f.write("4.0,5.0,6.0")

file_paths = ["data_files/data1.txt", "data_files/data2.txt"]

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
    lambda: file_reading_generator(file_paths),
    output_types=tf.float32,
    output_shapes=(3,)
)

print("Dataset created with files")

for data in dataset:
  print(f"Received data: {data}")
```
In this scenario, `file_reading_generator` itself is not directly executed at the `from_generator` call, but rather, a wrapper lambda function is created. Still, the generator will be executed *once* to infer the shape and type. Thus, the file processing print statements will execute before the "Dataset created with files" message. The key takeaway is that the underlying data reading and pre-processing within your generator function execute before the iterator within the pipeline, due to the eager shape and type inference by TensorFlow. This behavior highlights the necessity of carefully considering all operations within the generator since even file or database access will occur when the dataset is constructed. Because generators are executed immediately, this means data access can be an issue if the number of files grows large or if files are read from remote locations.

For further reading and development, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data.Dataset`. The API guide provides detailed explanations about data pipelines and optimization techniques. Furthermore, the TensorFlow tutorials, especially those related to data loading, offer a range of practical examples covering varied data types and processing methods. Also, the TensorBoard profiler provides detailed information on pipeline performance which is very useful during the development of an efficient pipeline. I always advise exploring open-source projects on GitHub that use the `tf.data` framework, because they can provide concrete implementations and best practices. The code of many of these open source projects also serve as examples for designing complex data pipelines. These sources should provide a solid foundation for understanding the behavior and intricacies of TensorFlow generators and how to best integrate them with data pipelines.
