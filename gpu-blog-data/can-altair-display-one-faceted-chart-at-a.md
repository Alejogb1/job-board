Faceted charts in Altair, while powerful for multivariate data exploration, typically display all facets simultaneously. Achieving single-facet display with toggling necessitates programmatic interaction beyond Altair’s declarative charting grammar. My experience in building interactive dashboards for a meteorological data visualization project demanded this functionality, leading me to implement a solution using Vega-Lite specifications and a bit of JavaScript glue.

The core challenge arises from Altair’s static chart generation. It produces a complete Vega-Lite JSON specification which then gets rendered by a client-side JavaScript library. To achieve toggling, we need to modify this specification dynamically and trigger a re-render. The usual approach of conditional encoding within Altair doesn’t quite cut it as it only filters data *within* the visualization, not completely hiding the facet itself. We need to manipulate the Vega-Lite specification directly.

My strategy involves creating a base chart in Altair, extracting its Vega-Lite specification as a Python dictionary, and then building a JavaScript function that dynamically alters this dictionary to adjust the facet being displayed. Crucially, this function interacts with a HTML element (like a dropdown or a set of buttons) to select the facet. This approach uses the underlying structure of Vega-Lite to our advantage, not the Altair library’s higher level API, to achieve the single-facet view.

The initial step involves creating an Altair chart with the desired facets:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C'],
        'value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35],
        'time': [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

base_chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_line().encode(
    x='time:O',
    y='value:Q',
    facet='category:N'
)

chart_spec = base_chart.to_dict()
print(chart_spec)

```

This Python code first defines a sample DataFrame and then constructs a line chart faceted by the ‘category’ column. The `.to_dict()` method extracts the Vega-Lite specification as a Python dictionary.  Crucially, this is the raw specification we need to modify. Note that no interactive logic has been applied by the base Altair specification. It's simply a static representation of the multi-faceted chart.  Printing this dictionary would reveal the deeply nested JSON structure we need to manipulate.

Next, I'll illustrate the JavaScript portion, responsible for toggling the facets.  This code assumes the Vega-Lite specification is accessible in a JavaScript variable named `chartSpec`. It also presupposes that an element exists on the page (such as a dropdown list) with an id of "facet-selector" which allows the user to choose the desired facet. The `vegaEmbed` function is used to handle the visualization, which requires the Vega and Vega-Lite JavaScript libraries to be included in the HTML page.

```javascript
function toggleFacet(facetName) {
    let newSpec = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(chartSpec)); // Deep copy the specification

    if(facetName !== "all"){
      // Assuming the data is named in 'datasets.data_0'
      newSpec.datasets.data_0 = chartSpec.datasets.data_0.filter(d => d.category === facetName);

      // If the facet encoding exists we should modify that, otherwise we create a conditional one
      if(newSpec.facet){
         newSpec.facet = null;
         newSpec.encoding.column= null; // remove column facet to prevent rendering error
      } else {
          newSpec.encoding.facet = {"field": "category", "type": "nominal"}
      }
     } else {
       newSpec = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(chartSpec)); // use the original with all facets
       // Ensure all facets are present by restoring the original encoding if it was nullified in the previous check.
       if (newSpec.encoding.facet) {
            newSpec.encoding.facet = null;
       }
       if (newSpec.facet){
            newSpec.encoding.column = {"field": "category", "type": "nominal"};
       }

      }
   
    vegaEmbed('#vis', newSpec);
}


document.getElementById('facet-selector').addEventListener('change', function(event) {
    toggleFacet(event.target.value);
});

```

This JavaScript code snippet creates a function `toggleFacet` that receives the selected facet name. The function makes a deep copy of the original Vega-Lite spec to avoid modifying the global reference.  It filters the underlying dataset in the chart specification based on the selected facet, modifying the specification to show only data pertaining to that facet. It also nullifies the existing facet encoding (or creates a conditional facet when needed) and, subsequently, re-embeds the chart with the updated specification using `vegaEmbed`. The `all` value in the dropdown list will reset the visualization to the original multi-faceted view. The change listener is attached to the select element to respond to user inputs. This JavaScript code is designed to manipulate the data based on the selection, providing the functionality to display facets individually. The key element is the direct manipulation of the data and the facet specifications inside the chart specification.

For a complete picture, the HTML structure that hosts the visualization and the interaction components would be as follows:

This HTML file sets up the necessary libraries, includes the facet selector dropdown, the `vis` container to host the chart and the JavaScript code. The `chartSpec` variable is directly embedded here but should be generated and transmitted from the server in a real-world scenario.  The `toggleFacet` function is the same as in the previous JavaScript code example.  The select element with id "facet-selector" handles the interactive toggling of the chart. This complete example shows a basic implementation of the functionality and demonstrates the need for both a static Altair chart generation and interactive JavaScript logic to achieve the desired single-facet view and toggling.

For additional learning, I highly recommend exploring the official documentation for Vega and Vega-Lite as these will provide an understanding of the underlying specifications of the charts.  Furthermore, examining the source code for the Altair library itself can illuminate the mapping between the Altair API and the underlying Vega-Lite specifications. This practical understanding is essential when you require more advanced control over visualization behavior. Lastly, I would suggest a comprehensive study of JavaScript’s DOM manipulation capabilities, which is crucial for integrating interactive elements with your visualizations.
