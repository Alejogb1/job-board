In TensorFlow/Keras, generating a consecutive index set, specifically when needing to access elements of a tensor based on such a sequence, frequently involves manipulating the tensor's shape and then utilizing appropriate indexing techniques. This isn't a built-in function that directly creates an index tensor; rather, it requires constructing the index tensor using TensorFlow's numeric tensor creation functions and combining them with operations such as `tf.range`, `tf.reshape`, and `tf.stack` before applying them in the desired context. This arises, for example, when you're implementing sequence processing, working with embeddings, or managing mini-batch iterations where specific sub-sections of a tensor must be accessed using sequential indexing.

Let's consider a scenario: I was working on a model to process time-series data extracted from sensor feeds. Each input tensor was a series of events, and for certain layers I needed to process chunks of the time series with a moving window. Generating an index tensor corresponding to that window was a core requirement. Therefore, I needed to construct tensors that represented a sequence of consecutive indices rather than relying on an existing index tensor. I'll detail three approaches Iâ€™ve used and found effective.

**Approach 1: `tf.range` and `tf.reshape` for Simple Consecutive Indices**

The most straightforward scenario is creating a simple, one-dimensional sequence of consecutive integers. This is easily achieved with `tf.range`. To then use these indices to access an arbitrary dimension within a tensor, reshaping becomes essential.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_simple_index(start, stop, step, target_shape):
    """
    Creates a sequence of indices and reshapes to match the target.

    Args:
        start: The starting number of the sequence.
        stop: The end number of the sequence (exclusive).
        step: The difference between numbers in the sequence.
        target_shape: The shape of the resulting index tensor.

    Returns:
      A reshaped index tensor.
    """
    indices = tf.range(start, stop, step, dtype=tf.int32)
    reshaped_indices = tf.reshape(indices, target_shape)
    return reshaped_indices

# Example usage
start_index = 0
end_index = 10
step_size = 1
target_shape = (2,5)
index_tensor = create_simple_index(start_index, end_index, step_size, target_shape)
print("Simple Index Tensor:\n", index_tensor)


test_tensor = tf.constant([[10, 20, 30, 40, 50], [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]])
indexed_elements = tf.gather_nd(test_tensor, tf.expand_dims(index_tensor,axis=-1)) #use gather_nd with reshaped indices

print("\nElements from test_tensor using the index_tensor:\n", indexed_elements)
```

In this example, `tf.range` generates the sequence. The resulting tensor is then reshaped using `tf.reshape` to match the desired dimensions, providing a compact way of generating an index tensor. The critical part of the application here is the `tf.gather_nd` function, combined with expansion of the dimension, to select the elements of the `test_tensor` at specific indices. If you intend to slice your tensor directly, it's important to consider the dimensional aspect and potentially use `tf.gather`. For example, if your desired indices match a tensor's first dimension, simply using the reshaped tensor with standard Python indexing will produce a result. The `target_shape` is crucial for adapting the resulting index tensor to the context of the tensor to be indexed.

**Approach 2: Using `tf.range` and `tf.stack` for Multi-Dimensional Indices**

Sometimes indices need to refer to multiple dimensions of the tensor. In such situations, `tf.stack` combined with multiple calls to `tf.range` provides a suitable method. This approach constructs index tensors that effectively point to locations within a multi-dimensional tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_multi_dim_index(rows, cols):
    """
    Creates a multi-dimensional index tensor using tf.stack.

    Args:
        rows: Sequence defining the row indices.
        cols: Sequence defining the column indices.
    Returns:
      A stacked index tensor.
    """
    row_indices = tf.range(rows[0],rows[1],rows[2], dtype=tf.int32)
    col_indices = tf.range(cols[0],cols[1],cols[2], dtype=tf.int32)
    
    index_tensor = tf.stack(tf.meshgrid(row_indices,col_indices), axis=-1)  # Use meshgrid to cover all pairings
    return index_tensor


# Example usage
rows_spec = [0,2,1] # start, end, step
cols_spec = [0,3,1] # start, end, step
index_tensor = create_multi_dim_index(rows_spec,cols_spec)
print("Multi-Dimensional Index Tensor:\n", index_tensor)

test_tensor_mult = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                              [5, 6, 7, 8],
                              [9, 10, 11, 12]])
indexed_elements_mult = tf.gather_nd(test_tensor_mult, index_tensor)
print("\nElements from test_tensor_mult using the index_tensor:\n", indexed_elements_mult)
```
Here, we generate indices using the spec `[start,stop,step]`. Using `tf.meshgrid` we create a cartesian product of the row and column indices. `tf.stack` is used to combine the index components to make pairs like `[row_index, col_index]`. Subsequently, this resulting tensor can be directly used with `tf.gather_nd` to extract values from the multi-dimensional tensor. This is useful where you need non-contiguous selections based on index pairs.

**Approach 3: Combining `tf.range` and `tf.concat` for Complex Index Sequences**

In some scenarios, you might need a non-uniform sequence of indices where some parts are contiguous but others jump.  This requires a combination of `tf.range` to make contiguous parts, and `tf.concat` to combine them.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_combined_index(ranges):
    """
    Creates a combined index by concatenating multiple ranges.

    Args:
        ranges: A list of lists. Each inner list specifies start, stop and step for a range
    Returns:
      A concatenated index tensor
    """
    index_parts = []
    for r in ranges:
        index_parts.append(tf.range(r[0], r[1], r[2], dtype=tf.int32))
    index_tensor = tf.concat(index_parts, axis=0)
    return index_tensor


# Example usage
ranges = [[0,3,1], [5,8,1]] # two different ranges [start, end, step]
index_tensor = create_combined_index(ranges)
print("Combined Index Tensor:\n", index_tensor)

test_tensor_comb = tf.constant([100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900])
indexed_elements_comb = tf.gather(test_tensor_comb, index_tensor)
print("\nElements from test_tensor_comb using the index_tensor:\n", indexed_elements_comb)

```

In this approach, `tf.range` is repeatedly applied to create sections of the overall index. The `ranges` argument makes this approach flexible, supporting multiple, independent sequences of indices which are then concatenated using `tf.concat` along the dimension zero to form a single composite index. As illustrated in the code, this index can be used with standard `tf.gather` (instead of `tf.gather_nd`) when indexing a 1-dimensional tensor.

These three methods demonstrate how to create custom, consecutive, index tensors in TensorFlow/Keras. In each instance, the resulting index tensors are used to select data from example tensors, showing the indexing operation.

For further learning on tensor manipulations, I recommend referring to TensorFlow's official documentation, specifically sections focusing on tensor creation, reshaping, slicing, and indexing.  Textbooks that cover computational graphs and deep learning will also delve deeper into the specifics of working with tensors. Also, the TensorFlow tutorial repository contains examples of efficient tensor manipulation in the context of common tasks. Examining how experts use these functions in real-world projects can also provide helpful intuition.
