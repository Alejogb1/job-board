The core issue lies in the distinction between compile-time constants and constant expressions in C++.  While a member variable declared `const` guarantees its immutability after object construction, the compiler lacks the contextual information necessary to reliably replace *all* accesses to it with its value at compile time.  This limitation stems from the potential for the constant member's value to be determined dynamically, either through initialization dependent on other runtime factors or via constructors that perform calculations. My experience working on a large-scale physics simulation engine highlighted this precisely: attempts to prematurely optimize constant member access resulted in subtle, hard-to-debug errors.

**1. Explanation:  The Limitations of Compile-Time Evaluation**

The C++ standard dictates that `const` variables maintain their immutability, preventing modification after initialization. However, this immutability does not automatically translate to compile-time evaluation.  The compiler's ability to perform such optimization hinges on a number of factors:

* **Initialization Context:**  A `const` member's value might be determined within a constructor, potentially depending on parameters passed to the constructor or the results of function calls.  If these calls involve I/O operations, or interactions with external libraries, the value is intrinsically runtime-dependent.  The compiler cannot reasonably perform substitution without risking unpredictable behavior.

* **Complex Expressions:** Even if the `const` member's initializer is seemingly straightforward, it could involve complex calculations whose result cannot be readily determined at compile time.  Consider nested function calls, recursive calculations, or template metaprogramming constructs.  Such situations necessitate runtime evaluation.

* **Object Lifetime:**  The compiler must also consider the object's lifetime. Replacing all accesses with a constant value would be incorrect if multiple objects of the same class exist, each potentially initialized with a different constant value.  Maintaining distinct values for each object necessitates runtime evaluation and storage.

* **Address-Taking:** If the address of the `const` member is taken, replacing its accesses with its value becomes problematic.  The address is meaningful and needed; substituting it with the value would alter the program's behavior and likely lead to errors.  This points to the compiler's priority: correctness over premature optimization.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate these points with examples:

**Example 1: Runtime-Dependent Initialization:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
  const int value;

  MyClass(int input) : value(input * 2) {} // Value determined at runtime
  
  void printValue() const {
    std::cout << value << std::endl;
  }
};

int main() {
  int userInput;
  std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
  std::cin >> userInput;
  MyClass obj(userInput);
  obj.printValue();
  return 0;
}
```

Here, `value` is `const`, but its value depends on user input.  The compiler cannot substitute `value` with a constant before runtime, as its value is not known until the program executes.

**Example 2: Complex Initialization:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

class MyClass {
public:
  const double value;

  MyClass() : value(std::sin(3.14159265359)) {} // Initialization involves a function call
  
  void printValue() const {
    std::cout << value << std::endl;
  }
};

int main() {
  MyClass obj;
  obj.printValue();
  return 0;
}
```

Even though `std::sin()` might seem a simple function, the compiler must still execute this function at runtime to obtain the value for `value`.  Premature substitution is prevented to ensure correctness.

**Example 3: Address-Taking:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
  const int value = 10;

  void printAddress() const {
    std::cout << &value << std::endl;
  }
};

int main() {
  MyClass obj;
  obj.printAddress();
  return 0;
}
```

In this scenario, we explicitly take the address of `value`.  Replacing accesses to `value` with its constant value would invalidate the address obtained by `&value`.  The compiler understands this constraint and correctly avoids the substitution.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of these subtleties, I recommend consulting the C++ standard itself, paying particular attention to the sections on constant expressions and object lifetime. A good C++ textbook covering low-level details of compilation and optimization will also be beneficial.  Furthermore, researching compiler optimization techniques, focusing on constant propagation and its limitations, will provide valuable insight.  Studying the assembly output generated by a compiler for similar code examples will reveal the practical application of these rules.  Understanding the compiler's role in enforcing constraints outlined in the C++ standard is crucial.
