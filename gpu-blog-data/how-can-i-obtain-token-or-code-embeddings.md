The Codex API doesn't directly offer a dedicated endpoint for retrieving "token embeddings" in the traditional sense of vector representations capturing semantic meaning of individual tokens.  My experience working with large language models (LLMs) like Codex, and specifically its predecessors in the GPT family, indicates that embeddings are typically generated indirectly, leveraging the model's internal representations.  This approach requires careful crafting of prompts and understanding of the underlying architecture.  We can, however, obtain contextual embeddings, reflecting the meaning of tokens within a given context. This is achieved through strategically designed prompts which extract information from the model's internal state.

**1. Explanation:**

Codex, being a transformer-based model, processes input text sequentially, generating internal representations (hidden states) for each token. These hidden states contain rich contextual information.  While not explicitly exposed as "embeddings" through a dedicated API call, we can cleverly engineer prompts to extract relevant information reflecting these internal representations.  The technique involves prompting the model to perform a task which implicitly reveals information about the internal representations of specific tokens. One approach is to request the model to predict the next token given a partial sequence, effectively allowing us to inspect the model's attention weights and probabilistically infer embedding-like vectors based on the context of neighbouring tokens.  Another technique involves comparing the model's response to subtly altered input sequences, identifying the differential impact of altering a given token. This difference can be used to infer a kind of contextual embedding.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate approaches to infer contextual embeddings, assuming familiarity with the Codex API's prompt-based interaction.  Note that these methods are indirect and not a replacement for dedicated embedding APIs found in specialized libraries.


**Example 1: Next-token prediction and attention weight analysis (Hypothetical)**

This method attempts to infer information about a token's embedding by observing the model's prediction of the next token within a sequence.  The approach focuses on the attention weights of the token of interest, assuming hypothetical access to this internal model data, which is not publicly available.

```python
# Hypothetical access to Codex's internal attention weights. This is NOT a real API call.
def get_attention_weights(prompt, token_index):
    """Simulates accessing attention weights for a given token within a prompt."""
    # In a real scenario, this would involve a complex internal API or a reverse-engineered model.
    # This is a placeholder for illustrative purposes.  Assume it returns a NumPy array.
    # This example does not reflect the internal workings of Codex, only mimics the output.
    import numpy as np
    return np.random.rand(10, 10) # Placeholder - Replace with actual attention weights


prompt = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy"
token_index = 3 # Index of 'brown'

attention_weights = get_attention_weights(prompt, token_index)

# Analyze attention weights to infer contextual information about "brown".
#  High attention weights from other tokens indicate strong contextual relationships.
#  This analysis is highly dependent on the model's architecture and may require advanced techniques.
#  This section needs significantly more sophisticated analysis to be meaningful.
print(f"Attention weights for 'brown':\n{attention_weights}")
```

**Commentary:** This code simulates accessing attention weights.  In reality, such access is not directly provided by the Codex API. This example highlights the conceptual approach. The actual analysis of attention weights would require advanced techniques beyond the scope of this response.


**Example 2:  Differential response analysis (Hypothetical)**

This method compares the model's response to slightly modified inputs, aiming to isolate the effect of changing a specific token.


```python
# Hypothetical Codex API call. This is NOT a real API call.
def codex_call(prompt):
    """Simulates a call to the Codex API; returns a hypothetical response."""
    # In reality, this would involve sending a prompt to the Codex API.
    # This is a simplified example for illustrative purposes.
    if "dog" in prompt: return "A canine."
    elif "cat" in prompt: return "A feline."
    else: return "An animal."


prompt1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
prompt2 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy cat."

response1 = codex_call(prompt1)
response2 = codex_call(prompt2)


# Compare responses to gauge the effect of changing "dog" to "cat".
# The difference could reflect a contextual embedding-like aspect.
print(f"Response to prompt1: {response1}")
print(f"Response to prompt2: {response2}")

# A more sophisticated approach would involve vectorizing the responses and computing distance metrics.
```

**Commentary:**  This example uses a simplified hypothetical API response.  A real implementation would require vectorizing the responses (e.g., using sentence embeddings from a separate model) and applying distance metrics to quantify the impact of the token change.  The difference between the responses can only indirectly be interpreted as reflecting a kind of contextual impact.

**Example 3:  Prompt Engineering for Implicit Contextual Information**

This approach focuses on structuring the prompt to elicit information reflecting the model's understanding of a token's context.

```python
prompt = "Describe the relationship between 'brown' and other words in the sentence: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'."

#Hypothetical Codex API call. This is NOT a real API call.
def codex_call(prompt):
    """Simulates a call to the Codex API; returns a hypothetical response."""
    return "Brown describes the color of the fox, contrasting with the color of the dog which may be assumed to be another color."

response = codex_call(prompt)
print(response)
```

**Commentary:** This method leverages the model's language generation capabilities to indirectly infer contextual information.  Analyzing the generated text reveals aspects of the model's internal representation of "brown" within the sentence's context.  This approach is less quantifiable than the previous ones but can offer qualitative insights.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I recommend exploring literature on transformer architecture, attention mechanisms, and techniques for analyzing hidden states in large language models.  Consult publications on embedding methods and their applications in natural language processing.  Books on deep learning and NLP will provide comprehensive background.  Understanding the inner workings of transformer networks is crucial for deciphering the indirect methods discussed here.  Familiarizing yourself with advanced techniques in NLP, such as attention visualization and interpretation, will be beneficial for further analysis.
