TensorFlow's GPU utilization hinges on effective device placement and configuration.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects highlighted a critical oversight often made: assuming TensorFlow automatically leverages all available GPUs optimally.  This is rarely the case; explicit control is necessary for efficient parallel processing.  The core issue revolves around specifying which GPU operations should run on, and how TensorFlow distributes the computational load across multiple devices.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's device placement mechanism allows for granular control over where computations occur.  This is achieved primarily through the use of device specifications within the TensorFlow graph.  A standard TensorFlow graph is constructed with operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, convolution) and tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) flowing between them. By default, TensorFlow attempts to place operations on available devices, prioritizing GPUs over CPUs. However, this default behavior often results in suboptimal performance, especially in complex models with numerous operations and varying computational demands.

Manual device placement involves explicitly assigning specific operations to particular GPUs.  This allows for tailoring resource allocation to the computational needs of individual layers or components within the model.  For instance, a computationally intensive convolutional layer might benefit from being placed on a high-performance GPU, while a less demanding fully connected layer could be assigned to a less powerful GPU or even a CPU, freeing up resources on the more powerful device.  This strategic allocation is crucial for maximizing throughput and minimizing training times.

Further optimizing GPU usage requires understanding TensorFlow's memory management.  Large models might exceed the memory capacity of a single GPU.  Efficient data transfer between GPUs becomes critical in such scenarios.  TensorFlow provides mechanisms for data transfer and synchronization, but these need careful consideration to avoid bottlenecks.  Poorly managed data transfers can negate the performance gains from utilizing multiple GPUs.  Techniques such as asynchronous data transfers and efficient memory allocation strategies are necessary for scalable training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Assigning Operations to Specific GPUs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume two GPUs available
gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True) # Avoid OutOfMemory
        with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
            #Operations to run on GPU 0
            a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], shape=[2, 2])
            b = tf.constant([5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0], shape=[2, 2])
            c = tf.matmul(a, b)
            print("Result on GPU 0:", c)

        tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(gpus[1], 'GPU')
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[1], True) # Avoid OutOfMemory
        with tf.device('/GPU:1'):
            # Operations to run on GPU 1
            d = tf.constant([9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0], shape=[2, 2])
            e = tf.constant([13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0], shape=[2, 2])
            f = tf.matmul(d, e)
            print("Result on GPU 1:", f)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)
```

This example demonstrates explicitly placing matrix multiplication operations on two distinct GPUs (GPU:0 and GPU:1). The `tf.device` context manager is crucial; operations within its scope are executed on the specified device.  The `set_visible_devices` function ensures that only the selected GPUs are used, crucial for avoiding accidental usage of other GPUs which could negatively impact performance or lead to errors.  `set_memory_growth` is vital for managing GPU memory dynamically and avoiding `OutOfMemory` errors.  Error handling is implemented to catch potential runtime issues.


**Example 2:  Utilizing MirroredStrategy for Data Parallelism**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

```

This example showcases data parallelism using `MirroredStrategy`.  This strategy replicates the model across available GPUs, distributing the training data among them.  Each GPU processes a subset of the data, and the gradients are aggregated to update the model's weights. This is particularly effective for large datasets where the processing time dominates. The `strategy.scope()` ensures all model variables and operations are created and replicated appropriately across devices.  This simplifies distributed training significantly compared to manual device placement for complex models.


**Example 3:  Using CPU for Preprocessing and GPU for Training**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Preprocessing on CPU
with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
    x_train = np.random.rand(60000, 784)
    y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 60000)

# Training on GPU
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates placing computationally inexpensive preprocessing steps on the CPU while performing the computationally intensive training on the GPU.  This approach minimizes data transfer overhead between CPU and GPU, as the preprocessed data is directly fed to the model residing on the GPU.  This is beneficial because data transfer can often be a significant bottleneck in training.  Strategic placement of operations in this manner is a key aspect of optimizing performance.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow's device placement mechanisms, consult the official TensorFlow documentation.  Further explore the various distribution strategies available within TensorFlow, paying particular attention to their performance implications and suitability for different hardware configurations.  Study examples of complex models using multiple GPUs to observe best practices for efficient memory management and data transfer.  Finally, familiarize yourself with profiling tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks within your TensorFlow applications.  Thorough understanding of these topics is crucial for proficient GPU utilization.
