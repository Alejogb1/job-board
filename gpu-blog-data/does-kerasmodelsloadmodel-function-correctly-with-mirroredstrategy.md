The `keras.models.load_model` function's interaction with `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` is not straightforward and hinges critically on how the model was initially saved.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects, particularly those involving distributed training across multiple GPUs, has highlighted the subtle nuances inherent in this process.  The core issue lies in the serialization of the model's internal state, including the distribution strategy itself, which isn't directly preserved during the `save_model` operation. Therefore, simply loading a model saved during a distributed training process using `load_model` within a different strategy (or even the same strategy on a different hardware configuration) often results in unexpected behavior or errors.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` replicates model variables across available devices, allowing for parallel computation.  When saving a model trained under this strategy, Keras primarily saves the model's architecture and the *weights* of these replicated variables.  It does *not* inherently save the distribution strategy itself. This omission is significant.  Upon loading, `keras.models.load_model` reconstructs the model's architecture from the saved configuration, but it instantiates this architecture within the *current* execution environment's strategy – which may differ from the training environment's strategy.

The consequences of this mismatch are varied.  If you load a model saved with `MirroredStrategy` into a non-distributed setting (using a single GPU or CPU), the model will function, but it will use only a single device, potentially hindering performance and memory efficiency. Conversely, loading a model saved without a strategy into an environment employing `MirroredStrategy` can result in errors, particularly if the model attempts to access replicated variables that don't exist.  Finally, loading a model saved with `MirroredStrategy` onto a system with a different number of GPUs can lead to inconsistencies in variable placement and potential crashes.

To ensure consistent and correct loading, one must handle the distribution strategy explicitly, both during saving and loading.  This typically involves saving the model's weights independently, alongside a separate configuration file detailing the architecture, and then reconstituting the model with the appropriate strategy during loading.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Handling – Direct Load with Mismatched Strategies:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Training with MirroredStrategy (assume 2 GPUs available)
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
  model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10)])
  model.compile(...)
  model.fit(...)
  model.save("model_incorrect.h5")

# Attempting to load without MirroredStrategy
model_loaded = keras.models.load_model("model_incorrect.h5") # Potential issues here
# ...further use...

```

This example demonstrates the potential problems. The model is trained using `MirroredStrategy` and saved directly. If the loading phase omits the strategy, the model may behave unpredictably, leading to runtime errors or silent performance degradation depending on the hardware in use.


**Example 2: Correct Handling – Manual Weight Saving and Loading:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Training with MirroredStrategy
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
  model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10)])
  model.compile(...)
  model.fit(...)
  weights = model.get_weights()
  model_config = model.get_config()
  np.save("model_weights.npy", weights)
  import json
  with open('model_config.json', 'w') as f:
      json.dump(model_config, f)


# Loading with MirroredStrategy (or even without - strategy is not directly used in reconstruction)
strategy_load = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy() # Could also be None
with strategy_load.scope(): # Or removed entirely
  reconstructed_model = keras.models.model_from_config(model_config)
  reconstructed_model.set_weights(np.load("model_weights.npy", allow_pickle=True))
  # ...further use...

```

This example showcases the preferred method.  The model's weights and configuration are saved separately, allowing flexible reloading irrespective of the loading environment's distribution strategy.  The `model_from_config` function reconstructs the architecture, and `set_weights` restores the trained parameters.  This approach ensures consistent behavior across different hardware and software setups.


**Example 3:  Handling Checkpointing with MirroredStrategy:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import os

# Training with MirroredStrategy and Checkpointing
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
checkpoint_dir = './training_checkpoints'
checkpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, "ckpt_{epoch}")

with strategy.scope():
  model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10)])
  model.compile(...)
  checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model, optimizer=model.optimizer)
  checkpoint.restore(tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir)) #Restore a previous checkpoint if exists
  model.fit(..., callbacks=[tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(filepath=checkpoint_prefix, save_weights_only=True)])


# Loading from checkpoint
with strategy.scope(): # Must use the same strategy during loading, but the checkpoint mechanism handles the distributed aspect.
  model_loaded = keras.models.load_model(tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir))
  #...further use...
```

This example uses TensorFlow's built-in checkpointing mechanism, designed specifically for distributed training. This offers a more streamlined approach to saving and restoring the model's state, especially for scenarios with frequent checkpoints during a lengthy training process. The key is maintaining consistency in the distribution strategy across both the saving and loading phases.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on distributed training and saving/loading models.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning with a focus on TensorFlow's distributed functionalities.  Articles and blog posts from reputable machine learning researchers focusing on scalable model training and deployment using TensorFlow.  Furthermore, examining the source code of Keras' model saving and loading functions provides invaluable insight into the underlying mechanisms.
