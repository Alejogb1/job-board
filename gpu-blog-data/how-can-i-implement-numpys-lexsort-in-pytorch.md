NumPy's `lexsort`, crucial for multi-key sorting, provides indirect sorting based on a sequence of keys. Replicating its functionality in PyTorch, which is fundamentally designed for tensor operations amenable to gradient computation, requires careful consideration of indexing and permutation mechanisms. PyTorch does not offer a direct equivalent, thus requiring a manual implementation.

I've encountered situations, particularly within computational physics simulations, where precisely ordering data based on multiple criteria becomes paramount.  For instance, when simulating particle trajectories, I frequently needed to sort particles first by their position along the x-axis, then by y-axis position, and finally by their momentum magnitude.  This isn’t a straightforward single-key sort; it requires evaluating a prioritized order among sort keys.  While PyTorch’s `sort` method can handle single keys, it doesn’t inherently support the cascading multi-key approach of NumPy’s `lexsort`. My solution centers on iteratively constructing permutation indices based on each sort key, moving from the least significant to the most significant key.

The fundamental concept rests on employing `torch.argsort` repeatedly. `torch.argsort` produces an index tensor that, when applied to the original tensor, sorts the tensor in ascending order. The key lies in how these indices are composed. We begin by sorting based on the least significant key, obtaining initial indices. Subsequent sort operations use the prior index tensor to order the current sort key before applying `torch.argsort`. This effectively sorts based on the most recent sort key, whilst preserving existing order within equivalent values based on previous keys. This process of cascading sorts is directly analogous to `lexsort`’s behavior.

Implementing this effectively demands a function that accepts a sequence of key tensors, with the last key provided being the most significant (the sort happens in reverse order). The function first obtains the shape of the input tensors and initializes an identity index tensor. It then iterates backward through the key tensors.  In each iteration, it gathers the current key tensor using the existing index, performing `torch.argsort` to update the index tensor. This iterative update, driven by `torch.gather`, allows for correct accumulation of the multi-key sort indices. Finally the calculated index can be used to retrieve the desired sorted arrays.

Here is my first code example showcasing the function:

```python
import torch

def lexsort_torch(keys):
    """
    Mimics NumPy's lexsort for PyTorch tensors.

    Args:
        keys (list of torch.Tensor): A list of tensors, with the last
            tensor being the primary sort key.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: A tensor of indices to sort based on the given keys.
    """
    rows = keys[0].shape[0]
    indices = torch.arange(rows)

    for key in reversed(keys):
        indices = key.gather(0, indices).argsort()
    return indices


# Example Usage:
key1 = torch.tensor([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6], dtype=torch.int32)
key2 = torch.tensor([2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 8], dtype=torch.int32)
key3 = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], dtype=torch.int32)

keys = [key3, key2, key1] # key1 is the least significant
sorted_indices = lexsort_torch(keys)
print("Indices:", sorted_indices)

sorted_values = key1[sorted_indices]
print("Sorted key1:", sorted_values)
sorted_values = key2[sorted_indices]
print("Sorted key2:", sorted_values)
sorted_values = key3[sorted_indices]
print("Sorted key3:", sorted_values)
```

In this first example, we establish the core logic. The `lexsort_torch` function accepts a list of key tensors, where the last key in the list is considered the most important for sorting, mirroring the convention in NumPy's `lexsort`. I instantiate three example keys and call the function to obtain the sort indices.  I then apply the returned indices to demonstrate that all keys are sorted using them. Note the output when comparing indices by their order in each sorted key. The `indices` tensor provides the correct permutation that orders the data based on `key1`, then `key2` then `key3`.

A second example is provided to handle cases with higher dimensional data. Instead of just vectors, we can have tensors of any rank. The core of the algorithm remains, utilizing `torch.gather` and `torch.argsort`, but instead of directly operating on the key, we must operate on a flatted tensor, preserving the original tensor shape within the index.

```python
import torch

def lexsort_torch_nd(keys):
    """
    Mimics NumPy's lexsort for PyTorch tensors of arbitrary dimension.

    Args:
        keys (list of torch.Tensor): A list of tensors of same shape, with the last
            tensor being the primary sort key.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: A tensor of indices to sort based on the given keys, with same shape
        as key tensors, or as a 1D tensor if the key is already a vector.
    """
    rows = keys[0].reshape(-1).shape[0] # Get the number of rows when flattened
    indices = torch.arange(rows)

    for key in reversed(keys):
        key_flat = key.reshape(-1) # Flatten the current key
        indices = key_flat.gather(0, indices).argsort()

    return indices.reshape(keys[0].shape) #Restore original shape


# Example Usage:
key1 = torch.tensor([[[3, 1], [4, 1]], [[5, 9], [2, 6]]], dtype=torch.int32)
key2 = torch.tensor([[[2, 7], [1, 8]], [[2, 8], [1, 8]]], dtype=torch.int32)
key3 = torch.tensor([[[0, 1], [2, 3]], [[4, 5], [6, 7]]], dtype=torch.int32)


keys = [key3, key2, key1]
sorted_indices = lexsort_torch_nd(keys)

print("Indices:", sorted_indices)

sorted_values = key1.reshape(-1)[sorted_indices.reshape(-1)].reshape(key1.shape)
print("Sorted key1:", sorted_values)
sorted_values = key2.reshape(-1)[sorted_indices.reshape(-1)].reshape(key2.shape)
print("Sorted key2:", sorted_values)
sorted_values = key3.reshape(-1)[sorted_indices.reshape(-1)].reshape(key3.shape)
print("Sorted key3:", sorted_values)
```

This enhanced version of the function handles input tensors of arbitrary dimensions.  The tensors are flattened before sorting, and reshaped back at the end, allowing proper operation on any multi-dimensional structure. This allows to treat higher dimensional data correctly. We get the initial indices for each position, and propagate the permutation to apply to each level of sorting from least significant to most significant. As before, the output of the `lexsort_torch_nd` function returns a set of indices that correctly orders the data based on the provided keys.

Finally, to highlight a practical scenario, consider simulation data, where one is sorting positions and velocities. Here the keys are explicitly different tensors with different shapes. The approach requires the permutation index to apply to all tensors. The general principal of multi-key sorting remains the same, but the function is applied to tensors with different shapes. The resulting index is applied to all related data, guaranteeing consistency.

```python
import torch

def lexsort_torch_general(keys):
    """
    Mimics NumPy's lexsort for PyTorch tensors. Handles tensors
    of different dimensions, but same first axis.

    Args:
        keys (list of torch.Tensor): A list of tensors, with the last
            tensor being the primary sort key.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: A tensor of indices to sort based on the given keys.
    """
    rows = keys[0].shape[0]
    indices = torch.arange(rows)

    for key in reversed(keys):
        indices = key.reshape(rows,-1).gather(0, indices.reshape(1,-1).repeat(1,key.reshape(rows,-1).shape[1])).argsort(0)[:,0]

    return indices

# Example Usage:
pos_x = torch.tensor([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6], dtype=torch.float32)
pos_y = torch.tensor([2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 8], dtype=torch.float32)
vel_x = torch.tensor([[0.2, 0.1], [0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8], [0.9, 0.1], [0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5], [0.6, 0.7]], dtype=torch.float32)
vel_y = torch.tensor([[0.01, 0.02], [0.03, 0.04], [0.05, 0.06], [0.07, 0.08], [0.09, 0.10], [0.11, 0.12], [0.13, 0.14], [0.15, 0.16]], dtype=torch.float32)

keys = [pos_y,pos_x] # sort by x then by y
sorted_indices = lexsort_torch_general(keys)
print("Indices:", sorted_indices)

print("Sorted pos_x:", pos_x[sorted_indices])
print("Sorted pos_y:", pos_y[sorted_indices])
print("Sorted vel_x:", vel_x[sorted_indices])
print("Sorted vel_y:", vel_y[sorted_indices])
```

This third example demonstrates handling multiple tensors of different shapes that require sorting by multi keys, which is common in computational tasks. Each key is provided, and the index obtained, that can be used on all related tensors to preserve the data consistency. The multi key sort effectively orders the data as required, demonstrating the power of this functionality.

For further exploration of the underlying mechanisms, I recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation regarding `torch.argsort` and `torch.gather`. In addition, detailed examination of advanced indexing in PyTorch is also beneficial. Finally, studying algorithms for stable sorting will help understanding potential issues when data contains identical sort keys.  These resources, combined with careful practice, will provide a robust understanding of replicating `lexsort` functionality within PyTorch.
