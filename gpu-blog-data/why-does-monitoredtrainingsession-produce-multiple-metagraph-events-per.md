The observed generation of multiple metagraph events per `MonitoredTrainingSession` run stems from the interaction between the session's internal event logging mechanism and the frequency of checkpointing, particularly when combined with specific TensorFlow graph configurations.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale TensorFlow projects has highlighted this interplay as the primary culprit.  While a single training run might logically seem to necessitate a single metagraph event, the reality involves a more nuanced process tied to the internal workings of TensorFlow's checkpointing and monitoring systems.


**1. Explanation:**

`MonitoredTrainingSession` facilitates checkpointing and other monitoring operations during training.  The core functionality rests upon the `tf.train.Saver` object implicitly managed within the session.  Checkpointing, triggered at user-defined intervals or upon specific events (e.g., reaching a new best validation accuracy), involves saving not only the model weights but also the TensorFlow graph itself, represented as a metagraph.  The metagraph encapsulates the computational graph's structure, including operations, variables, and their relationships.

Crucially, the act of checkpointing doesn't automatically overwrite the previous checkpoint's metagraph.  Instead, each checkpoint often saves a distinct metagraph file. This isn't inherently inefficient; it allows for the recovery of the graph at various points during training, which can be beneficial for debugging and analysis. The creation of multiple metagraphs directly reflects the multiple checkpoints generated throughout the training process.  Further complexity arises when dealing with distributed training setups or when using features like `tf.estimator.Estimator`, which may implicitly manage multiple sessions or employ internal checkpointing mechanisms, potentially resulting in even more metagraph files.  In essence, the number of metagraph events correlates directly with the number of checkpoints written by the `MonitoredTrainingSession`.  If no checkpointing occurs, ideally only a single metagraph would be produced at the session's initialization.

Furthermore, if the graph structure itself changes during the training process (e.g., due to conditional branches in the model or the addition of new operations), this can also contribute to the creation of additional metagraph events, as the altered graph needs to be recorded within a new checkpoint. Therefore, a careful examination of the model definition and checkpointing strategy is essential to minimize unnecessary metagraph events.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Checkpointing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 1])
W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

# Define loss and optimizer
y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 1])
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y - y_))
train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01).minimize(loss)

# Create a MonitoredTrainingSession with a checkpoint saver
hooks = [tf.train.CheckpointSaverHook(checkpoint_dir="./checkpoint_dir", save_steps=100)]
with tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession(hooks=hooks) as sess:
    # Training loop
    for i in range(1000):
        sess.run(train_step, feed_dict={x: [[i]], y_: [[i]]})

```
This example demonstrates basic checkpointing.  The `CheckpointSaverHook` saves checkpoints every 100 steps, leading to multiple metagraph events (one for each checkpoint).  The directory `checkpoint_dir` will contain the multiple checkpoint files, each encapsulating a metagraph.

**Example 2:  Conditional Graph Structure:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a model with a conditional branch
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 1])
training = tf.placeholder(tf.bool)

W1 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, 1]))
W2 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, 1]))

y = tf.cond(training, lambda: tf.matmul(x, W1), lambda: tf.matmul(x, W2))

# ... (Rest of the model definition, loss, optimizer remain similar to Example 1)

hooks = [tf.train.CheckpointSaverHook(checkpoint_dir="./checkpoint_dir_conditional", save_steps=100)]
with tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession(hooks=hooks) as sess:
    # Training loop with conditional execution
    for i in range(1000):
        sess.run(train_step, feed_dict={x: [[i]], training: (i%2==0)}) #condition alters graph execution
```
This illustrates a scenario where the graph structure changes conditionally during training.  Even with a fixed checkpointing frequency, this will likely generate multiple metagraphs because the saved graph represents the active configuration at each checkpoint.

**Example 3:  No Checkpointing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Model definition and training loop similar to Example 1, but without CheckpointSaverHook)
with tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession() as sess:
    # Training loop with no explicit checkpointing
    for i in range(1000):
        sess.run(train_step, feed_dict={x: [[i]], y_: [[i]]})
```
In this case, because no explicit checkpointing mechanism (like `CheckpointSaverHook`) is specified, only a single metagraph file should ideally be generated at the start of the session.  However, depending on the underlying TensorFlow version and other configurations, a minor variation might still exist, potentially due to internal bookkeeping.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a thorough understanding of TensorFlow's checkpointing mechanisms, consult the official TensorFlow documentation's section on saving and restoring models.  The documentation on `tf.train.Saver` and related classes is particularly valuable.  Furthermore, investigating the TensorFlow source code itself can offer insights into the internal workings of `MonitoredTrainingSession` and its event handling.  Finally, relevant research papers on large-scale deep learning training and model management can provide a broader context for understanding these phenomena.  A detailed exploration of TensorFlow's graph management and execution system would also prove beneficial.
