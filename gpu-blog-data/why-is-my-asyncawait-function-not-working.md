My experience troubleshooting asynchronous JavaScript often reveals a common culprit when `async/await` functions fail to behave as expected: a misunderstanding of how `await` handles promises and the implications of not returning them correctly. The core of `async/await` lies in its syntactic sugar over promises; it doesn't magically transform synchronous operations into asynchronous ones. An `async` function, when called, *always* returns a promise. The `await` keyword within that function pauses execution until a promise resolves (or rejects), and extracts the resolved value. If you don't return a promise from a function being `await`ed, or if you're not `await`ing a promise at all, the function will likely appear to be failing or behaving unexpectedly. This creates a common pitfall where code execution doesn’t pause as intended, especially with operations that do not inherently return promises.

The first key concept to grasp is that `await` operates *only* on promises. When you `await` a non-promise value, JavaScript implicitly wraps that value in a resolved promise, which then allows the `async` function to continue execution. However, this implicit conversion doesn't address scenarios where the operation itself (like a traditional callback-based operation) isn't returning a promise. The code simply continues executing without the pause you’d expect from an asynchronous operation. Another aspect to consider is error handling. If a promise rejects, it will throw an error that you must either catch within the `async` function using try/catch blocks, or allow to propagate up the call stack. Neglecting these error-handling requirements can lead to silent failures, making it difficult to understand why the function doesn't work as planned. Furthermore, understanding the execution order of async code is crucial. While `await` pauses the execution of the async function, other tasks, such as synchronous code or other promises may continue running, leading to timing issues.

Let’s consider a few code examples to illustrate common problem scenarios and how to address them.

**Example 1: Missing Promise Return**

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Data fetched");
    return "Data"; // This return is not within a promise context.
  }, 1000);
}

async function processData() {
  console.log("Starting process");
  const data = await fetchData();
  console.log("Data received:", data);
  console.log("Process finished");
}

processData();
```

In this case, `fetchData` uses `setTimeout`, which utilizes a callback. It doesn't return a promise. Therefore, the `await` in `processData` doesn't actually wait for `setTimeout` to complete. Instead, `fetchData` executes, schedules the timeout, and immediately returns `undefined` which `await` receives. The output of this snippet would show the immediate execution of "Starting process" and "Process finished" before the timeout completes, demonstrating the incorrect pause mechanism. The core issue here is that `setTimeout` doesn't inherently return a promise.

To fix this we would rewrite `fetchData` to return a promise.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Data fetched");
      resolve("Data");
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function processData() {
    console.log("Starting process");
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log("Data received:", data);
    console.log("Process finished");
  }
  
processData();
```

This corrected version wraps `setTimeout` in a `Promise` constructor. The `resolve` function, called after the timeout, makes the promise fulfill its duty, enabling the correct pausing and data transfer behavior of `await` within the `processData` function.

**Example 2: Incorrect Handling of a Promise Rejection**

```javascript
async function unreliableFetch() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const random = Math.random();
    if (random < 0.5) {
      setTimeout(() => resolve("Successful fetch"), 500);
    } else {
        setTimeout(() => reject("Fetch failed"), 500);
    }
  });
}

async function processData() {
    console.log("Starting unreliable process");
    const result = await unreliableFetch();
    console.log("Result:", result);
    console.log("Process finished");
  }
  
processData();
```

In the second example, the `unreliableFetch` function has the potential to reject the promise it returns. If it does reject, the promise won't resolve as `await` expects, leading to an unhandled rejection error and potentially stopping the `processData` function abruptly.  The execution may seem inconsistent and, in a real-world scenario, could lead to an application crash. The lack of error handling means we aren’t properly accounting for potential failures within an asynchronous operation.

The resolution is to use a `try...catch` block.

```javascript
async function unreliableFetch() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const random = Math.random();
      if (random < 0.5) {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("Successful fetch"), 500);
      } else {
          setTimeout(() => reject("Fetch failed"), 500);
      }
    });
  }
  
async function processData() {
    console.log("Starting unreliable process");
    try {
      const result = await unreliableFetch();
      console.log("Result:", result);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error);
    } finally {
        console.log("Process finished");
    }
  }
    
processData();
```

By wrapping `await unreliableFetch()` in a `try` block, we can intercept the promise rejection with the `catch` block and handle the error gracefully. The `finally` block provides a location to cleanup or execute code regardless of whether the promise resolves or rejects.

**Example 3: Incorrect Function Scope of `await`**

```javascript
function initiate() {
  console.log("Initiating sequence");
  await performAsyncOperation(); // Error: await is only valid in async functions.
  console.log("Sequence complete");
}

async function performAsyncOperation() {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Async operation complete");
            resolve();
        }, 1000)
    });
}

initiate();
```

In the third scenario, the `await` keyword is used in the `initiate` function, which is not an `async` function. This throws a syntax error, as `await` is only valid within the body of an `async` function. Even if `performAsyncOperation` is an async function returning a promise, you can't directly use `await` outside the context of `async` function calls. This shows that you should always carefully consider where to call async functions and where to use `await`.

The correct way to manage this is to make `initiate` an async function.

```javascript
async function initiate() {
    console.log("Initiating sequence");
    await performAsyncOperation();
    console.log("Sequence complete");
  }
  
async function performAsyncOperation() {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Async operation complete");
            resolve();
        }, 1000)
    });
}
  
initiate();
```

By declaring the `initiate` function as `async`, we can now use `await` correctly, pause execution until `performAsyncOperation` resolves, and then continue executing with the next line of code.

To enhance one's understanding of asynchronous JavaScript beyond these examples, it's beneficial to consult resources that provide a solid grasp of the underlying mechanisms. Focus on materials that delve into the event loop, promise mechanics (including promise chaining and resolution/rejection behavior), and the subtle nuances of error handling. Additionally, resources that illustrate asynchronous code patterns (like parallel executions via `Promise.all` and handling sequences with `async` generators) can help further develop your mastery of asynchronous JavaScript. I would particularly advise spending time with the more advanced asynchronous programming patterns as these are commonly used in more sophisticated applications. Practicing these concepts frequently will clarify the workings of `async/await`.
