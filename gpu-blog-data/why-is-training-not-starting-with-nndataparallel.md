The seemingly straightforward parallelization offered by `torch.nn.DataParallel` often fails to initiate training, stemming primarily from how it orchestrates data distribution and gradient accumulation across multiple GPUs. I've personally encountered this exact roadblock several times, especially when transitioning from single-GPU prototyping to distributed training setups. The issue isn't that `DataParallel` is inherently broken; instead, it reveals critical limitations regarding its underlying mechanics and its interaction with PyTorch's computation graph.

`nn.DataParallel` operates by splitting the input batch across available GPUs, executing the forward pass independently on each device, then gathering the resulting losses before backpropagating through a single, averaged loss. This process, while seemingly convenient, introduces several subtle pitfalls that commonly lead to training failures. The most significant of these is **incompatible input sizes and shapes.** When the input data isn't perfectly divisible by the number of GPUs or contains variable-length sequences, `DataParallel` struggles to evenly distribute the workload. This often manifests as errors stemming from tensor dimensions not aligning correctly after the split or gather operations.

Additionally, `DataParallel` can introduce significant overhead due to the constant data transfer between the main process (where the model resides) and the worker GPUs. This can lead to a slower effective training time, and in some cases, may actually stall the training loop if the overhead outweighs the parallelization gains. It is crucial to remember that the model's parameters remain in the primary process's memory, while only copies are used on the worker GPUs, making it a form of *model parallelism,* while primarily *data parallelism*. This creates further potential issues with parameter synchronization.

Another frequent cause of training stagnation with `DataParallel` relates to the way it handles gradient averaging across the multiple GPUs. Specifically, the reduction operation of the gradients and the loss is done in the master device. This single point of contact can create a bottleneck and can also be a problem when that device cannot handle the aggregation. This is not true if you are running it in multi-node multi-gpu settings (but still, the problem can manifest). Furthermore, if the model architecture contains custom operations or layers that aren't inherently compatible with the data parallelization strategy, issues with device transfer and gradient computation may appear.

Lastly, `DataParallel` does not properly scale with increasing numbers of GPUs. As more GPUs are added, the communication overhead between the primary process and worker GPUs starts to dominate. This phenomenon is very well documented in both PyTorch documentation and other researchers. In fact, it is generally recommended to use alternatives when working with more than 2 or 3 GPUs.

Let's examine a few examples to illustrate these problems:

**Example 1: Incompatible Input Shapes**

Suppose we have a dataset where input sequences have varying lengths, such as in natural language processing tasks. The following code snippet demonstrates what could go wrong.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, seq_lengths):
        self.seq_lengths = seq_lengths

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.seq_lengths)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        seq_len = self.seq_lengths[idx]
        return torch.randn(seq_len, 10) # Varying sequence length

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)


#Create dummy dataset with varying sequence length
seq_lengths = [10,20,30,40, 5, 15, 25, 35]
dataset = CustomDataset(seq_lengths)

#Create Dataloader, and try to batch it up. This works in the single device mode.
#However, it will not work when using the DataParallel
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=False,  collate_fn=lambda batch: torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_sequence(batch, batch_first=True))

# Model, loss function and optimizer creation.
model = SimpleModel(10, 20)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# Attempt to train with DataParallel
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    print("Using Data Parallel...")
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
    model.cuda()

for inputs in dataloader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
        inputs=inputs.cuda()
    output = model(inputs)
    target = torch.randn(output.shape).cuda() if torch.cuda.device_count() > 0 else torch.randn(output.shape)
    loss = criterion(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(loss.item())

```

In this example, when a batch of varying sequence lengths is presented to `DataParallel`, it might generate error due to the padding implemented in `pad_sequence`. Note that the error may not appear, but it will be more evident in more complex structures (e.g. LSTM-like structures). The `collate_fn` handles the padding of the sequences, and this padding is not accounted for by `DataParallel`, that expects a completely consistent tensor when using multiple GPUs.

**Example 2: Overhead due to Parameter Transfers**

Consider a scenario with a large model, and a small batch size.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import time

class LargeModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(LargeModel, self).__init__()
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size),
             nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, input_size),
        )
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layers(x)

input_size = 10000
hidden_size = 5000
model = LargeModel(input_size,hidden_size).cuda()

criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    print("Using Data Parallel...")
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)

batch_size=16
# simulate several steps
num_steps=10

for step in range(num_steps):
    input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size).cuda() if torch.cuda.device_count() > 0 else torch.randn(batch_size, input_size)
    start_time = time.time()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(input_tensor)
    target = torch.randn(output.shape).cuda() if torch.cuda.device_count() > 0 else torch.randn(output.shape)
    loss = criterion(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Step {step+1}: loss = {loss.item()}, time = {end_time - start_time:.4f} s")

```

In this example, we've created a moderately large model and are using a relatively small batch size. The transfer of data, model parameters, gradients, and loss across devices during forward and backward propagation can quickly dominate the training time, diminishing the overall speed benefits of `DataParallel`. You will observe, especially when increasing the `input_size` and `hidden_size`, that the time does not decrease by using multiple GPUs.

**Example 3: Custom Layer Issues**

Let's consider a scenario with a non-standard model module which may have inconsistent implementation among different devices.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn


class CustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(input_size, hidden_size))


    def forward(self, x):
        # this operation may not have correct device affinity in a distributed environment
        return torch.matmul(x, self.weight)



class ModelWithCustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(ModelWithCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.custom_layer = CustomLayer(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.custom_layer(x)
        x = self.linear(x)
        return x


input_size = 100
hidden_size = 50
model = ModelWithCustomLayer(input_size, hidden_size)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    print("Using Data Parallel...")
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
    model.cuda()

batch_size=32
input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size).cuda() if torch.cuda.device_count() > 0 else torch.randn(batch_size, input_size)
optimizer.zero_grad()
output = model(input_tensor)
target = torch.randn(output.shape).cuda() if torch.cuda.device_count() > 0 else torch.randn(output.shape)
loss = criterion(output, target)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
print(loss.item())

```

In this example, the custom layer's implementation, specifically the matrix multiplication with a manually defined weight, may lead to unexpected behavior. DataParallel relies on all tensors being on the same device in the forward pass, and also in the backward pass when calculating the gradient, and the implementation of the CustomLayer is not guaranteed to transfer to the worker devices. These problems are not easy to trace and may present several subtle inconsistencies.

Given these shortcomings, I would recommend investigating `torch.distributed` for production settings or complex scenarios. The `DistributedDataParallel` class generally handles the process of distributed data parallelism more gracefully, because it uses separate processes instead of threads, making the whole setup less prone to the limitations above mentioned. Also, for multi-node settings, this is the only recommended setting. It does, however, require a more involved setup and a better understanding of distributed computing, as it needs initialization of the processes and synchronization protocols.

For educational purposes, the PyTorch documentation on distributed training serves as a starting point. Consider carefully the trade-offs between simpler tools like DataParallel and more complex yet performant ones such as DistributedDataParallel. Resources such as the official PyTorch examples, and related academic papers on scaling distributed training of deep learning models are also very useful.
