A TensorFlow 2.0 custom layer returning `None` for its gradient during training typically stems from a failure to properly connect the layer's operations with the gradient tape. Specifically, TensorFlow's automatic differentiation engine needs explicit instructions on which computations to track for gradient calculation; if this lineage is broken or if the operations are not differentiable, `None` is returned.

My experience with this issue, stemming from developing a specialized attention mechanism for a sequence-to-sequence model, highlights common pitfalls that lead to this problem. The crucial detail is that TensorFlow, unlike some deep learning frameworks, doesn’t automatically track gradient information for all operations within a custom layer. The layer’s `call` method must employ only TensorFlow operations that are differentiable and have a defined gradient. If non-differentiable operations are used, or if operations are carried out outside of the context of the gradient tape (within `tf.GradientTape()` context), the framework cannot compute gradients correctly.

The first primary source of this problem is using operations that TensorFlow doesn’t know how to differentiate. Common examples include the direct manipulation of NumPy arrays inside a `tf.function` decorated call method or operations not included in TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation backend. When I was initially prototyping the custom attention layer, I used a Python loop and direct numpy array slicing. This was very efficient, but it entirely prevented TensorFlow from tracking the derivatives. Specifically, if a layer's computation involves conditional logic or dynamic array manipulations using traditional Python, that computation needs to be redefined using TensorFlow operations within a `tf.Tensor` format. TensorFlow computes gradients by applying the chain rule; this cannot work if Python code is executing parts of the computation outside of TensorFlow’s symbolic graph.

Another frequent culprit is unintentional scope issues related to the `tf.GradientTape`. In training loops, the gradient tape is used to record the operations performed within the layer. If the layer’s `call` method omits specific operations from the `tf.GradientTape()` context, these operations won’t contribute to the gradients. For instance, if a helper function performs computation that requires gradients and it’s outside the tape's context when called from a custom layer, TensorFlow will return None because its gradient-tracking system is unaware of these calculations. I faced this when trying to modularize the attention mechanism’s calculation by encapsulating part of the logic in a standalone Python function. My error was not explicitly including this function’s calculations within the tape's context and ensuring only tensors where being passed and returned.

The last typical cause is misusing `tf.stop_gradient`. While `tf.stop_gradient` is crucial for controlling gradients in some contexts, it must be used with precision. It prevents gradients from flowing past a specific node. If the output of a calculation within the layer that requires a gradient is passed through `tf.stop_gradient`, no gradients will be propagated back during training. This is not always immediately apparent in the codebase, especially when refactoring a layer that initially didn’t use gradients. I have, for example, unintentionally used `tf.stop_gradient` within layer outputs while using a custom activation function for the attention weights; this resulted in gradients being suppressed, even though the activation function required a gradient.

Below are several code examples illustrating these issues and the steps to address them:

**Example 1: Non-Differentiable NumPy Operations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class IncorrectLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(1, units), initializer='random_normal')
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='zeros')

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Incorrect: numpy used within the layer
        x = inputs.numpy()
        output = np.dot(x, self.w.numpy()) + self.b.numpy() # numpy dot
        return tf.convert_to_tensor(output, dtype=tf.float32) # back to tensor

# Training Loop (simplified)
model = IncorrectLayer(10)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
x = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 5))
y = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum((y_pred - y)**2)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

for grad in gradients:
    print(grad)
```
**Commentary:** The `IncorrectLayer` uses `numpy.dot()` and direct access to `numpy()` versions of the weights and biases. This happens outside of the TensorFlow graph that a `GradientTape` is recording. Because of this, the tape cannot record gradients, resulting in all `None` values. The fix is to replace `numpy` operations with their corresponding `tf` equivalents.

**Example 2: Operations Outside GradientTape Context**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def external_calculation(inputs):
    # Incorrect: outside of the gradient tape
    w = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(inputs.shape[1], 2)))
    return tf.matmul(inputs, w)


class CorrectedLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(1, units), initializer='random_normal')
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='zeros')

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Incorrect call of an external function
        external_output = external_calculation(inputs)
        return tf.matmul(external_output, self.w) + self.b

# Training Loop (simplified)
model = CorrectedLayer(10)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
x = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 5))
y = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum((y_pred - y)**2)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

for grad in gradients:
    print(grad)
```
**Commentary:** The `external_calculation` function, while using TensorFlow operations, is invoked outside of the `GradientTape` context. It declares its own variable and performs computations outside of what the tape observes. This leads to gradients being `None` for trainable variables within the model. The external function needs to be wrapped using `tf.function` or its operations need to be placed inside the GradientTape context.

**Example 3: Misuse of tf.stop_gradient**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class WrongGradientLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
      super().__init__(**kwargs)
      self.units = units
      self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(1, units), initializer='random_normal')

  def call(self, inputs):
    # Incorrect use of tf.stop_gradient
    output = tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)
    stopped_output = tf.stop_gradient(output)
    return stopped_output

# Training Loop (simplified)
model = WrongGradientLayer(10)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
x = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 5))
y = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum((y_pred - y)**2)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

for grad in gradients:
    print(grad)
```

**Commentary:** In the `WrongGradientLayer`, the output of the matrix multiplication (`tf.matmul`) is wrapped in `tf.stop_gradient`. This effectively blocks gradient flow, so even though the weight `self.w` is a trainable variable, its gradients are all `None` during backpropagation. This layer was likely designed not to train weights but rather to perform a static operation, which should be reviewed prior to including a layer that requires backpropagation.

To mitigate these issues, several resources are helpful. The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive information on `tf.GradientTape`, custom layers, and differentiable operations. The TensorFlow tutorials on custom training and layers detail best practices. In addition, exploring resources related to graph execution and eager execution will greatly improve comprehension of how TensorFlow computes gradients. Understanding the difference between eager and graph execution is critical when debugging such errors. Finally, reviewing implementations of other custom layers can provide valuable insights, specifically within models that use multiple custom layers with shared states and/or gradient updates.
