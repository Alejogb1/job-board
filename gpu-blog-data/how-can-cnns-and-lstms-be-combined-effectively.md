The effective combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks hinges on understanding their complementary strengths. CNNs excel at extracting spatial hierarchies of features from grid-like data, such as images, while LSTMs are adept at processing sequential data, capturing temporal dependencies. My experience building hybrid models for video analysis and natural language processing has shown that the key to successful integration lies in strategically passing the output of one network as input to the other.

Typically, this combination manifests in two primary architectural approaches. The first involves using CNNs as feature extractors followed by LSTMs for sequence modeling. The second uses LSTMs to process sequences and then employs CNNs for fine-grained analysis within the encoded context. The choice between these two approaches depends heavily on the nature of the data and the specific task.

In the scenario where CNNs precede LSTMs, the convolutional layers operate on the raw input to produce a set of high-level features. For instance, in video classification, each frame might be processed by a CNN. The spatial output (often a feature map) of the CNN for each frame is then flattened or aggregated into a vector representation. This sequence of vectors, representing the temporal evolution of the video content, is then fed into an LSTM layer. The LSTM, with its inherent ability to handle sequences, can learn temporal patterns and dependencies across frames. The final output of the LSTM is often used for classification or regression tasks. This architecture is particularly suitable for problems where spatial features vary over time and these temporal changes are critical to task resolution.

Conversely, when LSTMs precede CNNs, the LSTM receives sequential input and produces a hidden state at each step, encoding the sequence up to that point. These hidden states, or a summary of them, are then input to the CNN. This architecture is useful when the input data consists of a sequence of elements with inherent time dependencies, but the task involves identifying spatially-relevant patterns after sequence summarization. For example, consider a language processing task that processes an input sentence with an LSTM first. The LSTM output, potentially a summary of the sentence meaning, might then be interpreted by a CNN to capture word-level or phrase-level patterns important for sentiment analysis or semantic understanding. The CNN provides localized analysis based on the context learned by the preceding LSTM.

Here are three practical code examples, using Python and a conceptual framework based on Keras, illustrating how these combined approaches can be implemented:

**Example 1: CNN-LSTM for Video Classification**

This example demonstrates how to process a video using a CNN to extract features from each frame, and then process the sequence of features with an LSTM for classification. Assume the video input is a tensor of shape `(num_frames, height, width, channels)`.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, LSTM, TimeDistributed, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

def create_cnn_lstm_video_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = Sequential()

    # CNN for feature extraction on each frame
    model.add(TimeDistributed(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'), input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(TimeDistributed(MaxPooling2D((2, 2))))
    model.add(TimeDistributed(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')))
    model.add(TimeDistributed(MaxPooling2D((2, 2))))
    model.add(TimeDistributed(Flatten()))

    # LSTM to process the sequence of frame features
    model.add(LSTM(128, return_sequences=False))

    # Output layer
    model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
    return model

# Example usage
input_shape = (None, 128, 128, 3) # None represents arbitrary number of frames
num_classes = 5
model = create_cnn_lstm_video_model(input_shape, num_classes)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# Model will accept input of shape (batch_size, num_frames, 128, 128, 3)
```

This code defines a function `create_cnn_lstm_video_model` that constructs a sequential model. The `TimeDistributed` layer is crucial here; it applies the specified convolutional layers to every frame of the video independently. This effectively allows the CNN to act on individual frames without requiring padding or a fixed number of frames. The output of the TimeDistributed layer is flattened and passed to the LSTM layer, which then processes the extracted feature vectors over time. The final layer provides the classification probabilities. The input shape has the first dimension as 'None' allowing the user to pass a variable number of frames, a typical requirement when processing video data.

**Example 2: LSTM-CNN for Text Sentiment Analysis**

Here, an LSTM is employed to process a sequence of words, followed by CNN layers to extract pattern at the phrase level. Assuming the input is a sequence of word embeddings, shaped as `(sequence_length, embedding_dimension)`.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Conv1D, GlobalMaxPooling1D, Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def create_lstm_cnn_text_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, sequence_length, num_classes):
    input_layer = Input(shape=(sequence_length,))
    
    # Embedding layer
    embedding = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)(input_layer)

    # LSTM to process the word sequence
    lstm_out = LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)(embedding)

    # CNN to process the hidden states
    conv = Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')(lstm_out)
    pool = GlobalMaxPooling1D()(conv) # pool output down to a vector

    # Output layer
    output_layer = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(pool)
    
    model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

    return model


# Example usage
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 100
sequence_length = 50
num_classes = 2

model = create_lstm_cnn_text_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, sequence_length, num_classes)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# Model will accept input of shape (batch_size, sequence_length)
```

This code defines `create_lstm_cnn_text_model`, taking the vocabulary size, embedding dimension, and sequence length as parameters. An input layer accepts the input sequence. The sequence of word indices is embedded and processed by the LSTM layer. The output of the LSTM is passed to a one-dimensional CNN that operates on the time series of LSTM outputs. A global max pooling layer reduces the convolutional output to a vector, representing the most salient features extracted by the CNN, which is finally processed to give output probabilities for each class. This is a classic example of how the LSTM context is provided to the CNN which is able to capture pattern within that context, in this case sentiment.

**Example 3: Hybrid CNN-LSTM with Attention Mechanism**

This more advanced example demonstrates a CNN extracting visual features which are then processed by an LSTM with an attention mechanism.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, LSTM, Dense, Input, Attention
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def create_attention_cnn_lstm_model(input_shape, num_classes):
  inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
  # CNN for feature extraction
  x = Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu')(inputs)
  x = MaxPooling2D((2,2))(x)
  x = Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu')(x)
  x = MaxPooling2D((2,2))(x)
  feature_maps = Flatten()(x)

  # Reshape to a time series for LSTM
  feature_maps_rs = K.reshape(feature_maps, (-1,1,K.int_shape(feature_maps)[1]))
  
  # LSTM to learn temporal dependencies
  lstm_out = LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)(feature_maps_rs)
  
  # Attention Mechanism
  attention_out = Attention()([lstm_out, lstm_out]) 

  # Summarize with Global Average Pooling
  avg_pool = K.mean(attention_out, axis=1)

  # Output Layer
  outputs = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(avg_pool)
  
  model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
  return model


# Example usage
input_shape = (128, 128, 3) # Assume single image input
num_classes = 5

model = create_attention_cnn_lstm_model(input_shape, num_classes)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# Model will accept input of shape (batch_size, 128, 128, 3)
```

This final example shows the extraction of spatial features from a single image (shape=(128,128,3)) with a CNN. The output is flattened and reshaped as if a sequence with length 1, allowing it to be processed by the LSTM. The LSTM output is then fed into an Attention layer which learns how to weight each temporal step. This is followed by a global average pooling layer which summarises the temporal output and is passed to a dense layer to make classification predictions. This advanced example represents a good starting point for complex image-sequence processing. It leverages CNN for feature extraction, LSTM for temporal modelling, and attention for focusing on key parts of the sequence.

For those wishing to further explore the capabilities of CNN-LSTM hybrids, I would recommend exploring resources on time series analysis with deep learning, particularly those pertaining to sequence-to-sequence models. Textbooks dedicated to deep learning and its practical applications also provide in-depth theoretical understanding and implementation details.  Reviewing research papers on recurrent convolutional neural networks will further illuminate advanced architectural patterns and their specific applications.
