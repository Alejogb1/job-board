Directly addressing the query:  No, there isn't a single built-in Google Sheets function to automatically export each row to a separate Google Doc.  However, achieving this functionality requires a scripting approach, leveraging Google Apps Script.  My experience working on large-scale data migration projects within Google Workspace has highlighted the efficiency and necessity of such custom scripting solutions for non-trivial data transformations.  The following details a method, encompassing explanations and illustrative code examples, to accomplish this task.


**1.  Explanation of the Method**

The core process involves using Google Apps Script to iterate through each row of the Google Sheet. For each row, the script creates a new Google Doc, then dynamically populates the Doc's content based on the values present in that specific row.  The crucial elements are:

* **SpreadsheetApp Service:** This service provides methods to interact with Google Sheets, allowing access to data and sheet properties.

* **DocumentApp Service:** This service offers methods to create and manipulate Google Docs, including adding text, formatting, and more.

* **Iteration (Loops):** The script utilizes a loop (typically `for` or `forEach`) to process each row of the sheet sequentially.

* **Data Extraction:**  Within the loop, the script accesses individual cell values from each row.

* **Document Creation & Population:**  For every row, a new Google Doc is created using `DocumentApp.create()`.  Then, the extracted cell values are inserted into the document using `DocumentApp.getActiveDocument().getBody().appendParagraph()`.  Additional formatting can be applied at this stage as needed.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Row Export**

This example demonstrates the fundamental process of creating a new Google Doc for each row and populating it with the row's data as plain text.


```javascript  
function exportRowsToDocs() {
  // Get the active spreadsheet and sheet.
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const sheet = ss.getActiveSheet();

  // Get the data range (excluding the header row).
  const data = sheet.getRange(2, 1, sheet.getLastRow() - 1, sheet.getLastColumn()).getValues();

  // Iterate through each row.
  data.forEach(row => {
    // Create a new document.
    const doc = DocumentApp.create(row[0]); // Uses the first column value as the document title.

    // Append each cell value as a paragraph.
    row.forEach(cell => {
      doc.getBody().appendParagraph(cell);
    });
  });
}
```

This script first obtains the spreadsheet and the active sheet.  It then retrieves the data range, excluding the header row (assuming the first row contains headers). The `forEach` loop iterates through the rows, creating a new document for each using the first column's value as the document title. Finally, it appends each cell's value to the document as a separate paragraph.


**Example 2: Enhanced Formatting**

This builds on the previous example by adding basic formatting.  It uses bold for the first cell in each row and adds a line break for better readability.

```javascript
function exportRowsToDocsFormatted() {
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const sheet = ss.getActiveSheet();
  const data = sheet.getRange(2, 1, sheet.getLastRow() - 1, sheet.getLastColumn()).getValues();

  data.forEach(row => {
    const doc = DocumentApp.create(row[0]);
    row.forEach((cell, index) => {
      const paragraph = doc.getBody().appendParagraph(cell);
      if (index === 0) {
        paragraph.setAttributes({bold: true});
      }
    });
    doc.getBody().appendParagraph(""); // Add a line break between rows.
  });
}
```


Here, we introduce conditional formatting based on the cell's index (`index === 0`).  The first cell in each row is set to bold.  A blank paragraph is appended after each row to create visual separation.


**Example 3:  Handling Different Data Types**

This example demonstrates handling different data types within the sheet, including numbers and dates, ensuring they are correctly represented in the documents.


```javascript
function exportRowsToDocsDataTypeHandling() {
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const sheet = ss.getActiveSheet();
  const data = sheet.getRange(2, 1, sheet.getLastRow() - 1, sheet.getLastColumn()).getValues();

  data.forEach(row => {
    const doc = DocumentApp.create(row[0]);
    row.forEach(cell => {
      let formattedCell = cell;
      if (typeof cell === 'number') {
        formattedCell = Utilities.formatString("%f", cell); // Format numbers
      } else if (cell instanceof Date) {
        formattedCell = Utilities.formatDate(cell, ss.getSpreadsheetTimeZone(), "yyyy-MM-dd"); //Format dates
      }
      doc.getBody().appendParagraph(formattedCell);
    });
  });
}
```

This script explicitly handles numbers by using `Utilities.formatString` and dates with `Utilities.formatDate`, converting them into strings suitable for displaying in the Google Docs.  This prevents potential errors from directly appending numbers or dates as objects.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration and advanced techniques, I suggest consulting the official Google Apps Script documentation.  Pay close attention to the SpreadsheetApp and DocumentApp service references.  Furthermore, studying examples of Google Apps Script libraries that facilitate data manipulation and document creation will prove beneficial.  Finally, understanding error handling within Google Apps Script is crucial for robust applications, particularly when dealing with potentially large datasets or varying data formats.  Consider researching best practices for efficient script execution and resource management in Google Apps Script to handle large sheets effectively.
