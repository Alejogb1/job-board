The primary reason Keras’ `load_model` fails when loading a .h5 TensorFlow model often stems from discrepancies between the environment where the model was saved and the environment where it is being loaded, specifically concerning the versions of TensorFlow, Keras, and potentially other dependent libraries. I have encountered this issue numerous times during the deployment of machine learning models, and through experience, I've distilled several key contributing factors.

Firstly, serialization and deserialization of model architectures within TensorFlow's HDF5 format are sensitive to the exact configurations present during both save and load operations. A seemingly minor version mismatch, such as moving from TensorFlow 2.7 to 2.8, can introduce breaking changes in the way layers or their associated weights are stored. This is not uncommon and directly relates to internal restructuring within the framework, specifically how TensorFlow represents computational graphs and data structures. When loading, `load_model` expects a consistent representation; otherwise, it throws an error, often cryptic and pointing vaguely towards an issue with the HDF5 file or a class definition. This incompatibility isn’t necessarily a bug, but a consequence of evolutionary changes in TensorFlow's design.

Secondly, a common cause arises from the presence of custom layers or functions not explicitly defined or registered in the loading environment. I faced a situation where a custom activation function was used during training, yet the function itself was not available when I attempted to load the model on a server, resulting in a "Unknown Layer" error. Keras relies on the class registry to find corresponding definitions of the layers to correctly rebuild the model from its stored configuration. If it cannot find the specific constructor function, it won’t know how to instantiate the layers, leading to the load failure. This issue extends beyond custom layers to include anything not part of the standard TensorFlow/Keras API, like custom losses, metrics, or regularizers.

Thirdly, issues may arise from subtle differences in the save/load process if the model contains subclassed Keras models or layers employing custom build logic. These models can add additional complexity to the serialization process. The `save_model` function, under these circumstances, might not be able to fully capture the dynamic instantiation behavior. When subclassed layers initialize parts of their structure during the `build` step, this initialization logic itself can be absent during loading, especially if not handled correctly within the subclass definition. This scenario is trickier to debug, often requiring careful examination of the subclassed layer code to ensure the initial state can be reproduced from the saved architecture and weights.

Here are code examples illustrating the types of issues and their fixes:

**Example 1: Version Mismatch**

```python
# Saving (using an older TensorFlow version, say 2.7)
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.save('my_model.h5')


# Loading (using a newer TensorFlow version, say 2.10 or 2.11, where you get errors)
try:
    loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
    print("Model loaded successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")

# Potential Solution:
# Upgrade or Downgrade to matching environments
# Alternatively, if using SavedModel format this problem is reduced, but needs to be updated in the save call
# (model.save("my_model", save_format="tf"))

```

*Commentary:* This example highlights the fundamental problem of version conflicts. If the saved model originates from a TensorFlow version significantly different from the loading environment, expect failures. The solution is straightforward: ensure compatibility by using the same TensorFlow/Keras versions during save and load. While the SavedModel format is more resilient to such changes, it was not the original query. Also note, that `load_model` does not allow you to specify whether to load using the SavedModel or H5 format.

**Example 2: Custom Layer Issue**

```python
# Custom Activation Function
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import backend as K

def custom_activation(x):
  return K.sigmoid(x) * K.tanh(x)

class CustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
      self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                               initializer='random_normal',
                               trainable=True)
    def call(self, inputs):
        return custom_activation(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w))

# Saving Model Using Custom Layer and Custom Function
model_custom = keras.Sequential([
   CustomLayer(32, input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_custom.save('custom_model.h5')


# Loading Model Where custom activation isn't registered
try:
    loaded_custom_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_model.h5')
    print("Custom model loaded successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading custom model: {e}")


# Solution - Register the custom function/layers to the load context
# Method A, for custom activation, within the load call.
try:
    loaded_custom_model_fixed = keras.models.load_model('custom_model.h5',
    custom_objects={'custom_activation': custom_activation, 'CustomLayer': CustomLayer})
    print("Custom model loaded with custom_objects")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading custom model with custom objects: {e}")

# Method B, use @tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable
@tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable()
def custom_activation_register(x):
    return K.sigmoid(x) * K.tanh(x)

@tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable()
class CustomLayer_registered(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer_registered, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
      self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                               initializer='random_normal',
                               trainable=True)
    def call(self, inputs):
        return custom_activation_register(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w))

# Resave Model with serializable custom objects
model_custom_reg = keras.Sequential([
   CustomLayer_registered(32, input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_custom_reg.save('custom_model_reg.h5')

# Successfully load
try:
    loaded_custom_model_reg = keras.models.load_model('custom_model_reg.h5')
    print("Custom model loaded with registration")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading custom model with registration: {e}")

```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates how custom layers and functions not registered with Keras can lead to load failures. The first attempt to load `custom_model.h5` will fail, and the `custom_objects` argument in `load_model` is essential to specify custom functions or classes at load time. The use of `@tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable` when creating the `custom_activation_register` and `CustomLayer_registered` allows the model to be loaded without the need for the custom objects argument. This is often a cleaner approach.

**Example 3: Subclassed Layers and Build Logic**

```python
# Subclassed Layer with build logic
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras


class SubclassedLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(SubclassedLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.kernel = None # Note the lack of initialization in init

    def build(self, input_shape): #Initialization occurs in build
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
            initializer="random_normal",
            trainable=True
        )

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel)

model_sub = keras.Sequential([
   SubclassedLayer(32, input_shape=(10,)),
   keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model_sub.save('sub_model.h5')

#Attempt to load the subclassed model
try:
    loaded_sub_model = keras.models.load_model('sub_model.h5')
    print("Subclassed model loaded successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading subclassed model: {e}")


# Subclassing with Registration, this is equivalent to the registration in example 2.
@tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable()
class SubclassedLayer_reg(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(SubclassedLayer_reg, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.kernel = None

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
            initializer="random_normal",
            trainable=True
        )
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel)

model_sub_reg = keras.Sequential([
    SubclassedLayer_reg(32, input_shape=(10,)),
   keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model_sub_reg.save('sub_model_reg.h5')

#Attempt to load the subclassed model
try:
    loaded_sub_model_reg = keras.models.load_model('sub_model_reg.h5')
    print("Subclassed registered model loaded successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading subclassed registered model: {e}")

```
*Commentary:* This example deals with the build logic present in subclassed layers. When model initialization logic depends on shape information known at build time, `load_model` can struggle if this logic isn't explicitly serializable. Again, explicit registration of the subclassed layers using `@tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable` is key to successful loading. While a model using a subclassed layer *can* be loaded, I would always recommend registering it using the decorator, for long-term robustness.

For further study, I recommend carefully reviewing the TensorFlow documentation related to model saving and loading, focusing specifically on the `tf.keras.models.save_model` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` functions. Explore the advanced sections detailing custom layer implementation and serialization practices. The official TensorFlow tutorials on these topics are also extremely helpful in providing practical guidance. Additionally, examining the source code of the `tf.keras` package, particularly the sections involving model serialization and deserialization, can yield deep insights into the underlying processes.
