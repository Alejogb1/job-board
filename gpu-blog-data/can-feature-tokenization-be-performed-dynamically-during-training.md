Tokenization, typically considered a preprocessing step in Natural Language Processing, *can* indeed be performed dynamically during training, although this introduces several considerations compared to static tokenization. My experience building a large-scale sentiment analysis system using PyTorch revealed this process's potential benefits and challenges. Dynamically tokenizing text during training means the tokenization operation isn't a distinct, upfront phase applied to the entire dataset. Instead, it is computed for each batch of data just before feeding it to the model. This contrasts with static tokenization where the entire corpus undergoes tokenization once, and the resulting token indices are used throughout training.

The primary driver behind considering dynamic tokenization is flexibility and data augmentation. Static tokenization, while efficient, inherently requires a predefined vocabulary. If your training data contains out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or if the underlying patterns of interest shift slightly over time (think evolving slang or technical jargon), a static vocabulary can result in a loss of information. In contrast, dynamic tokenization, coupled with subword tokenization algorithms, can potentially handle a more diverse range of text by constructing tokens at the character, subword, or word level as needed by the current training batch. This allows the model to learn representations even for unseen words, if they can be broken down into recognized sub-components.

Implementing dynamic tokenization usually relies on a combination of tokenization functions called within the data loading pipeline and potentially directly within the training loop. This requires a tokenizer that can be applied on individual strings or lists of strings, along with a mechanism for managing the vocabulary and potentially handling OOV tokens.

Here are three scenarios demonstrating dynamic tokenization, moving from basic to more sophisticated applications:

**1. Basic Character-Level Dynamic Tokenization:**

This example uses a very basic character-level tokenizer within a simple PyTorch data loader. This approach is highly adaptable but produces very long token sequences.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class TextDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts):
        self.texts = texts

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.texts)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.texts[idx]

def char_tokenize(text):
    # Simplified character tokenizer.
    return [ord(char) for char in text] # using unicode code point

def collate_fn(batch):
    # Tokenizes and pads batches to equal length.
    tokenized_batch = [char_tokenize(text) for text in batch]
    max_len = max(len(tokens) for tokens in tokenized_batch)
    padded_batch = [tokens + [0] * (max_len - len(tokens)) for tokens in tokenized_batch]
    return torch.tensor(padded_batch)

texts = ["hello world", "dynamic tokenization", "a short sentence"]
dataset = TextDataset(texts)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True, collate_fn=collate_fn)

for batch in dataloader:
    print("Tokenized batch:", batch) # Inspect the resulting batches.
    # Feed batch into the training process...

```
*Commentary:*  This code shows a very rudimentary dynamic tokenization where each character is converted to a number.  The `collate_fn` is crucial; it applies `char_tokenize` to each element of the batch. It also handles padding to ensure tensors have a consistent shape. Although simple, it highlights the core concept of applying the tokenizer within the batch loading procedure. It is critical to pad sequences for them to be processed as a batch by deep learning models.

**2. Dynamic Subword Tokenization using a Library:**

This next example utilizes the Hugging Face `tokenizers` library, which offers highly optimized subword tokenization algorithms such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE).

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from tokenizers import Tokenizer
from tokenizers.models import BPE
from tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import Whitespace
from tokenizers.trainers import BpeTrainer

class TextDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts):
        self.texts = texts

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.texts)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.texts[idx]


# Create a simple BPE tokenizer and train it
tokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE())
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = Whitespace()

trainer = BpeTrainer(vocab_size=100, min_frequency=1)
texts = ["hello world", "dynamic tokenization is awesome", "a short sentence", "tokenization using subwords", "world of tokens"]

tokenizer.train_from_iterator(texts, trainer=trainer)


def tokenize_function(texts):
    return tokenizer.encode_batch(texts)

def collate_fn(batch):
    # Dynamically tokenize and pad using the trained tokenizer
    encoded_batch = tokenize_function(batch)
    max_len = max(len(tokens.ids) for tokens in encoded_batch)
    padded_batch = [tokens.ids + [0] * (max_len - len(tokens.ids)) for tokens in encoded_batch]
    return torch.tensor(padded_batch)

dataset = TextDataset(texts)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True, collate_fn=collate_fn)

for batch in dataloader:
   print("Subword Tokenized batch:", batch) # Inspect the resulting batch
  # Feed the batch into the training process...

```
*Commentary:* This example shows a more realistic setup. We utilize a pre-trained tokenizer (though training data is from the dataset itself in this example) and use its encoding functions in the data loader.  `Whitespace()` is used to initially separate words. The important change is the use of `tokenizer.encode_batch()`. This takes a batch of raw text and converts it into token indices, ready to use by a model. We still use `collate_fn` to pad sequences to the same length. This example demonstrates how external tokenization libraries can be seamlessly integrated.

**3. Dynamically Adapting the Vocabulary:**

This final example showcases the potential for updating the vocabulary dynamically based on the observed training batches. This approach, though computationally expensive, can be beneficial in highly dynamic contexts where new words can be introduced frequently. This example is more conceptual because it is not performant for most use cases but highlights the idea.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from tokenizers import Tokenizer
from tokenizers.models import BPE
from tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import Whitespace
from tokenizers.trainers import BpeTrainer

class TextDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts):
        self.texts = texts

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.texts)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.texts[idx]

# Initial tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE())
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = Whitespace()
trainer = BpeTrainer(vocab_size=100, min_frequency=1)
texts = ["hello world", "initial tokenization", "a short sentence", "bpe is working"]
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(texts, trainer=trainer)

def collate_fn(batch, tokenizer):
    encoded_batch = tokenizer.encode_batch(batch)
    max_len = max(len(tokens.ids) for tokens in encoded_batch)
    padded_batch = [tokens.ids + [0] * (max_len - len(tokens.ids)) for tokens in encoded_batch]
    return torch.tensor(padded_batch)

texts = ["hello world", "dynamic tokenization", "a new phrase", "another new term", "new words", "bpe is great"]

dataset = TextDataset(texts)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)
dynamic_tokenizer = tokenizer # Start with the initial tokenizer
for batch_idx, batch in enumerate(dataloader):

    # Dynamic vocabulary update based on the current batch
    new_words = []
    for text in batch:
        for word in text.split():
             if word not in dynamic_tokenizer.get_vocab():
                 new_words.append(word)

    if new_words: # If there is new words, update the tokenizer.
        dynamic_tokenizer.train_from_iterator(new_words, trainer=trainer)
    tokenized_batch = collate_fn(batch, dynamic_tokenizer)

    print(f"Batch {batch_idx + 1} tokenized, Vocabulary size: {dynamic_tokenizer.get_vocab_size()}:", tokenized_batch)
    # Feed the batch into the training process...

```

*Commentary:* In this scenario, the `dynamic_tokenizer` is updated with any new words observed in the batch using a training process. Although inefficient (requiring retraining of the tokenization model on-the-fly), it showcases an important concept. We could also adapt to using specific vocabulary when a text contains very specific keywords for example. This approach could lead to a model that adapts faster to its target data but it also has serious scalability problems. It is crucial to control how often the vocabulary is updated and to use a lightweight retraining approach.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of this area I recommend exploring advanced Natural Language Processing textbooks that cover sequence models and data preprocessing techniques. Research papers in NLP conferences such as ACL and EMNLP often delve into more specific techniques for dynamic tokenization and adaptive vocabulary approaches. Additionally, examining documentation and examples from libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers and tokenizers packages can provide in-depth insights into practical implementations. Pay particular attention to the sections covering data loaders, tokenizers, and how to implement custom dataset classes. Finally, exploring blog posts and tutorials from experienced researchers in the field can provide concrete examples on how to approach the topic.

In conclusion, while static tokenization provides a stable and often efficient starting point, dynamic tokenization provides flexibility and adaptability for datasets that evolve, have significant out-of-vocabulary content, or need a dynamic vocabulary to effectively learn. The approach used depends on the specific problem context and computational constraints.
