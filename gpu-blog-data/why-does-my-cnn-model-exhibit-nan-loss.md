My experience debugging deep learning models has shown that NaN (Not a Number) losses during training, especially when using LeakyReLU activation, often point to a convergence problem arising from high learning rates or unstable gradients, rather than an inherent issue with LeakyReLU itself. Specifically, the negative slope in LeakyReLU, while designed to address the dying ReLU problem, can exacerbate gradient explosion issues if not carefully managed, resulting in extremely large or small weight updates that overflow numerical representations, leading to NaN.

To understand this, consider that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) computes gradients via backpropagation, using the chain rule. If the gradients become excessively large, or if intermediate values in computations grow beyond representable floating-point limits, subsequent calculations produce invalid numerical results. LeakyReLUâ€™s small negative slope, usually a fraction of the input value when negative, can still contribute to these problems under specific circumstances. While ReLU hard-zeros negative inputs, effectively stopping the gradient's backflow along that branch, LeakyReLU instead introduces a very small slope. If activations are already large (which may happen early in training or with poorly scaled data), this small slope can amplify the pre-existing numerical instability and thus contribute to NaN.

There are multiple mechanisms at play. First, a high learning rate, even with well-scaled input data and weights, can lead to large weight updates that push the model into an unstable region of the loss landscape. Second, a poor choice of weight initialization can create situations where activation values explode in magnitude during early training iterations. Third, when combined with an already steep learning rate, this initial instability can quickly propagate through the network. While the leaky part of LeakyReLu is meant to avoid completely vanishing gradients, it does not inherently solve the problem of large gradients. When these gradients become exceedingly large, floating-point arithmetic can be overwhelmed.

The core of the issue is not that LeakyReLU inherently causes NaN, but rather it exposes an existing vulnerability within the network's training regime. It's like a microscope magnifying an existing imperfection in the training setup. The 'leaky' aspect of LeakyReLU, while helpful for preventing neuron death in certain situations, doesn't provide immunity against fundamental convergence problems that might stem from learning rate choice or initialization schemes.

To illustrate this, let's consider some simplified examples:

**Example 1: High Learning Rate with Large Weights**

Imagine a single layer with a linear transformation followed by LeakyReLU. I've observed situations where the initial weights, perhaps due to a default initialization scheme, are relatively large. When combined with an aggressively large learning rate, the weight updates can become excessively large, resulting in large intermediate activation values. These activations, even with the small negative slope of LeakyReLU, result in ever-increasing gradients during backpropagation. This gradient explosion leads to computational overflows which propagate through the network and result in NaN losses.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Example model with a single linear layer and LeakyReLU
class TestModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(TestModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.leakyrelu = nn.LeakyReLU(0.01)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.leakyrelu(x)
        return x

# Initialize model, loss, and optimizer
model = TestModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1.0) # High learning rate

# Dummy Input
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
target_data = torch.randn(1, 1)

# Training Loop
for i in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(input_data)
    loss = criterion(output, target_data)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

```
The large learning rate here often causes immediate NaN loss. The weights quickly become inflated, as each step exacerbates the unstable situation due to the gradient.

**Example 2: Controlled Learning Rate with Appropriate Initialization**

Now, consider the same setup, but with a smaller learning rate and Xavier initialization, which tends to produce better-scaled initial weights. This reduces the likelihood of initial large weights and therefore minimizes the possibility of a fast runaway into numerical issues.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Example model with a single linear layer and LeakyReLU
class TestModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(TestModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.linear.weight)
        self.leakyrelu = nn.LeakyReLU(0.01)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.leakyrelu(x)
        return x


# Initialize model, loss, and optimizer
model = TestModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) # Smaller learning rate

# Dummy Input
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
target_data = torch.randn(1, 1)

# Training Loop
for i in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(input_data)
    loss = criterion(output, target_data)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Here, the smaller learning rate and appropriate initialization generally result in a more stable training process, and NaN values are not observed. The use of Xavier initialization helps keep the variance of activations consistent throughout the layers, preventing numerical issues.

**Example 3: Input Data Scaling**

Even with appropriate learning rates and initializations, poor input data scaling can cause similar problems. If features in the input data have drastically different ranges or are too large in magnitude, the network can learn large weights to compensate. This again leads to high activations, gradient explosions and eventually, NaN losses. To prevent this, it's important to scale or normalize the input data so that all values are in the same range.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Example model with a single linear layer and LeakyReLU
class TestModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(TestModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.linear.weight)
        self.leakyrelu = nn.LeakyReLU(0.01)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.leakyrelu(x)
        return x


# Initialize model, loss, and optimizer
model = TestModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Dummy Input with extremely high magnitude
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10) * 1000
target_data = torch.randn(1, 1)


# Training Loop
for i in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(input_data)
    loss = criterion(output, target_data)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

The presence of large input values will almost certainly lead to unstable training and NaN losses, despite using appropriate weight initialization and learning rates. This highlights the importance of proper data preprocessing to avoid such situations.

In summary, NaN losses when using LeakyReLU are rarely an intrinsic problem with the activation function itself. The issue is typically an exacerbation of underlying instability stemming from an inappropriate learning rate, weight initialization, or input data scaling. Addressing these underlying issues, such as decreasing the learning rate, adopting a suitable initialization strategy (e.g., Xavier, He initialization), and normalizing or scaling input data will likely resolve the NaN loss. Beyond those, other strategies may also be helpful, such as gradient clipping, which limits the magnitude of gradients during backpropagation. Moreover, it is crucial to verify that batch size is appropriate for the computation (especially in complex models), and the presence of other numerical instabilities.

For resource recommendations, I would suggest exploring standard texts and online tutorials focused on deep learning best practices. Look for discussions on: 1) network initialization strategies, 2) learning rate schedulers, 3) batch normalization, and 4) gradient clipping.  Additionally, examining numerical stability considerations with floating-point operations in machine learning frameworks is also highly valuable.
