Tensor mapping in PyTorch, fundamentally, hinges on understanding the underlying data representation and leveraging PyTorch's flexible indexing and reshaping capabilities.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects highlighted the critical need for efficient tensor manipulation, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and memory constraints.  Directly addressing the question of mapping requires a nuanced approach, considering both the desired transformation and the underlying tensor structure.  Simply put, we're not merely copying data; we're strategically rearranging it.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Tensor mapping in PyTorch is not a single operation but a family of techniques.  It encompasses reshaping, transposing, view creation, and advanced indexing, all used to alter the tensor's dimensions and the arrangement of elements.  This arrangement is crucial; it dictates how the tensor is interpreted by subsequent operations.  Consider a 3D tensor representing a batch of images (batch size, height, width). Mapping could involve rearranging the batch order, swapping height and width, or even flattening the tensor into a 1D array for certain linear operations.  The choice of mapping depends entirely on the intended application.

Crucially, understanding the distinction between creating a *view* and copying the tensor is paramount.  A view shares the underlying data with the original tensor, offering memory efficiency. Modifications to the view directly affect the original. Copying, conversely, creates an independent copy, allowing modifications without altering the original.  Misunderstanding this distinction can lead to subtle and difficult-to-debug errors.

Several approaches exist for mapping, ranging from simple indexing to leveraging advanced functionalities like `torch.gather` and `torch.scatter`. Simple indexing is appropriate for straightforward rearrangements, whereas `gather` and `scatter` are invaluable when dealing with complex mappings requiring non-sequential access patterns.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Reshaping and Transposing:**

```python
import torch

# Original tensor: a 3x4 matrix
tensor = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
print("Original Tensor:\n", tensor)

# Reshaping to a 2x6 matrix. Note that this is a view; it shares the data.
reshaped_tensor = tensor.reshape(2, 6)
print("\nReshaped Tensor:\n", reshaped_tensor)

# Transposing the original tensor. This also creates a view.
transposed_tensor = tensor.T
print("\nTransposed Tensor:\n", transposed_tensor)

# Modifying the reshaped tensor affects the original.
reshaped_tensor[0, 0] = 999
print("\nOriginal Tensor after reshaped_tensor modification:\n", tensor)

# Creating a copy prevents this.
copied_tensor = tensor.clone()
copied_tensor.reshape(2,6)[0,0] = 1000
print("\nOriginal Tensor after copied_tensor modification:\n", tensor)
print("\nCopied Tensor:\n",copied_tensor)
```

This example demonstrates basic reshaping and transposing.  Observe how changing `reshaped_tensor` impacts the original `tensor` because it's a view. The `clone()` function creates a deep copy, preventing unintended modifications.


**Example 2: Advanced Indexing:**

```python
import torch

# Original tensor
tensor = torch.arange(27).reshape(3, 3, 3)

# Selecting specific elements using advanced indexing
indices = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [2, 2, 0]])
selected_elements = tensor[indices[:, 0], indices[:, 1], indices[:, 2]]
print("Selected elements:\n", selected_elements)


# Mapping using boolean indexing to select elements greater than 10.
boolean_mask = tensor > 10
masked_tensor = tensor[boolean_mask]
print("\nMasked Tensor:\n", masked_tensor)
```

This illustrates the power of advanced indexing for selecting specific elements based on their indices or conditions.  This is crucial for tasks like filtering or selecting data based on criteria.  Note the flexibility â€“ we can select elements based on complex criteria, not just sequential ranges.


**Example 3: `torch.gather` and `torch.scatter`:**

```python
import torch

# Original tensor
tensor = torch.arange(10)

# Indices for gathering
gather_indices = torch.tensor([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])

# Gathering elements using gather_indices
gathered_tensor = torch.gather(tensor, 0, gather_indices)
print("Gathered Tensor:\n", gathered_tensor)


# Indices and values for scattering
scatter_indices = torch.tensor([0, 2, 4, 6, 8])
scatter_values = torch.tensor([100, 200, 300, 400, 500])

# Scattering values into the tensor
scattered_tensor = torch.scatter(torch.zeros(10), 0, scatter_indices, scatter_values)
print("\nScattered Tensor:\n", scattered_tensor)

```

This example demonstrates `torch.gather` for collecting elements based on provided indices and `torch.scatter` for placing values into specific locations defined by indices. These functions are powerful for intricate data rearrangements and are often essential in implementing custom layers or algorithms.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper dive, I suggest consulting the official PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on tensor manipulation and indexing.  PyTorch's tutorials and examples offer practical demonstrations of various techniques.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of linear algebra concepts, especially matrix operations, significantly aids in grasping the intricacies of tensor manipulation.  Finally, exploring advanced topics like sparse tensors and custom CUDA kernels can enhance performance and efficiency for specific applications. Remember to always profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks and choose appropriate mapping strategies.
