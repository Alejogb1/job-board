TensorShape objects in TensorFlow do not possess an `as_list()` method because their fundamental design prioritizes static shape information and avoids implicit conversions.  My experience working on large-scale TensorFlow deployments for image processing and natural language processing highlighted this design choice repeatedly.  The lack of `as_list()` directly stems from the need for efficient computation graph construction and the potential for runtime errors introduced by dynamically altering shape information during graph execution.


**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow's core strength lies in its ability to optimize computations by representing them as graphs before execution.  These graphs explicitly define the operations and data flow.  A `TensorShape` object, representing the dimensions of a tensor, is a critical component of this graph structure.  Providing an `as_list()` method would inherently involve a conversion processâ€”transforming a potentially symbolic representation of the shape into a Python list. This conversion would occur at runtime, potentially disrupting the graph optimization process.  The optimized graph, built based on static shape information, could become invalid if shapes were altered dynamically.


Furthermore, a `TensorShape` object can contain partially or fully unknown dimensions.  These are often represented symbolically (e.g., `None` in Python) reflecting dynamic shapes determined only during runtime.  Converting such a shape to a list would require resolving these symbolic dimensions, which isn't always possible or desirable.  Attempting to force this conversion could lead to exceptions or inaccurate representations of the tensor's actual shape.


Finally, the use of a dedicated `TensorShape` object improves type safety and allows for more robust error detection during the graph construction phase.  Direct manipulation of the shape as a Python list would bypass these checks, increasing the chances of encountering runtime errors related to shape mismatches between tensors and operations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1:  Working with known static shapes**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

shape = tf.TensorShape([28, 28, 1]) # known, static shape

# Accessing dimensions using conventional indexing.  This is the recommended approach
height = shape[0]
width = shape[1]
channels = shape[2]

print(f"Height: {height}, Width: {width}, Channels: {channels}")

# Attempting to directly convert to a list would be unnecessary and less efficient.
# No as_list() method is needed or provided.
```

This example demonstrates the typical way to access the dimensions of a `TensorShape` object with a completely known shape.  Direct indexing offers better performance and clarity compared to any hypothetical conversion to a list.  My experience in optimizing CNN architectures showcased the significance of this direct access.


**Example 2:  Handling partially known shapes:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

batch_size = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[], name="batch_size")
shape = tf.TensorShape([batch_size, 28, 28, 1]) # shape includes a placeholder

# Accessing the dimensions.  'batch_size' remains symbolic until runtime
print(shape)
print(shape.as_list()) # This WILL throw an error.

# To work with this shape, one should utilize Tensorflow's functionality that accepts symbolic shapes.
# Example below: defining a variable with a shape including the placeholder
variable = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([batch_size, 28, 28, 1]))

# The shape is used within the TF graph implicitly.
```

This example highlights a scenario where the shape contains a placeholder (`batch_size`), representing a dimension determined only at runtime.  Attempting to use `as_list()` would result in an error, as the symbolic dimension cannot be directly converted to a numeric value.  In such situations, my projects relied on TensorFlow's inherent ability to handle symbolic shapes during graph construction and execution.


**Example 3: Shape inference and dynamic shapes:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 28, 28, 1]) #dynamic batch size
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_tensor)

#Inferring shape after applying a layer
output_shape = conv_layer.shape

#Access shape components (Dimension values will be symbolic initially)
print(output_shape)
# Accessing using output_shape[0].value will also throw an error.
#Correct approach: wait until runtime with a session or use tf.shape()

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    input_data = np.random.rand(10, 28, 28, 1)
    output_shape_val = sess.run(output_shape, feed_dict={input_tensor: input_data})
    print(output_shape_val)
    # Now output_shape_val is a concrete shape and can be manipulated as needed.

```

This showcases how shapes evolve within a computation graph.  Initially, the shape of `conv_layer` is partially known.  Trying to use `as_list()` prematurely would be incorrect.  The preferred method is to either use the shape information implicitly within TensorFlow operations or to resolve the shape after executing the graph with session.run() or equivalent methods within tf.function.  This reflects my practical experience in building complex deep learning models.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation,  particularly sections on tensor shapes, graph construction, and shape inference.  A comprehensive guide on TensorFlow fundamentals, covering the intricacies of tensor manipulation and graph optimization.  Lastly, a well-structured book on deep learning with TensorFlow is beneficial for in-depth understanding.
