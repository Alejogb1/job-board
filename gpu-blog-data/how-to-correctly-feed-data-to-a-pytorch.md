The core challenge in feeding data to a PyTorch Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) lies in understanding the sequence nature of the data and aligning it with the RNN's expectation of a three-dimensional tensor: (sequence length, batch size, input dimension).  My experience working on time series forecasting and natural language processing projects highlighted this repeatedly. Misunderstanding this fundamental requirement often leads to subtle, difficult-to-debug errors.  I've encountered numerous instances where seemingly correct code failed due to incorrect data shaping.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch RNNs process sequential data.  Each element in the sequence contributes to the hidden state, which is updated iteratively.  The input tensor needs to reflect this sequential structure.  The three dimensions are crucial:

* **Sequence Length:** This represents the number of time steps or elements in a single sequence. For example, in text processing, this would be the number of words in a sentence; in time series forecasting, this is the number of time points in a single observation.

* **Batch Size:** This is the number of independent sequences processed simultaneously.  Using a batch size greater than one significantly improves training efficiency by leveraging vectorization.

* **Input Dimension:** This corresponds to the dimensionality of a single element in the sequence.  For a text sequence represented by word embeddings, this would be the embedding dimension. In a time series with multiple features (e.g., temperature, humidity), this would be the number of features.

Failing to correctly represent these dimensions often results in shape mismatches, leading to runtime errors. PyTorch's error messages, while helpful, can sometimes obscure the underlying data shaping issue.  The key is to meticulously organize your data before feeding it to the RNN.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Text Classification**

This example demonstrates feeding word embeddings to an RNN for text classification.  Assume we have pre-trained word embeddings.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample data (replace with your actual data loading)
word_embeddings = torch.randn(10, 50) # 10 words, 50-dimensional embeddings
sequences = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]] # Indices of words in each sentence

# Pad sequences to ensure uniform length
max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = [seq + [0] * (max_len - len(seq)) for seq in sequences] # Pad with 0 (representing padding token)


# Convert to tensor
input_tensor = torch.LongTensor(padded_sequences)
input_tensor = torch.nn.functional.embedding(input_tensor, word_embeddings)
input_tensor = input_tensor.transpose(0, 1) # Transpose for (seq_len, batch_size, embedding_dim)


# Define RNN model
class TextClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super(TextClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])  # Take the last hidden state
        return out

# Initialize model, optimizer, etc.
model = TextClassifier(50, 100, 2) # Example: 2 classes
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop (omitted for brevity)

```

Commentary:  Note the crucial `transpose` operation.  Initially, the tensor shape is (batch_size, seq_len, embedding_dim), but the RNN expects (seq_len, batch_size, embedding_dim). The padding ensures that all sequences are of the same length before being processed by the embedding layer.

**Example 2: Time Series Forecasting**

This example focuses on a multivariate time series.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample data (replace with your actual data loading)
data = torch.randn(100, 3)  # 100 time steps, 3 features

# Reshape for RNN input
seq_length = 20
batch_size = 5
input_tensor = data[:seq_length*batch_size].reshape(batch_size, seq_length, 3).contiguous()

# Define RNN model
class TimeSeriesForecaster(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(TimeSeriesForecaster, self).__init__()
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out

# Initialize model, optimizer etc.
model = TimeSeriesForecaster(3, 50, 1) # Example: predicting a single value
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop (omitted for brevity)
```

Commentary: The crucial step is reshaping the input data to the correct dimensions.  `contiguous()` ensures that the data is stored contiguously in memory, which is often necessary for efficient GPU processing.  This example utilizes an LSTM, a type of RNN, demonstrating adaptability.

**Example 3:  Handling Variable-Length Sequences (using packing)**

This example showcases how to efficiently handle sequences of varying lengths using PyTorch's `pack_padded_sequence` and `pad_packed_sequence` functions.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.utils.rnn as rnn_utils

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
sequences = [torch.randn(10, 3), torch.randn(15, 3), torch.randn(7, 3)] # Variable length sequences
lengths = torch.tensor([len(seq) for seq in sequences])

# Pad sequences (necessary for batching)
max_len = max(lengths)
padded_sequences = [torch.cat((seq, torch.zeros((max_len - len(seq), 3)))) for seq in sequences]
padded_tensor = torch.stack(padded_sequences)

# Pack the sequences
packed_input = rnn_utils.pack_padded_sequence(padded_tensor, lengths, batch_first=True, enforce_sorted=False)

# Define RNN model (similar to previous examples)
class VariableLengthRNN(nn.Module):
  # ... (Define your RNN model here) ...

# Pass the packed sequences to the RNN
output, hidden = model(packed_input)

# Unpack the output
output, _ = rnn_utils.pad_packed_sequence(output, batch_first=True)

```

Commentary:  This approach is significantly more efficient than padding all sequences to the maximum length, especially with highly variable sequence lengths.  `enforce_sorted=False` allows for sequences of varying lengths without requiring pre-sorting.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation provides comprehensive tutorials and examples on RNNs.  Exploring the documentation for `nn.RNN`, `nn.LSTM`, `nn.GRU`, `pack_padded_sequence`, and `pad_packed_sequence` is essential.  Furthermore, delve into relevant textbooks on deep learning focusing on sequential models.  Understanding the fundamentals of RNN architectures and their mathematical underpinnings is crucial for effective data handling.  Finally, examining code repositories associated with RNN-based projects, paying close attention to data preprocessing and input preparation, will provide practical insights.
