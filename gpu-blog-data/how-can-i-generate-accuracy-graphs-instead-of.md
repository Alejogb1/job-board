TensorBoard's default scalar visualization, while useful for monitoring training progress, often lacks the granularity needed to assess model accuracy across diverse epochs or hyperparameter configurations.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted this limitation repeatedly.  Directly generating accuracy *graphs* within TensorBoard, rather than relying on the scattered point representation of the scalar summary, necessitates a shift in data logging strategy. This involves calculating and summarizing accuracy metrics in a manner conducive to line graph visualization.

The core problem stems from TensorBoard's interpretation of scalar data.  Each scalar summary entry represents a single data point at a specific step.  To create a smooth accuracy graph, we need to provide TensorBoard with a consistent series of data points representing average accuracy across an epoch, or other meaningful aggregation period.  A simple average of individual batch accuracies within an epoch will often suffice.  More sophisticated approaches might involve weighted averages to account for batch size variations or incorporate techniques like exponential moving averages for smoothing.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The solution involves modifying the training loop to calculate and log epoch-level (or other interval-level) accuracy metrics using TensorFlow's `tf.summary` API.  Instead of logging accuracy after every batch, we accumulate batch-level accuracies within each epoch and then log the average accuracy at the end of the epoch.  This aggregated value is then interpreted by TensorBoard as a single data point for that epoch, allowing for line graph generation.  Furthermore, for multi-metric visualizations (e.g., accuracy and loss), distinct summary writers should be employed to avoid data mixing within a single graph.

The key modifications involve:

* **Accumulating Metrics:** During each epoch, accumulate individual batch accuracy values within a list or variable.
* **Averaging Metrics:** Calculate the average accuracy after completing an epoch.  Consider using weighted averages if batch sizes fluctuate.
* **Logging Epoch-Level Metrics:** Log the calculated average accuracy using `tf.summary.scalar` with a clear tag (e.g., "epoch_accuracy").  The step value in this function should increment for each epoch.
* **Multiple Summary Writers:** Use separate `tf.summary.create_file_writer` instances for different metrics to ensure they're plotted on independent graphs.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Epoch Accuracy Logging**

This example demonstrates a simple approach using a `list` to accumulate batch-level accuracies.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... other code (model definition, data loading, etc.) ...

writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/accuracy')

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    epoch_accuracies = []
    for batch in training_data:
        # ... training step (forward pass, loss calculation, backpropagation) ...
        batch_accuracy = calculate_batch_accuracy(model, batch) # Fictional function
        epoch_accuracies.append(batch_accuracy)

    average_epoch_accuracy = sum(epoch_accuracies) / len(epoch_accuracies)

    with writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('epoch_accuracy', average_epoch_accuracy, step=epoch)
```

**Example 2: Weighted Average Epoch Accuracy**

This improves the basic example by incorporating weighted averaging based on batch size.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... other code ...

writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/accuracy')

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    total_correct = 0
    total_samples = 0
    for batch in training_data:
        batch_size = len(batch[0]) # Assuming batch is a tuple (features, labels)
        # ... training step ...
        batch_correct = calculate_batch_correct(model, batch) # Fictional function
        total_correct += batch_correct
        total_samples += batch_size

    average_epoch_accuracy = total_correct / total_samples

    with writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('epoch_accuracy', average_epoch_accuracy, step=epoch)
```


**Example 3: Multiple Metrics with Separate Writers**

This example showcases logging both accuracy and loss, each with its own graph in TensorBoard.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... other code ...

accuracy_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/accuracy')
loss_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/loss')

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    epoch_accuracies = []
    epoch_losses = []
    for batch in training_data:
        # ... training step ...
        batch_accuracy = calculate_batch_accuracy(model, batch)
        batch_loss = calculate_batch_loss(model, batch) # Fictional function
        epoch_accuracies.append(batch_accuracy)
        epoch_losses.append(batch_loss)

    average_epoch_accuracy = sum(epoch_accuracies) / len(epoch_accuracies)
    average_epoch_loss = sum(epoch_losses) / len(epoch_losses)


    with accuracy_writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('epoch_accuracy', average_epoch_accuracy, step=epoch)

    with loss_writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('epoch_loss', average_epoch_loss, step=epoch)
```

These examples assume the existence of placeholder functions `calculate_batch_accuracy` and `calculate_batch_loss` which would need to be implemented based on the specific model and task.  Remember to replace placeholders like `num_epochs` and `training_data` with your actual values.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.summary` and TensorBoard usage provides detailed explanations and advanced techniques.  Furthermore, studying examples in TensorFlow tutorials focused on training and evaluating models will solidify the understanding of integrating these logging practices into a complete workflow.  Finally, consulting specialized literature on model evaluation and performance metrics can help you choose more appropriate metrics and aggregation strategies depending on your problem domain and specific needs.  Careful consideration of  evaluation metrics beyond simple accuracy, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, and their integration into TensorBoard visualizations, should be considered for a more comprehensive evaluation.
