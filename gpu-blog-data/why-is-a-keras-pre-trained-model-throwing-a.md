The "not defined" error encountered when feeding input variables to a loaded Keras pre-trained model, specifically within a `feed_dict` context, almost invariably stems from a mismatch between the model's expected input tensor names and the names used within the `feed_dict`.  This issue frequently arises when employing TensorFlow's lower-level APIs alongside Keras, particularly when loading models saved with older TensorFlow versions or those saved without explicit naming conventions for input tensors.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across several large-scale image recognition projects,  consistent oversight in this area has been the primary culprit.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, while providing a high-level interface, ultimately relies on TensorFlow (or other backends) for computation.  When you load a pre-trained model using `load_model()`, the model's internal structure, including the names of input and output tensors, is reconstructed.  However, this reconstruction might not perfectly mirror the original model's definition if the original saving process lacked explicit tensor naming or used now-deprecated saving methods.  The `feed_dict` mechanism expects precise mapping between the names provided in the dictionary and the corresponding tensor names within the computational graph.  If these names diverge – even slightly – the interpreter cannot locate the intended input tensors, resulting in the "not defined" error.

The issue is further compounded if the model was originally trained and saved using a different TensorFlow version.  TensorFlow's internal representation of graphs evolved across versions, leading to potential incompatibilities.  For instance, a model saved using TensorFlow 1.x might have implicit input tensor naming conventions that differ significantly from TensorFlow 2.x, leading to the error when loaded into a 2.x environment.  Similarly, the use of different Keras versions (specifically those with different TensorFlow backend versions) can contribute to this problem.

Therefore, the key to resolving the error lies in correctly identifying and using the names of the input tensors as they exist within the loaded model.  Inspecting the model's structure after loading is crucial to avoid this problem.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect `feed_dict` Usage**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (Model loading code, assume 'model' is the loaded Keras model) ...

# INCORRECT: Assumes input tensor is named 'input'
input_data = {'input': np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])}
try:
    output = model.predict(x=input_data)
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # KeyError will be raised if 'input' isn't the correct name


```

This example demonstrates a typical scenario. The code assumes the input tensor is named 'input'. If the actual input tensor name within the loaded model is different (e.g., 'input_1', 'image_input'),  a `KeyError` will be raised because `feed_dict` cannot find a tensor matching the key 'input'.  The error might be masked by using `model.predict` directly as it typically handles tensor naming internally for easier usage, but this will break if you use lower level functions.



**Example 2: Correcting `feed_dict` with Model Inspection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... (Model loading code) ...

# Inspect the model's input layer to get the correct tensor name
input_layer_name = model.input.name.split(':')[0] #removes the ':0' suffix often present

input_data = {input_layer_name: np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])}

# Now feed_dict should work correctly
output = tf.compat.v1.Session().run(model.output, feed_dict=input_data) # using TF1's session

print(output)
```

This improved example explicitly determines the correct input tensor name from the loaded model using `model.input.name`. This ensures that the key in the `feed_dict` perfectly matches the name expected by the TensorFlow graph. The usage of `tf.compat.v1.Session().run` shows a way to leverage the `feed_dict` functionality when operating in TF2 environment.


**Example 3: Handling Multiple Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# ... (Model loading code) ...

# Assume model has two inputs: 'image_input' and 'text_input'
input_layer_names = [layer.name.split(':')[0] for layer in model.inputs]
image_input_data = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3)
text_input_data = np.random.rand(1, 100)

input_data = {input_layer_names[0]: image_input_data, input_layer_names[1]: text_input_data}

# Make prediction.  Error handling is crucial here.
try:
    output = tf.compat.v1.Session().run(model.output, feed_dict=input_data)
    print(output)
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"Error: Incorrect input name, check your model.inputs: {e}")
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error: Data shape mismatch: {e}")

```

This example demonstrates how to handle models with multiple input tensors.  Iterating through `model.inputs` allows the code to correctly identify and map each input tensor to its corresponding data. Note the inclusion of more robust error handling, checking for both name mismatches and potential shape inconsistencies.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections detailing model saving, loading, and the use of lower-level APIs like `tf.compat.v1.Session`.  Comprehensive Keras documentation covering input handling and model architecture inspection.  A good textbook on deep learning fundamentals will aid in understanding the underlying graph structures and tensor operations.  Finally, consulting relevant Stack Overflow threads (while avoiding direct link provision as requested) can provide practical insights on troubleshooting similar errors.  Thoroughly reviewing the error messages provided by the interpreter is crucial to identify the exact nature of the problem.  Understanding the structure of the model and the TensorFlow graph it represents are key to debugging these sorts of issues.
