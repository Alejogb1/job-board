Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implementations, particularly those designed for sequence-based tasks like drawing classification, frequently encounter compatibility issues when migrating from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2. This incompatibility stems largely from the significant architectural changes introduced in TensorFlow 2, specifically the removal of graph execution in favor of eager execution and substantial modifications to the Keras API. These changes directly impact how RNN layers are handled, their API interactions, and the underlying computation mechanisms.

In my experience migrating a sketchbook recognition system from TF 1.15 to TF 2.6, I directly encountered this very problem. The core issue wasn’t faulty logic but rather the fundamental difference in how TF 1.x and TF 2 handle RNN constructs. The TF 1.x code, reliant on session-based graph execution and older Keras APIs, often fails to execute correctly, generating a mix of obscure error messages and unexpected behavior when ported directly to TF 2. The transition requires a re-evaluation of how RNNs are implemented, especially concerning input shape expectations, layer instantiation, and the overall training loop.

In TF 1.x, the process of building an RNN model primarily revolved around defining a static computation graph. Placeholders for input data were created, and the entire model structure, including RNN layers, was represented as nodes within this graph. Sessions were then used to execute this graph, feeding data through placeholders and generating outputs. This approach allowed for a relatively simple, although rigid, method of defining the network structure. The use of low-level APIs like `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` was common, along with the older Keras API which had differences compared to the TF 2 implementation.

In contrast, TensorFlow 2 embraces eager execution, where operations are performed immediately. This provides more intuitive debugging and allows for dynamic model definition. Consequently, the old mechanisms for building RNNs often become incompatible. Key areas of concern include how the RNN layers are defined, the input data shapes, and the overall training structure. Specifically, the removal of `tf.contrib` where numerous RNN building blocks resided, such as `tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell`, means direct replacement is needed with their TF 2 equivalents. Furthermore, the Keras API underwent significant revisions; methods for defining and utilizing RNN layers changed. The `tf.keras.layers.LSTM` for instance, now has different expectations for input shapes and how to return states compared to the TF 1.x equivalent. Moreover, constructs such as ‘feed_dict’ used with session based computation is completely removed in TF 2, needing refactoring using TF.data or in memory tensors with the updated model training loop.

To illustrate these differences, let's examine a few code examples.

**Example 1: TF 1.x RNN Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior() # Disable TF 2 behavior

# Define parameters
num_units = 128
num_classes = 10 # Number of classes for drawing categories
sequence_length = 20 # Length of input drawing sequence
input_dim = 2  # (x,y) coordinates

# Input placeholder
X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, sequence_length, input_dim])

# RNN cell
lstm_cell = tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell(num_units)

# Process input
outputs, final_state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(lstm_cell, X, dtype=tf.float32)

# Output projection (simplified for clarity)
output_layer = tf.layers.dense(outputs[:, -1, :], num_classes)

# Placeholder for target classes
Y = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [None])

# Loss and training steps would follow this for actual training.
# Note: No explicit model definition in TF 1.x
```

This code snippet represents a simplified TF 1.x RNN implementation.  Notice the usage of `tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell` and `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn`. The input `X` is a placeholder that expects a shape of `[None, sequence_length, input_dim]`, representing batches of sequences with arbitrary batch size. The last operation uses `tf.layers.dense` which is a TF 1.x specific way to implement a fully connected layer. This code will not work directly in TF 2. It relies on deprecated functions from `tf.contrib` and also TF 1.x session based execution, requiring a full rewrite when transitioning to TF 2.

**Example 2: TF 2.x Equivalent RNN Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define parameters
num_units = 128
num_classes = 10
sequence_length = 20
input_dim = 2

# Define the model as a Keras Model.
class DrawingClassifier(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, num_units, num_classes):
    super(DrawingClassifier, self).__init__()
    self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(num_units)
    self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.lstm(inputs)
    x = self.dense(x)
    return x

model = DrawingClassifier(num_units, num_classes)
# Create dummy input tensor
X = tf.random.normal((32, sequence_length, input_dim))

# Passing the random data to the model to output logits
logits = model(X)

# Define loss and optimizer as required
# No placeholders used, use tf.data or in memory tensors for data input

```

This code snippet shows the corresponding TF 2.x implementation. It uses the Keras API to define the model.  `tf.keras.layers.LSTM` replaces `tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell`, and the model is implemented as a `tf.keras.Model` class, clearly defining a `call` method.  There's no need for placeholders; data is passed to the model directly as a tensor.  The data input can be managed through TF.data or directly using tensors. The training loop should also be updated to use Keras `model.fit`, `model.compile`, and `model.evaluate`, leveraging the eager execution paradigm of TF 2.

**Example 3: TF 1.x Training Loop (simplified)**

```python
# TF 1.x session based training loop. (Not executable as is, needs placeholders, loss function etc.)
'''
with tf.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
  for epoch in range(num_epochs):
      for batch_X, batch_Y in training_batches:
          _, loss_val = sess.run([train_op, loss], feed_dict={X: batch_X, Y: batch_Y})
          #Print and store loss data
'''
```

This illustrates the basic structure of training using `tf.Session` and `feed_dict`. The data is passed through placeholders, and the graph is executed.  This approach is not compatible with TF 2's eager execution model.

The primary reason for the code failure lies in that fundamental incompatibility between static graphs and eager execution. Functions like `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` were primarily built to work with graph-based computation, whereas TF 2's `tf.keras.layers.LSTM` is designed for dynamic execution. The old methods of passing data through the computation graph using placeholders and `feed_dict` is not used. It is critical to use Tensor based data inputs and TF.data pipeline. Furthermore, the training approach has to be completely updated to work with the TF 2 framework.

**Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guides on migrating from TF 1.x to TF 2, including dedicated sections on RNNs and Keras usage.
*   TensorFlow tutorials on the official website offer practical examples of building and training various types of neural networks, which can help to understand TF 2 workflows.
*   Books dedicated to TensorFlow 2 often provide in-depth explanations of the new API, its architecture, and migration strategies, such as "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet, a core contributor to Keras and TensorFlow.
*   Numerous online tutorials provide hands-on experience with TF 2, which offer practical demonstrations of how to use the new Keras API and its corresponding functionalities for RNN implementation.

In summary, migrating RNN code from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2 requires a substantial shift in thinking. The key lies in understanding the differences between graph and eager execution, adopting the updated Keras API, and appropriately managing input data within the new framework. While the transition can be challenging, the improved flexibility and debuggability of TensorFlow 2 makes the effort worthwhile. The code examples provided illustrate these core differences, highlighting the need for a complete rewrite and rethinking of existing RNN implementations for proper execution in the TF 2 environment. It’s less about “fixing” and more about rebuilding within a significantly revised environment.
