Efficiently updating Matplotlib subplots without a full figure redraw is crucial for creating responsive and performant visualizations, especially in applications involving real-time data or interactive elements.  My experience developing a high-frequency trading visualization tool highlighted the performance bottlenecks associated with repeatedly redrawing the entire figure.  The key is understanding Matplotlib's internal drawing mechanism and leveraging its capabilities for targeted updates.  This involves directly manipulating the underlying Artists and leveraging the `draw_artist` method of the Axes object.  Failing to do so results in significant performance degradation, particularly with numerous subplots or complex plots.


**1. Clear Explanation**

Matplotlib's drawing process involves multiple stages.  The naive approach of simply calling `plt.plot()` or similar within a loop forces a complete redraw each iteration. This redraw encompasses every artist within the figure, regardless of whether they've been modified.  For dynamic updates, this is highly inefficient.  The solution lies in directly manipulating the artists associated with individual subplots.  This means accessing the specific line objects, patches, text objects etc., within the Axes object corresponding to the subplot you wish to update.  These objects are then modified directly (e.g., changing their data) and finally, only the changed artist(s) and their associated elements are redrawn using the `draw_artist` method.  This avoids the expensive global redraw.  Additionally, using `canvas.flush_events()` helps ensure that updates are immediately reflected, and might be necessary depending on your backend and application's event loop.

The process consists of the following steps:

1. **Access the relevant Axes object:**  Obtain a reference to the specific subplot's Axes using the `axes` attribute of the figure or by indexing into the axes array returned by `plt.subplots()`.
2. **Locate the target artist(s):** Identify the artist(s) within the Axes that need updating (e.g., a `Line2D` object for a line plot). This might involve iterating through the Axes' children if necessary.
3. **Modify artist properties:** Update the data or other properties of the artist(s) directly.  For example, change the `Line2D` object's `data` attribute to reflect the new data points.
4. **Redraw the artist(s):** Use the `draw_artist` method of the Axes object to redraw only the modified artist(s).
5. **Flush events (optional):** Call `canvas.flush_events()` to force immediate rendering, especially in interactive environments.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**


**Example 1: Updating a line plot**

This example demonstrates updating a single line plot within a subplot.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x = np.arange(0, 10)
y = np.sin(x)
line, = ax.plot(x, y)  # Note the comma to unpack the result into line
fig.canvas.draw() #Initial draw

for i in range(10, 20):
    y = np.sin(np.arange(0, i)) # New data
    line.set_data(np.arange(0,i), y) #Update the line's data
    ax.set_xlim(0, i) #Update xlim if needed
    ax.draw_artist(line)  # Redraw only the line
    fig.canvas.flush_events()
    fig.canvas.draw_idle() # Alternative, often smoother
    plt.pause(0.1)

plt.show()
```

This code avoids redrawing the entire figure in each iteration of the loop.  The `set_data` method efficiently updates the line's data without requiring a full redraw. The `draw_artist` focuses the redraw on the modified line object itself.  `plt.pause` ensures a smooth animation, though the precise method for controlling frame rate will depend on the specific backend in use.  The `flush_events` is critical to display updates smoothly.

**Example 2: Updating multiple lines in different subplots**

This example extends the approach to multiple lines across different subplots.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1)
x = np.arange(0, 10)
lines = [axes[0].plot(x, np.sin(x))[0], axes[1].plot(x, np.cos(x))[0]]
fig.canvas.draw()

for i in range(10, 20):
    for ax, line in zip(axes, lines):
        if line == lines[0]:
            line.set_data(np.arange(0,i), np.sin(np.arange(0, i)))
        else:
            line.set_data(np.arange(0,i), np.cos(np.arange(0, i)))
        ax.set_xlim(0, i)
        ax.draw_artist(line)
        ax.relim() #Ensure limits are updated.
        ax.autoscale_view() #Auto-scale axes.
    fig.canvas.flush_events()
    fig.canvas.draw_idle()
    plt.pause(0.1)

plt.show()

```

Here, we iterate through each subplot's Axes and its corresponding line, updating and redrawing each individually.   The crucial addition is the use of `relim()` and `autoscale_view()` after updating the data to readjust the axes limits correctly.  Forgetting this would lead to misaligned or incomplete graphs.

**Example 3: Updating scatter plots with added points**

This example focuses on updating scatter plots efficiently by adding new points incrementally.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x = np.random.rand(10)
y = np.random.rand(10)
scatter = ax.scatter(x, y)
fig.canvas.draw()

for i in range(10):
    new_x = np.random.rand(1)
    new_y = np.random.rand(1)
    scatter.set_offsets(np.concatenate((scatter.get_offsets(), np.c_[new_x, new_y])))
    ax.draw_artist(scatter)
    fig.canvas.flush_events()
    fig.canvas.draw_idle()
    plt.pause(0.1)

plt.show()
```

In this example, instead of replacing the entire scatter plot dataset, we append new points to the existing data and efficiently update the `offsets` attribute of the `scatter` artist.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The Matplotlib documentation itself is the most comprehensive resource.  A deeper understanding of object-oriented programming principles in Python is invaluable for mastering the intricacies of Matplotlib's artist-based manipulation.  Exploring advanced plotting libraries built upon Matplotlib, such as Seaborn, can provide further insights into optimization techniques.  Finally, understanding the underlying graphics pipeline and the differences between Matplotlib backends (e.g., TkAgg, Qt5Agg) can greatly improve troubleshooting and fine-tuning performance.
