The unique identifier for a compiled CUDA binary, often referred to as a “cubin” or PTX assembly, is not a singular, universally accessible value in the way one might expect from a typical compiled executable. Rather, it's derived from a combination of intrinsic properties of the compiled code and the target hardware, making its identification somewhat nuanced and dependent on the tooling utilized. While there isn't a single "hash" accessible directly via a CUDA API call, the concept of unique identification hinges on the specific compute capabilities targeted during compilation, the generated instruction set, and often, implicitly, the source code itself.

My experience building and maintaining high-performance CUDA applications has consistently highlighted the importance of understanding how CUDA binaries are identified and differentiated. In my work, I've needed to manage different versions of kernel code, adapt to varying hardware architectures, and ensure compatibility across a distributed computing environment. This necessity has led me to investigate the mechanisms underlying CUDA binary identification.

Fundamentally, the lack of a concrete, readily queryable ID stems from the just-in-time (JIT) compilation model employed by the CUDA runtime. When a CUDA program is executed, the PTX assembly, the portable intermediate representation, or a cubin directly, is not immediately executed on the GPU. Instead, the driver examines the target device's compute capability and compiles the PTX (or the cubin) into machine code specific to that architecture. This dynamic compilation process introduces an important consideration: the same PTX or cubin file, compiled from identical source code, can yield drastically different machine code depending on the GPU it targets.

Therefore, if an application is to reliably identify a binary, it must do so based on features available *before* JIT compilation, primarily from the PTX or cubin file, and not on any runtime identifier. These identifying characteristics are:

1. **Compute Capability:** The CUDA compute capability dictates the feature set and instruction set architecture supported by a given GPU. This is the most crucial distinction. A binary compiled for compute capability 7.0 will generally not function correctly on a device supporting only 6.1. This information is embedded within the PTX or cubin, and it is often directly queryable via NVIDIA's tools.

2. **Instruction Set (PTX/SASS):** The specific instruction set targeted, whether PTX assembly or the compiled SASS (Shader Assembly), provides another level of granularity. Although the source code might be the same, differences in compiler optimization, driver versions, or compute capability settings can lead to distinct PTX or SASS code. These code differences form a unique "fingerprint."

3. **Source Code:** While not explicit in the binary itself, the source code is the foundation of any CUDA binary. While there can be cases where different source produces the same PTX, in practical development scenarios, a change in source will very often result in a change in the generated PTX/cubin and the resultant compiled machine code.

To illustrate, consider the following scenarios:

**Example 1: Inspecting Compute Capability via `nvcc`**

The following command illustrates how the compute capability setting during compilation directly impacts the generation of the cubin. If we compile the same CUDA source file targeting two different compute capabilities, the generated cubins will be unique based on this distinction.

```bash
# Assuming 'my_kernel.cu' exists
# Compile for compute capability 7.0
nvcc -arch=sm_70 -cubin my_kernel.cu -o my_kernel_sm70.cubin

# Compile for compute capability 8.0
nvcc -arch=sm_80 -cubin my_kernel.cu -o my_kernel_sm80.cubin
```

In this example, `my_kernel_sm70.cubin` and `my_kernel_sm80.cubin` would represent distinct binaries due to the differing target architectures (`sm_70` for compute capability 7.0 and `sm_80` for compute capability 8.0). This is the most fundamental aspect of CUDA binary identification. If we were to attempt to load `my_kernel_sm70.cubin` onto a device only supporting sm_80, an error would likely result, highlighting the critical role of this identifier.

**Example 2: Extracting PTX Assembly Using `cuobjdump`**

The `cuobjdump` tool allows for inspection of the PTX assembly generated from a compiled CUDA program or directly from a cubin. Comparing the disassembled output of a given kernel with minor source code modification demonstrates the changes in the PTX representation.

```bash
# Compile the source code and produce PTX
nvcc -arch=sm_70 --ptx my_kernel.cu -o my_kernel.ptx

# Display the PTX content
cuobjdump my_kernel.ptx

# Example Source Code change
# my_kernel.cu (modified)

__global__ void myKernel(float *data, int size){
   int id = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
   if(id < size){
     data[id] = data[id] * 2.0f; // Modification - multiply by 2.0f
   }
}
```
After modifying the kernel code to include multiplying by `2.0f`, and recompiling, the resulting `.ptx` file would differ from the original. We can then compare the disassembled output from both PTX files. This difference in the PTX output can be used as an identifier. Although not a compact hash, the textual representation can be used to distinguish between compiled variants of the same source.

**Example 3: Versioning PTX using embedded strings**

To better manage and differentiate between versions of PTX, one can embed strings into the code via pragmas. These strings will also exist in the PTX (or SASS) and can be extracted to perform runtime binary identification, although I should note that this doesn't solve a "missing hash" problem, but rather adds additional metadata to help differentiate PTX versions.

```cpp
// my_kernel.cu
#pragma stringify
const char *kernel_version_string = "Version 1.0";
#pragma endstringify

__global__ void myKernel(float *data, int size){
    //... kernel implementation ...
}
```
After compiling this code to PTX or cubin, the embedded version string can be searched for using `cuobjdump` or by programmatically parsing the PTX or cubin to allow for application-specific version tracking of the binaries.

In practice, to perform reliable CUDA binary identification, one must combine several approaches. A robust solution usually involves:

1.  **Storing Target Compute Capability**: During compilation, capture the targeted compute capability (-arch) setting. Store this information alongside the compiled binary.

2.  **Hashing PTX/Cubins**: Generate a cryptographic hash (SHA256, for example) of the PTX/cubin content. This allows detecting changes to either the PTX assembly or machine code (depending on if you hash PTX or cubin). When dealing with cubins, it is important to account for platform specific differences in the output, which can cause different output even with the same architecture, source code, and toolchain.

3.  **Embedding Versioning Information**: As in example 3, embed meaningful versioning strings via pragmas directly into the kernel source for easier identification. This strategy also allows you to store other metadata that might be needed.

4. **Using a Metadata System**: The best approach is often to not identify the kernel "hash" itself, but to use a database or external file which stores the build configuration, source control information and associated hashes of both cubins and PTX. Such a system can allow for a more complete identification and reproduceability of builds.

While a single, readily available identifier is absent within CUDA itself, by combining these techniques, developers can create a robust system for identifying and managing their CUDA binaries effectively. This comprehensive method has served me well during large CUDA development projects, allowing for controlled testing, reliable deployment across different hardware, and simpler debugging.

**Recommended Resources:**

For a deeper understanding of CUDA, I suggest consulting the following:

*   The CUDA Toolkit documentation (official documentation from NVIDIA). This includes the CUDA programming guide and the documentation for tools like `nvcc` and `cuobjdump`.
*   "CUDA by Example" by Sanders and Kandrot: A good resource to understand CUDA and it's memory model.
*   Books on parallel computing with GPUs: These can provide theoretical background on the hardware architecture.
