The root cause of Keras tensor errors exceeding dimension bounds invariably stems from a mismatch between the expected input shape and the actual shape of the tensor fed into a layer.  This mismatch arises frequently during model construction, data preprocessing, or during the application of custom layers.  In my experience troubleshooting such issues across numerous deep learning projects, the most effective approach involves meticulously verifying the dimensionality of each tensor at various pipeline stages.

**1. Understanding Tensor Dimensions and Keras Layers**

A Keras tensor is a multi-dimensional array representing data within the model.  Each dimension corresponds to a specific aspect of the data.  For example, in image processing, a tensor might have dimensions (batch_size, height, width, channels), where:

* `batch_size`: The number of images processed simultaneously.
* `height`: The height of each image.
* `width`: The width of each image.
* `channels`: The number of color channels (e.g., 3 for RGB, 1 for grayscale).

Keras layers are designed to operate on tensors with specific input shapes.  If a layer expects a tensor of shape (None, 10) and receives a tensor of shape (None, 20), a dimension bound error will occur.  'None' indicates a variable batch size.  The error messages usually specify the layer and the conflicting dimensions.

**2. Debugging Strategies**

My debugging process typically involves the following steps:

* **Print Tensor Shapes:**  Strategically placed `print(tensor.shape)` statements throughout the data pipeline and model construction are invaluable. This allows for the tracking of tensor dimensions from the raw data to the layer causing the error.

* **Inspect Layer Input Shapes:** Carefully review the documentation for each Keras layer used, paying close attention to its expected input shape.  Ensure that the tensors fed into each layer conform precisely to these specifications.

* **Data Preprocessing Verification:** Errors frequently originate from incorrect data preprocessing.  Check for inconsistencies in image resizing, data normalization, and one-hot encoding.  In my experience, subtle errors in these stages can propagate through the model, leading to dimension mismatches later.

* **Reshape Operations:**  If necessary, utilize Keras's `tf.reshape()` function or the `Reshape` layer to adjust tensor dimensions to match layer expectations.

**3. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate the problem and its solutions with three examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect Input Shape to a Dense Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Incorrect input shape
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 5))  # Batch of 10 samples, each with 5 features

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)), # Expecting (None, 5)
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

try:
    model.fit(input_tensor, tf.random.uniform((10, 1)))
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #Output will indicate dimension mismatch at the first Dense Layer
```

This example demonstrates a common error.  The input tensor has a shape of (10, 5), while the `Dense` layer expects an input shape of (None, 5).  The batch size (10) is correctly handled by `None`, but if the feature dimension did not match, this would result in an error.

**Example 2:  Dimensionality Issues with Convolutional Layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Incorrect input shape for Conv2D
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 28, 28)) # Missing channel dimension

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), #Expecting (None, 28, 28, 1)
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')

try:
    model.fit(input_tensor, tf.random.uniform((10, 10), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32))
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #Error will highlight the missing channel dimension in input_tensor.
```

This example highlights a typical issue with convolutional layers.  The `Conv2D` layer requires a four-dimensional input tensor (batch_size, height, width, channels).  The input tensor is missing the channel dimension, resulting in a dimension mismatch.  Adding a channel dimension using `tf.expand_dims(input_tensor, axis=-1)` would resolve the issue.

**Example 3: Reshaping for Compatibility**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Reshaping the input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 20))
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Reshape((5, 4)),  # Reshaping to (None, 5, 4)
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(input_tensor, tf.random.normal((10, 10)))
```


This example demonstrates how to use the `Reshape` layer to adapt the input tensor's dimensions to match the subsequent layers' requirements.  The input tensor is reshaped from (10, 20) to (10, 5, 4) before proceeding to a `Flatten` layer, preventing the dimension bound error.

**4. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on Keras layers and tensor manipulation, provides detailed information on layer input specifications and tensor reshaping functionalities.  A strong grasp of linear algebra, specifically matrix operations and dimensionality concepts, is crucial for effectively understanding and debugging such issues.  Familiarizing oneself with common data augmentation and preprocessing techniques within the TensorFlow ecosystem will also prove beneficial.
