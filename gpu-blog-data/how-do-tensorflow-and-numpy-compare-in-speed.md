TensorFlow's performance advantage over NumPy for mathematical operations stems primarily from its ability to leverage optimized hardware acceleration, particularly GPUs and TPUs.  While NumPy operates primarily on CPUs, utilizing highly optimized C code, TensorFlow's computational graph execution model allows for the distribution and parallelization of computations across these more powerful processing units.  This distinction becomes especially critical when dealing with large datasets and complex operations.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines has consistently shown this performance disparity.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core difference boils down to execution environment and optimization strategies. NumPy relies on efficient vectorized operations within a single CPU.  These operations are highly optimized in their own right, utilizing techniques like SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions for parallel processing at the instruction level.  However, this is fundamentally limited by the single CPU's capacity and memory bandwidth.  It excels in relatively small-scale computations or scenarios where GPU access isn't feasible or beneficial due to overhead.

TensorFlow, in contrast, builds a computational graph representing the sequence of operations.  This graph is then optimized by TensorFlow's runtime environment, which can identify opportunities for parallel execution across multiple cores (CPU) or, more significantly, across a GPU or TPU.  The graph optimization includes operations like kernel fusion (combining multiple small operations into larger ones) and memory optimization strategies that significantly minimize data transfer bottlenecks.  Furthermore, TensorFlow utilizes highly optimized custom kernels written in CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs) or XLA (for both CPUs and GPUs), providing another layer of performance enhancement unavailable to NumPy.

This leads to a situation where NumPy is faster for extremely small-scale operations where the overhead of building and executing a TensorFlow graph outweighs the benefits of parallel processing.  However, as the scale of the computation increases – dataset size, complexity of operations, or both – TensorFlow's potential for parallelization and hardware acceleration quickly eclipses NumPy's performance.  The crossover point, of course, depends heavily on the specific hardware and operations involved.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's consider three scenarios illustrating this comparison.  All examples assume necessary library imports (`import numpy as np; import tensorflow as tf`).

**Example 1: Matrix Multiplication (Small Scale):**

```python
# NumPy
a_np = np.random.rand(100, 100)
b_np = np.random.rand(100, 100)
%timeit np.dot(a_np, b_np)

# TensorFlow
a_tf = tf.random.normal((100, 100))
b_tf = tf.random.normal((100, 100))
%timeit tf.matmul(a_tf, b_tf)
```

In this small-scale matrix multiplication, NumPy might outperform TensorFlow due to the overhead associated with TensorFlow's graph construction and execution. The overhead of compiling and executing the TensorFlow graph can exceed the benefits of GPU usage, especially in CPU-based executions.  The `%timeit` magic function provides a simple benchmark to compare execution times.


**Example 2: Matrix Multiplication (Large Scale):**

```python
# NumPy
a_np = np.random.rand(10000, 10000)
b_np = np.random.rand(10000, 10000)
%timeit np.dot(a_np, b_np)

# TensorFlow (GPU enabled)
with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Assumes a GPU is available.
    a_tf = tf.random.normal((10000, 10000))
    b_tf = tf.random.normal((10000, 10000))
    %timeit tf.matmul(a_tf, b_tf)
```

With a significantly larger matrix, the parallelization capabilities of TensorFlow on a GPU become dramatically more apparent.  The difference in execution time would be substantial, showcasing TensorFlow's advantage.  The `with tf.device('/GPU:0'):` block ensures the operation runs on the GPU, assuming one is available and properly configured.  Without this, the TensorFlow operation might default to CPU execution, negating its advantage.


**Example 3:  Element-wise Operations (Large Dataset):**

```python
# NumPy
a_np = np.random.rand(1000000)
b_np = np.random.rand(1000000)
%timeit a_np + b_np

# TensorFlow (CPU)
a_tf = tf.random.normal((1000000,))
b_tf = tf.random.normal((1000000,))
%timeit a_tf + b_tf
```

Even for element-wise operations like addition, where NumPy is traditionally strong, TensorFlow can show competitive performance, especially with very large datasets. While NumPy’s vectorized operations are efficient, TensorFlow's optimized kernels and potential for parallelization across multiple CPU cores (if properly configured) can offer comparable speeds or even surpass NumPy, depending on hardware and configuration.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of NumPy's inner workings, I recommend exploring the NumPy documentation and studying its source code (available online).  Similarly, the official TensorFlow documentation is invaluable for grasping its intricacies, particularly concerning graph execution, optimization strategies, and hardware acceleration.  Finally, exploring materials covering parallel programming and GPU computing fundamentals will offer valuable context for understanding the performance differences highlighted in this response.  A strong foundation in linear algebra is also indispensable for comprehending the implications of these differences in practical applications.
