The crucial determinant of an LSTM network's output shape isn't solely its architecture but critically depends on the configuration of its return sequences and return states parameters, and the input data's dimensionality.  My experience working on sequence-to-sequence models for financial time series prediction highlighted this frequently.  Ignoring these parameters leads to unpredictable and often erroneous output shapes. I've debugged countless instances where overlooking this detail resulted in hours of wasted effort.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are designed for sequential data processing.  Their inherent architecture allows them to learn long-range dependencies within sequences.  The output shape, however, isn't fixed and is dynamically determined by the specific application and how the LSTM is configured.  The key factors influencing the output are:

* **Input Shape:**  The input data's shape dictates the LSTM's initial processing. Typically, this is represented as (samples, timesteps, features).  'Samples' refers to the number of individual sequences, 'timesteps' represent the length of each sequence, and 'features' denote the dimensionality of each timestep.

* **`return_sequences` Parameter:**  This boolean parameter, common in Keras and TensorFlow/PyTorch LSTMs, determines whether the LSTM returns the full sequence of hidden states for each timestep or only the hidden state of the last timestep. If `True`, the output reflects the entire sequence; otherwise, only the final state is returned.

* **`return_state` Parameter:**  This parameter (also boolean) dictates whether the LSTM returns its internal cell state and hidden state alongside the main output.  This is primarily useful for stateful LSTMs or when chaining multiple LSTMs.  The internal states are crucial for maintaining long-term memory across sequences.

* **Number of Units:**  The number of units in the LSTM layer directly impacts the dimensionality of the output. Each unit produces a single output value at each timestep. Therefore, having 'N' units will result in an output shape with a final dimension of size 'N'.

Based on these parameters, we can deduce several possible output shapes. For example:

* **Scenario 1 (`return_sequences=False`, `return_state=False`):** The output will be a 2D tensor of shape (samples, units).  This represents the hidden state from the last timestep of each input sequence.

* **Scenario 2 (`return_sequences=True`, `return_state=False`):** The output will be a 3D tensor of shape (samples, timesteps, units). This represents the hidden state at each timestep for each input sequence.

* **Scenario 3 (`return_sequences=False`, `return_state=True`):** The output will consist of two tensors: a 2D tensor of shape (samples, units) representing the last hidden state and a 2D tensor of shape (samples, units) representing the last cell state.

* **Scenario 4 (`return_sequences=True`, `return_state=True`):**  The output will consist of three tensors: a 3D tensor of shape (samples, timesteps, units) representing the sequence of hidden states, a 2D tensor of shape (samples, units) for the last hidden state, and a 2D tensor of shape (samples, units) for the last cell state.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples are written in Keras, demonstrating the various output shapes discussed above.  I've used simplified examples for clarity; real-world applications would typically involve more complex architectures and preprocessing.

**Example 1:  `return_sequences=False`, `return_state=False`**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=False, return_state=False, input_shape=(10, 3)), #input shape: (timesteps, features)
])

input_data = np.random.rand(32, 10, 3) #32 samples, 10 timesteps, 3 features
output = model.predict(input_data)
print(output.shape) # Output: (32, 64)  32 samples, 64 units (last hidden state)
```

This example shows a simple LSTM with 64 units.  Since `return_sequences` is `False` and `return_state` is `False`, only the final hidden state (32 samples x 64 units) is returned.

**Example 2: `return_sequences=True`, `return_state=False`**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(units=32, return_sequences=True, return_state=False, input_shape=(20, 5)), # input shape: (timesteps, features)
])

input_data = np.random.rand(16, 20, 5) # 16 samples, 20 timesteps, 5 features
output = model.predict(input_data)
print(output.shape) # Output: (16, 20, 32) 16 samples, 20 timesteps, 32 units
```

Here, `return_sequences=True` results in a 3D output. We get the hidden state for each of the 20 timesteps (16 samples x 20 timesteps x 32 units).

**Example 3: `return_sequences=False`, `return_state=True`**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(units=128, return_sequences=False, return_state=True, input_shape=(5,2))
])

input_data = np.random.rand(8, 5, 2)
output = model.predict(input_data)
print(len(output)) # Output: 3 (Hidden state, cell state, and the usual hidden state)
print(output[0].shape)  # Output: (8, 128) last hidden state
print(output[1].shape)  # Output: (8, 128) last cell state

```
This demonstrates the case where both hidden and cell states are returned. The output is a tuple containing three NumPy arrays.  The first one is the standard hidden state (8 samples x 128 units) of the last timestep, whereas the second and third outputs represent the last hidden and cell states, respectively.  Note that the shape of the last hidden state might be confusing. In the case `return_sequences=False, return_state=True`, the output tuple contains three elements, the first element being the last hidden state array.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of LSTMs and their intricacies, I recommend exploring the relevant chapters in deep learning textbooks by Goodfellow et al., and Bishop.  Furthermore, carefully examining the documentation of your chosen deep learning framework (Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch) is invaluable.  Finally, focusing on practical projects involving sequence data will solidify your grasp of LSTM behavior and output shapes.  Consider working through tutorials and examples that explicitly address the `return_sequences` and `return_state` parameters.  Thorough experimentation and careful examination of the output shapes produced will be the most effective learning method.
