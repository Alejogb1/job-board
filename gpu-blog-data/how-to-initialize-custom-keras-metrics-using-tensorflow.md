The core issue in initializing custom Keras metrics with TensorFlow functions lies in the distinction between eager execution and graph execution modes.  TensorFlow's variable initialization behavior differs significantly between these modes, and if not carefully handled, leads to the dreaded "uninitialized variable" error when a custom metric is evaluated before its internal variables are properly set.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image classification projects highlighted the necessity of explicitly managing variable initialization within the metric's `__init__` method and leveraging TensorFlow's `tf.Variable` and `tf.compat.v1.get_variable` (or its equivalent in the latest TF versions) for consistent behavior across execution contexts.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

Custom Keras metrics, extending the `tf.keras.metrics.Metric` class, often require internal state variables to accumulate values over batches or epochs. These variables must be initialized before the metric is used for calculation.  When using TensorFlow functions within the `update_state` method of a custom metric, the initialization process becomes intricate due to the potential for these functions to be executed within a graph context (during model building, for instance), where explicit initialization is mandatory. Eager execution, on the other hand, handles variable creation and initialization automatically, but relying solely on this approach can result in inconsistencies and errors when switching between execution modes or deploying to environments with different TensorFlow configurations.

Therefore, a robust custom metric implementation requires a strategy that guarantees initialization regardless of the execution environment.  This is achieved by explicitly creating and initializing `tf.Variable` objects within the metric's constructor (`__init__`).  These variables should be associated with the metric using the `self.add_weight` method provided by the `tf.keras.metrics.Metric` base class. This ensures that Keras's training loop correctly manages the metric's internal state.  Furthermore, using `tf.compat.v1.get_variable` (or its equivalent in more recent TensorFlow versions, offering similar scope management capabilities) provides better control over variable sharing and reuse across multiple metrics or layers, especially relevant in complex models.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Mean Squared Error (MSE) Metric**

This example demonstrates a basic MSE metric, showcasing explicit variable initialization within the constructor.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomMSE(tf.keras.metrics.Metric):
    def __init__(self, name='custom_mse', **kwargs):
        super(CustomMSE, self).__init__(name=name, **kwargs)
        self.squared_differences = self.add_weight(name='squared_differences', initializer='zeros')
        self.count = self.add_weight(name='count', initializer='zeros')

    def update_state(self, y_true, y_pred):
        diff = tf.math.squared_difference(y_true, y_pred)
        self.squared_differences.assign_add(tf.reduce_sum(diff))
        self.count.assign_add(tf.cast(tf.shape(y_true)[0], tf.float32))

    def result(self):
        return self.squared_differences / self.count

    def reset_states(self):
        self.squared_differences.assign(0.)
        self.count.assign(0.)

# Usage:
mse_metric = CustomMSE()
```

This code clearly initializes `squared_differences` and `count` as `tf.Variable` objects using `self.add_weight`. The `assign_add` method ensures correct accumulation during updates.


**Example 2:  Metric with TensorFlow Function for Complex Calculation**

This example demonstrates a more complex metric involving a custom TensorFlow function for calculating a specialized error.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def complex_error_fn(y_true, y_pred):
  #Some complex calculation here, possibly involving tf.cond or other ops
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)**3)


class ComplexErrorMetric(tf.keras.metrics.Metric):
  def __init__(self, name='complex_error', **kwargs):
    super(ComplexErrorMetric, self).__init__(name=name, **kwargs)
    self.total_error = self.add_weight(name='total_error', initializer='zeros')
    self.count = self.add_weight(name='count', initializer='zeros')

  def update_state(self, y_true, y_pred):
    error = complex_error_fn(y_true, y_pred)
    self.total_error.assign_add(error)
    self.count.assign_add(1.0)

  def result(self):
    return self.total_error / self.count

  def reset_states(self):
    self.total_error.assign(0.0)
    self.count.assign(0.0)

# Usage:
complex_error = ComplexErrorMetric()
```

This example uses a separate function `complex_error_fn` which can contain intricate TensorFlow operations, yet the metric's initialization and update remain robust due to the explicit variable handling.


**Example 3:  Metric Utilizing `tf.compat.v1.get_variable` (for legacy compatibility)**

This illustrates the use of `tf.compat.v1.get_variable` for better control, particularly useful in scenarios requiring careful variable scope management within larger models.  Note:  For the latest TF versions, consult the equivalent scope management mechanisms.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() #For illustrative purposes only - generally avoid disabling eager execution

class LegacyCompatibleMetric(tf.keras.metrics.Metric):
    def __init__(self, name='legacy_metric', **kwargs):
        super(LegacyCompatibleMetric, self).__init__(name=name, **kwargs)
        with tf.compat.v1.variable_scope(name):
            self.internal_var = tf.compat.v1.get_variable(
                'internal_var', initializer=tf.constant(0.0)
            )

    def update_state(self, y_true, y_pred):
        self.internal_var.assign_add(tf.reduce_sum(y_true))

    def result(self):
        return self.internal_var

    def reset_states(self):
        self.internal_var.assign(0.0)

#Usage
legacy_metric = LegacyCompatibleMetric()

#Re-enable eager execution if disabled
tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()

```

This example, while using older APIs, emphasizes the principle of explicit variable management, even when utilizing a function that might be integrated into a wider graph.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation on custom metrics, variables, and the differences between eager and graph execution.  Furthermore, a comprehensive guide on TensorFlow's variable scope management (especially if targeting legacy code or projects needing tighter control over variable sharing).  Finally, exploring advanced Keras concepts relating to model building and training loops can enhance your understanding of the integration of custom metrics.  Reviewing example implementations of complex metrics in published research papers often helps illustrate practical strategies.
