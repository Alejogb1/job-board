The issue you're encountering with `base_model.summary()` crashing your notebook and VS Code when working with ResNet101 stems from the sheer size of the model's architecture.  ResNet101, with its 101 layers, possesses a vast number of parameters, resulting in a significantly large computational graph representation.  This representation, when attempted to be fully printed by `summary()`, exceeds the memory capacity allocated to your Python interpreter, leading to the crash.  This isn't a bug in TensorFlow or Keras; it's a consequence of attempting to visualize a very complex model in a memory-constrained environment.  I've personally encountered this numerous times during my work on large-scale image classification projects.

My experience working with deep learning frameworks has shown that the `summary()` function isn't designed for models of this scale.  Its purpose is primarily to provide a concise overview of a model's architecture, which is perfectly suitable for smaller models but quickly becomes unwieldy and resource-intensive for deep networks like ResNet101.

The solution involves a multi-pronged approach focusing on reducing memory consumption during the visualization process and utilizing alternative methods for model inspection.

**1. Reducing Memory Consumption:**

The primary culprit is the attempt to render the entire model graph in memory at once.  We can mitigate this by leveraging alternative methods that generate the summary information incrementally or represent the architecture in a more compact manner.  These strategies are vital for working with high-capacity models.

**2. Code Examples:**

Here are three approaches illustrating different strategies to handle the issue, followed by detailed commentary:

**Example 1:  Using `dot_img_file` for Visualization**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet101
from tensorflow.keras.utils import plot_model
import os

base_model = ResNet101(weights='imagenet')

# Generate a graphviz representation of the model
plot_model(base_model, to_file='resnet101_model.png', show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True)

# Optionally, display the image (requires appropriate library, e.g., PIL)
# from PIL import Image
# img = Image.open('resnet101_model.png')
# img.show()

# Clean up temporary files (optional, but recommended)
# os.remove('resnet101_model.png')

```

This method avoids generating the textual summary entirely. Instead, it creates a visual representation of the model's architecture using Graphviz. This is far less memory-intensive and provides a clear, if less numerically detailed, overview of the model. The `show_shapes` and `show_layer_names` parameters improve the clarity of the generated image. Note that this approach requires Graphviz to be installed.  In my experience, this often provides a sufficiently clear overview while avoiding crashes.


**Example 2:  Iterative Layer Inspection**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet101

base_model = ResNet101(weights='imagenet')

for i, layer in enumerate(base_model.layers):
    print(f"Layer {i+1}: {layer.name}, Output Shape: {layer.output_shape}, Number of Parameters: {layer.count_params()}")

```

This approach inspects the model layer by layer.  It iterates through each layer, printing its name, output shape, and the number of parameters.  This provides a detailed overview of the model's architecture without attempting to render the entire graph in memory simultaneously.  This method is particularly useful for gaining insight into the model's structure and identifying potential bottlenecks. This method directly addresses the memory issue by avoiding the full summary generation and instead focusing on iteratively extracting key information about each layer.

**Example 3:  Summary with Reduced Detail (if absolutely necessary)**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet101

base_model = ResNet101(weights='imagenet')

base_model.summary(line_length=100) #Adjust line_length for your terminal width

```

This approach attempts a summary, but with modified parameters.  Here, I explicitly control the `line_length` parameter to manage the output format, which can reduce the memory footprint compared to the default output.  Experimentation with `line_length` and potentially other parameters such as `positions`  might be required to achieve a balance between information and resource consumption.  However, it is still possible that this may fail for ResNet101 depending on the system configuration.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   Consult the documentation for your deep learning framework (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, etc.) for alternative model visualization tools and techniques.
*   Invest time in understanding model architecture visualization libraries and tools specific to your framework.
*   Consider upgrading your system's RAM, or employing more powerful hardware if feasible.  This will provide more memory available for the Python interpreter.


In conclusion, directly generating a full summary for large models like ResNet101 is often impractical due to memory constraints.  By employing the techniques described above – using visual representations, iterative layer inspection, or carefully controlling the summary parameters – you can effectively work with these models without encountering crashes.  The key is to adapt your approach to the model's complexity and the available system resources. Remember that the aim is not to forcefully generate a complete summary, but to understand the model's architecture in a memory-efficient manner.  This methodology is crucial for working efficiently with large-scale deep learning models.
