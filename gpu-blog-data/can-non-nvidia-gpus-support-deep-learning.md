The widely held belief that only Nvidia GPUs are viable for deep learning is a significant oversimplification. While Nvidia has historically dominated the landscape due to CUDA's mature ecosystem and broad hardware support, deep learning, at its core, relies on numerical computation that can be accelerated by any massively parallel processing unit, including those from AMD and Intel. The key factors determining effective deep learning support are not brand affiliation, but rather the availability of compatible software libraries and robust driver implementations that expose the hardware's parallel processing capabilities. I've personally wrestled with this in projects involving diverse hardware, moving beyond the Nvidia-centric paradigm.

A critical understanding lies in how deep learning computations are performed. The process predominantly involves matrix multiplications and other vector operations, tasks ideally suited for parallelization. GPUs excel at this due to their architecture, featuring hundreds or thousands of processing cores that can perform the same operation concurrently on different data elements. While Nvidia's CUDA framework has historically been the most mature path to harness this power, alternatives have emerged and matured. These alternatives allow for efficient deep learning on non-Nvidia GPUs through different programming models. Therefore, the ability to support deep learning depends more on the software stack’s ability to interface with the hardware than on any inherent limitation of non-Nvidia hardware itself.

The primary barrier for non-Nvidia GPUs has been the previously limited software support. For years, deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch leaned heavily on CUDA as the default path for GPU acceleration, effectively excluding other manufacturers. However, this situation has evolved. AMD, for example, has invested heavily in their ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) platform, aiming to provide a comparable software ecosystem to CUDA. ROCm provides its own libraries, like HIP (Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability), that allow developers to write code that can be compiled and run on both Nvidia and AMD GPUs with minimal modification. Intel, too, is increasing its presence through its oneAPI platform, which aims to facilitate similar hardware acceleration on its integrated and discrete graphics processors.

To illustrate this, consider a common scenario: performing a matrix multiplication in a deep learning model. In TensorFlow, the default method would rely on CUDA. However, if you've configured TensorFlow to use a ROCm-enabled build, the same operation will leverage the AMD GPU. This doesn’t require changing the high-level TensorFlow code; the framework itself decides how to best distribute computations.

Here's a simplified example using TensorFlow (assuming a correctly configured environment with either CUDA or ROCm):

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create random matrices
a = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1000, 1000), dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1000, 1000), dtype=tf.float32)

# Perform matrix multiplication
c = tf.matmul(a, b)

# Execute the computation
with tf.Session() as sess:
  result = sess.run(c)

print("Matrix multiplication complete.")

```
This python code is agnostic of the underlying hardware. TensorFlow abstracts the complexity of the underlying hardware away. It will execute this matrix multiplication using whichever backend is configured; if it is CUDA it will use the GPU, and if it is ROCm it will be delegated to the AMD GPU. The user code remains the same. It highlights that the primary hurdle is in the configuration of the deep learning framework to use an available device.

Now, let's consider the same matrix multiplication but in a more explicit manner using the HIP API. This is directly targeting an AMD GPU:

```cpp
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

__global__ void matrix_mult(float* a, float* b, float* c, int N) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < N && col < N) {
        float sum = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
            sum += a[row * N + k] * b[k * N + col];
        }
        c[row * N + col] = sum;
    }
}


int main() {
    int N = 1000;
    size_t size = N * N * sizeof(float);

    // Host allocation
    std::vector<float> h_a(N*N), h_b(N*N), h_c(N*N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N*N; i++) {
      h_a[i] = (float)rand() / RAND_MAX;
      h_b[i] = (float)rand() / RAND_MAX;
    }
    // Device Allocation
    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;
    hipMalloc((void**)&d_a, size);
    hipMalloc((void**)&d_b, size);
    hipMalloc((void**)&d_c, size);

    // Copy to device
    hipMemcpy(d_a, h_a.data(), size, hipMemcpyHostToDevice);
    hipMemcpy(d_b, h_b.data(), size, hipMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Kernel Launch
    dim3 threadsPerBlock(16,16);
    dim3 numBlocks( (N + threadsPerBlock.x-1)/ threadsPerBlock.x,(N+ threadsPerBlock.y-1)/threadsPerBlock.y);
    hipLaunchKernelGGL(matrix_mult, numBlocks, threadsPerBlock, 0, 0, d_a, d_b, d_c, N);

    // Copy back to host
    hipMemcpy(h_c.data(), d_c, size, hipMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    hipFree(d_a);
    hipFree(d_b);
    hipFree(d_c);

    std::cout << "Matrix multiplication with HIP complete." << std::endl;

    return 0;

}
```

This C++ code, which uses HIP API calls, compiles and executes the same matrix multiplication on an AMD GPU. The code explicitly manages data transfer between the host (CPU) memory and the device (GPU) memory, as well as launching the kernel that performs the calculation on the GPU. It is noticeably more complex than the TensorFlow example as it needs to interface directly with the hardware at a lower level. This example demonstrates the capability of ROCm to expose the computational power of AMD GPUs through a direct programming model.

Finally, to illustrate a slightly higher-level interface, consider using a deep learning library that directly supports multiple backends (like PyTorch with a suitable backend). This would also allow a user to target a non-Nvidia GPU. This assumes the installation of a PyTorch build configured with the target backend:

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

# Check for GPU availability
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    print("Using CUDA GPU")
elif torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = torch.device("mps")
    print("Using Metal Performance Shaders")
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")
    print("Using CPU")

# Create random tensors
a = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
b = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)

# Perform matrix multiplication
c = torch.matmul(a, b)

print("Matrix multiplication complete.")
```

This code leverages PyTorch to automatically select a usable device. If it identifies an Nvidia GPU with CUDA support, it will use that, but if no CUDA device is available it will seamlessly fall back to using an alternative, such as Metal Performance Shaders on macOS, or even the CPU. As with the Tensorflow example, the user is abstracted from the underlying details of the hardware. The primary prerequisite remains that the PyTorch backend and runtime are configured to communicate with the targeted hardware.

For those wishing to further investigate, numerous resources exist. While specific links will not be provided as requested, I recommend exploring the official documentation from AMD regarding their ROCm platform and HIP library. Intel’s oneAPI platform also provides extensive material for targeting their hardware. For deep learning framework specific information, the official documentation of PyTorch and TensorFlow are the most up-to-date sources on supported platforms and device configurations.

In summary, non-Nvidia GPUs can indeed support deep learning. The key to success is not the manufacturer of the GPU itself, but the availability of supporting software frameworks and well-maintained drivers. The examples I’ve provided underscore this: high-level deep learning frameworks abstract away the complexities of the underlying hardware enabling code to be agnostic; and alternative, lower-level programming interfaces enable direct manipulation of the hardware. The ecosystem is evolving to provide support for different hardware, making the notion that only Nvidia GPUs are usable for deep learning obsolete.
