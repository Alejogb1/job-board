The discrepancy in the behavior of `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` between eager and graph execution modes, manifesting as an "Only integers are valid indices" error in eager mode but not in graph mode, stems from a fundamental difference in how TensorFlow handles data access and tensor creation in each execution paradigm.  My experience debugging similar issues across several large-scale TensorFlow projects has revealed that this error almost invariably points to an improper interaction between the generator function's output and TensorFlow's type inference mechanisms, particularly concerning the handling of dynamically sized tensors within the generator itself.  In eager execution, TensorFlow immediately evaluates operations, leading to immediate error reporting if type inconsistencies are encountered.  Graph mode, conversely, defers execution, building a computational graph before execution, allowing certain type inconsistencies to go unnoticed until runtime, potentially masking the underlying problem.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The root cause lies in the generator function used with `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator`.  This function is responsible for yielding data to the dataset. If the generator yields tensors with shapes that are not consistently defined (i.e., shapes containing non-integer dimensions like `None` or dynamically determined lengths), TensorFlow's eager mode will raise an error when attempting to index these tensors because it expects a fixed size. Graph mode, however, constructs a placeholder for the tensor shape, allowing the operation to seemingly proceed without immediate issues.  The error then only materializes *during* graph execution if an operation requires a fixed shape and the placeholder is not properly resolved during the execution phase.  The crucial difference is the timing of type checking: eager mode checks at generation, while graph mode defers the check until runtime.

Let's consider a scenario where the generator's output depends on external factors which influence the shape of the yielded tensors.  For example, imagine a generator loading data from files of varying lengths.  The length of each file might not be known beforehand, preventing a priori determination of the tensor shape within the generator. In eager mode, the attempt to access elements of this inconsistently shaped tensor with integer indexing will immediately raise the "Only integers are valid indices" error. In contrast, in graph mode, TensorFlow will attempt to build the graph accepting the tensor with a dynamically determined shape.  However, this might lead to an error later in the pipeline when an operation requires a fixed-size tensor.

The solution involves ensuring that the generator function always produces tensors with well-defined, fixed shapes, regardless of the input data. This could involve padding variable-length sequences, using a fixed-size input representation, or restructuring the data pipeline to handle variable-length data more gracefully. The use of `tf.TensorShape` to explicitly define output shapes inside the generator is strongly recommended.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Error-Prone Generator (Eager Mode Failure)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def inconsistent_generator():
  for i in range(3):
    yield tf.constant([i] * (i+1)) # Variable length lists

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
    inconsistent_generator,
    output_signature=tf.TensorSpec(shape=(None,), dtype=tf.int32)
)

# Eager execution will fail here.
for x in dataset:
  print(x[1]) # Indexing will raise "Only integers are valid indices"
```

This generator creates tensors of variable length. In eager execution, attempting to access the second element (`x[1]`) of each tensor will fail because the tensor shape is not fixed. The `output_signature` is correctly set to allow variable lengths, but it doesn't resolve the issue of immediate tensor indexing.

**Example 2: Corrected Generator (Eager and Graph Mode Success)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def consistent_generator():
  max_len = 3
  for i in range(3):
    tensor = tf.constant([i] * max_len)
    yield tensor

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
    consistent_generator,
    output_signature=tf.TensorSpec(shape=(3,), dtype=tf.int32)
)

# Both eager and graph modes will execute successfully.
for x in dataset:
  print(x[1])
```

Here, we pad all tensors to a fixed length (`max_len`).  This guarantees consistent shapes, resolving the indexing problem in both eager and graph execution modes. The `output_signature` accurately reflects the fixed shape.

**Example 3: Handling Variable Length Data with Padding (Eager and Graph Mode Success)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def variable_length_generator():
  for i in range(3):
    yield tf.constant([i] * (i+1))

def pad_tensor(tensor, max_len):
  padding = tf.constant([0] * (max_len - tf.shape(tensor)[0]))
  return tf.concat([tensor, padding], axis=0)


dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
    lambda: (pad_tensor(tensor, 3) for tensor in variable_length_generator()),
    output_signature=tf.TensorSpec(shape=(3,), dtype=tf.int32)
)

for x in dataset:
  print(x) # Both eager and graph will work correctly.
```

This example demonstrates a more sophisticated approach for handling variable-length data. It uses a helper function `pad_tensor` to pad each tensor to a maximum length before yielding it to the dataset. This makes sure the dataset contains tensors of a consistent shape.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data.Dataset`.  Pay close attention to the sections on `output_shapes` and `output_signature`.
*   TensorFlow's guide on eager execution and graph execution. Understanding the fundamental differences between the two modes is paramount for troubleshooting such issues.
*   A comprehensive guide on handling variable-length sequences in TensorFlow.  This will provide strategies for dealing with data that inherently varies in size.  Explore techniques like padding, masking, and bucketing.


By carefully inspecting your generator functionâ€™s output and ensuring consistent tensor shapes,  and leveraging TensorFlow's shape specification mechanisms, you can prevent the "Only integers are valid indices" error from occurring, regardless of whether you're running in eager or graph execution mode. Remember that the graph mode's deferred execution can sometimes mask underlying problems that surface only later during execution.  Proactive shape management within your generators is crucial for robust TensorFlow workflows.
