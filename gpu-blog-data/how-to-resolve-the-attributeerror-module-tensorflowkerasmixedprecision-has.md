The error "AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision' has no attribute 'set_global_policy'" arises from an incompatibility between the TensorFlow version being used and the desired mixed precision API call. Specifically, the `set_global_policy` function within `tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision` was introduced in TensorFlow 2.4.0 and does not exist in earlier versions. I encountered this myself during a research project upgrading an older codebase that relied on TensorFlow 2.3.

The fundamental issue lies in the evolutionary path of the TensorFlow API. In prior versions, mixed precision functionality was typically configured using environment variables or through the `tf.compat.v1.keras.mixed_precision` module (deprecated after TensorFlow 2.7), or required manual manipulation of data types and layers. With the advent of TensorFlow 2.4.0, a more streamlined and recommended approach was provided via `tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy`, allowing the user to set a global precision policy that applies to all layers within the model unless explicitly overridden. The absence of this method in older versions leads to the observed `AttributeError`. Thus, the solution involves either upgrading TensorFlow to a compatible version (2.4.0 or higher) or employing alternative mixed precision configuration methods suitable for older TensorFlow releases. I have found both solutions applicable in different contexts.

For illustration, consider the scenario where we intend to utilize float16 (or bfloat16) computation for improved performance in a neural network.

**Code Example 1: Attempting `set_global_policy` with TensorFlow < 2.4.0 (Failing)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    policy = tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
    tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy(policy)
    print("Mixed precision policy set successfully!")
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    print("TensorFlow version is likely older than 2.4.0 and does not support 'set_global_policy'.")

# Model definition and training would follow here, but is omitted for brevity.
```

In this example, if your TensorFlow installation is below 2.4.0, the `AttributeError` will be triggered. The program explicitly tries to use `set_global_policy` which doesn't exist, demonstrating the core issue. This was precisely the error I faced initially when migrating a project relying on `tf-gpu==2.3.0` to mixed precision.

**Code Example 2: Correct Usage of `set_global_policy` with TensorFlow >= 2.4.0**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Ensure TF version is >= 2.4.0
print("TensorFlow Version:", tf.__version__)
if tf.__version__ < "2.4.0":
    print("This code requires TensorFlow version 2.4.0 or higher.")
else:
    policy = tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
    tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy(policy)
    print("Mixed precision policy set successfully!")

# Model definition and training would follow here, but is omitted for brevity.
```
Here, I've added a version check, ensuring that the policy is only set if the TensorFlow installation is sufficiently recent. This prevents the AttributeError. This represents the straightforward solution for modern installations, demonstrating the proper application of the desired mixed precision method after meeting the dependency condition.

**Code Example 3: Alternative method for TensorFlow < 2.4.0 using `tf.compat.v1.keras.mixed_precision`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("TensorFlow Version:", tf.__version__)
if tf.__version__ < "2.4.0":
  print("Using compat.v1 method for TF < 2.4.0")
  tf.compat.v1.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy('mixed_float16')
  print("Mixed precision policy set using compat.v1 method.")
else:
    policy = tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
    tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy(policy)
    print("Mixed precision policy set successfully!")

# Model definition and training would follow here, but is omitted for brevity.
```

This final code example introduces an alternative approach using `tf.compat.v1.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy`. This provides a viable strategy for older TensorFlow versions, where `set_global_policy` does not exist. The `experimental` designation indicates that its usage may not be as stable or consistently supported across all scenarios compared to `set_global_policy`. However, in my experience, when constrained to using older environments, this was a necessary workaround. Note that after TensorFlow 2.7 this `compat.v1` method was deprecated, therefore using this approach should not be used in any modern application.

In summary, resolving the “AttributeError” requires understanding the TensorFlow version requirements for the `set_global_policy` method. The primary action needed is typically a TensorFlow upgrade or the selection of an appropriate API for your specific version. If upgrading isn’t an immediate option, the compat API presents a viable alternative. However, for newer projects, upgrading should be the preferred method.

For additional information, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation and community forums. The "TensorFlow API Overview" section within the official documentation provides detailed information on module structure and version specific functionality. The "Mixed Precision" guide offers specific information on how to use this functionality. Within the TensorFlow community, both the official GitHub repository and the Stack Overflow platform provide excellent resources, including the reporting of various issues, solution paths, and general support. Examining tutorials or example code that demonstrates mixed precision with similar project requirements is also beneficial.
