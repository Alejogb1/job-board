The `tf.contrib.rnn.OutputProjectionWrapper` as it existed in TensorFlow 1.x is effectively superseded by the combination of using a standard RNN cell and applying a dense layer, generally via `tf.keras.layers.Dense`, after the RNN computation. The functionality of projecting the recurrent hidden state to a different dimensionality, a common need for matching output shapes in sequence-to-sequence models or similar applications, is now handled explicitly. This shift aligns with TensorFlow 2's emphasis on greater clarity and modularity in its APIs. I encountered this specific migration challenge during the refactoring of a sequence labeling model last year when adapting legacy code to TensorFlow 2.

In TensorFlow 1.x, the `OutputProjectionWrapper` acted as a wrapper around any given RNN cell, such as an `LSTMCell` or `GRUCell`. It encapsulated the recurrent core and also applied a projection matrix at each time step to map the hidden state output to the required output dimension. This was convenient but also obscured some of the underlying mechanics, leading to a less flexible model architecture. TensorFlow 2 promotes composition, enabling more explicit control over layers and data flow.

The core change involves directly managing the output projection using a `Dense` layer. Instead of wrapping the RNN cell within another layer to perform the projection, we now let the RNN cell purely handle the recurrence while we add a separate layer after the RNN operation. We first generate the output of the RNN which is usually of the shape `[batch_size, seq_length, hidden_units]`. Next, we input that to a dense layer which allows us to project from `hidden_units` to the `output_dim` of our choice, resulting in a shape like `[batch_size, seq_length, output_dim]`. This process is straightforward and is applicable to diverse model architectures.

The benefit here is enhanced control and clarity in how data is transformed through the network. We can perform other operations between the RNN output and projection if needed, like normalization or dropout, whereas with the old wrapper, such manipulations were less explicit. Additionally, it reinforces the principle that RNN cells should focus on the temporal recurrence and the output projection is a separate and distinct component.

Here are three code examples illustrating this transition:

**Example 1: Basic RNN with output projection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Hypothetical old implementation using OutputProjectionWrapper - For demonstration, not functional in TF2.
# It's presented to visualize what functionality it provided
# tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution() # Not applicable in TF2

#def build_legacy_model(input_dim, hidden_units, output_dim, cell_type='lstm'):
#    if cell_type == 'lstm':
#        cell = tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(hidden_units)
#    elif cell_type == 'gru':
#        cell = tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.GRUCell(hidden_units)
#    else:
#        raise ValueError("Unsupported cell type")
#    
#    wrapped_cell = tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.OutputProjectionWrapper(cell, output_dim)
#
#    inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None, input_dim))  
#    outputs, _ = tf.compat.v1.nn.dynamic_rnn(wrapped_cell, inputs, dtype=tf.float32)
#    model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
#    return model

def build_modern_model(input_dim, hidden_units, output_dim, cell_type='lstm'):
  
    inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None, input_dim))
    if cell_type == 'lstm':
        rnn_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(hidden_units, return_sequences=True)
    elif cell_type == 'gru':
        rnn_layer = tf.keras.layers.GRU(hidden_units, return_sequences=True)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported cell type")
        
    rnn_output = rnn_layer(inputs)
    projection_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim)
    outputs = projection_layer(rnn_output)
    model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    return model

input_dim = 10
hidden_units = 64
output_dim = 20

# Example usage:
# legacy_model = build_legacy_model(input_dim, hidden_units, output_dim, cell_type='lstm') # Cannot be run in TF2
modern_model = build_modern_model(input_dim, hidden_units, output_dim, cell_type='lstm')
modern_model.summary()

```
In the first example, I show the older conceptual way of how an `OutputProjectionWrapper` would operate, albeit in an inactive mode since that is incompatible with TF2. The modern implementation uses the Keras `LSTM` layer with `return_sequences=True`, ensuring a sequence of hidden states is returned. Subsequently, the `Dense` layer serves as the output projection. The model's summary reveals the separation of the RNN layer and the projection.

**Example 2: Custom Cell with Projection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomRNNCell(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.state_size = self.units
        self.kernel = None
        self.recurrent_kernel = None
    
    def build(self, input_shape):
        input_dim = input_shape[-1]
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim, self.units), initializer='uniform')
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units), initializer='uniform')
        
    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_state = states[0]
        output = tf.tanh(tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel) + tf.matmul(prev_state, self.recurrent_kernel))
        return output, [output] # return_state
    
def build_custom_projection_model(input_dim, hidden_units, output_dim):
    
    inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None, input_dim))
    cell = CustomRNNCell(hidden_units)
    rnn_layer = tf.keras.layers.RNN(cell, return_sequences=True)
    rnn_output = rnn_layer(inputs)
    projection_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim)
    outputs = projection_layer(rnn_output)
    model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    return model


input_dim = 10
hidden_units = 64
output_dim = 20

model = build_custom_projection_model(input_dim, hidden_units, output_dim)
model.summary()
```

This example showcases how to integrate a custom-defined RNN cell and apply the same concept for output projection. The `CustomRNNCell` calculates a simple recurrent update. The pattern remains the same: after obtaining the sequence of hidden states from the `RNN` layer, a `Dense` layer handles the output projection. This emphasizes that the technique applies across different cell types, not just pre-defined Keras RNN layers.

**Example 3: Bi-directional RNN and Projection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def build_bidirectional_projection_model(input_dim, hidden_units, output_dim, cell_type='lstm'):

    inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None, input_dim))
    if cell_type == 'lstm':
        forward_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(hidden_units, return_sequences=True)
        backward_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(hidden_units, return_sequences=True, go_backwards=True)
    elif cell_type == 'gru':
      forward_layer = tf.keras.layers.GRU(hidden_units, return_sequences=True)
      backward_layer = tf.keras.layers.GRU(hidden_units, return_sequences=True, go_backwards=True)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported cell type")

    bi_rnn_output = tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(forward_layer, backward_layer)(inputs)
    projection_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim)
    outputs = projection_layer(bi_rnn_output)
    model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    return model

input_dim = 10
hidden_units = 64
output_dim = 20


model = build_bidirectional_projection_model(input_dim, hidden_units, output_dim, cell_type='lstm')
model.summary()
```

The third example illustrates how this approach also seamlessly extends to bidirectional RNNs. The `Bidirectional` wrapper combines the output of a forward and backward layer, and subsequently, a dense layer handles the output projection. The core principle of separated recurrent computation and projection is consistently maintained.

Based on my work, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow Keras documentation for `tf.keras.layers.LSTM`, `tf.keras.layers.GRU`, `tf.keras.layers.RNN`, and `tf.keras.layers.Dense`. Additionally, the TensorFlow guide on recurrent neural networks is valuable for understanding the principles involved. These resources provide a strong foundation for working with recurrent models in TensorFlow 2 and handling different aspects like input shaping, handling varying sequence lengths, and different optimization strategies which will prove useful in any substantial implementation. These can effectively allow developers to gain a solid understanding of current practices.
