Matrix factorization is fundamentally a dimensionality reduction technique, aiming to decompose a large matrix into the product of two smaller matrices.  This decomposition reveals latent features or factors that explain the relationships within the original data.  My experience working on collaborative filtering systems for e-commerce recommendation engines highlighted the power and efficiency of TensorFlow 2 for this task.  The choice of specific factorization method—be it Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), or others—depends largely on the data characteristics and desired properties of the resulting factors.  Let's examine practical implementations using TensorFlow 2, focusing on these aspects.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow 2 provides a straightforward approach to matrix factorization through its robust tensor manipulation capabilities and readily available optimization algorithms.  The process typically involves defining a loss function that measures the difference between the original matrix and the product of the factor matrices. Gradient descent, or a variant thereof (like Adam or RMSprop), then iteratively adjusts the factor matrices to minimize this loss, effectively learning the underlying latent factors.  The key is to carefully consider the regularization techniques employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

In essence, we're solving an optimization problem: given a matrix *R* (e.g., a user-item rating matrix), find matrices *P* and *Q* such that *R ≈ P * Q<sup>T</sup>.  The dimensions of *P* and *Q* are chosen to reflect the desired level of dimensionality reduction; they are typically much smaller than the dimensions of *R*.  The quality of the approximation is measured by the loss function, which can be chosen based on the data type and the specific needs of the application. Common loss functions include mean squared error (MSE) for continuous data and cross-entropy for binary or categorical data.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) using TensorFlow's built-in function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample data matrix
R = tf.constant([[5, 3, 0, 1],
                 [4, 0, 0, 1],
                 [1, 1, 0, 5],
                 [1, 0, 0, 4]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Perform SVD
U, S, V = tf.linalg.svd(R)

# Reconstruct the matrix using the top k singular values (dimensionality reduction)
k = 2 #Number of singular values to retain
S_k = tf.linalg.diag(S[:k])
R_approx = tf.matmul(U[:, :k], tf.matmul(S_k, V[:k, :]))

print("Original Matrix:\n", R.numpy())
print("\nApproximated Matrix:\n", R_approx.numpy())
```

This example leverages TensorFlow's built-in `tf.linalg.svd` function for a direct SVD calculation.  The reconstruction utilizes only the top *k* singular values, thus achieving dimensionality reduction.  Note that this is a straightforward application of SVD; for larger matrices, more computationally efficient algorithms might be necessary.  This approach is particularly suited for cases where a direct decomposition is acceptable and the data characteristics align well with the assumptions of SVD.

**Example 2:  Alternating Least Squares (ALS) for Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data matrix (non-negative)
R = tf.constant([[5, 3, 0, 1],
                 [4, 0, 0, 1],
                 [1, 1, 0, 5],
                 [1, 0, 0, 4]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Define the latent factors
latent_dim = 2
P = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((R.shape[0], latent_dim)), dtype=tf.float32)
Q = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((R.shape[1], latent_dim)), dtype=tf.float32)

# Optimization parameters
learning_rate = 0.01
epochs = 1000

# Optimization loop (ALS)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        R_approx = tf.matmul(P, Q, transpose_b=True)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(R - R_approx))

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [P, Q])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [P, Q]))

print("Approximated Matrix:\n", tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(P, Q, transpose_b=True)).numpy())

```

This example implements a simplified Alternating Least Squares (ALS) approach for NMF.  ALS iteratively updates *P* and *Q*, holding one constant while optimizing the other.  The `tf.nn.relu` activation ensures non-negativity, a key characteristic of NMF.  This method is particularly advantageous when dealing with large sparse matrices, offering better scalability than direct methods.  However, it's an iterative approach, requiring a predefined number of epochs for convergence.  Note the use of the Adam optimizer; other optimizers could be employed depending on the specific application.

**Example 3: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for Matrix Factorization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample data matrix (sparse representation assumed for efficiency)
R = tf.sparse.SparseTensor([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [2, 3]], [5, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4])

# Define latent factors
latent_dim = 2
P = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((R.dense_shape[0], latent_dim)))
Q = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((R.dense_shape[1], latent_dim)))

# Optimization parameters
learning_rate = 0.01
epochs = 1000

# Optimization loop (SGD)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=learning_rate)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i, j, rating in tf.sparse.to_dense(R):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            prediction = tf.reduce_sum(tf.gather(P, i) * tf.gather(Q, j))
            loss = tf.square(rating - prediction)

        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [P, Q])
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [P, Q]))

print("Approximated Matrix (sparse):\n", tf.matmul(P, Q, transpose_b=True).numpy())
```

This example demonstrates a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) approach, particularly suited for very large sparse matrices.  Instead of processing the entire matrix in each iteration, SGD updates the factor matrices based on individual entries.  This reduces computational complexity significantly but might require more epochs to converge.  The example utilizes a sparse tensor representation, which is crucial for efficiency when dealing with large datasets containing mostly zero entries.  Again, the choice of optimizer is flexible, with alternatives potentially providing faster convergence.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Matrix Computations" by Golub and Van Loan provides a thorough mathematical foundation.  "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville offers a broader context within the field of machine learning.  Finally, the TensorFlow documentation and associated tutorials serve as invaluable practical guides for implementing these techniques effectively.  Careful study of these resources will provide a robust understanding of the underlying theory and its practical applications.  Remember to consider the computational complexities and scalability implications of each approach before selecting an implementation for a given task.  Experimentation and careful evaluation of results are key to successful application of these techniques.
