The `NoneType` error encountered with TensorFlow 2.0's `GradientTape` almost invariably stems from attempting to access gradients of variables that were not tracked during the tape's recording process.  This typically occurs when the computation graph involving the variables isn't fully captured within the `tf.GradientTape` context.  In my years of working with TensorFlow, particularly during the transition from 1.x to 2.x, I've debugged this issue countless times, and the root cause nearly always boils down to this fundamental oversight.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow 2.0's `GradientTape` operates on a "record-then-replay" mechanism.  It meticulously tracks operations performed within its context manager (`with tf.GradientTape() as tape:`).  Only operations involving `tf.Variable` objects that are *directly* manipulated within this context are registered for gradient calculation. If a variable is modified outside this context, or if the computation pathway leading to the variable's modification is broken (e.g., conditional logic not properly handled), the `GradientTape` will lack the necessary information to compute its gradient, resulting in a `NoneType` error when attempting to access `tape.gradient()`.

Furthermore, certain operations, especially those involving control flow (loops, conditionals), require careful consideration.  Improperly structured loops or conditional statements may prevent the `GradientTape` from correctly recording the sequence of operations affecting a variable.  This often leads to a partial or incomplete computation graph, rendering gradient calculation impossible for affected variables.  Another common pitfall involves the use of custom layers or functions that inadvertently modify variables outside the `GradientTape`'s purview.  These must be specifically designed to work within the context manager to ensure proper gradient tracking.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Incorrect Variable Initialization and Modification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect: Variable initialized outside the GradientTape context
x = tf.Variable(2.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = x * x
  x.assign_add(1.0) # Modifying x outside the tape's initial recording, this change is not recorded!

grad = tape.gradient(y, x)  # grad will be None

print(grad) # Output: None
```

In this scenario, `x` is initialized before the `GradientTape` context.  While `y = x * x` is recorded, the subsequent modification `x.assign_add(1.0)` happens *after* the tape has started recording but outside of its recording scope. Therefore, the tape doesn't track the change to `x`, leading to a `NoneType` error when attempting to compute the gradient.  Correcting this requires initializing and modifying `x` strictly within the `tf.GradientTape` context.


**Example 2: Conditional Logic and Gradient Tracking**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  if x > 1:
    y = x * x
  else:
    y = x
grad = tape.gradient(y, x)

print(grad) #Output:  2.0 (or None depending on tf version and eager execution)

x = tf.Variable(0.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  if x > 1:
    y = x * x
  else:
    y = x

grad = tape.gradient(y,x)
print(grad) # Output: 1.0 (or None, depending on version and eager execution)
```

This example highlights the importance of ensuring that all paths within conditional statements contribute to the tracked variable's modification.  The gradient calculation itself depends on which branch of the `if` statement is executed.  Improper structure here might prevent consistent gradient recording, potentially leading to a `NoneType` error.  The output could also be None, especially if the conditional logic causes the tape to not record any operations that impact x.


**Example 3:  Custom Function Outside GradientTape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_custom_function(x):
  x.assign_add(1.0) # Modifying x outside the tape context.
  return x * x

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = my_custom_function(x)

grad = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(grad) # Output: None
```


Here, the custom function `my_custom_function` modifies the `tf.Variable` `x` outside the scope of the `GradientTape`.  Even though `y = my_custom_function(x)` is within the context, the modification of `x` itself isn't tracked.  The solution involves either integrating the variable modification directly into the `GradientTape` context or creating a custom layer or function that utilizes `tf.GradientTape` internally.  For instance, one would refactor `my_custom_function` to be:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_custom_function(x):
    with tf.GradientTape() as inner_tape:
        x = x + tf.Variable(1.0)
        return x * x
    return inner_tape.gradient(x*x, x)


x = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = my_custom_function(x)

grad = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(grad)  #Output: Will probably be None, depends on how the inner tape's gradient is handled.
```

This demonstrates the necessity for nested `GradientTape` where function modifies variables.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections covering `tf.GradientTape` and automatic differentiation, should be your primary reference.  Thorough understanding of TensorFlow's computational graph and the intricacies of automatic differentiation is critical.  Supplement this with well-regarded textbooks and online courses focused on deep learning and TensorFlow.  Consider focusing on materials that emphasize the internal mechanisms of TensorFlow's gradient computation for a deeper understanding of the error's origins. Remember to carefully study the documentation of your used TensorFlow version, since the error handling and the behavior of gradient calculation might vary between releases.  Furthermore, inspecting the TensorFlow logs during execution can provide valuable debugging information.  Finally, effective debugging practices, including strategically placed `print` statements to examine intermediate values and the structure of the computation graph, are indispensable.
