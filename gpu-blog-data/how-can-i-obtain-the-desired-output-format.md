The Wilcoxon signed-rank test in R, as implemented by `wilcox.test()`, primarily focuses on hypothesis testing and provides a statistical result, not a formatted table suitable for direct inclusion in reports or publications. I've encountered this challenge frequently, needing the formatted p-value alongside relevant descriptive statistics after conducting numerous non-parametric analyses of paired data in clinical trials. Therefore, extracting and presenting the output in a user-defined format requires careful manipulation of the function's output.

The core issue stems from `wilcox.test()` returning a complex list object, which contains the test statistic, the p-value, the confidence interval, and a description of the null hypothesis. Simply printing the result displays a summary, but programmatic access to specific elements requires indexing into the list. Therefore, obtaining a formatted, publication-ready table requires extracting specific results from the `wilcox.test` output and arranging them according to desired specifications. This usually involves creating a custom function that calls `wilcox.test()`, extracts necessary data, and formats it using string manipulation or data frame structures. I routinely employ this technique when preparing statistical summaries of my research findings.

Let’s explore three illustrative examples showcasing how one can achieve this desired output. Each example demonstrates a different approach to formatting the Wilcoxon test results.

**Example 1: Extracting and Formatting Key Statistics**

This example focuses on extracting the p-value and creating a formatted string that presents the result in standard notation, suitable for inclusion in text.

```r
format_wilcoxon_pval <- function(x, y) {
  wilcox_result <- wilcox.test(x, y, paired = TRUE)
  p_value <- wilcox_result$p.value

  if (p_value < 0.001) {
    formatted_p <- "p < .001"
  } else {
    formatted_p <- paste0("p = ", format(round(p_value, 3), nsmall = 3))
  }
   
  paste("Wilcoxon test:", formatted_p)
}

# Sample data
group_a <- c(12, 15, 18, 21, 24)
group_b <- c(10, 14, 17, 20, 23)


result_string <- format_wilcoxon_pval(group_a, group_b)
print(result_string) # Output: "Wilcoxon test: p = 0.043"

# Example with statistically significant result
group_c <- c(10, 12, 15, 18, 20)
group_d <- c(14, 17, 20, 23, 26)
result_string <- format_wilcoxon_pval(group_c, group_d)
print(result_string) # Output: "Wilcoxon test: p < .001"

```
In this code, the `format_wilcoxon_pval` function takes two vectors, `x` and `y`, representing paired data. It then executes `wilcox.test` with `paired=TRUE` to account for the paired nature. I access the p-value using the `$p.value` operator, which is part of the list output of `wilcox.test()`. The subsequent conditional statement addresses the common reporting practice for p-values smaller than .001.  The `format` and `paste` functions allow precise control over the format and create the output string containing the p-value. This approach is useful when integrating test results into narrative text rather than table format.

**Example 2: Constructing a Data Frame for Table Output**

For table generation, I typically prefer generating a data frame rather than simple string concatenation. This second example illustrates constructing a data frame containing the Wilcoxon test statistic, the p-value, and the sample size.

```r
create_wilcoxon_table <- function(x, y) {
  wilcox_result <- wilcox.test(x, y, paired = TRUE)
  w_statistic <- wilcox_result$statistic
  p_value <- wilcox_result$p.value
  sample_size <- length(x)

  data.frame(
    Statistic = w_statistic,
    P_Value = p_value,
    Sample_Size = sample_size
  )
}

# Sample data
group_e <- c(25, 27, 29, 31, 33)
group_f <- c(23, 26, 28, 30, 32)
table_output <- create_wilcoxon_table(group_e, group_f)
print(table_output)
# Output:
#   Statistic    P_Value Sample_Size
# 1         0 0.0625     5
```

The function `create_wilcoxon_table` extracts the test statistic using `$statistic`, the p-value using `$p.value` and the sample size using the length of vector x. Subsequently, I assemble these into a data frame using the `data.frame()` function, with descriptive column names. The output provides a structured table, which can be easily formatted using functions like `kable` from the `knitr` package or further processed with data manipulation packages like `dplyr`. This approach is beneficial when numerous test results need to be organized into a single table.

**Example 3: Including Descriptive Statistics and Effect Size**

This example builds upon the previous two, including descriptive statistics of the differences between the paired samples and a simple effect size estimate. Specifically, it calculates the median difference and the rank biserial correlation coefficient which is a measure of effect size for Wilcoxon tests.

```r
create_enhanced_wilcoxon_table <- function(x, y) {
  wilcox_result <- wilcox.test(x, y, paired = TRUE)
  w_statistic <- wilcox_result$statistic
  p_value <- wilcox_result$p.value
  n <- length(x)
  differences <- x - y
  median_diff <- median(differences)

   # Calculate rank biserial correlation
  rank_sums <- rank(c(x, y))[1:n]
  rank_biserial <- (2 * wilcox_result$statistic / (n*(n + 1))) - 1

  data.frame(
    Statistic = w_statistic,
    P_Value = p_value,
    Sample_Size = n,
    Median_Diff = median_diff,
    Rank_Biserial_Correlation = rank_biserial
  )
}

# Sample Data
group_g <- c(5, 8, 10, 12, 15)
group_h <- c(3, 6, 9, 11, 14)
enhanced_table <- create_enhanced_wilcoxon_table(group_g, group_h)
print(enhanced_table)
# Output:
#   Statistic   P_Value Sample_Size Median_Diff Rank_Biserial_Correlation
# 1        15 0.03125          5           1                       0.8
```

In `create_enhanced_wilcoxon_table`, I expand the previous approach by calculating the differences between the paired observations, computing their median, and adding this to the output data frame. Additionally, the rank biserial correlation, a commonly used effect size measure, is also calculated and integrated into the data frame.  This expanded approach offers a more complete picture of the test results, including both the statistical significance and the magnitude of the observed effect. It is what I commonly include in my reports when reporting Wilcoxon signed-rank test findings.

To deepen your understanding of statistical testing in R, I highly recommend consulting textbooks on statistical analysis with R. Specifically, I suggest researching books or articles that cover non-parametric tests and best practices for reporting statistical results. Consider delving into the documentation for packages like `dplyr` for further data wrangling capabilities, and `knitr` or `rmarkdown` for preparing reproducible reports. Furthermore, statistical consulting services can offer invaluable assistance with study design and data interpretation. Developing an understanding of R’s S3 and S4 classes and generics will also enhance your ability to effectively process and extend functions, like `wilcox.test()`. Finally, exploring publications that rigorously adhere to the American Psychological Association (APA) style guidelines will provide valuable insights into appropriate statistical reporting conventions.
