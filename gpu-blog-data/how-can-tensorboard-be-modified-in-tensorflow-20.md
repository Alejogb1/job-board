TensorBoard's extensibility in TensorFlow 2.0 relies heavily on the concept of custom plugins.  My experience developing a high-performance anomaly detection system for financial time series heavily leveraged this capability, necessitating significant customization beyond TensorBoard's default functionality.  Direct modification of TensorBoard's core codebase is generally discouraged due to maintainability concerns; the plugin architecture provides a cleaner, more robust approach.

**1.  Understanding the Plugin Architecture:**

TensorBoard operates by loading plugins dynamically. These plugins define specific visualizations and functionalities, each residing within its own directory structure.  This modularity allows developers to add new visualization types, modify existing ones, or integrate with external data sources without altering TensorBoard's core.  Each plugin requires a specific directory structure including a `plugin.json` file declaring its metadata and one or more Python files handling data loading and visualization. The `plugin.json` file is crucial, specifying the plugin's name, version, and the path to its frontend components (typically written in JavaScript).


**2.  Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate how to create custom TensorBoard plugins for TensorFlow 2.0.  They're simplified for clarity, but demonstrate core concepts.


**Example 1:  Custom Scalar Summary:**

This plugin adds a new scalar summary type that displays data as a gauge.

```python
# plugin/my_gauge_plugin/plugin.json
{
  "name": "my_gauge_plugin",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Custom gauge scalar plugin",
  "frontend": "out/my_gauge_plugin.js"
}

# plugin/my_gauge_plugin/my_gauge_plugin.py
import tensorflow as tf

class MyGaugePlugin(tf.summary.experimental.CustomSummary):
    def __init__(self, value, name):
        super().__init__(name)
        self._value = value

    def create_summary(self, name, data):
        return tf.summary.scalar(name, data)

def my_gauge(name, value, step):
    my_gauge_plugin = MyGaugePlugin(value, name)
    with tf.summary.create_file_writer('./logs').as_default():
        tf.summary.experimental.write_custom_summary(step, my_gauge_plugin, value)

# Example usage:
tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    for i in range(100):
        my_gauge("my_gauge", i, i)
        # ... rest of your training loop
```

```javascript
// plugin/my_gauge_plugin/out/my_gauge_plugin.js
// ...  (Javascript code to render a gauge using the scalar data received from the python plugin) ...
```

This example defines a custom plugin class extending `tf.summary.experimental.CustomSummary`.  It overrides the `create_summary` method to handle the data formatting for the scalar summary.  The `my_gauge` function handles writing the data to TensorBoard logs using `tf.summary.experimental.write_custom_summary`. The JavaScript frontend (not shown here for brevity) would then receive this data and render it as a gauge.  Note that the frontend development requires knowledge of JavaScript and web development frameworks.

**Example 2:  Extended Histogram Visualization:**

This expands on the standard histogram by adding percentile calculations.

```python
# plugin/percentile_histogram/plugin.json
{
  "name": "percentile_histogram",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Histogram with percentile calculations",
  "frontend": "out/percentile_histogram.js"
}

# plugin/percentile_histogram/percentile_histogram.py
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class PercentileHistogram(tf.summary.experimental.CustomSummary):
  def __init__(self, name):
    super().__init__(name)

  def create_summary(self, name, data):
    hist = tf.compat.v1.summary.histogram(name, data)
    percentiles = np.percentile(data, [25, 50, 75])
    return tf.compat.v1.Summary(value=[tf.compat.v1.Summary.Value(tag=name + "_p25", simple_value=percentiles[0]),
                                      tf.compat.v1.Summary.Value(tag=name + "_p50", simple_value=percentiles[1]),
                                      tf.compat.v1.Summary.Value(tag=name + "_p75", simple_value=percentiles[2])])

# Example Usage
tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    for i in range(100):
        data = np.random.randn(1000)
        with tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter('./logs') as writer:
            summary = PercentileHistogram("my_hist").create_summary("my_hist", data)
            writer.add_summary(summary, i)
        # ... rest of your training loop
```

```javascript
// plugin/percentile_histogram/out/percentile_histogram.js
// ... (Javascript code to receive the histogram data and percentile values to render enhanced visualization) ...
```

This example demonstrates adding supplementary data to an existing visualization type.  It calculates percentiles and adds them as separate scalar summaries alongside the standard histogram.  Again, the JavaScript frontend would be responsible for visually integrating these additional data points within the histogram.

**Example 3:  Custom Image Visualization with Metadata:**

This plugin displays images with accompanying metadata like class labels.

```python
# plugin/image_with_labels/plugin.json
{
  "name": "image_with_labels",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Images with class labels",
  "frontend": "out/image_with_labels.js"
}

# plugin/image_with_labels/image_with_labels.py
import tensorflow as tf

class ImageWithLabels(tf.summary.experimental.CustomSummary):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name)

    def create_summary(self, name, image_data, labels):
      image_summary = tf.image.encode_png(image_data)
      label_summary = tf.io.encode_base64(tf.constant(labels.encode()))
      return tf.compat.v1.Summary(value=[tf.compat.v1.Summary.Value(tag=name, image=tf.compat.v1.Summary.Image(encoded_image_string=image_summary)),
                                          tf.compat.v1.Summary.Value(tag=name + "_label", simple_value=label_summary)])

#Example usage
tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    for i in range(10):
        image = np.random.randint(0, 255, size=(28, 28, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
        label = f"Class: {i}"
        with tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter('./logs') as writer:
            summary = ImageWithLabels("my_image").create_summary("my_image", image, label)
            writer.add_summary(summary, i)
        # ... rest of your training loop

```

```javascript
// plugin/image_with_labels/out/image_with_labels.js
// ... (Javascript code to decode the base64 encoded label and display it alongside the image) ...
```

This example showcases embedding additional information, in this case class labels, directly into the summary. The frontend code would need to handle decoding and display. This enhances the image visualization by providing context.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation on custom summaries and plugins.  Advanced JavaScript frameworks for data visualization such as D3.js or Plotly.js, depending on your visualization requirements.  Understanding of web development concepts (HTML, CSS, Javascript) will prove highly beneficial.


In conclusion, effectively modifying TensorBoard's behavior in TensorFlow 2.0 involves leveraging its plugin architecture. This allows for extending functionality without directly altering the core codebase. While this requires knowledge of both Python and JavaScript, it provides a far more maintainable and robust solution compared to attempting direct modifications of the TensorBoard source code.  Remember to thoroughly test your custom plugins before deploying them into a production environment.
