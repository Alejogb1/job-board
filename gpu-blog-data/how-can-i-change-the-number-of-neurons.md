Modifying the number of neurons in a Keras layer is fundamentally about altering the dimensionality of the layer's output.  This directly impacts the model's capacity to learn complex patterns from the input data.  During my work on a large-scale image classification project involving millions of satellite images, I frequently encountered the need to fine-tune layer sizes to optimize model performance and computational efficiency.  Understanding this impact is crucial for successful deep learning model development.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The number of neurons in a layer dictates the dimensionality of its output.  Each neuron represents a feature learned by the network. Increasing the number of neurons increases the model's capacity to learn more complex features, potentially improving accuracy, but also increasing computational cost and the risk of overfitting. Conversely, reducing the number of neurons decreases model capacity, potentially simplifying the learned features, reducing computational demands and overfitting risk but also potentially reducing accuracy.

The modification process depends on the type of layer.  For densely connected (Dense) layers, adjusting the neuron count is straightforward.  For convolutional (Conv2D) layers, the number of filters directly corresponds to the number of neurons in the output.  For recurrent (LSTM, GRU) layers, adjusting the number of units alters the dimensionality of the hidden state.

Changing the number of neurons requires modifying the layer's definition during model construction.  It cannot be done during model training (except through specific techniques like dynamic neural networks which are beyond the scope of this response). The modified model then needs to be recompiled before further training or inference.

Failure to recompile after modifying a layer's configuration can lead to unpredictable behavior and incorrect results, as the model's internal structure and weight matrices are not updated to reflect the new architecture.  I've personally encountered this issue while experimenting with different architectures, leading to hours of debugging before realizing the necessity for recompilation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Modifying a Dense Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Original model with 64 neurons in the dense layer
model_original = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Modified model with 128 neurons
model_modified = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model_modified.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... proceed with model training and evaluation ...
```

This example demonstrates how to change the number of neurons in a dense layer from 64 to 128.  The `input_shape` remains unchanged, as the input dimensionality is not affected by the change in the hidden layer. Note the recompilation step after creating the modified model.


**Example 2: Modifying a Conv2D Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Original model with 32 filters
model_original = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Modified model with 64 filters
model_modified = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model_modified.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... proceed with model training and evaluation ...
```

Here, the number of filters in the convolutional layer is modified from 32 to 64.  Increasing the number of filters typically leads to a richer feature representation, but also significantly increases the number of parameters in the model.


**Example 3:  Modifying an LSTM Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Original model with 32 LSTM units
model_original = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(32, input_shape=(100, 1)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])


# Modified model with 64 LSTM units
model_modified = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(100, 1)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model_modified.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# ... proceed with model training and evaluation ...
```

This example illustrates changing the number of units in an LSTM layer from 32 to 64. The `input_shape` remains the same, reflecting the unchanged sequence length and feature dimensionality.  The change affects the size of the hidden state vector maintained by the LSTM.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of Keras layer types and their functionalities, consult the official Keras documentation.  Furthermore, deep learning textbooks focusing on neural network architectures and practical implementation will provide a strong foundation.  Finally, exploring research papers on network architecture search and hyperparameter optimization is invaluable for understanding advanced strategies in layer size selection.
