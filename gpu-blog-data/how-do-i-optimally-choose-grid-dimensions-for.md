Achieving optimal performance with CUDA reduction kernels hinges critically on selecting appropriate grid and block dimensions. This choice significantly impacts memory access patterns, warp occupancy, and overall kernel efficiency. My experience with developing high-performance scientific computing applications on NVIDIA GPUs has shown that there is no single "best" dimension; instead, an informed decision depends on the problem size, the available compute resources of the target architecture, and the specifics of the reduction algorithm.

Fundamentally, CUDA reduction involves combining values across a data set into a single result. This process can be parallelized using thread blocks, where each block performs a partial reduction, and subsequently, the partial results are combined across blocks, typically in host code or with a final device-side reduction. The grid dimensions determine the number of these blocks and their organization, while block dimensions dictate the number of threads within each block. The total number of threads spawned for a kernel invocation is thus the product of grid dimensions and block dimensions.

When selecting these dimensions, it's crucial to consider factors related to memory access patterns and the architecture's multiprocessor configuration. Inefficient choices can lead to bank conflicts, thread divergence, and underutilized resources. Specifically:

* **Block Size:** A block must be large enough to allow for sufficient parallelism but small enough to fit within the limited shared memory of a streaming multiprocessor (SM). Too few threads per block reduce occupancy, which means there are fewer active warps, and the GPU core doesn't have sufficient work to hide memory latency. On the other hand, too many threads can exhaust the available registers, leading to register spills to global memory, a performance killer. Furthermore, using thread blocks that are not evenly divisible by warp sizes (typically 32) leads to wasted processing power and warp divergence, as threads in the same warp take different control paths.
* **Grid Size:** The grid size should be large enough to cover all elements to be reduced. Choosing a large grid will give more threads to process the input dataset and allow higher total throughput, and smaller grids might result in underutilization. However, large grids may have to make more global memory accesses, as the final reductions happen between block partial reduction results. There is a balance to achieve here.

Let's illustrate this with examples. Consider a scenario where we need to reduce a large vector of floating-point numbers.

**Example 1: Simple Reduction with Power-of-Two Block Size**

This example showcases a basic reduction implementation, emphasizing the importance of block sizes that are multiples of warp size, and are reasonably sized to fill a streaming multiprocessor (SM). A common practice is to use thread blocks with 256 threads. In the following code, we also show a technique of reducing shared memory per block size that will reduce the need for block level reduction further by utilizing the shared memory as well as the global memory.

```cpp
__global__ void reduce_simple(float *input, float *output, int size) {
    extern __shared__ float sdata[];
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    float localSum = 0;

    if (i < size) {
        localSum = input[i];
    }

    sdata[tid] = localSum;

    __syncthreads();

    for(int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
        if (tid < s) {
            sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + s];
        }
      __syncthreads();
    }


    if (tid == 0) {
      atomicAdd(output, sdata[0]);
    }

}
```
In this example, the `reduce_simple` kernel uses `extern __shared__ float sdata[]` for shared memory allocation that has to be passed in during runtime. The input is read into the shared memory, each thread will reduce its part of data in shared memory by repeatedly reducing two neighboring values. `__syncthreads()` calls ensure that all threads are synchronized, and that data is consistent for reads and writes. Finally, thread 0 within each block writes its partial sum to the global memory location `output` using `atomicAdd` to avoid conflicts, as partial sum from blocks will be aggregated here. For this kernel, I would choose a block size of 256 and a grid size to cover the full input size. Using larger block sizes would require larger shared memory allocation.

**Example 2: Reduction with Warp-Level Optimization**

The performance of the previous example can be greatly improved by employing warp-level reduction, which leverages the implicit synchronization within a warp. This example also illustrates the strategy of increasing block utilization by reducing number of steps for shared memory reduction.

```cpp
__global__ void reduce_warp(float *input, float *output, int size) {
    extern __shared__ float sdata[];
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    float localSum = 0;

    if (i < size) {
        localSum = input[i];
    }

    sdata[tid] = localSum;

    __syncthreads();


    for(int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 32; s >>= 1) {
      if(tid < s) {
            sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + s];
      }
      __syncthreads();
    }


    if(tid < 32) {
      for(int offset = 16; offset > 0; offset >>= 1){
        localSum += __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, localSum, offset);
      }
      if(tid == 0) atomicAdd(output, localSum);

    }
}
```

Here, the reduction within a warp is handled by using `__shfl_down_sync`, which is a warp shuffle function. This function can bring data from other threads in the warp without accessing shared memory. In each warp, thread 0 performs the final accumulation and writes to global memory. Note that if number of threads in a block is not exactly divisible by 32, some threads will be unused. This example highlights how leveraging architectural features can lead to a more performant implementation by removing the need for excessive shared memory sync operations. For this kernel, I also would choose a block size of 256, but there are significant performance gains if larger block sizes can be used.

**Example 3: Tree-Based Reduction with Dynamic Parallelism**

For very large datasets, hierarchical, tree-based reductions might be a more optimal strategy. This approach is significantly more complex, and I have found that the benefits can be significant if tuned correctly. A key ingredient of this strategy is to reduce in each block and then reduce between blocks in a separate kernel call. We further utilize dynamic parallelism here, where we launch one kernel for the reduction within the block and then launch a kernel from the first kernel to reduce between blocks.

```cpp
__global__ void block_reduce_kernel(float *input, float *output, int size){
    extern __shared__ float sdata[];
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    float localSum = 0;

    if(i < size){
      localSum = input[i];
    }

    sdata[tid] = localSum;

    __syncthreads();


    for(int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
        if (tid < s) {
            sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + s];
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

    if(tid == 0){
      output[blockIdx.x] = sdata[0];
    }
}


__global__ void grid_reduce_kernel(float *input, float* output, int size){
    extern __shared__ float sdata[];
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    float localSum = 0;

    if (i < size) {
        localSum = input[i];
    }

    sdata[tid] = localSum;

    __syncthreads();


    for(int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
      if(tid < s) {
        sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + s];
      }
      __syncthreads();
    }


    if (tid == 0) {
      atomicAdd(output, sdata[0]);
    }
}


__global__ void launch_tree_reduce(float *input, float *output, int size){

    int block_size = 256;

    int num_blocks = (size + block_size - 1) / block_size;
    float* block_reduction_output;

    cudaMalloc((void **)&block_reduction_output, num_blocks * sizeof(float));


    block_reduce_kernel<<<num_blocks, block_size, block_size*sizeof(float)>>>(input, block_reduction_output, size);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    if(num_blocks > 1){
      int grid_reduce_size = (num_blocks + block_size - 1) / block_size;
      grid_reduce_kernel<<<grid_reduce_size, block_size, block_size*sizeof(float)>>>(block_reduction_output, output, num_blocks);
      cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    } else {
      cudaMemcpy(output, block_reduction_output, sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);
    }

   cudaFree(block_reduction_output);

}
```

In this example, `launch_tree_reduce` kernel will take the input and size and allocate and call kernel `block_reduce_kernel` to do partial reduction from the input, and store the partial reduction in the allocated memory. It will then launch `grid_reduce_kernel` to do the reduce between the partial reduction output. Here, a block size of 256 is chosen, but a good choice is dependent on the specific problem. This example highlights how tree based approach, using nested kernel call, is a good choice for large dataset. This is an area where careful benchmarking can be very helpful for optimization.

Choosing the best grid and block dimensions requires careful consideration. For optimal performance, it's crucial to empirically evaluate different configurations and to understand the target GPU's architecture, including warp size, the number of SMs, shared memory size, and the number of registers. Start with sizes that are multiples of the warp size (e.g., 32, 64, 128, 256), and adjust grid dimensions to ensure all data is processed.

For resources, I recommend consulting the NVIDIA CUDA documentation, specifically the programming guide, which provides a wealth of information about the architecture. Look for the optimization guides, which describe how to maximize hardware utilization. Additionally, books focused on CUDA programming such as those available through university coursework can provide theoretical and practical knowledge for further study. Furthermore, I recommend reading NVIDIA technical blogs, which detail specific optimization techniques. There are many excellent books as well, that cover parallel computing. Ultimately, practical experimentation with different sizes on the target GPU and utilizing the CUDA profiler to identify bottlenecks is indispensable for optimal performance.
