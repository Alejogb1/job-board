Pretrained models in PyTorch, particularly those based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), frequently form the backbone of transfer learning workflows. A significant performance optimization involves caching their intermediate feature activations, avoiding redundant computations during iterative training phases. Recalculating feature maps from the same input data at each epoch wastes computational resources and extends training time. Efficiently leveraging these pretrained layers requires strategic extraction and storage of features.

When using a pretrained network for feature extraction, the typical forward pass involves feeding the input through the pretrained layers. During backpropagation, only the parameters of newly added layers (e.g., classifiers or regression heads) are updated. The pretrained layer's parameters remain fixed unless fine-tuning is employed. This fixed nature provides an opportunity to precompute feature maps, storing them for subsequent reuse in all epochs. Instead of performing this calculation repetitively, features can be extracted once before the training loop begins, thereby reducing the workload at each epoch.

A key aspect of efficient feature caching involves understanding the network architecture and selecting an appropriate layer to act as the feature extractor. This layer should generally be somewhere near the end of the convolutional base, immediately before the classifier head. Selecting the right layer represents a trade-off: using earlier layers might capture more low-level features, often less informative for the final task, while selecting layers too close to the output might result in loss of discriminative information.

In my experience training various computer vision models, choosing a layer within the penultimate block of ResNet or similar architectures has often been successful. I typically identify the layer I wish to use and then modify the model's forward method to return only the activations from this layer. This involves creating a new 'feature extraction' model, which takes in input data, processes it through the necessary layers, and outputs the feature representation.

The first code example demonstrates a class that encapsulates this feature extraction logic:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

class FeatureExtractor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, pretrained_model, feature_layer):
        super(FeatureExtractor, self).__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(*list(pretrained_model.children())[:feature_layer])

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.features(x)

# Example Usage
resnet18 = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor(resnet18, feature_layer=8) # using the 8th child as feature layer
feature_extractor.eval() #Important to switch to eval mode

#Sample data
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
extracted_features = feature_extractor(dummy_input)
print(extracted_features.shape) #torch.Size([1, 256, 28, 28]) for resnet18
```

This `FeatureExtractor` class creates a new model that includes only the layers up to the `feature_layer` specified. I chose the `feature_layer` manually in this case based on ResNet18's architecture; for ResNet18, the 8th module was the output of layer 3. The `eval()` mode ensures dropout and batchnorm layers behave in evaluation mode, crucial when the model is only used for inference or feature extraction. For different architectures, the specific integer value associated with the desired layer will change according to the module list order. The returned shape is important because it defines the input size of downstream classifier or regression models.

The second code example demonstrates how to cache the extracted features before the training loop:

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
import numpy as np

#Assume you have your training data as x_train, y_train (numpy array or tensor), batch size 32
# x_train shape is (1000,3,224,224) and y_train shape (1000,)
x_train = torch.randn(1000,3,224,224)
y_train = torch.randint(0,10,(1000,))
batch_size=32

feature_extractor.to('cuda') #Move feature extractor to GPU
x_train = x_train.to('cuda')

with torch.no_grad():
    features = []
    dataloader = DataLoader(TensorDataset(x_train,y_train), batch_size=batch_size)
    for batch_x,_ in dataloader:
         batch_features = feature_extractor(batch_x).cpu() #Move the feature to CPU for storage
         features.append(batch_features)
    cached_features = torch.cat(features, dim=0)


print(cached_features.shape) #torch.Size([1000, 256, 28, 28])
cached_dataset= TensorDataset(cached_features, y_train)
train_dataloader = DataLoader(cached_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
```
Here, I first move the `feature_extractor` to the GPU, ensuring maximum calculation speed during the feature extraction process. A dataloader is used to efficiently process the data. Within the loop, the features are calculated for each batch and then moved to the CPU, then appended into a Python list to later be stacked. Using `torch.no_grad()` is vital because I don't need to store the gradient information from the feature extraction step, improving memory efficiency. Finally, I make a new dataloader using the cached feature to train a new classifier head.  This newly created dataloader can then be used within the standard PyTorch training loop.

The third code example demonstrates how to train a new simple classifier layer on these cached features:

```python
#Define new classifier
class SimpleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, feature_size, num_classes):
        super(SimpleClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1),
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(feature_size,num_classes)
        )
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.classifier(x)

classifier = SimpleClassifier(256,10) # Assuming the feature size from the previous step
classifier.to('cuda') #Move classifier to GPU


criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(classifier.parameters(), lr=0.001)
num_epochs = 5
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i, (batch_features, batch_labels) in enumerate(train_dataloader):
         batch_features = batch_features.to('cuda')
         batch_labels = batch_labels.to('cuda')

         outputs = classifier(batch_features)
         loss = criterion(outputs, batch_labels)
         optimizer.zero_grad()
         loss.backward()
         optimizer.step()

         if(i % 10 == 0):
             print (f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Step [{i+1}/{len(train_dataloader)}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

Here, the classifier takes the previously cached feature representation as input. Note that the size of the fully connected layer must match the output feature size of the extracted layer. The training loop is standard and does not require any modification as we are feeding the cached pre-computed features. By following this approach, we eliminate redundant computations within the training loop, dramatically reducing training times, especially when dealing with large datasets.

For deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of PyTorch models, I suggest exploring the official PyTorch documentation, specifically focusing on the `torch.nn` and `torch.optim` modules. Additionally, detailed tutorials on transfer learning and feature extraction using pretrained networks, commonly found in popular deep learning educational resources, can provide further context. Lastly, examination of the source code for various pretrained model architectures in `torchvision.models` is highly beneficial for developing a more concrete understanding of their internal structures and how to best manipulate them for transfer learning.
