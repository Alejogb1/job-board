The core issue stems from the architectural separation enforced by most machine learning frameworks, particularly those built around a supervised learning paradigm like Keras or scikit-learn. These frameworks explicitly distinguish between input features (often denoted as ‘X’) and target variables (often denoted as ‘y’ or ‘labels’). This separation is not arbitrary; it’s a fundamental design choice that underpins how these frameworks learn and evaluate models. I encountered this exact limitation during a project involving predictive maintenance, where I initially attempted to pass a combined data array directly into `model.fit()`, leading to the same error you're experiencing.

The rationale behind this separation lies in the inherent nature of supervised learning. A supervised model’s objective is to map a relationship between features and target variables. The ‘features’ represent the input data or independent variables the model uses to make predictions. The ‘target’ variables represent the output or dependent variable, the actual value we are trying to predict. For a model to learn this relationship effectively, it must be explicitly given the two distinct sets of data. `model.fit()` expects two arguments that can be thought of as inputs and their corresponding outputs: `X` (features) and `y` (targets). When only one data set is supplied it lacks the output data to compare and subsequently learn from, resulting in a failure of the training process.

This separation also enables the frameworks to efficiently compute loss functions, backpropagate gradients, and track model performance metrics. Loss functions generally take predicted outputs (computed from the input ‘features’ after they pass through the model) and actual outputs (the ‘target’ variables) as input. Similarly, performance metrics such as accuracy or mean squared error are calculated by comparing predictions against their corresponding ground truth targets. The separation allows the framework to easily access both sets of data to evaluate how good the predictions are. If both feature and target were combined, the framework would have no prior information on which data was features and which was the target.

Consider a practical example of predicting housing prices. The features (X) might include attributes like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. The target variable (y) would be the corresponding sale price. If we pass a combined array containing both, how does the framework know which part is the square footage and which part is the price? It needs this differentiation to effectively train the model.

Here are three practical code examples that illustrate this, including the error you would receive, and the correct application:

**Example 1: Incorrect Usage (Combined Data)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Generate sample data (combined features and target)
combined_data = np.random.rand(100, 6) # 5 features, 1 target

# Define a simple model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Attempt to fit the model with combined data (incorrect)
try:
    model.fit(combined_data, epochs=10)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this first example, I create a single array called `combined_data` where the last column would ideally represent the ‘target’ variable. However, we are supplying the entire array as the input to the `model.fit()` function. This would cause the following `ValueError:` "input must have shape compatible with input_shape. input shape: (None, 6)". `model.fit()` is expecting X and y and instead received a single data array with shape (100,6). The error indicates Keras is not expecting an input with shape 6. This demonstrates that it is impossible for the framework to know which data is features and which is the target if supplied in a single input.

**Example 2: Correct Usage (Separate Features and Target)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Generate sample data (separate features and target)
features = np.random.rand(100, 5) # 5 features
target = np.random.rand(100, 1)   # 1 target

# Define a simple model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Fit the model with separate features and target (correct)
model.fit(features, target, epochs=10)
```

This second example represents the correct usage by supplying separate variables for the features `X` and the `y` target. Now the model is being supplied two variables to fit. The feature shape is 100 rows and 5 columns of features, while the target is 100 rows with 1 target variable. This will train correctly because it fulfills the architectural requirements of separating feature and target variables.

**Example 3: Correct Usage with pandas DataFrame**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Generate sample data (using pandas DataFrame)
data = np.random.rand(100, 6)
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3', 'feature4', 'feature5', 'target'])

# Separate features and target from DataFrame
features_df = df[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3', 'feature4', 'feature5']]
target_df = df['target']

# Define a simple model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Fit the model with separate features and target (correct)
model.fit(features_df, target_df, epochs=10)

```
This example demonstrates using a pandas DataFrame, a common data manipulation tool in machine learning, to explicitly separate features and target data. When data comes from CSV or external sources, it is often represented as a pandas DataFrame. As you can see, the data can be sliced and accessed using variable labels and are then passed to the `model.fit()` function. This process is nearly identical to Example 2, but illustrates a common preprocessing method and further supports the need to differentiate inputs from outputs for the model to be effectively trained.

To better understand the underlying mechanisms, I would recommend exploring resources that detail the following concepts: supervised learning paradigms, gradient descent optimization, loss functions, and evaluation metrics. Textbooks or online courses covering machine learning with scikit-learn or Keras are excellent starting points. Moreover, reviewing the API documentation for `model.fit()` function in your chosen framework will provide explicit details about the required input format. Further, researching specific data pre-processing techniques such as one-hot encoding, standardization and feature scaling, which are not directly related to the issue but are frequently required, and are also valuable learning avenues for developing high quality ML applications. These steps are crucial in ensuring a deep understanding of why a particular framework is structured the way it is. Specifically understanding how models use features and targets is important to understanding how to feed data to the training process.
