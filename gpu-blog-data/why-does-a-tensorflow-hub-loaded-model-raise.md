The root cause of a `ValueError` indicating missing input arguments when using a TensorFlow Hub loaded model almost invariably stems from a mismatch between the model's expected input signature and the data you're providing.  My experience debugging hundreds of TensorFlow models, particularly those sourced from Hub, points to this as the primary culprit.  The error message itself often isn't specific enough to pinpoint the exact issue, demanding a meticulous examination of the model's requirements and the data's structure.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow Hub models, unlike custom-built models, come pre-packaged with a defined input signature. This signature, essentially a specification of expected input tensor shapes and data types, is implicitly or explicitly defined during the model's creation and saving process.  When you load a model via `hub.load`, TensorFlow maintains this signature internally.  The `ValueError` arises when the function call to your loaded model receives input tensors that violate this signature.  This violation can manifest in several ways:

* **Incorrect Number of Inputs:** The model expects a specific number of input tensors (e.g., image and text for a multimodal model), but you're providing more or fewer.
* **Inconsistent Tensor Shapes:** The dimensions of your input tensors (height, width, channels for images, sequence length for text) do not match the model's expectations. A common issue is forgetting to include a batch dimension.
* **Mismatched Data Types:**  The model anticipates input tensors of a certain data type (e.g., `tf.float32`, `tf.int32`), but you're providing tensors of a different type.
* **Incorrect Input Names:**  Some Hub models may utilize named inputs, requiring specific keyword arguments during the function call.  Failure to provide these named inputs, or providing them with incorrect names, results in errors.


To rectify this, you must thoroughly understand the model's input signature.  The best method is to consult the model's documentation, which ideally will specify the input tensor names, shapes, and data types.  Alternatively, you can programmatically inspect the model's signature.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Mismatched Number of Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

# Assume a model expecting image and text inputs
module_url = "some_model_url" # Replace with actual model URL
model = hub.load(module_url)

# Incorrect: Providing only one input
image = tf.random.normal((1, 224, 224, 3))
try:
    predictions = model(image)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"ValueError: {e}") # Expecting a ValueError here


# Correct: Providing both image and text inputs
image = tf.random.normal((1, 224, 224, 3))
text = tf.constant(["This is a sample sentence."])
predictions = model(image, text)
print(predictions)
```

This example demonstrates the common error of providing insufficient inputs.  A proper call requires both `image` and `text` according to the fictional model's (and likely actual models') expected signature.


**Example 2: Inconsistent Tensor Shapes**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

module_url = "some_model_url" # Replace with actual model URL
model = hub.load(module_url)

# Assume the model expects images with shape (1, 224, 224, 3)

# Incorrect: Missing batch dimension
image = tf.random.normal((224, 224, 3))
try:
  predictions = model(image)
except ValueError as e:
  print(f"ValueError: {e}")  # Expecting a ValueError because of missing batch dimension.


# Correct: Including the batch dimension
image = tf.random.normal((1, 224, 224, 3))
predictions = model(image)
print(predictions)
```

Here, the crucial batch dimension is omitted in the first attempt, leading to a shape mismatch. The corrected version explicitly includes the batch dimension (size 1 in this case).  Real-world applications would typically use larger batch sizes for efficiency.


**Example 3:  Mismatched Data Types and Named Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

module_url = "some_model_url" # Replace with actual model URL
model = hub.load(module_url)

# Assume model expects named inputs 'image:0' as tf.float32 and 'text:0' as tf.string

# Incorrect: Wrong data types
image = tf.constant([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], dtype=tf.int32) #Incorrect data type
text = tf.constant(["Example text"])

try:
  predictions = model(image=image, text=text)
except ValueError as e:
  print(f"ValueError: {e}") # Expecting a ValueError due to incorrect data types


# Correct: Correct data types and named inputs
image = tf.cast(tf.constant([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]), tf.float32) # Correct data type
text = tf.constant(["Example text"])
predictions = model(image=image, text=text) #Using named inputs
print(predictions)
```

This example highlights the importance of data type consistency and the use of named inputs.  The `tf.cast` function is used to explicitly convert the data type to `tf.float32` as assumed by the fictional model. The use of keyword arguments (`image=image`, `text=text`) ensures proper input mapping even if the model uses named inputs.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To effectively troubleshoot these issues, I highly recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.function`, input signatures, and the specific TensorFlow Hub model's documentation.  Furthermore, diligently studying the model's `signatures` attribute (accessible via `model.signatures`) provides invaluable insight into the expected input shapes and types.  Understanding the concepts of TensorFlow graphs and sessions would also aid in diagnosing such problems.  Finally, proficient use of a debugging tool like pdb can help track the flow of data and identify the exact point of failure.
