Predicting the next time step in a time series using Keras fundamentally relies on framing the problem as a supervised learning task.  My experience developing forecasting models for financial time series data highlighted the critical need for careful feature engineering and model selection to achieve accurate predictions.  The core concept is to transform the time series into a dataset where each sample represents a sequence of past observations and the target variable is the subsequent observation.  This allows us to leverage Keras' capabilities for building and training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically LSTMs and GRUs, which are well-suited for handling sequential data.

**1. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:**

The first, and often most crucial, step involves preparing the data appropriately.  This includes cleaning the time series to handle missing values (imputation techniques like linear interpolation or more sophisticated methods are applicable depending on the data's characteristics), outliers (robust statistical methods or winsorization can be employed), and potentially transforming the data to achieve stationarity (differencing or logarithmic transformations are commonly used).  I've found that the quality of the preprocessing directly impacts the model's predictive performance.  Furthermore, feature engineering plays a significant role.  Consider adding lagged variables (previous time steps), rolling statistics (e.g., moving averages, standard deviations), or external regressors (e.g., macroeconomic indicators, seasonal dummies) to enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the time series.  These additional features often provide context and improve forecasting accuracy.

**2. Model Building and Training:**

Keras provides a straightforward API for building RNNs.  LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) are particularly effective for capturing long-range dependencies within the time series.  Both are types of recurrent neural networks designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem that can hinder the training of standard RNNs.  I've observed that GRUs often offer a good balance between computational efficiency and predictive performance, while LSTMs can be more powerful for extremely long sequences.  The choice depends on the characteristics of your data and computational resources.  The model architecture generally consists of one or more LSTM or GRU layers followed by a dense layer for output.  The activation function in the output layer depends on the nature of the target variable (e.g., sigmoid for binary classification, linear for regression).

**3. Code Examples:**

The following examples demonstrate how to build and train time series prediction models using Keras with different approaches:

**Example 1: Simple LSTM Model for Univariate Time Series**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample univariate time series data (replace with your own data)
data = np.array([10, 12, 15, 14, 18, 20, 22, 25, 23, 27]).reshape(-1, 1)

# Create sequences and targets
sequence_length = 3
X, y = [], []
for i in range(len(data) - sequence_length):
    X.append(data[i:i + sequence_length])
    y.append(data[i + sequence_length])
X = np.array(X)
y = np.array(y)

# Build the LSTM model
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(sequence_length, 1)),
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=1)

# Make predictions
last_sequence = data[-sequence_length:]
prediction = model.predict(last_sequence.reshape(1, sequence_length, 1))
print(f"Prediction: {prediction[0][0]}")
```

This example uses a simple LSTM model for a univariate time series.  The data is reshaped into sequences of length `sequence_length`, and the model is trained to predict the next time step.  The `mse` loss function is suitable for regression tasks.


**Example 2: Multivariate Time Series with GRU and Feature Engineering**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU, Dense

# Sample multivariate time series data (replace with your own data)
data = np.array([[10, 20, 30], [12, 22, 32], [15, 25, 35], [14, 24, 34], [18, 28, 38]])

# Feature engineering: adding lagged variables
sequence_length = 2
X, y = [], []
for i in range(len(data) - sequence_length):
    X.append(data[i:i + sequence_length])
    y.append(data[i + sequence_length, 0]) # Predicting the first variable
X = np.array(X)
y = np.array(y)

# Build the GRU model
model = keras.Sequential([
    GRU(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(sequence_length, 3)),
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=1)

# Make predictions
last_sequence = data[-sequence_length:]
prediction = model.predict(last_sequence.reshape(1, sequence_length, 3))
print(f"Prediction: {prediction[0][0]}")
```

This example illustrates a GRU model for a multivariate time series.  Lagged variables are included as features.  The model predicts the next value of the first variable in the multivariate series.


**Example 3: Stacked LSTM with Dropout for Improved Generalization**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

# Sample data (replace with your own data - ensure sufficient length for stacked LSTM)
data = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# ... (Data preprocessing as in Example 1)

# Build the stacked LSTM model with dropout
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(100, activation='relu', return_sequences=True, input_shape=(sequence_length, 1)),
    Dropout(0.2),
    LSTM(50, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

# ... (Prediction as in Example 1)
```

This example demonstrates a stacked LSTM model with dropout regularization to improve generalization and prevent overfitting, particularly useful with larger datasets.  The `return_sequences=True` argument is crucial for stacking LSTM layers.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of RNNs and time series forecasting, I would recommend exploring texts dedicated to deep learning and time series analysis.  Specific titles focusing on practical implementations using Keras and TensorFlow would be highly beneficial, along with supplementary materials on statistical time series analysis for proper data preparation and model evaluation.  Understanding different evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, MAPE) is crucial for selecting the best-performing model.  Finally, studying various optimization techniques and hyperparameter tuning strategies is vital for achieving optimal predictive performance.
