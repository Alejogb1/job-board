The discrepancy between your input array's dimensionality and the expectation of `conv1d_195` (presumed to be a 1D convolutional layer in a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or Keras) stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how these layers interpret input data.  The three dimensions expected are not arbitrary; they represent a specific data structure optimized for efficient convolutional operations.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects involving time-series analysis and signal processing, this often arises from neglecting the inherent structure required for convolutional layers.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A 1D convolutional layer, unlike its 2D counterpart used for image processing, operates on sequential data.  The three dimensions expected by `conv1d_195` are:

* **Samples:** This represents the number of independent data instances you are processing.  For instance, if you are classifying audio segments, each segment constitutes a sample.  If you're working with multiple time series, each series would be a separate sample.

* **Time Steps (or Features):** This represents the length of your individual data instance.  In the audio example, it would be the number of time points in a single audio segment.  For a time series, it represents the number of data points in that series.

* **Channels:** This dimension represents the number of independent features at each time step.  A single-channel signal, like a simple audio recording, would have a channel dimension of 1.  However, if you have multiple features at each time step (e.g., audio amplitude and frequency), your channel dimension would be greater than 1.

Your single-dimension input array likely represents only the 'Time Steps' dimension.  The convolutional layer is expecting a batch of samples (multiple time series or audio segments), each with a specified length, and potentially multiple channels.  The crucial point is that the data must be structured to explicitly represent this sample-time-channel organization, which is often a source of confusion for newcomers to deep learning.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate with three examples using a hypothetical framework mimicking TensorFlow/Keras's API.  Assume the input data is named `input_data`.

**Example 1: Single Sample, Single Channel**

```python
import numpy as np

# Input data: 100 time steps, single channel
input_data = np.random.rand(100)  # Shape: (100,)

# Reshape to fit conv1d_195's expectation:
# Samples (1), Time steps (100), Channels (1)
reshaped_input = np.reshape(input_data, (1, 100, 1)) #Shape: (1, 100, 1)

# ... proceed with conv1d_195 operation ...
# conv1d_195(reshaped_input, ...)
```

This example handles the case where you have only one data instance (sample) with a single feature (channel).  The crucial step is reshaping the input array from a 1D array to a 3D array with the correct dimensions. The resulting array has a batch size of 1 (one sample).

**Example 2: Multiple Samples, Single Channel**

```python
import numpy as np

# Input data: 10 samples, each with 100 time steps, single channel
input_data = np.random.rand(10, 100) # Shape: (10, 100)

# Reshape is not needed in this case because the data is almost correct.
# We add the channel dimension
reshaped_input = np.expand_dims(input_data, axis=2)  # Shape: (10, 100, 1)

# ... proceed with conv1d_195 operation ...
# conv1d_195(reshaped_input, ...)
```

Here, we have ten independent samples. The original input array is nearly correct, representing samples and time steps.  However, the channel dimension is missing; `np.expand_dims` adds this dimension efficiently.


**Example 3: Multiple Samples, Multiple Channels**

```python
import numpy as np

# Input data: 5 samples, each with 50 time steps, and 3 channels
input_data = np.random.rand(5, 50, 3) # Shape: (5, 50, 3)

# No reshaping needed; the input is already in the correct format
reshaped_input = input_data # Shape: (5, 50, 3)

# ... proceed with conv1d_195 operation ...
# conv1d_195(reshaped_input, ...)
```

This example shows a properly formatted input array. The data is correctly arranged to represent samples, time steps, and channels. No reshaping is necessary.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of 1D convolutional neural networks, I recommend consulting reputable textbooks on deep learning and signal processing.  Focus on sections covering convolutional layers and their applications to sequential data.  Furthermore, review the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework; understanding the expected input shapes for convolutional layers is crucial.  Thoroughly examine examples provided within the framework's documentation â€“ they typically illustrate correct input formatting.  Practicing with simple datasets and visualizing your input arrays at each step can aid in debugging similar issues.  Finally, online forums, though not directly referenced, often contain valuable troubleshooting advice and code snippets.
