The core issue stems from the fundamental differences in memory management and execution models between the Standard Template Library (STL) `std::vector` and CUDA Thrust's `thrust::device_vector`.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects, particularly those involving image processing and fluid dynamics simulations, has repeatedly highlighted this incompatibility.  The error manifests during the linking stage because the compiler cannot reconcile the disparate memory allocation and access mechanisms employed by these distinct vector types.

STL vectors reside in the host's system memory (RAM), accessible directly by the CPU.  Their memory is managed by the C++ standard library's allocator.  Conversely, Thrust vectors are designed for GPU execution.  They reside in the GPU's global memory, accessible only through CUDA kernels launched from the host.  Their memory is managed by the CUDA runtime, adhering to CUDA's memory model, distinct from the host's memory management.

The linking errors arise because the compiler, during the linking stage, encounters functions and data structures related to both vector types.  It attempts to resolve function calls and variable references, but encounters a conflict:  functions operating on STL vectors (e.g., `std::vector::push_back`) cannot operate directly on Thrust vectors, and vice-versa.  The compiler cannot automatically bridge the gap between host-side (CPU) and device-side (GPU) memory spaces.  This fundamental incompatibility leads to unresolved symbols, resulting in a linker error.  The error messages often indicate undefined references to functions or data structures associated with one or both vector types, depending on the specific code and the nature of the interaction between the STL and Thrust vectors.

To illustrate, let's examine three code examples highlighting different scenarios and potential solutions:


**Example 1: Direct Mixing of STL and Thrust Vectors**

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> host_vector = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    thrust::device_vector<int> device_vector(host_vector.begin(), host_vector.end());

    // Incorrect attempt to directly mix STL and Thrust vectors.  This will likely cause a compile or link error.
    host_vector.push_back(device_vector[0]); // Error!

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the attempt to directly append an element from the `device_vector` to the `host_vector` is invalid. The `device_vector[0]` accesses GPU memory, while `host_vector.push_back` operates on host memory.  The compiler cannot implicitly convert between these memory spaces.


**Example 2:  Data Transfer and Separate Operations**

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/copy.h>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> host_vector = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    thrust::device_vector<int> device_vector(host_vector.size());

    // Copy data from host to device
    thrust::copy(host_vector.begin(), host_vector.end(), device_vector.begin());

    // Perform operations on the device_vector using Thrust algorithms
    thrust::transform(device_vector.begin(), device_vector.end(), device_vector.begin(), [](int x){ return x * 2; });

    // Copy data back from device to host
    thrust::copy(device_vector.begin(), device_vector.end(), host_vector.begin());

    return 0;
}
```

This demonstrates the correct approach. Data is explicitly transferred between the host and device using `thrust::copy`.  Operations on the `device_vector` are performed using Thrust algorithms.  The separation prevents direct interaction between STL and Thrust vectors within the same context.  This is crucial for avoiding linking conflicts.


**Example 3:  Using Host-Side STL Vectors for Preprocessing and Postprocessing**

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/copy.h>
#include <thrust/reduce.h>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> input_data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    thrust::device_vector<int> d_input_data(input_data.begin(), input_data.end());

    thrust::device_vector<int> d_result(input_data.size());
    // ...Thrust operations on d_input_data, storing results in d_result...
    int sum = thrust::reduce(d_result.begin(), d_result.end());

    std::vector<int> output_data(1);
    thrust::copy(d_result.begin(), d_result.begin() + 1, output_data.begin()); //Example copy, adjust as needed

    return 0;
}

```

Here, STL vectors are used for input data preparation and output data handling.  The core computation is performed on the GPU using Thrust, minimizing interactions between the host and device memory spaces during computation.  This strategy leverages the strengths of both libraries without inducing linking errors.


To avoid these linking issues, rigorously adhere to the following principles:

1. **Data Transfer:**  Use `thrust::copy` or similar functions to explicitly transfer data between host and device memory.

2. **Separate Execution Spaces:**  Keep operations on STL vectors and Thrust vectors separate.  Avoid attempting to directly intermingle them in a single function or code block.

3. **Thrust for Device Operations:**  Use Thrust algorithms for any computation that should be performed on the GPU.

4. **Host-Side Pre- and Post-processing:** Employ STL vectors for tasks such as data input, initialization, and output handling on the host.


**Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the CUDA programming guide and the Thrust library documentation. A good understanding of CUDA's memory model and Thrust's functions is paramount to writing effective and error-free code.  Furthermore, studying examples of GPU-accelerated algorithms implemented using Thrust will provide valuable practical experience in managing the interplay between host and device memory.  Finally, reviewing common compiler error messages related to undefined symbols will significantly improve your ability to diagnose and resolve these kinds of linking problems.
