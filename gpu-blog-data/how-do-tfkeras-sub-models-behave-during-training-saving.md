The crucial aspect governing the behavior of `tf.keras` sub-models during training, saving, and loading hinges on their instantiation and inclusion within the overarching model architecture.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects has consistently highlighted the importance of understanding this hierarchical relationship.  Simply adding a model as a layer doesn't automatically ensure proper weight management; explicit handling is required for effective training, saving, and restoration.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

`tf.keras` offers flexibility in constructing models, allowing for both sequential and functional approaches.  Sub-models, essentially smaller, independently defined `tf.keras.Model` instances, can be incorporated as layers within a larger model.  However, their interaction during the training, saving, and loading processes requires careful attention.

During training, the weights of sub-models are updated alongside those of the parent model.  The training process treats the sub-model as an integral part of the overall architecture; backpropagation propagates gradients through the sub-model's layers.  This ensures that the sub-model's parameters are optimized to contribute effectively to the parent model's objective function.  Crucially, if a sub-model is shared across multiple branches within the parent model, its weights are updated consistently across all instances.  Any modifications made to the sub-model's internal structure during training will affect the entire model's behavior.

Saving a model containing sub-models necessitates careful consideration of the saving mechanism.  Using `model.save()` will save the entire model architecture, including the weights of all layers, including the sub-models. This generates a single file (or a directory of files, depending on the format) encapsulating the complete state.  The structure of the saved model reflects the hierarchical relationship.  Loading such a saved model restores the parent model and all its constituent sub-models to their previous state, ready for further training or inference.  Importantly, attempting to save and load only the sub-model independently will often lead to errors unless it is itself a complete, independently trainable model.

One common misunderstanding arises from the belief that simply saving the weights of a sub-model separately will suffice.  While technically possible, this approach omits the model's architecture information.  Therefore, reconstructing the sub-model and loading these saved weights might require explicit code to rebuild the model structure, which is error-prone and necessitates meticulous record-keeping.  The holistic saving offered by `model.save()` eliminates this complexity and potential for errors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Sequential Inclusion of a Sub-model:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a sub-model
sub_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')
])

# Define the main model
main_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    sub_model,
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile and train the main model (standard procedures omitted for brevity)
main_model.compile(...)
main_model.fit(...)

# Save the main model
main_model.save('main_model.h5')

# Load the main model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('main_model.h5')
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward sequential integration. The sub-model's weights are managed as part of the main model's weights. Saving and loading the `main_model` implicitly handles the sub-model.

**Example 2: Functional API with Shared Sub-model:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a sub-model
sub_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,)), outputs=tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,)))))

# Define the main model using the functional API
input_layer = tf.keras.Input(shape=(20,))
branch1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_layer)
branch2 = sub_model(input_layer[:, :10]) # Using slicing to feed a portion of input
merged = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([branch1, branch2])
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged)
main_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

# Compile, train, save, and load (standard procedures omitted)
main_model.compile(...)
main_model.fit(...)
main_model.save('functional_model.h5')
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('functional_model.h5')
```

Here, the functional API showcases a shared sub-model, underscoring consistent weight updates across branches.  The saving and loading processes remain unchanged; the entire architecture is preserved.

**Example 3:  Sub-model with custom training:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a sub-model
sub_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')
])

# Define a custom training loop for sub-model
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
sub_model_loss = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

def train_sub_model(x_sub, y_sub, epochs=10):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = sub_model(x_sub)
            loss = sub_model_loss(y_sub, predictions)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, sub_model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, sub_model.trainable_variables))

# ... (Rest of the main model definition and training using the main model.  Sub-model weights will be updated separately, then integrated into main model)
# Save and load as previously demonstrated.
```


This example highlights scenarios where you might separately train a sub-model initially, which may be useful for pre-training or transfer learning.  However, the complete model still needs to be saved and loaded as a whole. The individual sub-model training doesn't negate the need for holistic model management.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on model building, saving, and loading.  Explore the sections on the Keras functional API and model saving options.  Furthermore, several advanced texts on deep learning thoroughly cover model architectures and training strategies.  Finally, I highly recommend reviewing articles and tutorials specifically addressing model persistence and checkpointing.  These resources will offer further insights into best practices and potential challenges.
