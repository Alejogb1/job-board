Altera Quartus Prime 13.1 errors 12007 ("Error: No valid memory locations found for this memory block") and 293001 ("Error: No physical memory locations assigned to memory block") are fundamentally linked to inconsistencies between the design's memory allocation and the available physical resources within the target FPGA device.  I've encountered these errors numerous times during my years working on high-speed data acquisition systems and embedded vision processing pipelines, often stemming from improper memory planning or misconfigurations in the Quartus settings.  Addressing them necessitates a careful review of the memory instantiation, allocation strategy, and device configuration.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

These errors arise when the Quartus Prime compiler cannot map the memory blocks defined in your HDL code to the actual memory resources available on your chosen FPGA.  This mismatch can manifest in several ways:

* **Insufficient Memory:** The most straightforward cause is a simple lack of sufficient memory resources in the target FPGA. Your design might require more Block RAM (BRAM), embedded Single-Port RAM (M9K), or other memory elements than the device provides.  This is readily apparent in designs with large frame buffers, extensive lookup tables, or significant data storage requirements.  Careful budgeting of memory resources during the design phase is crucial.

* **Conflicting Memory Assignments:** Multiple memory blocks might be inadvertently assigned to overlapping physical locations. This can occur due to a flawed memory allocation scheme within the HDL code or through manual assignment conflicts in the Quartus settings.  Even small inconsistencies can cause cascading errors, leading to the 12007 and 293001 error messages.

* **Incorrect Memory Initialization:**  Problems with memory initialization, particularly in designs employing specific memory initialization schemes (e.g., ROM initialization from a file), can lead to the compiler's inability to map the memory. Incorrect file paths, incompatible memory initialization formats, or flawed initialization procedures all contribute to this issue.

* **Timing Constraints:** While less directly related, stringent timing constraints can sometimes indirectly trigger these errors. If the compiler struggles to meet timing closure due to routing complexity, it might not be able to successfully place and route all memory blocks, resulting in these error messages.

* **Quartus Project Settings:**  Improperly configured Quartus project settings, including those related to memory mapping and device family selection, can also lead to these errors. For example, selecting the wrong FPGA device family or using an outdated device database can cause resource allocation problems.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate potential scenarios leading to these errors, focusing on VHDL, but the principles are applicable to Verilog as well.

**Example 1: Insufficient Memory**

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity large_memory is
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    data_in : in std_logic_vector(1023 downto 0);
    data_out : out std_logic_vector(1023 downto 0);
    addr : in integer range 0 to 1023
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of large_memory is
  type mem_array is array (0 to 1023) of std_logic_vector(1023 downto 0);
  signal memory : mem_array;
begin
  process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      memory(to_integer(unsigned(addr))) <= data_in;
      data_out <= memory(to_integer(unsigned(addr)));
    end if;
  end process;
end architecture;
```

* **Commentary:** This example defines a 1KB memory block (1024 entries * 1024 bits).  If the target FPGA lacks sufficient BRAM to accommodate this memory, Quartus will likely report errors 12007 and 293001.  Employing techniques like memory compression, data partitioning, or selecting a different, more resource-rich FPGA are necessary solutions.

**Example 2: Conflicting Memory Assignments**

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity conflicting_memory is
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    data_in_a : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    data_out_a : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    data_in_b : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    data_out_b : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    addr : in integer range 0 to 15
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of conflicting_memory is
  type mem_array is array (0 to 15) of std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
  signal memory_a : mem_array;
  signal memory_b : mem_array;
begin
  -- Both memory_a and memory_b attempt to use the same memory locations.
  process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      memory_a(addr) <= data_in_a;
      data_out_a <= memory_a(addr);
      memory_b(addr) <= data_in_b;  -- Conflict!
      data_out_b <= memory_b(addr);
    end if;
  end process;
end architecture;
```

* **Commentary:**  This example illustrates a scenario where two memory blocks (`memory_a` and `memory_b`) are unintentionally using the same memory addresses.  This will cause a conflict during synthesis and placement, resulting in the errors.  Separate, non-overlapping memory regions must be defined.

**Example 3: Incorrect Memory Initialization**

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity rom_init_error is
  port (
    addr : in integer range 0 to 7;
    data_out : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of rom_init_error is
  type mem_array is array (0 to 7) of std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
  constant rom_data : mem_array := (others => (others => '0')); -- Incorrect initialization
begin
  data_out <= rom_data(addr);
end architecture;

```

* **Commentary:** This example shows a potential issue with ROM initialization.  While functional, if `rom_data` were intended to be initialized from an external file, an incorrect file path or format would lead to a failure in memory initialization, which could ultimately cause errors 12007 and 293001 if the compiler cannot resolve the undefined memory contents.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the Altera Quartus Prime documentation meticulously.  Pay close attention to the sections detailing memory allocation, resource planning, and device-specific constraints.  Review the synthesis and fitting reports generated by Quartus to identify the specific memory blocks causing problems.  Utilize the Quartus memory planner to visualize memory resource utilization and assist in allocation.  Furthermore, thoroughly examine the compilation log files; they often contain detailed clues about the root cause of these errors.  Familiarize yourself with the FPGA's memory architecture and the various types of memory available (BRAM, M9K, etc.). Understanding these differences is essential for efficient memory allocation. Finally, consider using static timing analysis tools to ensure that your design meets timing closure; failure to do so can indirectly lead to placement and routing issues that manifest as these errors.
