Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures, within the PyTorch framework are exceptionally well-suited for sequence generation tasks.  My experience optimizing these models for natural language processing applications has highlighted the crucial role of careful architecture design and training regimen selection.  The core principle lies in leveraging the RNN's ability to maintain a hidden state that encapsulates information from preceding sequence elements, allowing the network to predict subsequent elements based on this contextualized representation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Sequence generation using PyTorch RNNs involves training a model to predict the next element in a sequence given its preceding elements.  This is achieved by feeding the sequence into the RNN one element at a time.  At each timestep, the RNN updates its hidden state based on the current input and its previous hidden state.  The final hidden state, or a transformation thereof, is then used to predict the probability distribution over the possible next elements in the sequence.  This prediction is typically performed through a fully connected layer followed by a softmax activation function, converting the network's output into a probability distribution.  The element with the highest probability is then selected as the predicted next element.  For training, the model is typically optimized using techniques like backpropagation through time (BPTT) to minimize the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the actual next element in the sequence.  The loss function employed is usually cross-entropy, given its suitability for categorical probability distributions.  The training process involves iteratively feeding the model sequences from the training dataset, updating its weights based on the calculated loss.

Generating new sequences involves providing the RNN with an initial input (e.g., a starting token) and iteratively feeding the predicted output back into the network as input for the next timestep. This process continues until a termination token is generated or a predefined sequence length is reached.  The quality of the generated sequences significantly depends on the training data's quality, the network architecture's complexity, and the hyperparameters used during training.  Overfitting is a significant concern, and regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay are commonly employed to mitigate this issue.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Character-level Text Generation using LSTM**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CharLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(CharLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x, hidden):
        out, hidden = self.lstm(x, hidden)
        out = self.fc(out)
        return out, hidden

# Example usage:
input_size = 80 # Assuming 80 unique characters
hidden_size = 256
output_size = 80
lstm = CharLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)

input = torch.randn(1,1, input_size) #Batch size 1, seq_len 1
hidden = (torch.zeros(1,1,hidden_size), torch.zeros(1,1,hidden_size))
output, hidden = lstm(input, hidden)
```

This example demonstrates a basic character-level LSTM for text generation.  The input size represents the number of unique characters in the vocabulary. The LSTM layer processes the input sequence, and a fully connected layer maps the hidden state to a probability distribution over the vocabulary.  The code showcases a single timestep; sequence generation would involve iteratively feeding the output back as input.  In a practical scenario, one would embed characters into a vector representation and handle the input/output more sophisticatedly.


**Example 2:  Word-level Sequence Generation using GRU with Embedding Layer**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class WordGRU(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(WordGRU, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.gru = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, hidden_size)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x, hidden):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        out, hidden = self.gru(embedded, hidden)
        out = self.fc(out)
        return out, hidden

#Example Usage
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 100
hidden_size = 256
output_size = vocab_size
gru = WordGRU(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size, output_size)

input = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (1,1)) #Batch size 1, seq_len 1, random word index
hidden = torch.zeros(1,1,hidden_size)
output, hidden = gru(input, hidden)

```

This example uses a GRU, which often offers comparable performance to LSTMs with fewer parameters.  Crucially, it introduces an embedding layer, mapping discrete word indices to continuous vector representations. This is a standard technique in NLP to capture semantic relationships between words. The output is a probability distribution over the vocabulary, enabling word-level sequence generation.


**Example 3:  Sequence-to-Sequence Model with Attention Mechanism**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Encoder(nn.Module):
    #Simplified Encoder for brevity
    pass

class Decoder(nn.Module):
    #Simplified Decoder for brevity
    pass

class Seq2Seq(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, encoder, decoder):
        super(Seq2Seq, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = encoder
        self.decoder = decoder

    def forward(self, input, target):
        encoder_output = self.encoder(input)
        output = self.decoder(target, encoder_output)
        return output

#Example Usage (Illustrative, requires detailed encoder/decoder implementation)
#...  Encoder and Decoder initialization ...
seq2seq = Seq2Seq(encoder, decoder)
input = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (1, seq_len)) #Example input sequence
target = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (1, seq_len)) # Example target sequence
output = seq2seq(input, target)
```

This example outlines a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, frequently used for machine translation or other tasks involving mapping input sequences to output sequences.  While a simplified illustration, it highlights the use of separate encoder and decoder RNNs.  The encoder processes the input sequence, and its output is used by the decoder to generate the output sequence.  A complete implementation would include attention mechanisms for improved performance, especially for longer sequences.  I have omitted the detailed implementation of the Encoder and Decoder for brevity, but this structure showcases the fundamental concept.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a more thorough understanding of PyTorch RNNs and their application in sequence generation, I suggest exploring the official PyTorch documentation, focusing on the `torch.nn` module's RNN layers and related tutorials.  Furthermore,  reviewing established textbooks on deep learning and natural language processing would significantly benefit your understanding of the underlying theoretical concepts and advanced techniques.  Finally, actively examining relevant research papers focusing on RNN architectures and sequence generation models will expose you to the latest advancements in this field.  Consider exploring works on attention mechanisms and various RNN architectures beyond LSTMs and GRUs, such as those designed to address the vanishing gradient problem.
