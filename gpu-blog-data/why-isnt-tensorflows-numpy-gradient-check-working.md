TensorFlow's `gradient_check_numercial` function, while a valuable tool for verifying the correctness of custom gradients, often yields unexpected results due to inherent limitations in numerical differentiation.  My experience debugging similar issues points to three primary sources of error: insufficient precision in finite difference approximations, numerical instability in the underlying function, and incorrect handling of broadcasting and higher-order derivatives.  These issues aren't always readily apparent, and often require a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve.

**1.  Insufficient Precision in Finite Difference Approximations:**

The core principle behind numerical gradient checking is approximating the derivative using a finite difference formula.  TensorFlow's implementation typically employs a central difference scheme, offering second-order accuracy.  However, the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic can significantly impact accuracy, particularly when dealing with functions exhibiting sharp changes in slope or with small gradients.  The finite difference approximation's accuracy is heavily reliant on the choice of `epsilon`, the small perturbation added to the input during the calculation.  If `epsilon` is too small, it's overshadowed by the inherent noise in floating-point operations, leading to inaccurate derivative estimates. Conversely, too large an `epsilon` can lead to inaccuracies due to the truncation error in the Taylor series approximation used to derive the finite difference formula.  Finding the optimal `epsilon` often necessitates experimentation, considering the function's scale and sensitivity to input changes.

**2. Numerical Instability in the Underlying Function:**

The function for which the gradient is being checked may suffer from numerical instability. This manifests as significant variations in output even with minuscule input changes.  Such instability, often stemming from operations like exponentiation, logarithms, or divisions involving near-zero values, can severely impact the accuracy of the finite difference approximation.  In my past encounters, functions involving large exponents or ill-conditioned matrices proved particularly problematic.  This instability masks the actual gradient, making the numerical check yield misleading results.  Addressing this requires careful examination of the function's numerical properties, potentially involving techniques like rescaling inputs, employing more stable algorithms (e.g., using `tf.math.log1p` instead of `tf.math.log` for values close to 1), or employing specialized libraries designed for numerical stability.


**3. Incorrect Handling of Broadcasting and Higher-Order Derivatives:**

TensorFlow's automatic differentiation operates efficiently with broadcasting, but mismatches in broadcasting behavior between the forward pass and the gradient calculation can lead to discrepancies during the numerical check.  This often arises when functions involve operations that alter the shape or dimensionality of tensors.  Similarly, higher-order derivatives, while less common in standard gradient calculations, can introduce complexities if not handled correctly.  Inconsistent behavior regarding broadcasting between the user-defined gradient and the numerically approximated gradient will frequently lead to failures in the gradient check.  Explicitly managing tensor shapes and employing techniques like `tf.reshape` or `tf.expand_dims` as necessary can mitigate this issue.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Impact of epsilon**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_function(x):
  return tf.sin(x)

x = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float64)  # Using float64 for higher precision

# Test different epsilon values
epsilons = [1e-8, 1e-6, 1e-4]
for epsilon in epsilons:
  numerical_gradient = tf.gradient_check_numercial(my_function, [x], epsilon=epsilon)
  print(f"Epsilon: {epsilon}, Gradient Check: {numerical_gradient}")

```

This example demonstrates how the choice of `epsilon` affects the gradient check's outcome.  Using `tf.float64` enhances precision, but even then, optimal `epsilon` selection may still be necessary.


**Example 2:  Numerical Instability**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def unstable_function(x):
  return tf.exp(100 * x)

x = tf.constant(0.1, dtype=tf.float64)

numerical_gradient = tf.gradient_check_numercial(unstable_function, [x])
print(f"Gradient Check: {numerical_gradient}")


def stable_function(x):
    return tf.exp(tf.clip_by_value(100 * x, -100, 100)) # Added Clipping for stability

numerical_gradient = tf.gradient_check_numercial(stable_function, [x])
print(f"Gradient Check (Stable): {numerical_gradient}")
```

This showcases a function prone to numerical instability due to the large exponent.  The second part demonstrates a stabilization technique using `tf.clip_by_value` to constrain the exponent's range, resulting in a more reliable gradient check.

**Example 3: Broadcasting Issues**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def broadcasting_function(x):
  return tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(x))

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float64)
numerical_gradient = tf.gradient_check_numercial(broadcasting_function, [x])
print(f"Gradient Check: {numerical_gradient}")

```

This example illustrates a situation where broadcasting is implicitly handled within `tf.reduce_sum` and `tf.square`.  If a custom gradient were to handle broadcasting inconsistently, this would likely lead to a failed numerical gradient check.  Careful attention to broadcasting within the function and its gradient is crucial.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of numerical differentiation and its intricacies, I recommend consulting standard numerical analysis textbooks.  Additionally, the TensorFlow documentation provides detailed explanations of the `tf.gradient_check_numercial` function and its limitations.  Finally, exploring advanced topics on automatic differentiation and computational graph construction can provide a deeper insight into the mechanisms at play.
