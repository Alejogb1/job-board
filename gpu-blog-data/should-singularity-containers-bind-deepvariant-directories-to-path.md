My experience with Singularity and DeepVariant, particularly in HPC environments, suggests directly binding DeepVariant directories to `$PATH` within a Singularity container is generally not advisable and introduces more problems than it solves. The core issue stems from the fundamental purpose of containerization: isolation and reproducibility. Modifying `$PATH` within a container undermines this isolation, potentially leading to conflicts and unexpected behavior.

First, let's clarify the typical use case. DeepVariant, a Google-developed tool for variant calling from next-generation sequencing data, is commonly deployed within containers to manage its complex dependencies. Users need to run `deepvariant` and its associated scripts, typically found in a specific directory within the container's file system.

Directly altering the container's `$PATH` to include this directory exposes the container’s internal structure in a way that is inconsistent with the container's philosophy of bundling everything it requires within itself. It can cause conflicts when the container is run alongside other applications that may have their own `$PATH` considerations, particularly in environments like cluster schedulers where multiple jobs from different users may run on the same compute node concurrently. These jobs could have their own containers, creating a situation with a potentially confusing and messy global `$PATH`.

The primary alternative and preferred practice is to use explicit paths when invoking commands within the container. Instead of relying on `$PATH` to locate executables, users should specify the full path to the `deepvariant` binary or script within the container. This ensures that the correct version of DeepVariant is executed as part of that specific containerized workflow, eliminating the potential ambiguity introduced by modifying `$PATH`.

For example, consider a container with DeepVariant located at `/opt/deepvariant/bin`. Rather than adding `/opt/deepvariant/bin` to the container's `$PATH`, the user would execute the deepvariant command via `/opt/deepvariant/bin/deepvariant`.

This approach aligns with containerization’s core principles of self-contained environments where an execution environment is encapsulated and predictable regardless of the underlying host system. Direct `$PATH` modification violates this principle by injecting context about the container's internal layout into the external execution environment.

Now, let’s examine code examples to illustrate the recommended approach and the problems with directly modifying `$PATH`.

**Example 1: Executing DeepVariant with Explicit Paths**

This example demonstrates the correct way to invoke DeepVariant within a Singularity container:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Assume the Singularity container has DeepVariant at /opt/deepvariant/bin
CONTAINER_IMAGE="deepvariant.sif"
INPUT_BAM="input.bam"
OUTPUT_VCF="output.vcf"
REFERENCE_FASTA="reference.fasta"
SINGULARITY_BIN="singularity"

# Execute DeepVariant using the full path within the container
$SINGULARITY_BIN exec $CONTAINER_IMAGE /opt/deepvariant/bin/deepvariant \
    --model_type=WGS \
    --ref=$REFERENCE_FASTA \
    --reads=$INPUT_BAM \
    --output_vcf=$OUTPUT_VCF
```

In this script, the `deepvariant` executable is invoked using its full path inside the container `/opt/deepvariant/bin/deepvariant`. This approach is self-contained, explicit, and requires no alteration to the container's default environment settings and will not introduce environment specific issues. It explicitly specifies where to find the DeepVariant executable regardless of the `$PATH` environment within the container or on the host system.

**Example 2: Attempting to add to `$PATH` Inside a Singularity Container**

The following shows an example of how to *incorrectly* modify `$PATH` within a Singularity container and then use it. This code illustrates why the practice is problematic and to be avoided in normal use cases:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# WARNING: This is an ANTI-PATTERN, do not use this in production
CONTAINER_IMAGE="deepvariant.sif"
INPUT_BAM="input.bam"
OUTPUT_VCF="output.vcf"
REFERENCE_FASTA="reference.fasta"
SINGULARITY_BIN="singularity"

# Attempting to modify the PATH inside the container (avoid this)
$SINGULARITY_BIN exec --env PATH=/opt/deepvariant/bin:$PATH $CONTAINER_IMAGE \
   sh -c 'deepvariant \
    --model_type=WGS \
    --ref=$REFERENCE_FASTA \
    --reads=$INPUT_BAM \
    --output_vcf=$OUTPUT_VCF'
```

Here, we use the `--env PATH=/opt/deepvariant/bin:$PATH` option of `singularity exec` to attempt to add the DeepVariant binaries directory to the container's `$PATH`. While this works at a basic level, it introduces a host of problems:

*   It relies on `sh` shell inside the container, which means you can accidentally execute bash commands without fully understanding what is occurring with your environment.
*   The modification is only in effect for the current execution. There is no permanence and any change you make to `$PATH` is only local to that singular command.
*   It can cause problems with other scripts that expect a clean `$PATH` and may not be compatible with modifications. This is particularly true with environment setups or other third party software.
*   It introduces a reliance on environment details rather than a specific execution path, and you may introduce conflicts with other container or even host configurations.

**Example 3: An Example of the Correct and Preferred Approach in a Script**

This example shows the use of a script within the container where an explicit path is required within the script itself, showcasing a more realistic use case:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example demonstrating a script within the container
CONTAINER_IMAGE="deepvariant.sif"
INPUT_BAM="input.bam"
OUTPUT_VCF="output.vcf"
REFERENCE_FASTA="reference.fasta"
SINGULARITY_BIN="singularity"

# Create a wrapper script inside the container (e.g. /opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant.sh)

# The content of /opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant.sh inside the container:
# #!/bin/bash
# /opt/deepvariant/bin/deepvariant \
#     --model_type=WGS \
#     --ref=$1 \
#     --reads=$2 \
#     --output_vcf=$3

# Execute the wrapper script within the container
$SINGULARITY_BIN exec $CONTAINER_IMAGE /opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant.sh \
    $REFERENCE_FASTA $INPUT_BAM $OUTPUT_VCF
```

In this scenario, the DeepVariant invocation happens inside a script that is located inside the container and is executed via `singularity exec`. Inside that script, DeepVariant is invoked with the explicit path `/opt/deepvariant/bin/deepvariant`. This is a common pattern in many containerized applications. This script now becomes self contained and is portable with the container.

**Resource Recommendations**

To further understand Singularity containers and best practices, I recommend investigating several resources:

1.  **The official Singularity documentation**: This is the definitive resource for all aspects of Singularity container usage, including detailed explanations of execution models and configuration options. Look for sections discussing environment variables and command execution for a clear understanding of path resolution.
2.  **Containerization Best Practices Guides**: Resources that discusses general best practices for working with any containerization technology, including Singularity and Docker. These guides frequently address environment configurations and avoiding the modification of `$PATH` within a container.
3. **High Performance Computing (HPC) Best Practices Documents**: Look for documentation specific to container usage within an HPC setting, such as SLURM and PBS specific guides. HPC communities often have recommended usage patterns for containerized applications in shared environments, which often avoids modifying `$PATH` inside containers.

In conclusion, while modifying `$PATH` within a Singularity container seems a quick fix, it compromises the container’s inherent isolation. Relying on explicit paths is the preferred and more robust approach for executing applications such as DeepVariant within a containerized environment and will lead to more stable and predictable workflows. This approach ensures proper isolation, reduces the potential for conflicts and promotes consistency.
