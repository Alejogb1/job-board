`stat_pvalue_manual` in `ggplot2` allows for the manual addition of statistical significance brackets to plots, a useful feature for visualizing comparisons. However, controlling the vertical order of these brackets, especially when dealing with multiple comparisons and overlapping brackets, requires a nuanced understanding of its underlying mechanics. I’ve encountered this challenge frequently in my work analyzing gene expression datasets, and the default ordering often obscured rather than clarified my results. The key lies in understanding how `stat_pvalue_manual` interprets the `y.position` and, more critically, how it handles overlapping brackets, as it does not inherently provide a "z-order" parameter like some graphics libraries.

The fundamental problem is that `stat_pvalue_manual` primarily orders brackets based on the numerical value of their `y.position`, with higher values placed higher on the plot. If two brackets overlap horizontally and share a similar `y.position`, the bracket plotted last in your data frame tends to be visually placed on top, obscuring the one below. This behavior, while seemingly straightforward, becomes problematic when you intend specific visual precedence amongst multiple statistical comparisons. Simply increasing the `y.position` for a desired bracket isn’t always the solution, as it also alters its vertical placement and can lead to cluttered plots. The method I've refined focuses on meticulously managing the `y.position` assignments, strategically introducing minor offsets, and finally leveraging the order of data within the `data` argument provided to the `stat_pvalue_manual` layer, ensuring the correct bracket is plotted in front.

My approach begins by creating a data frame specifically for `stat_pvalue_manual`, which I've found critical for managing complex layouts. This data frame must contain at least the following columns: `xmin`, `xmax` (defining the horizontal extent of the brackets), `y.position` (determining the vertical placement), `label` (the text displayed above the bracket, often p-values), and a column for the `group` that will correspond to values in the x-axis (or faceting groups) in your `ggplot`.

Here’s the first code example to illustrate the basic implementation, assuming a simplified scenario with three comparisons:

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Sample Data
df <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), each = 10), levels = c("A", "B", "C", "D")),
  value = c(rnorm(10, 5, 1), rnorm(10, 5.5, 1), rnorm(10, 7, 1), rnorm(10, 6.5, 1))
)


# P-value Data Frame
pvalues_df <- data.frame(
    group1 = c("A", "A", "B"),
    group2 = c("B", "C", "C"),
    label = c("p=0.03", "p<0.01", "p=0.02"),
    y.position = c(7.5, 8.0, 7.7)
)

# Create x-axis position columns for stat_pvalue_manual
pvalues_df <- pvalues_df %>%
  dplyr::mutate(xmin = as.numeric(group1),
                xmax = as.numeric(group2))

# Base plot
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic()


# Add stat_pvalue_manual layer
p +
  stat_pvalue_manual(
    data = pvalues_df,
    aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, label = label, y = y.position),
    vjust = 0.5
  )
```

In this first example, I created a basic boxplot and added significance brackets using `stat_pvalue_manual`. The `pvalues_df` data frame defines the comparisons, their p-values, and the desired initial y-positions. Note that `xmin` and `xmax` columns are created based on the numerical index of the `group1` and `group2` factors which will properly position the bracket on the correct groups. This initial plot might not display brackets in the desired order if they overlap. This is where the second example and its commentary becomes critical.

The second example demonstrates how to introduce vertical offsets to control the visual stacking:

```R
# Modify pvalues_df for manual reordering

pvalues_df <- pvalues_df %>%
    dplyr::mutate(y.position = case_when(
        label == "p<0.01" ~ 8.2, # Raise "p<0.01" above others
        label == "p=0.02" ~ 7.9, # Move slightly above p=0.03
        TRUE ~ y.position # Keep other positions as initially defined
    ))


# Re-plot
p +
    stat_pvalue_manual(
        data = pvalues_df,
        aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, label = label, y = y.position),
        vjust = 0.5
    )
```

Here, I've used `dplyr::mutate` and `case_when` to adjust the `y.position` for specific p-value labels.  The bracket corresponding to "p<0.01" is moved to a slightly higher `y.position` (8.2) than "p=0.02" (7.9), while `p=0.03` remains at 7.5. This ensures "p<0.01" is plotted above "p=0.02", and subsequently above "p=0.03". I used specific, incremental offsets to create visual separations. A key realization here is that while direct z-index or layering is not available, manipulation of y-position coupled with the order of rows in the dataframe is the key to controlling visual representation.

My final example combines vertical offset adjustments with explicit ordering of rows in the dataframe:

```R
# Reorder rows in pvalues_df to force stacking

pvalues_df_ordered <- pvalues_df %>%
  dplyr::arrange(y.position)

# Re-plot with reordered data
p +
  stat_pvalue_manual(
    data = pvalues_df_ordered,
    aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, label = label, y = y.position),
    vjust = 0.5
  )
```

This last example utilizes `dplyr::arrange` to explicitly sort the `pvalues_df` data frame based on the y.position before feeding it to `stat_pvalue_manual`. This explicit ordering ensures that brackets with lower positions will be plotted first, followed by the one with higher positions. By plotting them last and having the highest y.position, the bracket for "p<0.01" will be plotted above the "p=0.02" which will be above the "p=0.03". This final step solidifies my layering strategy, ensuring the exact bracket arrangement I intend. In my experience, using both the `y.position` manipulation and ordering data makes more robust and reproducible results. Note that while it does reorder the plotting process, the final result of this approach may be similar to adjusting the `y.position`, but the explicit ordering does have a direct impact when y-positions are very similar.

In summary, achieving the desired order of statistical significance brackets in `ggplot2`'s `stat_pvalue_manual` requires a meticulous and staged approach. First, a carefully constructed data frame is essential. Next, adjusting `y.position` values with small, incremental offsets is crucial for visual separation. Finally, data frame row ordering before plotting reinforces the explicit stacking. I have found that combining these three elements provides reliable control over the layering of brackets, even in the most complex scenarios. Through this method, I have been able to produce highly informative, layered visualizations that accurately represent the nuances of my statistical comparisons.

For further study, I recommend consulting the official `ggplot2` documentation for details on layers and aesthetics. Additionally, the `dplyr` package’s documentation will be useful for more complex manipulations of data frames. Resources on statistical visualization best practices are also relevant for creating clear and understandable graphics. Exploring examples from the `ggpubr` package, which provides a user-friendly interface for statistical analyses alongside `ggplot2`, can also offer additional insights. These resources, while not code-focused, can provide both a theoretical basis and practical guidance when navigating more complex plotting requirements.
