The fundamental incompatibility between Theano's and TensorFlow's internal parameter representations necessitates a two-stage conversion process.  Direct transformation isn't possible due to differing data structures and serialization methods. My experience working on large-scale model migration projects has underscored this point repeatedly. The approach requires first extracting the parameter values from the Theano archive and then constructing a compatible TensorFlow graph, subsequently saving it as a checkpoint.

**1. Parameter Extraction from Theano Archives (.pkl/.npz)**

Theano's `.pkl` and `.npz` files store model parameters differently.  `.pkl` files, often used for pickled Python objects, directly contain the model's parameter values, usually as NumPy arrays.  `.npz` files, on the other hand, are NumPy's compressed archive format, storing multiple arrays, potentially including other metadata.  The first step involves loading these files and extracting the relevant weight matrices and bias vectors. The specific names and organization of these parameters depend entirely on the original Theano model's architecture and how it was saved.  Thorough inspection of the `.pkl` or `.npz` contents is crucial.

**2. TensorFlow Graph Construction and Parameter Assignment**

After extracting the Theano parameters, the next critical step is to reconstruct an equivalent TensorFlow model. This involves defining the network architecture in TensorFlow using functions like `tf.keras.layers.Dense` or equivalent low-level operations. The extracted parameter values are then assigned to the corresponding TensorFlow variables within this recreated model. This ensures that the weights and biases of the TensorFlow model mirror those from the original Theano model.  Incorrect mapping will lead to significant performance degradation or completely incorrect results.  The exact methodology hinges on carefully mapping Theano layers (e.g., `theano.tensor.nnet.conv2d`) to their TensorFlow counterparts (e.g., `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D`).

**3. Checkpoint Creation using TensorFlow's Saver**

Finally, once the TensorFlow model has been built and populated with the extracted weights, the model is saved as a checkpoint using `tf.compat.v1.train.Saver`. This saver object allows saving and restoring the model's state, including all its parameters.  This is the standard TensorFlow approach for persistence of trained models.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Converting from a .pkl file**

```python
import pickle
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load Theano parameters from .pkl
with open('theano_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    theano_params = pickle.load(f)

# Assume theano_params contains a dictionary: {'W': weight_matrix, 'b': bias_vector}
W_theano = theano_params['W']
b_theano = theano_params['b']

# Define the TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=W_theano.shape[1], input_shape=(W_theano.shape[0],), use_bias=True,
                          kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.Constant(W_theano),
                          bias_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.Constant(b_theano))
])

# Save the TensorFlow model as a checkpoint
saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver()
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    save_path = saver.save(sess, "tensorflow_model.ckpt")
    print("Model saved in path: %s" % save_path)
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward conversion from a `.pkl` file assuming a simple dense layer.  The crucial step here lies in correctly assigning the extracted weights and biases to the TensorFlow layer's initializers.  Error handling (e.g., checking for the existence and shape of keys within `theano_params`) should be incorporated in a production environment.


**Example 2: Converting from a .npz file**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Load Theano parameters from .npz
theano_params = np.load('theano_model.npz')

# Extract parameters - adapt based on your .npz file contents
W_theano = theano_params['W']  # Replace 'W' with actual key name
b_theano = theano_params['b']  # Replace 'b' with actual key name

# Define the TensorFlow model (similar to Example 1)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=W_theano.shape[1], input_shape=(W_theano.shape[0],), use_bias=True,
                          kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.Constant(W_theano),
                          bias_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.Constant(b_theano))
])

# Save the TensorFlow model (same as Example 1)
saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver()
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    save_path = saver.save(sess, "tensorflow_model.ckpt")
    print("Model saved in path: %s" % save_path)
```

This example mirrors the `.pkl` conversion but handles the `.npz` format, highlighting the importance of adapting to the specific structure of the loaded archive.  It's imperative to inspect the contents of the `.npz` file to identify the correct keys for weights and biases.

**Example 3: Handling a Convolutional Layer**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Load Theano convolutional layer parameters (example)
theano_params = np.load('theano_conv_model.npz')
W_conv_theano = theano_params['W_conv']
b_conv_theano = theano_params['b_conv']

# Define the TensorFlow convolutional layer
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=W_conv_theano.shape[3], kernel_size=(W_conv_theano.shape[0], W_conv_theano.shape[1]),
                           input_shape=(28, 28, 1),  #Example input shape. Adjust accordingly
                           use_bias=True,
                           kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.Constant(W_conv_theano),
                           bias_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.Constant(b_conv_theano),
                           padding='same')
])

# Save the TensorFlow model (same as previous examples)
saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver()
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    save_path = saver.save(sess, "tensorflow_conv_model.ckpt")
    print("Model saved in path: %s" % save_path)

```

This example extends the conversion process to a convolutional layer, showcasing the need to adapt the TensorFlow layer definition and parameter assignment accordingly.  Note that the input shape needs to be appropriately set.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on `tf.keras.layers`, `tf.compat.v1.train.Saver`, and variable initialization, are essential resources.  Furthermore, the NumPy documentation provides detailed information on loading and manipulating `.npz` and `.npy` files.  Finally, consulting the official Theano documentation (if still available) might offer insights into the specific structure of your `.pkl` or `.npz` files. Remember that thorough understanding of both Theano's and TensorFlow's APIs is crucial for successful model conversion.
