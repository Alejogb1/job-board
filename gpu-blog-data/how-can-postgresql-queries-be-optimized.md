PostgreSQL query optimization hinges fundamentally on understanding the query planner's cost model and the characteristics of your data.  My experience working on large-scale data warehousing projects has shown that superficial changes rarely yield significant performance improvements.  Instead, a systematic approach, beginning with thorough analysis and profiling, is crucial.

**1.  Understanding the Query Planner and Execution:**

The PostgreSQL query planner employs a cost-based optimizer.  It estimates the cost of various execution plans based on statistics gathered about your tables, indexes, and data distribution.  These statistics are crucial; inaccurate statistics can lead to suboptimal query plans.  Therefore, before implementing any optimization strategy, ensuring your statistics are up-to-date via `ANALYZE` is paramount.  I've encountered countless situations where a simple `ANALYZE` command on a frequently updated table dramatically improved query performance.  Beyond `ANALYZE`, understanding the actual execution plan using `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` is critical for pinpointing bottlenecks.  `EXPLAIN` shows the planned execution path, while `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` executes the query and provides actual execution times and costs. This allows for direct observation of where the query is spending the most time.

**2.  Indexing Strategies:**

Indexes are the cornerstone of query optimization in PostgreSQL.  However, indiscriminately adding indexes can negatively impact performance due to the overhead of index maintenance on write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  The choice of index type and columns requires careful consideration.  B-tree indexes are the workhorse for equality and range queries on individual columns.  For multi-column queries, a composite index on the columns in the order of frequency of use is essential.  If the most frequent queries filter on `columnA` then `columnB`, a composite index on `(columnA, columnB)` will outperform separate indexes.  Furthermore, partial indexes can significantly improve performance for queries filtering on a subset of data. I once worked on a project where a simple partial index reduced query execution time from several minutes to under a second, simply by indexing only the relevant rows for a specific report.

**3.  Query Rewriting and Techniques:**

Beyond indexing, several techniques can enhance query performance.  Careful consideration of the `WHERE` clause is paramount.  Using appropriate operators and avoiding functions within the `WHERE` clause can dramatically improve the planner's ability to utilize indexes.  For instance, using `ILIKE` instead of `LIKE` prevents the use of indexes in many cases.  Similarly, functions on indexed columns often hinder index usage.  Consider pre-calculating and storing derived values if necessary.

Another significant aspect is minimizing the amount of data retrieved.  Using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` is often necessary, but large `OFFSET` values can be computationally expensive.  In such scenarios, employing alternative techniques, like window functions, can drastically improve performance.  Furthermore, `DISTINCT` clauses can be resource-intensive; if possible, explore alternative methods to achieve the same result without relying on `DISTINCT`.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Query and Optimization with Indexing**

```sql
-- Inefficient query: Full table scan
SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE columnA = 'some_value' AND columnB > 100;

-- Optimized query: Using composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_large_table_ab ON large_table (columnA, columnB);
-- Now the query will utilize the index
SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE columnA = 'some_value' AND columnB > 100;
```

*Commentary:*  The first query performs a full table scan, which is extremely inefficient for large tables.  The second query, after creating a composite index on `columnA` and `columnB`, allows the query planner to efficiently locate the relevant rows using the index, drastically reducing execution time.  The order of columns in the index is crucial here, reflecting typical query patterns.


**Example 2:  Optimizing Queries with Large OFFSETs**

```sql
-- Inefficient query using OFFSET: Slow for large offsets
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price LIMIT 10 OFFSET 100000;

-- Optimized query using window functions: Much faster
SELECT * FROM (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY price) as rn FROM products) as ranked_products WHERE rn BETWEEN 100001 AND 100010;
```

*Commentary:*  The first query, using `OFFSET`, requires scanning through 100,000 rows before returning the desired 10 rows.  The second query utilizes window functions to assign row numbers and then filters for the specific range, avoiding the unnecessary scan.


**Example 3:  Improving Query Performance with Function Usage**

```sql
-- Inefficient query with function in WHERE clause: Index not used
SELECT * FROM users WHERE lower(username) = 'john';

-- Optimized query:  Pre-processing or alternative approach
CREATE INDEX idx_username_lower ON users ((lower(username))); --if the lower() is frequently used.
SELECT * FROM users WHERE lower(username) = 'john';

--Alternatively, if lower is not frequently used:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john' OR username = 'John';

```

*Commentary:* The initial query hinders index usage because a function is applied to the indexed column (`username`). The second solution creates a functional index to allow index usage. The third solution demonstrates an alternative approach that avoids the function entirely if case-insensitive matching is only required for "john" and "John".  Careful consideration is needed to weigh the benefit of functional indexes against the write overhead.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official PostgreSQL documentation, specifically the chapters on query planning, indexing, and performance tuning.  Furthermore, books focusing on PostgreSQL optimization and database performance provide more detailed explanations and advanced techniques.  Finally, attending conferences and workshops on database management can provide valuable insights and networking opportunities.


Through a combination of careful index design, appropriate query construction, and consistent monitoring using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`,  one can significantly enhance PostgreSQL query performance.  Remember that optimization is an iterative process requiring continuous profiling and adjustments based on evolving data characteristics and application requirements.
