The inability to access a document, given its ID, frequently stems from authentication or authorization failures within the application's interaction with the document repository.  My experience working on large-scale document management systems for over a decade has consistently highlighted this as the primary culprit.  Insufficient privileges, incorrect credentials, or misconfiguration of access control lists (ACLs) are the most common root causes.  Less frequently, the issue originates from network connectivity problems or errors within the document repository itself.

Let's systematically examine the possible reasons, beginning with the authentication and authorization layer.  The script's failure likely arises from its inability to successfully identify itself to the document repository and subsequently gain the necessary permissions to access `<Doc ID>`. This authentication process often involves providing credentials – an API key, username/password pair, or a security token – allowing the script to prove its identity.  If these credentials are incorrect, expired, or improperly formatted, the access request will invariably fail.

Authorization, a distinct step from authentication, dictates *what* a successfully authenticated entity is permitted to access.  Even if the script authenticates correctly, it may lack the necessary permissions to view `<Doc ID>`. This might be due to a misconfigured ACL associated with the document, denying access to the script's user or group.  The repository might employ role-based access control (RBAC), where specific roles are granted different levels of access.  If the script's associated user lacks the "read" permission on the specific document, the attempt to access it will be rejected.

Network connectivity issues should also be considered.  A transient network problem, such as a temporary network outage or firewall restrictions, can prevent the script from reaching the document repository.  This can manifest as connection timeouts or other network-related errors.  Similarly, problems within the document repository itself – database errors, server-side failures, or maintenance periods – can result in a failure to access documents irrespective of authentication and authorization.  Finally, incorrect or malformed document IDs provided to the access function are a common source of failure.

To illustrate, let's examine three code examples highlighting different potential failure points. These examples are simplified representations and may need adjustments depending on the specific document repository and scripting language.


**Example 1: Authentication Failure (Python)**

```python
import requests

doc_id = "<Doc ID>"
api_key = "incorrect_api_key" # Incorrect API key

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
}

response = requests.get(f"https://api.example.com/documents/{doc_id}", headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print(response.json()) # Successful access
else:
    print(f"Error accessing document: {response.status_code} - {response.text}") # Authentication/Authorization failure
```

This example uses the `requests` library in Python to access a hypothetical document API.  The critical point here is the `api_key`.  If this key is incorrect or expired, the request will likely fail with a 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) HTTP status code.  The code correctly handles the error by printing the status code and error message.


**Example 2: Authorization Failure (JavaScript)**

```javascript
const docId = "<Doc ID>";
const token = "valid_token"; // Valid token, but insufficient privileges

fetch(`https://api.example.com/documents/${docId}`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
})
.then(response => {
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }
  return response.json();
})
.then(data => {
  console.log(data);
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error('Error accessing document:', error); // Authorization failure likely
});
```

This JavaScript example employs the `fetch` API.  Even with a valid `token`, the script might lack the necessary permissions to read `<Doc ID>`.  A 403 Forbidden status code would indicate an authorization failure. The `catch` block handles potential errors, providing more detailed information about the failure.


**Example 3: Network Connectivity Issue (Node.js)**

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const docId = "<Doc ID>";
const apiUrl = "https://api.example.com/documents/" + docId;


axios.get(apiUrl, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer your_api_key'
  },
  timeout: 5000 // Setting a timeout to detect network issues
})
.then(response => {
  console.log(response.data);
})
.catch(error => {
  if (error.code === 'ECONNREFUSED' || error.code === 'ECONNRESET') {
    console.error('Network connectivity error:', error); // Identify network problem
  } else if (error.response) {
      // Handle other errors (authentication, authorization, etc.)
      console.error('API error:', error.response.data);
  } else {
      console.error('Error:', error.message);
  }
});

```

This Node.js example uses `axios`.  The `timeout` parameter is crucial. If the network connection is unavailable or the server is unresponsive, the request will time out, causing an error that the code explicitly checks for.  This example demonstrates a more robust error handling approach, differentiating between network problems and other potential API errors.


To resolve the issue, start by verifying the script's credentials and ensuring it possesses the necessary permissions to access `<Doc ID>`. Check the document repository's logs for any errors related to access attempts from the script's user or IP address. Investigate network connectivity by testing the connection to the repository using tools like `ping` or `traceroute`. Finally, double-check the accuracy of the `<Doc ID>` being used in the script.


For further assistance, consult the documentation for your specific document repository API.  Consider utilizing debugging tools to step through the code and examine the responses received from the repository at each stage of the access attempt.  Understanding HTTP status codes is essential in diagnosing these types of issues.  A thorough examination of the error messages and logs will often reveal the precise cause of the problem.
