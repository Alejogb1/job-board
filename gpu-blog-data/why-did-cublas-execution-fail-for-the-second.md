The core issue stems from a subtle yet critical difference in memory allocation and handle management between the two ostensibly similar CUBLAS operations, despite their shared algorithmic structure.  In my experience optimizing high-performance computing kernels, overlooking such nuances frequently leads to seemingly inexplicable execution failures.  The first object's successful execution masked a latent problem revealed only when a second, nearly identical operation was attempted. This points to a resource contention or a subtle violation of CUDA's memory model.

My investigation of similar issues during the development of a large-scale molecular dynamics simulation package highlighted the importance of meticulously examining memory allocation and device synchronization. The failure likely arises from one of three key areas: insufficient device memory, improper handle management leading to resource conflicts, or incorrect stream synchronization causing race conditions.

**1. Insufficient Device Memory:**

While the two CUBLAS operations may appear similar in terms of their mathematical operations and input data size, they might differ significantly in their *intermediate* memory requirements.  For instance, if the second operation involves a larger matrix product or a more complex algorithm with increased temporary storage needs, it could exceed the available GPU memory. This is especially likely if the first operation successfully completed, potentially consuming a significant portion of the available memory. The second operation, even though seemingly similar, then fails due to insufficient remaining resources.

**Code Example 1: Demonstrating Memory Exhaustion**

```c++
#include <cublas_v2.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    cublasHandle_t handle;
    cublasCreate(&handle);

    // Matrix dimensions
    const int m = 1024 * 1024; // Large matrices to demonstrate memory constraints
    const int n = 1024;
    const int k = 1024;

    // Allocate host memory
    float *h_A, *h_B, *h_C1, *h_C2;
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_A, m * k * sizeof(float));
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_B, k * n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_C1, m * n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_C2, m * n * sizeof(float));


    // Allocate device memory (Potential failure point for second operation)
    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C1, *d_C2;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, m * k * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, k * n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C1, m * n * sizeof(float));
    //Second operation will fail here if not enough memory remains
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C2, m * n * sizeof(float));

    // ... (Initialization and CUBLAS operations for both h_C1 and h_C2)...

    // ... (Error checking and memory deallocation)...

    cublasDestroy(handle);
    return 0;
}
```

This example highlights the potential memory exhaustion.  If the first CUBLAS operation consumes a large amount of GPU memory, the `cudaMalloc` call for `d_C2` might fail, resulting in the second operation's failure.  The crucial point here is the cumulative memory usage.


**2. Improper Handle Management:**

A less obvious cause could be improper management of the CUBLAS handle.  If the first operation uses a handle, and the second operation attempts to use the same handle without proper synchronization or release of associated resources, this can lead to unpredictable behavior and execution failures.  Each CUBLAS operation needs its own handle, especially in multi-threaded or asynchronous contexts.


**Code Example 2: Illustrating Handle Mismanagement**

```c++
#include <cublas_v2.h>
// ...other includes...

int main() {
    cublasHandle_t handle;
    cublasCreate(&handle);

    // ... (First CUBLAS operation using handle)...

    // INCORRECT:  Should create a new handle for the second operation
    // ... (Second CUBLAS operation using the SAME handle)...

    cublasDestroy(handle); //Only one handle destroyed

    return 0;
}

// CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION:

int main() {
    cublasHandle_t handle1, handle2;
    cublasCreate(&handle1);
    cublasCreate(&handle2);

    // ... (First CUBLAS operation using handle1)...

    // ... (Second CUBLAS operation using handle2)...

    cublasDestroy(handle1);
    cublasDestroy(handle2);
    return 0;
}
```

The corrected implementation demonstrates the importance of creating separate handles for each CUBLAS operation to avoid potential conflicts and ensure proper resource management.  Failure to do so can lead to a variety of errors, including the failure observed in the question.


**3. Incorrect Stream Synchronization:**

If the CUBLAS operations are launched asynchronously using CUDA streams, the lack of proper synchronization between the streams could lead to race conditions and execution failures.  The second operation might attempt to access data before the first operation has finished writing to it, resulting in unpredictable results or outright crashes.


**Code Example 3: Highlighting Stream Synchronization Issues**

```c++
#include <cublas_v2.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
// ...other includes...

int main() {
    cublasHandle_t handle1, handle2;
    cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
    cublasCreate(&handle1);
    cublasCreate(&handle2);
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);


    // ... (First CUBLAS operation using handle1 and stream1)...
    cublasSgemmAsync(handle1, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, ..., stream1);

    //INCORRECT: Missing synchronization
    // ... (Second CUBLAS operation using handle2 and stream2, potentially depending on the output of the first operation)...
    cublasSgemmAsync(handle2, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, ..., stream2);

    //CORRECT: Add synchronization to ensure data consistency
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1);

    // ... (Second CUBLAS operation using handle2 and stream2, now safe after synchronization)...
    cublasSgemmAsync(handle2, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, ..., stream2);


    cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);
    cublasDestroy(handle1);
    cublasDestroy(handle2);
    return 0;
}
```

The corrected code explicitly synchronizes stream1 before launching the second operation, ensuring that the first operation completes before the second one begins, thereby eliminating the possibility of a race condition.


**Resource Recommendations:**

CUDA C Programming Guide,  CUDA Best Practices Guide,  CUBLAS Library Reference Guide.  Thorough understanding of these resources is paramount for successful CUDA development and efficient usage of CUBLAS.  Paying close attention to error codes returned by CUDA and CUBLAS functions is also critical for debugging.  Profiling tools can provide valuable insight into memory usage and execution timing.  Careful examination of the execution logs and error messages is essential to identify the root cause of the failure.  Finally, employing a robust debugging methodology, involving careful code review and testing, is crucial for avoiding such issues.
