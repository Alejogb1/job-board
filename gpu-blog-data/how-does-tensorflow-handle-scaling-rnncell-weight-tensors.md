TensorFlow's handling of RNNCell weight tensor scaling during dimension changes is not an automatic or magical process; rather, it relies fundamentally on the user defining how to initialize these tensors when the cell structure or input/output dimensions are altered. The library itself provides no built-in mechanism for dynamically rescaling existing weight tensors. Instead, it's designed around the principle of explicit weight management, where changes necessitate creating new, appropriately sized tensors and populating them as needed. The challenge lies in determining when and how to transfer any relevant learned information from old to new weights, a task that falls squarely on the developer’s shoulders. I've encountered this problem firsthand during several projects involving dynamic sequence length and embedding size changes in recurrent models.

The core issue stems from how TensorFlow stores and uses weight tensors within `RNNCell` instances. Weight matrices and bias vectors are generally initialized once during cell construction using variable initializers (e.g., Glorot Uniform, He Normal, or custom functions). The shape of these tensors is determined by the input and hidden state dimensions specific to that cell at the time of its creation. If, during subsequent training or deployment, the input size, hidden state size, or number of hidden units changes, the pre-existing weight tensors become incompatible with the new dimensions, rendering the model unusable unless these changes are correctly managed. The library doesn’t offer any automatic adjustment or interpolation of the pre-existing values because it doesn't know how the user expects the mapping from one space to another to work.

To illustrate this, consider a simplified scenario involving a basic GRU cell:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial dimensions
input_dim = 10
hidden_dim = 20

# Creating the GRU cell
cell_1 = tf.keras.layers.GRUCell(hidden_dim)

# Build the cell to initialize the weights (needed for manual inspection)
cell_1.build(input_shape=(None, input_dim))

# Inspect weights and biases:
weights_initial = cell_1.weights # Returns a list of Tensors
print(f"Initial weights shapes: {[w.shape for w in weights_initial]}")

# Attempting to use the cell with different dimensions will fail
try:
    inputs_invalid_dim = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 30, 12)) # Changed input dim
    output_invalid, _ = cell_1(inputs_invalid_dim, initial_state=tf.random.normal(shape=(1,hidden_dim)))
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error using cell with mismatched dimensions: {e}")
```

Here, `cell_1` is constructed with input dimension of 10 and hidden dimension of 20.  When we try to process a tensor with an input dimension of 12, it will fail because the cell was built using weights designed for input of 10. It highlights a fundamental fact: the weight tensors are tightly coupled with the structural dimensions defined during cell creation. You cannot directly feed data with incompatible dimensions without recreating the cell or handling the weight matrix transforms yourself.

To handle dimension changes, a common, though manually intensive, strategy involves creating a new cell instance with the appropriate shapes, and then transferring the *relevant* information. It’s important to understand “relevant” here is highly dependent on the context and what you, the developer, want to preserve about your model’s behavior after the change. There’s no single, optimal answer to this.

Consider the scenario of changing the embedding size for a language model. If the existing embedding dimension is 50, and you want to increase it to 100, you must create a new `tf.keras.layers.Embedding` layer with the desired output size.  A naive approach might simply use a random initialization of the new embedding weights, but this often loses the benefit of prior training. Here’s an illustrative example of how one might attempt to transfer prior learned embedding data using zero-padding or a simple projection.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def transfer_embedding_weights(old_embedding_weights, new_output_dim, mode="zero_padding"):
    """Transfers embeddings while handling dimensionality changes
    Args:
        old_embedding_weights: TF Variable of the old embedding weights.
        new_output_dim: The output dimension of the new embedding layer.
        mode: "zero_padding" or "projection" for weight copying method.
    Returns:
       tf.Variable initialized with modified weights.
    """
    old_input_dim, old_output_dim = old_embedding_weights.shape

    if new_output_dim == old_output_dim:
        return tf.Variable(initial_value = old_embedding_weights.numpy(), dtype=tf.float32)

    if mode == "zero_padding":
      if new_output_dim < old_output_dim:
            # Truncate if shrinking dimension
            new_weights_init = old_embedding_weights[:, :new_output_dim].numpy()
      else:
            padding = tf.zeros((old_input_dim, new_output_dim - old_output_dim), dtype = tf.float32).numpy()
            new_weights_init = np.concatenate((old_embedding_weights, padding), axis = 1)
    elif mode == "projection":
      # For simplicity using random matrix; would use trained projections in reality
      projection_matrix = tf.random.normal(shape=(old_output_dim, new_output_dim)).numpy()
      new_weights_init = np.dot(old_embedding_weights.numpy(), projection_matrix)
    else:
      raise ValueError("Invalid mode: 'zero_padding' or 'projection'")


    return tf.Variable(initial_value=new_weights_init, dtype=tf.float32)

# Simulate old and new embeddings

old_input_dim, old_output_dim = 100, 50
new_output_dim = 100

old_embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(old_input_dim, old_output_dim)
inputs = tf.random.uniform(shape=(10,20), minval=0, maxval=old_input_dim-1, dtype=tf.int32)
old_embedding(inputs) # Run to intialize the weight tensor
old_weights = old_embedding.weights[0]

new_embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(old_input_dim, new_output_dim)

# Transfer weights using padding
padded_new_weights = transfer_embedding_weights(old_weights, new_output_dim, mode="zero_padding")
new_embedding.weights[0].assign(padded_new_weights)

print(f"Old embedding weights shape: {old_embedding.weights[0].shape}")
print(f"New embedding weights shape after padding: {new_embedding.weights[0].shape}")

# Transfer weights using linear projection
projected_new_weights = transfer_embedding_weights(old_weights, new_output_dim, mode="projection")
new_embedding_project.weights[0].assign(projected_new_weights)

print(f"New embedding weights shape after projection: {new_embedding.weights[0].shape}")
```

In this example, `transfer_embedding_weights` demonstrates the central concept: create a new weight tensor with the desired output dimension and then use your algorithm to either transfer, pad, or project learned information from the old tensor into the new tensor.

Finally, consider a situation where you need to change the hidden dimension of the RNN cell itself. In that situation, both input *and* recurrent weight matrices will need attention. Here is a more complex example using GRU cells with modified hidden unit size.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


def transfer_gru_weights(old_cell, new_hidden_dim):
   """Transfers GRU weights with dimension changes. Simplified implementation."""

   old_input_dim = old_cell.input_shape[-1]
   old_hidden_dim = old_cell.units

   new_cell = tf.keras.layers.GRUCell(new_hidden_dim)
   new_cell.build(input_shape=(None, old_input_dim)) # Build to initialize new weights

   # Get new weights after build for setting
   new_weights = new_cell.weights
   old_weights = old_cell.weights

   # Input weights transfer
   old_kernel_input = old_weights[0].numpy()
   old_recurrent_input = old_weights[1].numpy()
   old_bias_input = old_weights[2].numpy()

   # Handle input gate weights
   input_kernel = new_weights[0].numpy()
   input_recurrent = new_weights[1].numpy()
   input_bias = new_weights[2].numpy()

   if new_hidden_dim > old_hidden_dim:
      input_kernel[:,:old_hidden_dim*3] = old_kernel_input
      input_recurrent[:old_hidden_dim, :old_hidden_dim*3] = old_recurrent_input # Note, only the appropriate part is being copied
      input_bias[:old_hidden_dim*3] = old_bias_input
   else: # truncate
     input_kernel = old_kernel_input[:, :new_hidden_dim*3]
     input_recurrent = old_recurrent_input[:new_hidden_dim, :new_hidden_dim*3]
     input_bias = old_bias_input[:new_hidden_dim*3]
   #Assign modified weights
   new_weights[0].assign(input_kernel)
   new_weights[1].assign(input_recurrent)
   new_weights[2].assign(input_bias)
   return new_cell

# Simulate old and new GRU cells
old_input_dim = 20
old_hidden_dim = 30
new_hidden_dim = 60

old_cell = tf.keras.layers.GRUCell(old_hidden_dim)
old_cell.build(input_shape=(None, old_input_dim))

new_cell_transfered = transfer_gru_weights(old_cell, new_hidden_dim)


print(f"Old GRU weights shapes: {[w.shape for w in old_cell.weights]}")
print(f"New GRU weights after tranfer, shapes: {[w.shape for w in new_cell_transfered.weights]}")

```

The `transfer_gru_weights` function provides an example of transferring the learned weight matrices when changing the hidden dimension of a GRU cell, although it uses a rather naive direct copying and only works for simple examples.  This example underscores the fact that scaling requires careful manipulation of *multiple* weight tensors within the RNN cell and it is essential to understand the internal structure to accomplish this effectively.

For further learning, I'd recommend these resources: the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the pages covering recurrent neural networks and custom layers.  Research publications on techniques for transfer learning and network surgery are also invaluable. Finally, experimenting with various initializers and data loading techniques will solidify the understanding of how these weights are actually used. Note that the use cases are extremely variable, and it is impossible to create a truly general solution, given that it depends on what is meant by a “good” mapping of an old model to a model with new dimensions.
