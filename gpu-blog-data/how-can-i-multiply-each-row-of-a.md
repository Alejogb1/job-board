The core challenge in efficiently multiplying each row of a softmax output by a separate matrix in TensorFlow lies in leveraging broadcasting effectively to avoid explicit looping, which significantly impacts performance, especially with large datasets.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for large-scale deployment has highlighted this repeatedly.  Directly applying `tf.matmul` will fail due to dimensionality mismatch unless carefully managed.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The problem necessitates a solution that aligns the dimensions appropriately.  We have a softmax output tensor, which I'll represent as `softmax_output` with shape `(batch_size, num_classes)`, where `batch_size` is the number of samples and `num_classes` is the number of classes.  We also have a matrix `transformation_matrices` with shape `(batch_size, num_classes, embedding_dim)`.  The goal is to multiply each row of `softmax_output` (a probability distribution over classes) by its corresponding matrix in `transformation_matrices`. The result should be a tensor of shape `(batch_size, embedding_dim)`.

The key is to reshape `softmax_output` to enable broadcasting.  By adding a new dimension of size 1 along the `embedding_dim` axis, we create a tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_classes, 1)`.  This allows TensorFlow's broadcasting rules to perform element-wise multiplication across the `num_classes` dimension, effectively multiplying each element of a softmax row by the corresponding row in `transformation_matrices`.  Following this, a summation along the `num_classes` axis reduces the result to the desired `(batch_size, embedding_dim)` shape.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Using `tf.einsum`**

This approach leverages Einstein summation, offering a concise and often highly optimized method for expressing tensor contractions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

batch_size = 32
num_classes = 10
embedding_dim = 50

softmax_output = tf.random.normal((batch_size, num_classes))
softmax_output = tf.nn.softmax(softmax_output, axis=-1)  # Ensure softmax output
transformation_matrices = tf.random.normal((batch_size, num_classes, embedding_dim))

result = tf.einsum('bc,bcd->bd', softmax_output, transformation_matrices)

print(result.shape) # Output: (32, 50)
```

The `tf.einsum('bc,bcd->bd', softmax_output, transformation_matrices)` line concisely expresses the desired operation.  'bc' represents the shape of `softmax_output`, 'bcd' represents the shape of `transformation_matrices`, and 'bd' represents the desired output shape.  The comma separates the input shapes, and the arrow indicates the output shape. This eliminates the need for explicit reshaping.  In my experience, `tf.einsum` often provides better performance than manual reshaping and summation.

**Example 2: Reshaping and Broadcasting with `tf.reduce_sum`**

This illustrates the manual reshaping and broadcasting approach described earlier.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

batch_size = 32
num_classes = 10
embedding_dim = 50

softmax_output = tf.random.normal((batch_size, num_classes))
softmax_output = tf.nn.softmax(softmax_output, axis=-1)
transformation_matrices = tf.random.normal((batch_size, num_classes, embedding_dim))

# Reshape softmax output for broadcasting
reshaped_softmax = tf.reshape(softmax_output, (batch_size, num_classes, 1))

# Element-wise multiplication using broadcasting
multiplied = reshaped_softmax * transformation_matrices

# Summation across num_classes
result = tf.reduce_sum(multiplied, axis=1)

print(result.shape) # Output: (32, 50)
```

This example explicitly shows the reshaping step and the use of broadcasting for element-wise multiplication before summing along the correct axis. While more verbose than `tf.einsum`, it clearly demonstrates the underlying mechanism.  I've found this approach useful for debugging and understanding the intermediate steps.


**Example 3:  Using `tf.expand_dims` and `tf.matmul` (less efficient)**

While possible, directly using `tf.matmul` requires careful dimension management and is generally less efficient than the previous two methods.  This is provided for completeness, highlighting a less optimal approach.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

batch_size = 32
num_classes = 10
embedding_dim = 50

softmax_output = tf.random.normal((batch_size, num_classes))
softmax_output = tf.nn.softmax(softmax_output, axis=-1)
transformation_matrices = tf.random.normal((batch_size, num_classes, embedding_dim))

# Expand dimensions for matmul compatibility
reshaped_softmax = tf.expand_dims(softmax_output, axis=2)
reshaped_matrices = tf.transpose(transformation_matrices, perm=[0, 2, 1])

# Matrix multiplication
intermediate_result = tf.matmul(reshaped_softmax, reshaped_matrices)

# Squeeze the extra dimension
result = tf.squeeze(intermediate_result, axis=2)

print(result.shape)  #Output: (32, 50)

```

This example requires transposing `transformation_matrices` and adding an extra dimension to the softmax output to make `tf.matmul` work. The final `tf.squeeze` operation removes the unnecessary dimension introduced during the process.  While functional, this method introduces more computational overhead compared to `tf.einsum` or the reshaping/broadcasting approach.  I generally avoid this method unless absolutely necessary due to its lower efficiency.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on tensor manipulation, broadcasting, `tf.einsum`, and `tf.reduce_sum`, are essential resources.  Furthermore,  a comprehensive text on linear algebra and matrix operations is invaluable for solidifying the theoretical underpinnings.  A deep understanding of broadcasting is crucial for efficiently working with tensors in TensorFlow.  Finally, performance profiling tools within TensorFlow can help in identifying and optimizing bottlenecks in your code.
