Yes, a Keras custom layer can indeed accept another layer as input.  This functionality is fundamental to building complex and modular neural network architectures.  My experience developing large-scale recommendation systems heavily utilized this capability for creating sophisticated embedding and interaction layers.  The key lies in understanding how Keras handles layer objects and tensor manipulation within the `call` method of your custom layer.

**1. Clear Explanation**

A Keras layer, at its core, is a callable object that takes a tensor as input and returns a transformed tensor as output.  This transformation is defined within the `call` method. When constructing a custom layer that accepts another layer as input, you aren't directly passing the layer object itself, but rather the *output tensor* generated by that layer. This output tensor, which is a NumPy array or TensorFlow tensor depending on your Keras backend,  becomes the input to your custom layer's `call` method.

The process involves several steps:

* **Instantiating the input layer:**  You first define and instantiate the layer that will serve as input to your custom layer. This could be any Keras layer, such as a `Dense`, `Conv2D`, `LSTM`, or another custom layer.
* **Passing the input layer's output:** Within your custom layer's `__init__` method, you typically don't store the input layer object itself. Instead, you might store relevant hyperparameters from the input layer if necessary for your custom layer's computations. During the `call` method, you receive the input tensor, which is the output of the input layer, as the first argument (`inputs`).
* **Processing the input tensor:**  Your `call` method then performs the desired transformations on this input tensor using TensorFlow/Theano operations. The result of these operations is the output tensor of your custom layer.
* **Layer integration within the model:** Finally, you integrate both the input layer and your custom layer into a Keras `Sequential` or `Model` object, ensuring the data flow correctly from the input layer's output to your custom layer's input.


Failure to correctly handle the tensor input within the `call` method is a common source of errors. Incorrect data types or shapes can lead to `ValueError` exceptions.  Careful consideration of the expected input shape and data type from the preceding layer is crucial.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Addition Layer**

This example demonstrates a custom layer that simply adds the output of another layer to a constant value.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class AddConstantLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, constant_value, **kwargs):
        super(AddConstantLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.constant_value = tf.constant(constant_value)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs + self.constant_value

# Example usage
input_layer = keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,))
add_layer = AddConstantLayer(constant_value=2)
model = keras.Sequential([input_layer, add_layer])
```

This code defines a layer that adds a constant value to its input.  The `call` method directly uses TensorFlow's element-wise addition.  The `constant_value` is defined in the `__init__` for efficient computation.


**Example 2: Element-wise Multiplication Layer with Shape Check**

This example illustrates a layer performing element-wise multiplication, incorporating a shape check for robustness.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class ElementwiseMultiplicationLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, multiplier_tensor, **kwargs):
        super(ElementwiseMultiplicationLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.multiplier_tensor = tf.constant(multiplier_tensor)

    def call(self, inputs):
        if inputs.shape != self.multiplier_tensor.shape:
            raise ValueError("Input tensor and multiplier tensor must have the same shape.")
        return inputs * self.multiplier_tensor

#Example Usage
input_layer = keras.layers.Dense(5, input_shape=(5,))
multiplier = [1,2,3,4,5]
mul_layer = ElementwiseMultiplicationLayer(multiplier_tensor=multiplier)
model = keras.Sequential([input_layer, mul_layer])

```

This layer demonstrates error handling by raising a `ValueError` if the input shape doesn't match the multiplier tensor shape. This is a crucial aspect of creating production-ready custom layers.  The use of `tf.constant` ensures efficient computation.

**Example 3:  Concatenation Layer with Multiple Inputs**

This showcases a layer accepting multiple inputs (outputs of different layers) using Keras's functional API.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

input_a = keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,))
input_b = keras.layers.Input(shape=(5,))

dense_a = keras.layers.Dense(5)(input_a)
dense_b = keras.layers.Dense(5)(input_b)

class ConcatenateLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.concat(inputs, axis=-1)

concat_layer = ConcatenateLayer()([dense_a, dense_b])
output = keras.layers.Dense(1)(concat_layer)

model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=output)
```

This uses the Keras functional API to create a model with two input layers.  The `ConcatenateLayer` then takes the outputs of `dense_a` and `dense_b` as a list and concatenates them along the last axis. This demonstrates flexibility in handling multiple input tensors.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official Keras documentation;  a comprehensive textbook on deep learning, such as "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet;  and specialized publications on neural network architectures are valuable resources for understanding the intricacies of custom layer development within Keras.  Focusing on TensorFlow's tensor manipulation functions will enhance your understanding of the underlying operations within your custom layers.  Understanding the Keras functional API is highly beneficial for creating more complex network structures involving multiple input and output layers.
