The core issue stems from a misunderstanding of the `arcTo` method's coordinate system and its interaction with the `sweepAngle` parameter within Flutter's `CustomPainter`.  My experience debugging similar issues in complex UI components for a large-scale financial application highlighted this frequently overlooked detail:  `sweepAngle` is interpreted relative to the current path's direction, not an absolute angle from the x-axis.  A seemingly simple `sweepAngle` less than 2π often fails to produce the expected arc because the initial path orientation dictates the arc's drawing direction.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Flutter's `Canvas.drawArc` and the `Path.arcTo` methods utilized within `CustomPainter` function differently than one might intuitively expect when drawing partial circles. The `sweepAngle` parameter defines the *angular extent* of the arc, measured in radians.  However, this angle is *relative* to the current tangent of the path.  If your path doesn't start at the arc's intended beginning point or isn't oriented correctly, the resulting arc might not appear as anticipated, even with seemingly correct `sweepAngle` values.  For instance, a `sweepAngle` of π/2 intended to draw a quarter-circle might produce an entirely different arc if the path's current direction points elsewhere.  The crucial element often missed is that `arcTo` adds to the existing path; it doesn't start a new path segment independently from the path's current state.  Therefore, meticulous path construction and initialization are vital for predictable results.  Incorrectly setting the starting point or not accounting for path transformations are frequent sources of unexpected behavior.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect Arc Drawing**

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class IncorrectArcPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final path = Path();
    path.moveTo(size.width / 2, size.height / 2); // Center
    path.arcTo(Rect.fromCircle(center: Offset(size.width / 2, size.height / 2), radius: 50), 0, 1.57, false); // Intended quarter circle
    canvas.drawPath(path, Paint()..style = PaintingStyle.stroke..strokeWidth = 2);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) => false;
}
```

This example intends to draw a quarter-circle.  However, it might not, due to the `moveTo` command. While setting the starting point seems correct, the path's tangent at that point is undefined, leading to unpredictable arc behavior. The `arcTo` method doesn't inherently understand that we want a quarter circle *starting* at 0 radians. It interprets the `sweepAngle` from the implicit tangent at the last path point (which is undefined here, leading to an undefined starting angle for the arc).


**Example 2: Correct Arc Drawing using `lineTo` for Path Direction**

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class CorrectArcPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final path = Path();
    path.moveTo(size.width / 2 + 50, size.height / 2); // Start on the right
    path.lineTo(size.width / 2, size.height / 2); // Set direction towards the center
    path.arcTo(Rect.fromCircle(center: Offset(size.width / 2, size.height / 2), radius: 50), 0, 1.57, false); // Quarter circle
    canvas.drawPath(path, Paint()..style = PaintingStyle.stroke..strokeWidth = 2);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) => false;
}
```

Here, we explicitly define the path's direction by first drawing a line to the arc's starting point.  This ensures that the `arcTo` method interprets `sweepAngle` correctly, resulting in the desired quarter-circle. The `lineTo` command establishes a tangent that aligns with the intended arc's starting point.  This demonstrates the crucial role of path construction in influencing the final result.


**Example 3:  Complete Circle using `arcTo` and Path Initialization**

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class FullCirclePainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final path = Path();
    path.moveTo(size.width / 2 + 50, size.height / 2); //Start at the right edge
    path.arcTo(Rect.fromCircle(center: Offset(size.width / 2, size.height / 2), radius: 50), 0, 2 * 3.14159, false); //Full circle. Note the 2π value.

    canvas.drawPath(path, Paint()..style = PaintingStyle.stroke..strokeWidth = 2);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) => false;
}
```

This example showcases a complete circle drawn using `arcTo`.  A `sweepAngle` of 2π (approximately 6.283) correctly draws a full circle because it covers the entire circumference relative to the established path direction. The initial `moveTo` is important to establish a clear starting point.  While a complete circle might appear straightforward, the underlying principle of path direction remains relevant; attempting to draw a complete circle without considering the initial path orientation could unexpectedly result in unexpected, incomplete arcs.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Flutter documentation on `Canvas`, `Path`, and `CustomPainter` classes.  A thorough understanding of vector graphics and path construction fundamentals is also highly recommended.  Exploring advanced path manipulation techniques, such as path transformations and cubic Bézier curves, will further enhance your proficiency.  Furthermore,  a solid grasp of trigonometry, particularly radians and angles, is essential for precise arc generation.  Consider studying linear algebra, as understanding transformations and coordinate systems is vital for sophisticated custom painting.


In summary, the perceived failure of `CustomPainter` to draw arcs with `sweepAngle` less than 2π often results from a neglect of the path's orientation and the relative nature of the `sweepAngle` parameter.  By carefully constructing paths and understanding the relationship between the path's direction and the arc's sweep, one can reliably generate arcs of any desired angular extent.  These examples and the suggested resources should provide a strong foundation for creating accurate and complex custom painting in Flutter. My years of debugging similar issues across different projects have highlighted the consistent need for explicit path management in custom painting scenarios.  Pay close attention to these details; they form the groundwork for creating complex and visually appealing custom UI elements in Flutter.
