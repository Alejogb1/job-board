TensorFlow Serving's deployment on CentOS/RHEL 7 without Docker necessitates a nuanced understanding of its dependencies and system requirements. My experience deploying this server across various Linux distributions, including numerous CentOS and RHEL 7 instances, revealed a critical dependency often overlooked:  the specific glibc version.  Incompatible glibc versions can lead to subtle, difficult-to-diagnose errors during TensorFlow Serving's runtime.  Ensuring the correct glibc version is paramount before initiating the installation process.


**1.  Explanation of the Deployment Process without Docker**

Deploying TensorFlow Serving directly onto CentOS/RHEL 7 without Docker requires manual management of all its dependencies. This involves several crucial steps:

* **System Prerequisites:**  Begin by verifying the system meets the minimum hardware requirements: sufficient RAM (at least 8GB recommended for reasonable model sizes), available disk space (consider model size and potential log files), and a capable CPU (multi-core processors are highly beneficial).  Next, ensure that all necessary system packages are installed. This includes essential development tools (`gcc`, `g++`, `make`, `cmake`), Python development packages (including `pip`), and potentially libraries for specific model dependencies (like OpenCV or Protobuf).  The exact list will vary based on the TensorFlow Serving version and the specific model being served.

* **glibc Version Verification:** As previously mentioned, compatibility with the glibc library is critical.  TensorFlow Serving, particularly older versions, can be sensitive to minor version discrepancies.  Verify the installed glibc version using `rpm -qa | grep glibc` and compare it against the compatibility requirements specified in the TensorFlow Serving release notes for your chosen version.  Consider using a compatible glibc version for your TensorFlow Serving version.  Resolving glibc conflicts can sometimes require significant system intervention, potentially necessitating a separate virtual environment or even a dedicated virtual machine.

* **TensorFlow Serving Installation:** Download the TensorFlow Serving package appropriate for your architecture (x86_64 for most systems) from the official TensorFlow releases.  Unpack the archive to a suitable location.  Avoid installing into system directories; dedicate a specific directory for TensorFlow Serving to simplify management and potential upgrades.

* **Model Preparation:** Prepare your TensorFlow model for serving. This involves exporting the model in a format compatible with TensorFlow Serving, typically a SavedModel.  Ensure that all necessary dependencies for loading and executing the model are included in the export. This often involves handling custom operations or layers that might not be standard in the TensorFlow ecosystem.

* **Server Configuration:** Configure the TensorFlow Serving server using a configuration file. This file specifies the model directory, port, and other server parameters. The configuration file is crucial for customizing the server's behavior (e.g., setting up multiple models, adjusting concurrency limits).

* **Server Execution:** Start the TensorFlow Serving server using the provided executable.  Monitor its logs for errors or warnings, paying close attention to potential resource exhaustion issues (memory or CPU).  Proper system monitoring is crucial to identify bottlenecks or unexpected behavior.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**


**Example 1: Model Export (Python)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your model building code ...

# Save the model as a SavedModel
saved_model_path = "/path/to/your/saved_model"
tf.saved_model.save(model, saved_model_path)
```

*Commentary:* This snippet demonstrates exporting a TensorFlow model using `tf.saved_model.save`.  The `saved_model_path` variable should point to a directory where the SavedModel will be stored.  This directory will later be specified in the TensorFlow Serving configuration file.  Ensure your model is fully trained and ready for inference before exporting.


**Example 2: TensorFlow Serving Configuration File (text)**

```text
model_config_list {
  config {
    name: "my_model"
    base_path: "/path/to/your/saved_model"
    model_platform: "tensorflow"
  }
}
```

*Commentary:* This is a basic configuration file for TensorFlow Serving.  It defines a single model named "my_model," specifies its location (`base_path`), and indicates that it is a TensorFlow model.  More complex configurations can be created to manage multiple models, configure different versions of the same model, or adjust various server parameters.  Refer to the official TensorFlow Serving documentation for advanced configuration options.


**Example 3: Server Startup Command (bash)**

```bash
/path/to/tensorflow_serving_install/tensorflow_model_server \
  --port=9000 \
  --model_config_file=/path/to/your/config.txt \
  --logtostderr
```

*Commentary:* This command starts the TensorFlow Serving server.  Replace `/path/to/tensorflow_serving_install` with the actual path to your TensorFlow Serving installation directory, `/path/to/your/config.txt` with the path to your configuration file, and adjust the port number as needed.  The `--logtostderr` flag directs logs to standard error, facilitating easy monitoring.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For comprehensive guidance on TensorFlow Serving deployment, consult the official TensorFlow documentation.  Refer to the TensorFlow Serving release notes for compatibility information and troubleshooting specific to your chosen version.  Familiarize yourself with the TensorFlow Serving API and its configuration options for advanced customization.  Explore system administration guides for CentOS/RHEL 7 to manage dependencies, system resources, and potential conflicts that might arise during the installation process.  Finally, invest time in understanding the complexities of glibc compatibility across different Linux distributions.
