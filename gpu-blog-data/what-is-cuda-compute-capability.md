CUDA compute capability is a crucial metric signifying the architectural capabilities of a NVIDIA GPU, directly impacting the performance of CUDA applications.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) simulations for geophysical modeling has consistently highlighted its importance; choosing the correct CUDA code compilation strategy based on compute capability is paramount for achieving optimal performance and avoiding unexpected runtime errors.  It's not simply a version number; it reflects a complex interplay of hardware features, instruction set extensions, and memory hierarchy characteristics.  Misunderstanding this can lead to suboptimal code execution, limited memory access, and ultimately, inefficient algorithms.


**1. A Clear Explanation:**

Compute capability is expressed as a version number, typically in the format `X.Y`, where `X` denotes the major and `Y` the minor revision.  The major revision indicates significant architectural changes, while the minor revision represents incremental improvements and additions.  Each compute capability level introduces new instructions, enhanced memory access patterns, and potentially altered register file sizes. These differences directly affect the compiled CUDA code.  A kernel compiled for compute capability 3.5, for example, might not run on a device with compute capability 2.0 due to reliance on instructions not present in the older architecture.

The specification for each compute capability level details the following key characteristics:

* **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):** This defines the set of instructions the GPU can execute. Newer compute capabilities introduce new instructions, offering enhanced performance for specific operations.  For instance, higher compute capabilities might support more efficient floating-point arithmetic or specialized instructions for matrix multiplications.

* **Multiprocessors (MPs):** The number and configuration of MPs influence the level of parallelism achievable.  The number of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) within a GPU, and their individual capabilities, directly impact the execution throughput of parallel kernels.  Later compute capabilities frequently incorporate a larger number of SMs and potentially improved intra-SM performance.

* **Memory Hierarchy:**  This encompasses the different memory types (global, shared, constant, texture) and their bandwidths, latencies, and access patterns.  Changes in memory bandwidth and cache sizes between compute capabilities significantly affect memory-bound kernel performance. Higher compute capabilities generally offer improved memory bandwidth and larger cache sizes.

* **Warp Size:** This represents the number of threads executed simultaneously within a single SM.  While this has remained relatively constant across many generations, understanding its implications for thread divergence is crucial for efficient kernel design.

* **Register File Size:** The amount of on-chip register memory per SM impacts the number of threads that can be concurrently executed without spilling to slower memory.  Larger register files allow for more complex threads and better occupancy, leading to higher performance.

Failing to account for these variations when developing CUDA applications results in performance bottlenecks.  Code compiled for a higher compute capability will likely fail to execute on a device with a lower capability, whereas code compiled for a lower capability might execute on a higher capability device but with suboptimal performance due to missing optimizations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Targeting Specific Compute Capability**

```cuda
// Kernel code ...

__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int size) {
  // ... kernel operations ...
}

int main() {
  // ... data allocation and initialization ...

  // Get device properties
  int deviceCount;
  cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
  if (deviceCount == 0) {
    printf("No CUDA devices found!\n");
    return 1;
  }

  int device;
  for (device = 0; device < deviceCount; device++) {
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);
    printf("Device %d: Compute Capability %d.%d\n", device, prop.major, prop.minor);

    // Check for minimum compute capability
    if (prop.major >= 3 && prop.minor >= 5) {
      cudaSetDevice(device);
      // Launch kernel only if compute capability is met
      myKernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(data, size);
      // ... error checking and memory deallocation ...
    } else {
      printf("Device %d does not meet minimum compute capability (3.5)\n", device);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates how to obtain the compute capability of available devices and conditionally launch a kernel only if the minimum required capability is met. This ensures compatibility and avoids runtime errors.


**Example 2: Using Compiler Directives for Optimization**

```cuda
#include <cuda.h>

// Define minimum compute capability
#define MIN_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY 500

// Kernel code that uses advanced features available from 5.0 onwards
__global__ void optimizedKernel(float *a, float *b, float *c, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
#if __CUDA_ARCH__ >= MIN_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY
    // Use advanced instruction available from 5.0
    c[i] = __fmaf_rn(a[i], b[i], c[i]); // fused multiply-add
#else
    // Fallback to slower operation for lower compute capabilities
    c[i] = a[i] * b[i] + c[i];
#endif
  }
}
```

This illustrates how compiler directives can conditionally compile code based on the compute capability.  This allows leveraging advanced instructions while maintaining backward compatibility for older devices.  The `__CUDA_ARCH__` macro provides the compute capability value at compile time.


**Example 3: Handling Different Warp Sizes Implicitly**

```cuda
__global__ void warp_sensitive_kernel(int *data, int size){
    int i = threadIdx.x;
    // Operations that are sensitive to warp size might be optimised differently in future architectures.
    // Compiler will generate appropriate instructions based on the compute capability of target GPU.
    // No explicit handling of warp size necessary in this example.
    // ... operations that might benefit from different warp size optimizations ...
}
```

This example implicitly leverages compiler optimizations.  The compiler automatically generates appropriate instructions based on the target compute capability, accounting for any potential differences in warp size or related architectural features.  While this simplifies development, careful profiling is still essential to identify and address potential performance limitations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation, specifically the sections detailing compute capability and programming guides.  Consult NVIDIA's CUDA C Programming Guide and the CUDA Occupancy Calculator for further details on optimizing kernel performance across various compute capabilities.  Reviewing relevant white papers and application notes on specific compute capability features will significantly enhance your understanding.  Studying example CUDA codes tailored for different compute capabilities is highly beneficial.  Finally, thorough profiling and benchmarking using tools provided within the CUDA toolkit are essential for verifying the effectiveness of your optimization strategies.
