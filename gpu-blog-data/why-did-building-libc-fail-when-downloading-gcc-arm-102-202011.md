The failure to build libc during a gcc-arm-10.2-2020.11 source compilation is almost certainly attributable to an unmet dependency or a configuration mismatch, rather than a primary issue within the GCC compiler itself.  My experience building cross-compilers for embedded systems, spanning projects involving ARM Cortex-M and A series processors, indicates that such errors stem from subtleties in the build environment’s setup.  The GNU toolchain is notoriously sensitive to the host system's configuration and the presence of specific libraries and header files.  The error isn't inherently within gcc-arm itself, but in the build system's ability to correctly locate and utilize necessary components for libc construction.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The gcc-arm compiler package primarily provides the compiler, assembler, and linker.  It does *not* intrinsically contain the source code for libc (the C standard library).  libc is a separate project, often built using the provided compiler.  During the GCC build process, if the system fails to find or access the necessary build tools, headers, and libraries required for compiling libc, the build process will terminate. This can manifest in various ways, from cryptic error messages referencing missing header files to more direct complaints about the build system itself (like `make` failing to locate targets).  The problem lies in the interaction between the build scripts of GCC and the system's capabilities, not solely within GCC's codebase.  The build system needs to have the correct prerequisites satisfied before it can successfully proceed with building the C standard library.  This includes, but isn't limited to:  a compatible build system (usually `make`),  the necessary header files (often found in a development package like `build-essential` on Linux), and sufficient disk space.

Crucially, the gcc-arm package itself is a cross-compiler.  This means it compiles code for ARM processors, *not* the host system's architecture.  Therefore, any dependencies for building libc (which is architecture-dependent) must be resolved for the *host* architecture, not the target ARM architecture.  Mixing these concepts is a frequent source of errors.  Failure often arises from insufficient attention to configuring the cross-compiler's target architecture (ARM) distinctly from the host architecture (e.g., x86-64).

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's examine three scenarios and associated solutions illustrating this issue.

**Scenario 1: Missing Build Dependencies**

Assume a Debian-based system.  A common cause is a missing `build-essential` package, which contains crucial tools and headers needed for many build processes:

```bash
# Incorrect (missing dependency)
./configure --target=arm-none-eabi --prefix=/opt/gcc-arm
make

# Correct (installing build-essential)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
./configure --target=arm-none-eabi --prefix=/opt/gcc-arm
make
```

The first attempt fails because the system lacks fundamental tools like `gcc` (the host compiler) and essential header files. Installing `build-essential` provides these prerequisites for the *host* system's compilation process, allowing the gcc-arm cross-compiler build to complete successfully.

**Scenario 2: Incorrect Host Compiler Selection**

The build system may attempt to use the wrong compiler.  For example, using `gcc` instead of `arm-none-eabi-gcc` when compiling libc components within the GCC build process. This can lead to incompatibility and failures:

```bash
# Incorrect (wrong compiler invoked internally)
# (simplified representation – the actual error is within the GCC build system)
# ... build process ...
gcc -c some_libc_file.c  # Incorrect; should use arm-none-eabi-gcc in this context

# Correct (forcing the correct compiler within configure)
./configure --target=arm-none-eabi --prefix=/opt/gcc-arm --host=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu CFLAGS="-fPIC"
make
```
This might require understanding the GCC build system's internal workings, but specifying the correct host architecture with the `--host` flag can resolve this.  The `CFLAGS` addition ensures Position Independent Code (PIC), which is often necessary for shared libraries.

**Scenario 3:  Incorrect Path Configuration**

The GCC build system relies on environment variables and configuration options to locate libraries and include directories.  An incorrectly set `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, or `INCLUDE` variable can prevent the linker from finding necessary libraries:

```bash
# Incorrect (missing necessary library paths)
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH  # Possibly missing paths needed by the build system
./configure --target=arm-none-eabi --prefix=/opt/gcc-arm
make

# Correct (setting necessary environment variables)
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/:/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./configure --target=arm-none-eabi --prefix=/opt/gcc-arm
make
```
Manually setting the paths to the host system's libraries and include directories can resolve issues when the build system's automatic detection fails.  Note that these paths are examples and will need adjustment based on your system’s actual library locations.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The GNU Compiler Collection manual, specifically the sections on building and installing GCC.  The documentation for your specific Linux distribution regarding package management and build system tools.  A good understanding of cross-compilation principles and terminology. Finally, a robust understanding of the make utility and its usage in complex build systems.  Carefully examining the complete error message during the build failure is paramount; it provides invaluable insights into the root cause.  Pay close attention to any warnings or errors related to missing files, missing libraries, or undefined symbols.
