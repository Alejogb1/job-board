The inherent stochasticity in Bayesian Optimization, coupled with Keras' reliance on random weight initialization, is the primary reason for inconsistent results even with identical hyperparameters.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for image classification using Keras and Bayesian Optimization (BO) revealed this clearly.  While BO aims to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space, the underlying optimization process relies on probabilistic models, making the results inherently susceptible to variations in the sampling and model fitting stages.

**1.  A Clear Explanation:**

Bayesian Optimization works by constructing a probabilistic model (typically a Gaussian Process) of the objective function (e.g., validation accuracy). This model represents our uncertainty about the objective function's value at different hyperparameter settings.  At each iteration, BO uses an acquisition function (e.g., Expected Improvement) to select the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate, aiming to balance exploration (sampling unexplored regions) and exploitation (sampling promising regions).

The inconsistency stems from several factors:

* **Random Weight Initialization:** Keras models are initialized with random weights.  Even with the same hyperparameters, different random initializations can lead to different training trajectories and ultimately, different performance metrics.  This is particularly pronounced in deep learning models, where the landscape of the loss function is highly complex and non-convex.  Slight variations in the initial weights can drastically alter the model's convergence path.

* **Stochastic Optimization Algorithms:**  The optimization process itself—typically stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants—is inherently random.  Small variations in the order of data batches processed during training can lead to minor differences in the final model parameters. These differences accumulate and can manifest as inconsistent performance evaluations across runs.

* **Acquisition Function and Model Uncertainty:** The acquisition function's role is to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters.  However, the acquisition function's calculation involves estimating the model's uncertainty. This uncertainty estimation is probabilistic, and inherently noisy. Consequently, the selected hyperparameters slightly vary even for seemingly identical conditions.  The Gaussian Process model itself, used for surrogate function modeling, introduces further variability in its estimations.

* **Data Sampling:** If your training data is substantial, randomness in the order of batches during training will cause small but systematic differences across runs. Even with shuffling enabled, the specific order remains random. This effect becomes more significant with smaller batch sizes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples illustrate the problem using a simple Keras sequential model for MNIST digit classification and `hyperopt` as the BO framework (other frameworks show similar behaviors).

**Example 1: Basic Setup Illustrating Inconsistency:**

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from hyperopt import fmin, tpe, hp, Trials

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784)
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 784)
y_train = np.array(y_train)
y_test = np.array(y_test)

def objective(params):
    model = Sequential([
        Flatten(input_shape=(784,)),
        Dense(params['units'], activation='relu'),
        Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=params['epochs'], verbose=0)
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
    return -accuracy # Negative since hyperopt minimizes

space = {
    'units': hp.quniform('units', 32, 128, 16),
    'epochs': hp.quniform('epochs', 5, 15, 1)
}

trials = Trials()
best = fmin(fn=objective,
            space=space,
            algo=tpe.suggest,
            max_evals=5,
            trials=trials)
print(best)
```

This simple example shows how the accuracy can vary between different runs. Even with the same `units` and `epochs` parameters selected by Bayesian Optimization, the achieved accuracy will fluctuate due to the reasons explained above.

**Example 2:  Seed Setting for Reproducibility (Partial):**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
# ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

def objective(params):
    tf.random.set_seed(42) #Setting seed for TensorFlow
    np.random.seed(42) #Setting seed for NumPy
    # ... (rest of the code from Example 1) ...

# ... (rest of the code from Example 1) ...
```

Setting seeds for both TensorFlow and NumPy can improve reproducibility to some extent but does not eliminate inconsistencies completely.  The randomness in the data sampling during stochastic gradient descent remains.

**Example 3: Averaging Multiple Runs:**

```python
import numpy as np
# ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

def objective(params):
    results = []
    for i in range(3): # Running 3 times
        tf.random.set_seed(i) #Different seed for each run
        np.random.seed(i)
        # ... (model training as before) ...
        _, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
        results.append(accuracy)
    return -np.mean(results) # Average accuracy

# ... (rest of the code from Example 1) ...
```

Averaging multiple runs with different random seeds provides a more robust estimate of the performance for a given hyperparameter set, mitigating some of the noise introduced by random weight initialization and stochastic gradient descent.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest consulting the documentation for your chosen Bayesian Optimization library (e.g., `hyperopt`, `optuna`, `scikit-optimize`).  Also, studying publications on Bayesian Optimization methods and their application to deep learning model selection will enhance your understanding of the underlying techniques and their limitations. Furthermore, investigating the theory and practical implications of stochastic gradient descent methods within the context of deep learning will further clarify the issues.  Finally, exploring advanced techniques like weight initialization strategies, optimization algorithms and data augmentation methods can help in stabilizing the training process and reducing inconsistencies.
