The issue of KerasTuner only displaying output from the first trial stems from a misunderstanding of its asynchronous nature and the way logging interacts with concurrent processes.  In my experience developing and deploying hyperparameter optimization pipelines, this is a common pitfall, particularly when integrating KerasTuner with verbose training processes.  The problem isn't necessarily a bug in KerasTuner itself, but rather an incorrect expectation regarding the timing and order of output streams.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

KerasTuner employs asynchronous execution for its trials. This means that multiple hyperparameter configurations are evaluated concurrently, often leveraging multiple CPU cores or even distributed computing resources.  Each trial runs independently, and its standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) are managed separately.  If you are simply printing training progress within your Keras model definition using standard `print()` statements, each trial will indeed print its output. However, the seemingly random display of only the first trial's output is because the main process – the KerasTuner orchestrator – doesn't necessarily wait for each trial to complete before proceeding to manage the next. The output streams intertwine, with the main process often outpacing the completion of slower trials. Consequently, you might see the output of faster-executing trials before the slower ones finish.  Later outputs, then, might get obscured or appear fragmented.  This isn't a data loss issue; the data is generated; it simply isn't being displayed in an easily digestible way due to the concurrent nature of the optimization.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect Logging – Using `print()` directly within the model.**

```python
import kerastuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(hp):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=512, step=32),
                              activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(
    hypermodel=build_model,
    objective='val_loss',
    max_trials=3,
    executions_per_trial=1,
    directory='my_dir',
    project_name='helloworld'
)

tuner.search_space_summary()

tuner.search(x=tf.random.normal((100,10)), y=tf.random.normal((100,1)), epochs=2, validation_split=0.2, verbose=1) # Notice verbose=1

for trial in tuner.get_best_trials(num_trials=3):
    print(f"Trial {trial.trial_id}: {trial.hyperparameters.values}, Val_loss: {trial.score}")

```

This code demonstrates the typical problem.  The `verbose=1` argument in `tuner.search()` prints some progress during training, but the lack of structured logging means that the output from subsequent trials may be interleaved or overwritten.


**Example 2: Improved Logging – Using a Callback and TensorBoard.**

```python
import kerastuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard

def build_model(hp):
    # ... (same model definition as Example 1) ...
    return model

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(
    hypermodel=build_model,
    objective='val_loss',
    max_trials=3,
    executions_per_trial=1,
    directory='my_dir',
    project_name='helloworld_tensorboard'
)

tuner.search_space_summary()

tensorboard_callback = TensorBoard(log_dir="./logs", histogram_freq=1)

tuner.search(x=tf.random.normal((100,10)), y=tf.random.normal((100,1)), epochs=2, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])


for trial in tuner.get_best_trials(num_trials=3):
    print(f"Trial {trial.trial_id}: {trial.hyperparameters.values}, Val_loss: {trial.score}")

```

Here, we introduce the `TensorBoard` callback.  This logs the training metrics to a directory, allowing for visualization and analysis of each trial's performance *separately*. While `print()` statements within the model are still subject to interleaving, TensorBoard provides a structured, non-interfering mechanism for capturing detailed training progress for all trials.


**Example 3:  Handling Logging Explicitly within the Search Loop.**

```python
import kerastuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf
import sys

def build_model(hp):
    # ... (same model definition as Example 1) ...
    return model

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(
    hypermodel=build_model,
    objective='val_loss',
    max_trials=3,
    executions_per_trial=1,
    directory='my_dir',
    project_name='helloworld_explicit'
)

tuner.search_space_summary()

trials = tuner.search(x=tf.random.normal((100,10)), y=tf.random.normal((100,1)), epochs=2, validation_split=0.2)

# Explicitly iterate through and print trial results
for trial in trials.get_best_trials(num_trials=3):
    print(f"Trial {trial.trial_id} Summary:", file=sys.stderr) # Redirect to stderr for cleaner output
    print(f"  Hyperparameters: {trial.hyperparameters.values}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"  Objective Value: {trial.score}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"  Status: {trial.status}", file=sys.stderr)

```

This example demonstrates handling the output of each trial individually *after* the `tuner.search()` method completes.  By iterating through the completed trials and printing their results (using `sys.stderr` for cleaner separation), we ensure all outputs are displayed systematically.  This approach avoids the issue of interleaved output.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official KerasTuner documentation.  A comprehensive textbook on hyperparameter optimization.  A publication detailing the use of callbacks in TensorFlow/Keras.  Advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on distributed training and logging.  The source code of KerasTuner itself (for deeper understanding of its internal workings).


By implementing structured logging and understanding the asynchronous nature of KerasTuner, you can effectively capture and analyze the results of all trials, avoiding the deceptive impression that only the first trial's output is generated.  The examples above illustrate different strategies to achieve this, allowing you to choose the approach best suited to your specific needs and project complexity.
