Intermediate Language (IL) optimization is not solely confined to the just-in-time (JIT) compiled binary; significant optimization efforts occur before the JIT process, specifically within the .NET compiler (csc.exe for C#). This preliminary optimization directly influences the IL emitted, ultimately impacting the performance characteristics of the application. Based on my experience as a .NET developer for over a decade, understanding this two-phase optimization paradigm is critical for writing performant code.

The initial phase, occurring during the compilation of source code to IL, entails a variety of transformations. These are designed to improve IL's efficiency before the JIT compiler even becomes involved. A key aspect is the removal of redundant operations. For example, if the compiler can statically determine that a variable will be assigned a constant value, it will frequently directly embed that value into the IL instead of emitting an instruction to perform the assignment. This reduces the number of executed instructions during runtime. Similarly, dead code elimination, which involves removing unreachable or unused code paths, happens at this stage. If a conditional statement's branch is never entered, the associated IL will be entirely removed, reducing the size of the assembly and the workload for the JIT. This phase also includes transformations like constant folding, where arithmetic operations on constants are performed during compilation, replacing the expression with its result in the IL. This pre-optimization process significantly reduces the runtime overhead.

Another crucial aspect of the compiler's optimization is inlining. If a function is deemed short and not called from too many locations, the compiler may choose to replace the call site with the function's IL directly. Inlining avoids the overhead associated with function calls (stack manipulation, parameter passing, etc.) which can be costly, especially in performance-critical code sections. However, inlining decisions are not always clear-cut and the compiler employs heuristics based on function size and complexity, and other factors. Careful function design and minimizing method length can improve the inlining outcome and overall performance.

The final, yet equally critical phase is the JIT compiler. While the .NET compiler handles pre-JIT optimizations, the JIT compiler takes the already optimized IL and further refines it during runtime, converting it into native machine code based on the target architecture. The JIT has access to detailed information about runtime conditions (such as hardware capabilities, the size of arrays, and common data access patterns). This enables it to make optimizations that would be impossible statically during the initial compilation. These optimizations may include register allocation, which places frequently accessed values into the fastest storage locations, and vectorization, which replaces multiple single operations with a single vector operation if the hardware supports it. The JIT compiler can also perform branch prediction optimization and loop unrolling, where loops are rewritten to execute fewer iterations, often enhancing performance.

It is important to note that even though the compiler already did its own level of optimization during IL generation, JIT has access to more information and hence might perform its own optimization on the IL. This is crucial to performance optimization. The JIT’s access to runtime type information gives it the capability to handle generics more effectively than the static compilation process. It can generate specialized code for different type parameters, eliminating boxing operations which degrade performance. This runtime dynamic optimization is invaluable and complements the earlier pre-JIT optimizations.

Let's consider a few code examples.

**Example 1: Constant Folding and Dead Code Elimination**

```csharp
public int Example1()
{
    const int a = 5;
    const int b = 10;
    int result = a + b * 2;
    if (false)
    {
       result += 100;
    }
    return result;
}
```

In this example, the C# compiler will perform constant folding during IL generation and calculate the `result` variable's value to be `25`. In the resulting IL, instead of containing the instruction to perform the addition and multiplication, the IL would just contain a `ldc.i4.s 25` instruction to load the constant value 25. The `if (false)` condition and the `result += 100` line will be entirely eliminated because that branch is never reachable. The JIT will then receive this simplified IL.

**Example 2: Inlining of Small Methods**

```csharp
public class Helper
{
    public int Add(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }
}

public int Example2()
{
    var helper = new Helper();
    int result = helper.Add(5, 10);
    return result;
}
```

Here, the compiler may choose to inline the `Add` method, effectively replacing the call to `helper.Add(5, 10)` with the addition of the values directly within the IL of `Example2`. Depending on the inlining heuristics, this would mean that instead of the IL having a call instruction to the Add method, it would simply have an instruction to add the constants 5 and 10 to get the final result. If it chooses not to inline, the JIT may later choose to inline this method based on runtime usage. In this case, both the pre-JIT and JIT compilers can contribute to optimize the method.

**Example 3: JIT Optimization Based on Runtime Type Information**

```csharp
public int Example3<T>(T value)
{
    if (value is int)
    {
       return (int)(object)value * 2;
    }
    else if (value is double)
    {
       return (int)((double)(object)value * 2.0);
    }
   return 0;

}
```
For generic methods like `Example3`, the .NET compiler generates IL that is generic. However, at runtime, the JIT compiler will create specialized versions of this method based on the actual type argument. If a call to `Example3<int>(5)` is executed multiple times, the JIT will optimize the method specifically for integers. It can eliminate the type check and the boxing conversions, creating efficient native code that directly multiplies the integer by two. If, later, a call `Example3<double>(5.0)` happens, the JIT can further compile a specialized version for doubles. The initial compiler cannot perform this level of optimization because it lacks runtime type information. The JIT's ability to optimize based on runtime type parameters demonstrates another level of optimization entirely unavailable to the pre-JIT compiler.

In summary, CIL optimization is not restricted to the JIT phase. The .NET compiler performs significant optimizations that directly influence the IL emitted before the JIT compiler is even called. The JIT compiler then further optimizes that IL based on runtime parameters. Both optimization stages are important for creating performant applications. While developers don’t directly manipulate the intermediate language, understanding what goes on behind the scenes helps in developing code that is more easily optimized by both the pre-JIT and JIT compilers.

For further learning, I would highly recommend delving into resources like the .NET documentation from Microsoft that provide excellent insights on the .NET compilation pipeline. Books on .NET performance tuning can also be beneficial, as these books usually discuss and show how to measure optimization improvements. Exploring resources related to the inner workings of compilers (although not directly related to CIL) would be helpful in understanding the mechanics of optimization. Finally, reviewing the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification provides details on the format and organization of IL. These resources provide a deeper knowledge of the topic.
