The crucial aspect of retrieving data from a Gremlin server using Node.js/Express and handling promises efficiently lies in understanding the asynchronous nature of Gremlin queries and employing appropriate promise resolution techniques.  Over the years, I've built numerous graph databases using this combination, and consistently found that mishandling asynchronous operations leads to unpredictable behavior and difficult-to-debug errors.  Therefore, structuring the code for clear promise resolution is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Data retrieval from a Gremlin server involves sending queries over a network connection, which is inherently asynchronous.  Node.js, being event-driven, facilitates handling this asynchronicity gracefully through promises.  The Gremlin client library for Node.js typically returns a promise for each query.  To retrieve and utilize the data, you must handle these promises correctly, ensuring the application doesn't proceed before the data is available.  Failure to do so will likely result in undefined behavior or errors referencing `undefined` values.  Efficient promise handling involves using `.then()` for successful query resolution, `.catch()` to handle errors (including network issues and invalid queries), and potentially `finally()` for cleanup actions such as closing connections, regardless of success or failure.  Furthermore, error handling should be comprehensive, providing informative error messages and logging details for easier debugging.  In complex scenarios involving multiple queries or chained operations, using `async/await` can significantly improve readability and maintainability, effectively transforming asynchronous code into a more synchronous-looking structure.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Data Retrieval:**

```javascript
const gremlin = require('gremlin');
const DriverRemoteConnection = gremlin.driver.DriverRemoteConnection;

const connection = new DriverRemoteConnection(`ws://localhost:8182/gremlin`);

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const result = await connection.submit('g.V().limit(10)'); //Simple query
    const vertices = result.toArray(); //Convert to array for easy access
    console.log(vertices);
    return vertices;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    throw error; // Re-throw for handling at a higher level if necessary.
  } finally {
    await connection.close(); //Ensure connection closure even on error.
  }
}

fetchData().then(data => console.log('Data successfully retrieved: ', data));
```

This example demonstrates a basic query using `g.V().limit(10)` which retrieves the first 10 vertices from the graph.  The `async/await` syntax simplifies the asynchronous operation, making it look and behave more like synchronous code. The `try...catch` block ensures error handling, and the `finally` block guarantees connection closure, regardless of success or failure. The use of `toArray()` converts the Gremlin result into a standard JavaScript array for easier manipulation.


**Example 2: Handling Multiple Queries:**

```javascript
async function fetchDataMultiple() {
  const results = [];
  try {
    const result1 = await connection.submit('g.V().hasLabel("person").count()');
    const count1 = (await result1.toArray())[0]; // Extract count from the array
    results.push(count1);

    const result2 = await connection.submit('g.V().hasLabel("person").limit(5)');
    results.push((await result2.toArray()));

    return results;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    throw error;
  } finally {
    await connection.close();
  }
}

fetchDataMultiple().then(data => console.log('Multiple query results:', data));
```

Here, we perform two separate queries: counting persons and fetching a limited set of persons.  Both results are collected, demonstrating the handling of multiple asynchronous operations.  The use of `await` before each `toArray()` ensures each query completes before proceeding.  This approach avoids potential race conditions and ensures data consistency.

**Example 3:  Error Handling and Chaining:**

```javascript
async function complexQuery() {
  try {
    const person = await connection.submit('g.V().has("name", "John Doe").next()').then(result => result.toArray()[0]).catch(error => {
      console.error("Person not found:", error);
      return null; // Return null to indicate failure
    });
    if (person) {
      const friends = await connection.submit(`g.V(${person.id}).out("friend")`);
      console.log("Friends:", (await friends.toArray()));
    }
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in complex query:", error);
    return false;
  } finally {
    await connection.close();
  }
}

complexQuery().then(success => console.log('Complex query success:', success));
```

This example demonstrates a more complex scenario. It first attempts to find a specific person. If successful, it then retrieves the person's friends. The `.catch` within the promise chain allows for handling the case where the person isn't found, returning `null`.  The outer `try...catch` provides additional error handling for other potential issues during the query.  The function returns a boolean indicating success or failure.  This showcases robust error handling and promise chaining for sophisticated queries.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Gremlin documentation; a comprehensive guide on asynchronous programming in Javascript; a well-structured guide to error handling in Node.js; a tutorial on advanced promise handling techniques in Javascript; a book on designing scalable Node.js applications.  These resources provide the foundational knowledge and deeper understanding needed for effective Gremlin server interaction with Node.js and efficient promise management.  Thorough understanding of these resources will allow you to build robust and scalable applications that interact flawlessly with your graph database.
