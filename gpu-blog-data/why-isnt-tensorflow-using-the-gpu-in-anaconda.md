TensorFlow's apparent failure to utilize a GPU within an Anaconda environment is often a result of a mismatch between the installed TensorFlow build and the available CUDA toolkit drivers and libraries, or an incorrect configuration of the system environment. It's not an inherent flaw of TensorFlow or Anaconda, but rather a specific configuration issue that prevents the framework from accessing the GPU's parallel processing capabilities. I've personally encountered this problem multiple times across different projects, and the root cause invariably stems from one of these configuration mismatches. When TensorFlow is compiled, it links against specific versions of the CUDA toolkit. If the installed toolkit version or associated libraries don’t precisely match what TensorFlow expects, GPU acceleration will be absent, defaulting to CPU execution.

Specifically, there are several contributing factors that I've identified. Firstly, the version of TensorFlow installed is crucial. TensorFlow releases specific packages, often denoted by a '+gpu' suffix, designed to leverage NVIDIA GPUs. These require corresponding installations of NVIDIA's CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN, a library for deep neural network acceleration. An improperly installed or an absent GPU version of TensorFlow is a frequent culprit. If the installation command used was something like `pip install tensorflow` instead of `pip install tensorflow-gpu`, the CPU-only version will be installed and the system will not utilize the GPU no matter what Nvidia drivers are installed.

Secondly, even if the `tensorflow-gpu` package was installed, an inconsistent CUDA and cuDNN configuration is equally problematic. The CUDA toolkit's libraries, such as `cudart64_xx.dll` (Windows) or `libcudart.so` (Linux), must be present in the system's library path, and the installed versions must perfectly align with the TensorFlow build. An older or newer version may cause a mismatch preventing proper GPU interaction. The cuDNN library, which speeds up convolution and pooling operations, similarly needs to be installed correctly and be compatible with the installed CUDA version. Incorrect environment variables or file locations can often lead to this issue. The third likely culprit is that there is more than one driver version that is installed and that is conflicting and causing the program to default to the CPU.

To illustrate these issues, let's consider a few scenarios and accompanying code snippets. The first example demonstrates a rudimentary check within Python to determine if TensorFlow detects and uses a GPU.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices()
print(devices)

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
    print("TensorFlow is using the GPU.")
    for gpu in gpus:
        print(gpu)
    print("GPU available")
else:
    print("TensorFlow is NOT using the GPU.")
    print("No GPU device found. Verify Nvidia drivers and CUDA are correctly installed.")
```

This code snippet directly queries TensorFlow for available physical devices. If a GPU is correctly recognized and accessible, it should list at least one entry. It can display a message like `PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:0', device_type='GPU')`, confirming correct recognition. This example provides an immediate feedback mechanism to determine if a device is detected. The crucial part is the conditional statement: if the list of GPUs is not empty, we can expect TensorFlow to utilize it for calculations. In my experience, often the issue is uncovered at this step with an empty GPU list being returned. This indicates the lack of communication between TensorFlow and any available GPU hardware.

The next code example shows how to configure TensorFlow to explicitly limit the GPU usage. This is useful in multi-GPU environments or when wanting to allocate a specific amount of memory. While this is not directly related to the problem, it is useful for controlling Tensorflow's access to GPU resources and sometimes this misconfiguration can be the root of the issue.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
    try:
        # Limit TensorFlow to use the first GPU
        tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')

        # Set memory growth to prevent TensorFlow from allocating all GPU memory
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
        print("TensorFlow is configured to use the first GPU.")

        # Confirm the visible devices are correctly set
        visible_gpus = tf.config.get_visible_devices('GPU')
        print("Visible devices are:", visible_gpus)


    except RuntimeError as e:
        # If there was a problem setting devices or memory growth, catch it.
        print(f"Error configuring GPU usage: {e}")
else:
    print("No GPUs found; continuing with CPU only.")

# Code that uses TensorFlow operations for illustration.
a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
c = a + b
print(c)
```

This example demonstrates a slightly more sophisticated setup. It selects the first visible GPU, sets the memory growth option to prevent TensorFlow from grabbing all available VRAM, and confirms the chosen GPU is visible. While it doesn’t directly resolve the non-GPU utilization problem, it showcases correct GPU selection, which sometimes is missing. It also includes a test operation `c = a+b` which if running on the GPU, would be accelerated versus the CPU. The message "Visible devices are" after `tf.config.get_visible_devices('GPU')` should output a result containing `GPU:0` if the GPU has been set up correctly. If not, it indicates that there is a configuration problem with either the driver or Tensorflow's configuration.

The final example pertains to environment variables, a frequent source of GPU issues. These variables tell TensorFlow where to find CUDA and its related libraries.

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf

# Check the environment variables. This code will output the current values of these system variables, indicating that they exist
if 'CUDA_PATH' in os.environ:
    print(f"CUDA_PATH is set to: {os.environ['CUDA_PATH']}")
else:
    print("CUDA_PATH is not set.")

if 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' in os.environ:
    print(f"LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to: {os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH']}")
elif 'PATH' in os.environ:
    print(f"PATH is set to: {os.environ['PATH']}") # for windows path is used instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
else:
   print("LD_LIBRARY_PATH or PATH is not set")

try:
    devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    if devices:
        print("TensorFlow can see the GPU")
    else:
        print("TensorFlow can not see the GPU")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Exception {e} encountered.")
```
The environment variables shown here are platform specific. On Linux based systems, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is more typical, and on windows `PATH` is used. The `CUDA_PATH` variable should be set to the location where the CUDA toolkit was installed. The appropriate path to the CUDA toolkit libraries needs to be available on your system. When the code is run, it displays these variables so you can confirm that they are set properly. If these are missing or incorrectly set, TensorFlow will not be able to locate the necessary libraries. The system will fall back to using CPU instead. These environment variables must point to directories containing the NVIDIA driver libraries and toolkit files.

From my experience, systematically checking these three aspects – the correct TensorFlow GPU package, compatible CUDA and cuDNN installation, and correctly configured environment variables, invariably solves the issue.

To help address these issues, I would recommend consulting the NVIDIA developer documentation for CUDA and cuDNN installation. The official TensorFlow website provides extensive installation instructions specific to GPU setups. In addition, exploring the forums and online communities dedicated to TensorFlow issues is helpful as a resource for the common problems encountered in this type of setup. Further, I have found that carefully cross-referencing the TensorFlow version against the NVIDIA driver documentation is helpful as it is critical to ensuring full compatibility. These resources have consistently helped me understand, diagnose, and resolve similar GPU utilization issues.
