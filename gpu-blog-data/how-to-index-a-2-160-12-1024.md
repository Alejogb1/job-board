The core issue lies in understanding PyTorch's advanced indexing capabilities, specifically how to leverage broadcasting and multi-dimensional indexing to achieve the desired reshaping without explicit looping.  My experience optimizing deep learning models frequently necessitates such intricate tensor manipulations, and this problem is a common subclass of a broader indexing challenge.  The key is recognizing that the [160] tensor acts as a set of indices to select specific elements along the second dimension of the original [2, 160, 12, 1024] tensor.  However, direct indexing with a single index tensor won't automatically reshape; we must strategically utilize broadcasting and view operations.

**Explanation:**

The provided [2, 160, 12, 1024] tensor represents a data structure where the first dimension might represent, for example, two separate channels, the second dimension contains 160 feature vectors, the third represents 12 sub-features within each vector, and the fourth dimension holds 1024 elements per sub-feature. The [160] tensor, on the other hand, serves as a selection mechanism.  Each element in this [160] tensor should represent the index for a specific sub-feature within the corresponding feature vector in the larger tensor.  Our goal is to extract the elements specified by the [160] tensor, collapsing the third dimension (originally 12 sub-features) into a single dimension of 1024 elements.

To achieve this, we can't directly use the [160] tensor as a single index. Instead, we construct advanced indices using `torch.arange` to generate indices for the first two dimensions, allowing broadcasting to handle the selection of the appropriate 1024-element sub-vectors. The key is understanding that the selection process must be performed along the third dimension, effectively reducing it while maintaining the structure of the first and second dimensions.  This requires explicit index specification across all dimensions.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Using Advanced Indexing**

```python
import torch

# Input tensor
tensor_large = torch.randn(2, 160, 12, 1024)

# Index tensor
index_tensor = torch.randint(0, 12, (160,)) # Random indices for demonstration

# Advanced indexing
tensor_result = tensor_large[:, torch.arange(160), index_tensor, :]

# Verification of shape
print(tensor_result.shape) # Output: torch.Size([2, 160, 1024])
```

This example demonstrates the most direct approach.  `torch.arange(160)` generates a sequence of indices from 0 to 159 for the second dimension, allowing broadcasting across the first and fourth dimensions. `index_tensor` selects the specific element from the third dimension for each feature vector.  The resulting tensor has the desired shape [2, 160, 1024].  This method is efficient and clearly expresses the intent.


**Example 2:  Reshaping with `view` and `gather`**

```python
import torch

tensor_large = torch.randn(2, 160, 12, 1024)
index_tensor = torch.randint(0, 12, (160,))

# Reshape for gather operation
reshaped_tensor = tensor_large.view(2, 160, 12 * 1024)

# Gather indices
gathered_tensor = torch.gather(reshaped_tensor, 2, index_tensor.unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(0).expand(2, 160, 1) * 1024 + torch.arange(1024).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0).expand(2, 160, 1024))

# Verification and Reshape
print(gathered_tensor.shape) # Output: torch.Size([2, 160, 1024])
```

This approach is less intuitive but showcases another powerful PyTorch function, `gather`.  We reshape the tensor to a 2D array where each row contains all sub-features for a given feature vector. Then, the gather operation efficiently selects the specified indices. This requires careful index calculation and expansion to maintain correct broadcasting, thus making it slightly less readable.


**Example 3: Utilizing `reshape` and `permute` for clarity (if index is contiguous)**

```python
import torch

tensor_large = torch.randn(2, 160, 12, 1024)

# Assume index_tensor selects contiguous block (e.g., all indices are 5)
index_tensor = torch.tensor([5] * 160)

# Permute for efficient reshaping
permuted_tensor = tensor_large.permute(0, 1, 3, 2)

# Reshape and select the relevant dimension
reshaped_tensor = permuted_tensor.reshape(2, 160, 1024, 12)[:, :, :, index_tensor]
final_tensor = reshaped_tensor.squeeze(-1)

# Verification of shape
print(final_tensor.shape) # Output: torch.Size([2, 160, 1024])

```

This method relies on the assumption that the indices are contiguous or easily handled by simple slicing.  By permuting dimensions and then reshaping, we position the dimension of interest (the sub-feature dimension) at the end, making direct selection via slicing possible.  This method is efficient if your indexing pattern allows for such simplification, however it's less flexible.

**Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation provides comprehensive details on tensor manipulation techniques, including advanced indexing and broadcasting.  I also recommend exploring tutorials and documentation on linear algebra and multi-dimensional arrays for a more thorough understanding of these concepts.  A solid grasp of NumPy's array operations is also beneficial, as it shares many underlying concepts with PyTorch's tensor operations.  Finally, studying examples of deep learning model implementations often reveals practical applications of these indexing strategies.  Careful study of these resources will enable a deeper understanding of tensor manipulation in PyTorch.
