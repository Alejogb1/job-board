The single most common reason for underutilization of available GPUs in Keras distributed training, despite following the official guide, stems from incorrect configuration of the TensorFlow backend, particularly regarding device visibility and placement strategies. My experience with a large-scale image classification project using `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` highlighted this issue acutely. We had a machine with four powerful GPUs, yet the training loop stubbornly remained confined to a single processor.

The Keras distributed training guide emphasizes the use of `tf.distribute.Strategy` objects, designed to facilitate parallel computation across multiple devices. `MirroredStrategy`, specifically, aims to replicate model weights across devices and distribute batches of data for parallel processing during each training step. However, the automatic allocation and utilization of these devices are not guaranteed simply by instantiating the strategy. Several factors can inhibit correct parallel execution, and understanding them is crucial for diagnosing the problem.

Fundamentally, TensorFlow operates within a session, and the devices available to that session are determined by the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable, or explicit device specifications during session creation. The default TensorFlow behavior, if no devices are explicitly requested, is often to allocate only the first visible GPU, even if others are present. This default behavior, while convenient in basic single-GPU setups, is a primary cause for single-GPU usage in intended multi-GPU configurations. The Keras documentation assumes a specific environment setup where all visible GPUs are intended to be used, however this is frequently not the case.

Secondly, improper handling of `tf.data` pipelines can lead to data bottlenecks, preventing parallel workers from being fed information efficiently. While data loading is, in theory, separate from the actual training, if the dataset pipeline is not designed for parallel access, it can stall the computation and bottleneck the training process, regardless of strategy used. A single process may handle the loading and then distribute that single batch to mirrored copies, rendering the mirroring strategy ineffective.

Thirdly, issues can arise from the strategy's context scope and the way variables are defined in Keras. Specifically, the strategy needs to be active during both model creation and optimization. Misaligning these scopes will invalidate the variable sharing necessary for mirrored execution. If the model is defined outside the strategy context, or variables are not created within its scope, the distribution strategy will only be partially applied, and the model might not be distributed.

Here are some code examples, based on experience, that highlight these common problems and their fixes:

**Example 1: Incorrect Device Visibility**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Incorrect: CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES might be set globally or undefined,
# leading to TensorFlow only seeing/using one GPU by default

# Example of explicitly setting, this will use only device 1
# os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '1'

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# This will still execute mostly on a single GPU, if only one is visible
# The mirrored strategy is correctly instaniated, but the device visibility
# is causing the problem.
```

In this case, even though `MirroredStrategy` is employed and used as a context for the model, if the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable is not appropriately configured or set to a single GPU, TensorFlow will only see and use that single device. The strategy appears functional but will result in performance not much greater than single device.

**Example 2: Data Pipeline Issues**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assuming a single batch loading function
def load_data(batch_size):
    data = np.random.rand(1000, 100).astype(np.float32) # 1000 examples, 100 features
    labels = np.random.rand(1000, 1).astype(np.float32) # 1000 labels
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    return dataset

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

BATCH_SIZE = 32
dataset = load_data(BATCH_SIZE) # single loading pipeline
dist_dataset = strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset(dataset) # Apply strategy

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
    
    def train_step(inputs):
        features, labels = inputs
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          predictions = model(features)
          loss = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(labels, predictions)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    for epoch in range(10):
        for x in dist_dataset:
            strategy.run(train_step, args=(x,))

```

Here, while the data is distributed using the `strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset()`, the initial data loading is not parallel. The `load_data` function creates a single data source, which can become a bottleneck as the data is only loaded by the main process and then distributed across devices. The model itself is correctly defined within the scope of the strategy.

**Example 3: Scope Misalignment and Incorrect Variable Creation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([  # Incorrect: Model defined outside strategy scope
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam() # Incorrect: Optimizer defined outside strategy scope

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():

    dist_dataset = strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset(tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.random.uniform((1000, 100), dtype=tf.float32), tf.random.uniform((1000, 1), dtype=tf.float32))).batch(32))
    
    def train_step(inputs):
        features, labels = inputs
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          predictions = model(features)
          loss = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(labels, predictions)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    for epoch in range(10):
        for x in dist_dataset:
            strategy.run(train_step, args=(x,))
```

In this final example, although the training loop itself is defined within the strategy scope, the *model* and *optimizer* are defined outside of it. This leads to variable creation outside of the context, invalidating the intended mirroring and distribution of the parameters. TensorFlow, in such cases, will usually execute on the default device, typically a single GPU. This misaligned context is common in first-time distributed attempts.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To effectively address these issues, several resources beyond the basic Keras guide should be explored. Deep diving into TensorFlow's API documentation concerning `tf.distribute` and `tf.data` is essential. The TensorFlow Performance Guide contains advice on optimal data pipeline implementations and strategies for maximizing device utilization. The TensorFlow tutorials, found on the official website, provide practical code examples and explanations regarding specific topics like device placement. Finally, exploring real-world code repositories, that implement distributed training, will provide a good way to understand correct usage.
