TensorFlow Keras does *not* automatically handle gradient calculations for custom activation functions;  the automatic differentiation relies on the framework's knowledge of standard activation functions and their derivatives.  My experience optimizing neural networks for high-throughput applications has underscored the critical need for explicitly defining these derivatives when introducing custom activation functions.  Failure to do so results in incorrect backpropagation and consequently, a model that fails to learn effectively, or worse, produces nonsensical results.

The core issue lies in the automatic differentiation process underpinning backpropagation.  TensorFlow Keras leverages computational graphs to track operations and their dependencies.  For built-in activation functions (like ReLU, sigmoid, tanh), these graphs include pre-defined nodes representing both the function and its derivative.  These nodes are crucial during the backward pass, where gradients are calculated. When you introduce a custom activation function, this pre-defined derivative is absent.  The framework cannot automatically derive the gradient unless you provide it.

**1.  Explanation of Automatic Differentiation and Custom Activation Functions:**

Automatic differentiation relies on the chain rule of calculus.  Consider a simple neural network layer with a weight matrix `W`, input `X`, and an activation function `f`. The output is `Y = f(WX)`.  During the forward pass, the network computes `Y`. During the backward pass, the gradient with respect to `W` (∂L/∂W, where L is the loss function) needs to be computed.  The chain rule dictates that ∂L/∂W = (∂L/∂Y) * (∂Y/∂W).  `∂L/∂Y` is obtained from the subsequent layers;  however, calculating `∂Y/∂W` requires the derivative of the activation function `f'(WX)`.

For built-in activation functions, TensorFlow Keras has pre-computed these derivatives.  For a custom activation function, you must explicitly provide the derivative.  Failure to do so leads to an incorrect `∂Y/∂W` and thus a flawed gradient update, hindering the learning process.  This is precisely why the error messages you'll likely encounter will point toward a missing or undefined gradient for the custom activation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation (Missing Derivative):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyActivation(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.sin(inputs) #Custom activation function

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, input_shape=(784,)),
  MyActivation(), #No derivative defined
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

model.compile(...)
model.fit(...)
```

This code will likely fail during training.  While the `sin` function is defined, TensorFlow Keras does not automatically know its derivative for backpropagation.

**Example 2: Correct Implementation (Using tf.custom_gradient):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_activation(x):
    return tf.math.sin(x)

@tf.custom_gradient
def my_activation_with_gradient(x):
    y = tf.math.sin(x)
    def grad(dy):
        return dy * tf.math.cos(x) #Derivative of sin(x)
    return y, grad

class MyActivationLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return my_activation_with_gradient(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, input_shape=(784,)),
  MyActivationLayer(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

model.compile(...)
model.fit(...)
```

This example correctly defines the derivative using `tf.custom_gradient`.  The decorator `@tf.custom_gradient` allows you to specify both the forward pass function (`my_activation_with_gradient`) and its gradient function (`grad`).  The `grad` function calculates the derivative with respect to the input `x`, crucial for backpropagation. This method ensures correct gradient calculation during training.


**Example 3: Correct Implementation (Using tf.GradientTape):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyActivationLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.sin(inputs)

    def get_config(self):
        config = super().get_config().copy()
        return config

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, input_shape=(784,)),
  MyActivationLayer(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(input_data) #Replace input_data with your training data
    loss = loss_function(predictions, labels) #Replace loss_function and labels appropriately

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

This example utilizes `tf.GradientTape` for manual gradient calculation.  While not as concise as `tf.custom_gradient`, this approach allows for more control, particularly helpful when dealing with complex custom activations or needing fine-grained control over the gradient computation.  This avoids relying on automatic differentiation for the custom activation itself.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on custom training loops and automatic differentiation.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, focusing on the mathematical foundations of backpropagation and automatic differentiation.  A practical guide to building and optimizing neural networks in TensorFlow/Keras.


In conclusion, while TensorFlow Keras provides a convenient high-level API for building neural networks, it does not magically handle gradients for custom activation functions. Explicitly defining the derivative, either through `tf.custom_gradient` or manual gradient calculation using `tf.GradientTape`, is essential for successful training.  Ignoring this crucial step invariably leads to incorrect model training and unreliable results. My extensive experience debugging and optimizing deep learning models has repeatedly highlighted the importance of this detail.
