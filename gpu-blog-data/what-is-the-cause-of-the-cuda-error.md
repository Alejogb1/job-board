The CUDA error "invalid device ordinal" stems from an attempt to access a non-existent GPU device within the application's context.  This typically arises from a mismatch between the requested device index and the number of available, accessible, and correctly initialized CUDA-capable devices on the system.  I've encountered this repeatedly during large-scale simulations involving multiple GPUs, and often in situations where runtime device discovery wasn't properly implemented.

My experience suggests that this error is seldom a genuine CUDA driver problem, but rather a software configuration or application logic issue. Thoroughly examining the code's device selection process is crucial. The error manifests when the ordinal—the numerical identifier of the GPU—passed to CUDA functions exceeds the actual number of available and visible devices. This discrepancy can be due to several factors, including:

1. **Incorrect Device Count Determination:**  The application might incorrectly determine the number of available devices.  This is common when relying on outdated or improperly implemented device enumeration methods.  For instance, a naive approach might assume a fixed number of GPUs without accounting for runtime variations or system configurations.

2. **Device Initialization Failures:** Even if the correct number of devices is identified, an individual device might fail to initialize properly.  This could be caused by driver issues, resource conflicts, or hardware malfunctions on a specific GPU.  The application might proceed to utilize a faulty device ordinal, leading to the error.

3. **Incorrect Device Selection:** The application logic might select a device index based on erroneous assumptions or external input.  External configuration files, command-line arguments, or even user input could unintentionally provide an out-of-range device ordinal.

4. **Concurrency Issues:** In multi-threaded applications, multiple threads might attempt to access and manage devices concurrently, leading to race conditions and incorrect device ordinal selection.  Poor synchronization mechanisms can exacerbate this issue.

Let's illustrate these possibilities with code examples.  These examples assume basic familiarity with CUDA programming and the CUDA runtime API.

**Example 1:  Incorrect Device Count Assumption**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount = 2; // Incorrect assumption: Always 2 GPUs
    int device = 1;     // Attempting to use the second GPU

    cudaSetDevice(device);
    // ... CUDA kernel launch ...

    cudaError_t error = cudaGetLastError();
    if (error != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(error));
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code assumes the existence of two GPUs. If only one GPU is present,  `cudaSetDevice(1)` will fail, resulting in the "invalid device ordinal" error.  A robust solution involves dynamically querying the number of devices using `cudaGetDeviceCount()`.

**Example 2:  Ignoring Device Initialization Errors**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

    int device = 0; // Attempting to use the first GPU

    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device); //This should be checked!

    cudaSetDevice(device);
    // ... CUDA kernel launch ...

    cudaError_t error = cudaGetLastError();
    if (error != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(error));
    }

    return 0;
}
```


This example improves upon the first by determining the device count. However, it lacks error handling for `cudaGetDeviceProperties`. A faulty device might return errors here, yet the code proceeds to `cudaSetDevice()`, potentially leading to the error. Proper error checking after each CUDA call is essential.

**Example 3:  Improper Device Selection from External Input**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <device_ordinal>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    int device = atoi(argv[1]);
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

    if (device >= deviceCount) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Invalid device ordinal.  Only %d devices available.\n", deviceCount);
      return 1;
    }

    cudaSetDevice(device);
    // ... CUDA kernel launch ...

    cudaError_t error = cudaGetLastError();
    if (error != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(error));
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This example takes the device ordinal as a command-line argument.  While it checks the device count, it doesn't handle potential errors during argument parsing or other unexpected input.  Input validation is paramount to prevent out-of-bounds device ordinals.  This improved example adds a check against the available device count, improving robustness.



Addressing the "invalid device ordinal" error requires a layered approach:

1. **Robust Device Enumeration:** Always use `cudaGetDeviceCount()` to determine the available devices dynamically.  Never hardcode this value.

2. **Comprehensive Error Checking:** Check the return value of every CUDA API call.  Handle errors appropriately, potentially logging detailed information for debugging.

3. **Input Validation:**  If using external input to select devices, rigorously validate the input to ensure it's within the valid range.

4. **Device Initialization Verification:**  Before using a device, verify its successful initialization with `cudaGetDeviceProperties()`.  Handle errors appropriately if initialization fails.

5. **Thread Safety:** If working with multiple threads, employ appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions when accessing and managing CUDA devices.


Resource Recommendations:
