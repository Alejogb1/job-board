The discrepancy between Keras and TensorFlow outputs for a sinusoidal function, particularly when dealing with complex architectures or extensive training epochs, often stems from subtle differences in their internal gradient computation and optimization processes, even when ostensibly using the same backend. My experience troubleshooting this in a large-scale time-series forecasting project highlighted the importance of meticulously examining the underlying TensorFlow graph and Keras' layer implementations.  While both frameworks ultimately leverage TensorFlow's computational graph, Keras adds an abstraction layer that can introduce minor discrepancies due to default hyperparameter choices or differing handling of numerical precision.


**1. A Clear Explanation**

The core issue lies in the numerical stability and optimization algorithms.  TensorFlow, at its base, offers fine-grained control over the computational graph and the optimization procedure. Keras, built on top, provides a higher-level API streamlining the process.  However, this abstraction can mask nuances.  For instance, Keras might employ default optimizers (like Adam) with default hyperparameters, while a direct TensorFlow implementation might use a different optimizer or fine-tuned hyperparameters. These seemingly minor differences can accumulate over many training epochs, leading to diverging model weights and, consequently, different outputs for the same input, especially when dealing with sensitive functions like a sine wave with its inherent oscillatory nature.

Another critical element is the handling of floating-point arithmetic. Both Keras and TensorFlow utilize floating-point numbers, inherently prone to rounding errors.  The accumulation of these errors during backpropagation and weight updates can significantly affect the final model behavior, especially with deep networks or extended training. The specific order of operations, memory management, and hardware acceleration (such as GPU usage) can further influence the accumulation of these errors, albeit subtly.

Furthermore, the internal random seed initialization within each framework might not be perfectly synchronized, leading to slight differences in weight initialization, and consequently, in the subsequent training trajectory.  Unless explicitly set, this can be a hidden source of variance across runs, further compounding the issue.  Finally, even the use of different versions of TensorFlow, the underlying engine, can cause inconsistencies between Keras and its direct TensorFlow counterpart.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate this with three examples focusing on different aspects contributing to the divergence.

**Example 1: Optimizer Differences**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Keras implementation
model_keras = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model_keras.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
x_keras = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
y_keras = np.sin(x_keras)
model_keras.fit(x_keras, y_keras, epochs=100, verbose=0)
predictions_keras = model_keras.predict(x_keras)

# TensorFlow implementation
X = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1])
Y = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1])
W1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1, 10]))
b1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([10]))
W2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([10, 1]))
b2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1]))
layer1 = tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(X, W1) + b1)
output = tf.matmul(layer1, W2) + b2
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(output - Y))
optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)  #Different Optimizer
train = optimizer.minimize(loss)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    x_tf = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
    y_tf = np.sin(x_tf)
    for i in range(100):
        sess.run(train, feed_dict={X: x_tf, Y: y_tf})
    predictions_tf = sess.run(output, feed_dict={X: x_tf})

#Compare predictions
print("Difference:", np.mean(np.abs(predictions_keras - predictions_tf)))
```
This example directly contrasts Keras' default Adam optimizer with a Gradient Descent optimizer in TensorFlow. The difference in optimization algorithms, even with the same loss function, results in distinct model weights and consequently different predictions.


**Example 2:  Random Seed Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#Setting seeds for reproducibility
tf.random.set_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)

# ... (Keras model and training as in Example 1) ...

#TensorFlow with seed
tf.compat.v1.set_random_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)
# ... (TensorFlow model and training as in Example 1) ...

#Compare predictions (Should show less difference than without seed setting)
```
Here, by explicitly setting the random seeds in both Keras and TensorFlow, we aim to minimize the discrepancies arising from random weight initialization. The comparison will highlight how different seed management can create differences.


**Example 3:  Numerical Precision Control (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Keras with higher precision (Illustrative - not a guaranteed solution)
tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64') #Illustrative change
# ... (Keras model and training as in Example 1) ...

# TensorFlow with default precision
# ... (TensorFlow model and training as in Example 1) ...
```
This example (illustrative, because the effect might be minimal or absent) demonstrates how using higher precision floating-point numbers in Keras (changing the default float32 to float64) could potentially mitigate some of the numerical instability. However, the impact is highly dependent on the complexity and depth of the network.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on its architecture, optimizers, and numerical precision options.  Similarly, the Keras documentation thoroughly explains its layer implementations and the relationship with the underlying TensorFlow graph. Consult the relevant chapters on numerical stability and optimization algorithms in introductory machine learning textbooks.  A book dedicated to advanced TensorFlow techniques would also be beneficial. Thoroughly reading and understanding these resources provides an understanding of the internal workings to address these discrepancies effectively.  Finally, understanding linear algebra and calculus fundamentals related to gradient descent is crucial for grasping the intricacies involved in training neural networks.
