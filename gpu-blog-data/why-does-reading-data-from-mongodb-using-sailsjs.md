Data loss during retrieval operations from MongoDB, specifically when utilizing Sails.js, is not an inherent characteristic of either technology; such behavior indicates a misconfigured or incorrectly implemented data interaction logic within the Sails application. I've debugged several similar issues across various projects, and the common thread isn't a flaw in MongoDB or Sails itself but rather how the application uses these technologies together. The root cause almost always resides in unintentionally destructive operations being executed during what should be read-only requests.

Sails.js, while simplifying much of the boilerplate for web application development, does not intrinsically alter standard MongoDB behavior. When a user makes a request intending to retrieve data using a Sails controller and the associated model, the fundamental operations sent to the MongoDB database should be `find`, `findOne`, or other similar read queries. These commands, under normal circumstances, will not result in data deletion. Therefore, to understand why data loss is occurring during read operations, we must examine what non-standard actions may be getting intertwined within the read logic. Common culprits include mistaking update or delete commands for read operations, or inadvertently triggering model lifecycle hooks that perform destructive actions.

A primary area for scrutiny is the Sails model configuration itself. Specifically, model lifecycle callbacks, like `beforeDestroy`, `afterDestroy`, `beforeUpdate`, and `afterUpdate` are functions triggered automatically upon designated events. If, for instance, you mistakenly implement the `afterFind` hook to call a destructive function or alter data properties in a way that, upon re-saving, triggers deletion, seemingly read-only requests can lead to data loss. Consider this scenario: you are using a custom `afterFind` hook on a `User` model. Instead of just reading, you inadvertently perform logic that changes a user property and then performs an implicit save on the record, which might have unintended consequences.

Let's examine a concrete example to illustrate this.

```javascript
// models/User.js
module.exports = {
  attributes: {
    email: { type: 'string', required: true, unique: true },
    name: { type: 'string', required: true },
    isActive: { type: 'boolean', defaultsTo: true },
    lastLogin: { type: 'ref' },
    loginCount: { type: 'number', defaultsTo: 0 }
  },

  afterFind: async function (results, proceed) {
    for (let user of results) {
        user.loginCount = user.loginCount + 1;
        user.lastLogin = new Date();
        await User.update(user.id, user); // Incorrect update within afterFind
    }
    return proceed();
  }
};

// controllers/UserController.js
module.exports = {
  find: async function (req, res) {
      try {
          const users = await User.find();
          return res.json(users);
      } catch (error) {
          return res.serverError(error);
      }
  }
}
```
In this example, the controller simply fetches all users using `User.find()`. However, within the `User` model, the `afterFind` hook is designed to increment the `loginCount` and update the `lastLogin` for each user fetched. Critically, the `afterFind` lifecycle callback is designed to process returned results without modifying the underlying database by design. This incorrect operation triggers an update after each find operation which depending on the update logic, might result in unintended behaviour. This doesn’t delete records but the example demonstrates the type of logical issue which causes data issues when combined with bad data models.

Another potential cause stems from improperly structured or unintentionally destructive custom query logic. While Sails Waterline, the ORM layer utilized, abstracts the underlying database operations, this abstraction does not preclude the application code from performing delete operations. If custom query logic inadvertently invokes `destroy` on fetched records instead of solely retrieving them, it leads to loss of data. Consider the below code snippet.

```javascript
// models/User.js
module.exports = {
    attributes: {
      email: { type: 'string', required: true, unique: true },
      name: { type: 'string', required: true },
      isActive: { type: 'boolean', defaultsTo: true },
      lastLogin: { type: 'ref' },
      loginCount: { type: 'number', defaultsTo: 0 }
    },
    customFunc: async function (criteria) {
        try{
            const users = await User.find(criteria);
            if(users.length > 0)
            {
                await User.destroy({ id: _.map(users, 'id')}); // Mistaken destroy operation
                return {success: true, message: "users found and destroyed"}
            }
            return {success: false, message: "no users found"}
        } catch (e) {
            throw e
        }

    }
  };

// controllers/UserController.js
module.exports = {
    customEndpoint: async function (req, res) {
      try {
        const criteria = req.body.criteria;
        const response = await User.customFunc(criteria);
        return res.json(response);
      } catch(err) {
        return res.serverError(err);
      }
    }
  }
```

In this case, a custom function on the User model is incorrectly designed to `destroy` users based on arbitrary criteria. When `customEndpoint` in `UserController` makes a request using a criteria that results in any user records being found they are all destroyed by the model logic. It shows a common error pattern where custom logic unintentionally invokes `destroy` methods.

Finally, incorrect usage of the populate function can potentially lead to deletion if used incorrectly. Populate is designed to fetch related records within a relational model however if not handled carefully can cause unintentional writes that can lead to deletion in poorly designed data structures or via lifecycle hooks that are triggered during the population operation. Note the below code example.

```javascript
// models/Post.js
module.exports = {
    attributes: {
        title: { type: 'string', required: true },
        content: { type: 'string' },
        author: { model: 'user' },
        tags: { collection: 'tag', via: 'posts' },
    },
    afterPopulate: async function (results, proceed) {
       for (let result of results) {
          if(result.tags && result.tags.length == 0)
            await Post.destroy(result.id); // Incorrect conditional destroy
       }
        return proceed()
      },
};

// models/Tag.js
module.exports = {
  attributes: {
    name: { type: 'string', required: true, unique: true },
    posts: { collection: 'post', via: 'tags' }
  }
};

// controllers/PostController.js
module.exports = {
  find: async function (req, res) {
    try {
      const posts = await Post.find().populate('tags').populate('author');
      return res.json(posts);
    } catch (error) {
      return res.serverError(error);
    }
  },
};
```

Here, a `Post` model includes a `tags` collection. The controller calls `.populate('tags')` in an attempt to eagerly load the associated tags when fetching posts. The `afterPopulate` lifecycle hook is incorrectly designed to destroy posts that don't have any associated tags, which isn't the normal use case for the lifecycle callback. If the user requests posts which don’t have tags in the associated collection, they are destroyed rather than returned as empty or null.

To mitigate such issues, several resources are invaluable. Firstly, thoroughly review the official Sails.js documentation, particularly the sections on models, lifecycle callbacks, and custom queries. Understanding the intended functionality and limitations of each component is crucial. Second, examine your project code for non-standard logic, especially within model files, and review the logic within your custom endpoint definitions. If you do not have a detailed knowledge of the behavior of the code, then you do not understand the behavior of your code. Finally, incorporate rigorous testing with particular emphasis on testing the read logic and data models; data loss of this type should be caught early and never in production. Specifically, focus on unit tests for models and integration tests that combine controller logic with data access. By adopting a systematic approach, these issues can be prevented and data integrity ensured. Review and adhere to separation of concerns such that reads, updates and deletes each have dedicated control paths and are not accidentally intertwined by way of misimplemented data models and controllers.
