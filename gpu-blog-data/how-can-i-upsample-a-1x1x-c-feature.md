Upsampling a 1x1xC feature map to NxNxC in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) requires careful consideration of the desired properties of the upsampled output.  Directly applying standard upsampling techniques like bilinear interpolation or nearest-neighbor interpolation will often lead to unsatisfactory results, particularly when dealing with learned feature maps within a deep learning context. My experience in developing high-resolution image segmentation models has shown that preserving semantic information during upsampling is critical for effective performance. Therefore, a learned upsampling method is generally preferred.

The most effective approach I've found involves the use of a transposed convolution (also known as a deconvolution), often coupled with additional architectural elements to further enhance the quality of the upsampled feature map. A simple transposed convolution will effectively upsample the input by learning the appropriate kernel weights to generate the NxN spatial dimensions. However, the learned weights might struggle to capture the complex relationships necessary to reconstruct detailed spatial information from a single point.

**1. Explanation of Transposed Convolution for Upsampling**

A transposed convolution operates by reversing the process of a standard convolution.  Instead of reducing the spatial dimensions of an input feature map, it expands them. This expansion is controlled by the kernel size, stride, and padding parameters.  Crucially, the transposed convolution learns the weights that best map the 1x1xC input to the NxNxC output. This learned mapping allows for a more semantically meaningful upsampling compared to simple interpolation methods.

The mechanism involves expanding the input feature map to incorporate zero-padding to account for the stride and kernel size, performing a standard convolution operation on this expanded map with the learned kernel, and then reshaping the result to the desired NxNxC dimensions. The zero padding ensures that the output dimensions align with the target size.

The effectiveness of this method significantly depends on the appropriate selection of the transposed convolution's hyperparameters: kernel size, stride, and padding.  A larger kernel size will allow for the capture of more contextual information during upsampling, while a smaller kernel size will maintain finer details but potentially at the cost of accuracy. The stride determines the amount of upsampling per step, directly impacting the output dimensions.  Appropriate padding is crucial for achieving the desired NxN output dimensions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate the application of transposed convolutions for upsampling in different deep learning frameworks.

**Example 1: TensorFlow/Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def upsample_1x1(input_tensor, output_size):
    """Upsamples a 1x1xC feature map to NxNxC using a transposed convolution.

    Args:
        input_tensor: Input tensor of shape (batch_size, 1, 1, C).
        output_size: Tuple (N, N) specifying the desired output spatial dimensions.

    Returns:
        Upsampled tensor of shape (batch_size, N, N, C).
    """
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=input_tensor.shape[-1],
                                        kernel_size=3,  #Example kernel size, adjust as needed.
                                        strides=output_size[0], #Stride matches output size for simplicity. Adjust if different upsampling is required
                                        padding='same')(input_tensor)
    return x

#Example Usage
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 1, 1, 64)) #Batch size 1, 1x1 input, 64 channels
output_size = (16, 16)
upsampled_tensor = upsample_1x1(input_tensor, output_size)
print(upsampled_tensor.shape) # Output: (1, 16, 16, 64)
```

This Keras example leverages the `Conv2DTranspose` layer for direct upsampling.  The kernel size and stride are set to values that might be suitable, but optimizing these for a specific application is essential.  Experimentation is critical here.  I've typically found a kernel size of 3 or 5 to be effective in my projects. The 'same' padding ensures that the output maintains the desired dimensions.


**Example 2: PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def upsample_1x1_pytorch(input_tensor, output_size):
    """Upsamples a 1x1xC feature map to NxNxC using a transposed convolution in PyTorch.

    Args:
        input_tensor: Input tensor of shape (batch_size, C, 1, 1).
        output_size: Tuple (N, N) specifying the desired output spatial dimensions.

    Returns:
        Upsampled tensor of shape (batch_size, C, N, N).
    """
    upsample = nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels=input_tensor.shape[1],
                                  out_channels=input_tensor.shape[1],
                                  kernel_size=3, #Example kernel size. Adjust as needed.
                                  stride=output_size[0], #Stride matches output size for simplicity. Adjust as needed.
                                  padding=1) #Example padding. Adjust as needed.
    upsampled_tensor = upsample(input_tensor)
    return upsampled_tensor

#Example Usage
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 64, 1, 1) #Batch size 1, 64 channels, 1x1 input
output_size = (32, 32)
upsampled_tensor = upsample_1x1_pytorch(input_tensor, output_size)
print(upsampled_tensor.shape) # Output: (1, 64, 32, 32)

```

This PyTorch example uses `nn.ConvTranspose2d` for the transposed convolution. Note the channel ordering in PyTorch (Batch, Channel, Height, Width) differs from TensorFlow/Keras.  Similar to the Keras example, kernel size, stride, and padding are configurable parameters requiring careful tuning.


**Example 3:  Improving Upsampling with a Residual Connection**

In many cases, directly using a transposed convolution might not yield the best results.  Adding a residual connection can substantially improve the upsampling quality.  This is particularly true for upsampling from extremely low resolutions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def upsample_1x1_residual(input_tensor, output_size):
    """Upsamples a 1x1xC feature map to NxNxC using a transposed convolution with a residual connection.

    Args:
        input_tensor: Input tensor of shape (batch_size, 1, 1, C).
        output_size: Tuple (N, N) specifying the desired output spatial dimensions.

    Returns:
        Upsampled tensor of shape (batch_size, N, N, C).
    """
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=input_tensor.shape[-1],
                                        kernel_size=3,
                                        strides=output_size[0],
                                        padding='same')(input_tensor)
    #Upsample input tensor to match dimensions using nearest neighbor for residual connection
    residual = tf.image.resize(input_tensor, size=output_size, method='nearest')
    # Add residual connection
    x = tf.keras.layers.Add()([x, residual])
    return x


#Example Usage
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 1, 1, 64))
output_size = (16, 16)
upsampled_tensor = upsample_1x1_residual(input_tensor, output_size)
print(upsampled_tensor.shape)  # Output: (1, 16, 16, 64)
```

This example incorporates a residual connection, adding the upsampled feature map to a nearest-neighbor upsampled version of the input. This residual connection helps preserve low-level details that might be lost during the transposed convolution process, enhancing the overall quality.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further understanding of transposed convolutions, I suggest consulting standard deep learning textbooks and research papers focusing on image segmentation and generative models.  Specific attention should be given to papers discussing architectural design choices for upsampling in deep convolutional networks.  Exploring various implementations within popular deep learning libraries' documentation is also beneficial.  Finally, reviewing code examples from well-established repositories focusing on image generation or segmentation provides practical insights.
