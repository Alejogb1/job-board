The lack of improvement in accuracy and loss during LSTM model training often stems from a combination of data-related, architectural, and training process issues. Specifically, it’s not enough to merely select an LSTM; the model’s performance is highly sensitive to proper configuration and careful handling of input data. In my experience, these three areas warrant systematic investigation.

Firstly, problematic input data can significantly hinder an LSTM's ability to learn. Issues frequently revolve around insufficient preprocessing, leading to non-stationarity in the input sequences. For example, if features possess markedly different scales, the LSTM might struggle to converge. Consider a time series dataset predicting stock prices, containing both 'volume traded' and ‘price.’ The volume, often in the thousands or millions, might overshadow the relatively smaller price values. Failing to standardize or normalize such features results in the model disproportionately weighting the volume information, hindering its ability to accurately interpret price movements. Similarly, the lack of proper temporal context can mislead the model. If each sequence fed to the LSTM is too short, the model may not capture longer-term patterns and will exhibit high variance during training, thereby preventing a consistent improvement in accuracy or loss. Input sequences must possess a length sufficient to include the relevant dependencies in the data. If your sequences are derived using fixed length sliding window based on a very long time series that does not show stationarity in the mean, you also need to re-think how you are splitting the data. I’ve worked on systems with hourly granularity that performed much better after the data was segmented into 24-hour long chunks, since the daily seasonal pattern was not being captured when using smaller sequence length. Finally, noisy or corrupted data can undermine any model's ability to learn underlying patterns. Preprocessing steps to remove outliers or impute missing values are frequently necessary before supplying data to an LSTM.

Secondly, the architecture of the LSTM itself can be a limiting factor. The size, and specifically, the number of hidden units in the LSTM layers determine model capacity. Too few units can lead to underfitting – where the model cannot capture the complexity of the data and therefore does not reduce the loss or increase accuracy. Conversely, too many units can lead to overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data without generalizing well to unseen data, leading to erratic training patterns. The number of layers in the LSTM is equally important. Shallow networks might lack the expressive power to learn intricate relationships, while deep networks could be susceptible to vanishing gradients during backpropagation if not implemented with care. Moreover, the chosen activation function can impact the rate and nature of learning. For instance, using the hyperbolic tangent as activation function might result in vanishing gradients in deep models. Also, neglecting to add regularization, such as dropout, can contribute to overfitting and suboptimal model performance, even in cases where enough hidden units are provided. Lastly, the choice of the optimizer may also matter. The adaptive learning rate of algorithms like Adam or RMSprop usually leads to faster convergence.

Thirdly, the training process must be carefully designed to encourage learning. A common pitfall is employing a learning rate that's either too large or too small. A learning rate that’s too large will cause the model to ‘jump’ over the minima, oscillating around a minimum point without converging. Whereas too small learning rate will lead to a painfully slow process and also the model may converge to a local minima. Another issue may be a batch size that's improperly set. Small batch sizes can result in highly variable gradient estimates, leading to unstable training. Conversely, overly large batch sizes can reduce the effective learning rate, hindering convergence. Moreover, a sufficient number of training epochs are crucial; too few, and the model hasn't learned enough; too many and you’re simply fitting the noise. Finally, incorrect weight initialization can slow learning or contribute to vanishing gradients, especially in deep networks. Specifically, it's been my experience that using Glorot or He initialization provides a much faster convergence than the default random initialization.

Here are three concrete code examples, using Python and TensorFlow, to illustrate these points:

**Example 1: Data Scaling Issue (Illustrative)**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Simulate data with a feature on a large scale, and another on a smaller scale
np.random.seed(42)
time_steps = 100
n_features = 2
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, time_steps, n_features)
X_train[:,:,0] = X_train[:,:,0] * 1000  # Scaled up feature 0
y_train = np.random.rand(1000, 1)

# Incorrect model architecture (without scaling)
model_incorrect = Sequential([
  LSTM(50, input_shape=(time_steps, n_features)),
  Dense(1)
])
model_incorrect.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
history_incorrect = model_incorrect.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)


# Correct model architecture (with scaling)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = np.copy(X_train) # Avoid modifying the original X_train
for i in range(X_train.shape[0]):
  X_scaled[i] = scaler.fit_transform(X_scaled[i]) # Normalize each sequence separately
model_correct = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, input_shape=(time_steps, n_features)),
    Dense(1)
])
model_correct.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
history_correct = model_correct.fit(X_scaled, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

print("Loss without scaling: ", history_incorrect.history['loss'][-1])
print("Loss with scaling: ", history_correct.history['loss'][-1])

```

In this first example, the feature at index zero is scaled up significantly. Without standardizing the features, the model’s loss remains quite high, even after training for 10 epochs. Whereas, using `StandardScaler` for each time series individually, significantly reduces the loss. This demonstrates the importance of proper data scaling. The `StandardScaler` is fit using only one sequence of the entire `X_train` array at a time and not by fitting to the entire data set of `X_train`. This is important since the scaler needs to be fit and applied to every sequence individually and not globally to the whole batch of data.

**Example 2: LSTM Size and Overfitting**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Generate a simpler synthetic dataset
np.random.seed(42)
time_steps = 50
n_features = 1
X_train = np.random.rand(100, time_steps, n_features)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Overly small LSTM model
model_small = Sequential([
    LSTM(5, input_shape=(time_steps, n_features)),
    Dense(1)
])
model_small.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
history_small = model_small.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=200, verbose=0)

# Overly large LSTM model (without regularization)
model_large = Sequential([
  LSTM(200, input_shape=(time_steps, n_features)),
  Dense(1)
])
model_large.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
history_large = model_large.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=200, verbose=0)

# Medium size with regularization
model_medium_reg = Sequential([
    LSTM(100, input_shape=(time_steps, n_features)),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(1)
])

model_medium_reg.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
history_medium_reg = model_medium_reg.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=200, verbose=0)


print("Loss of small model: ", history_small.history['loss'][-1])
print("Loss of large model: ", history_large.history['loss'][-1])
print("Loss of medium-sized regularized model: ", history_medium_reg.history['loss'][-1])
```

Here we see that with an overly small LSTM, the training error is higher than the one of a medium-sized network, with 100 hidden units. However, using 200 units yields similar performance, with potential overfitting that is evidenced by a higher validation error. Adding a dropout layer to the medium-sized model demonstrates that by properly regulating the network, you can achieve a better performance.

**Example 3: Learning Rate Issues**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Simple synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
time_steps = 20
n_features = 1
X_train = np.random.rand(100, time_steps, n_features)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)


# Training with a high learning rate
model_high_lr = Sequential([
    LSTM(20, input_shape=(time_steps, n_features)),
    Dense(1)
])
optimizer_high_lr = Adam(learning_rate=0.1)  # Large learning rate
model_high_lr.compile(optimizer=optimizer_high_lr, loss='mse')
history_high_lr = model_high_lr.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Training with a low learning rate
model_low_lr = Sequential([
    LSTM(20, input_shape=(time_steps, n_features)),
    Dense(1)
])
optimizer_low_lr = Adam(learning_rate=0.0001)  # Small learning rate
model_low_lr.compile(optimizer=optimizer_low_lr, loss='mse')
history_low_lr = model_low_lr.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Training with an appropriate learning rate
model_appropriate_lr = Sequential([
    LSTM(20, input_shape=(time_steps, n_features)),
    Dense(1)
])
optimizer_appropriate_lr = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)  # Proper learning rate
model_appropriate_lr.compile(optimizer=optimizer_appropriate_lr, loss='mse')
history_appropriate_lr = model_appropriate_lr.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

print("Loss with high LR: ", history_high_lr.history['loss'][-1])
print("Loss with low LR: ", history_low_lr.history['loss'][-1])
print("Loss with proper LR: ", history_appropriate_lr.history['loss'][-1])
```

The third code snippet demonstrates the impact of the learning rate. A high learning rate causes the loss to fluctuate wildly, without any apparent downward trend. Using a small rate causes the convergence to be very slow. The proper learning rate allows for a much faster and stable reduction in loss.

For those who want to delve deeper, I recommend resources focusing on time series analysis, LSTM network implementation, and numerical optimization techniques. Consult introductory textbooks on deep learning for background on neural networks and activation functions.  Look into specialized literature focusing on the specific applications you are tackling (e.g., natural language processing or financial time series).  Academic journals provide cutting-edge research on advanced architectures, optimizers and more complex applications. Lastly, the official documentation for libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch offers detailed guidance on their respective APIs, which can aid in implementing these techniques correctly.
