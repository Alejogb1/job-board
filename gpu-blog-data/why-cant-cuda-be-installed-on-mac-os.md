CUDA's incompatibility with macOS 10.7.5 stems primarily from a fundamental mismatch between the operating system's kernel and the driver requirements of the CUDA toolkit.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects across various platforms, including extensive work with CUDA on Linux and Windows systems, highlights this core issue.  Apple's rapid iteration of macOS during that era, coupled with Nvidia's focused development efforts targeting more modern operating systems and hardware, resulted in a discontinued support window for older versions like 10.7.5.  This is not merely a matter of a few missing libraries; it reflects a broader architectural incompatibility that prevents the CUDA driver from establishing the necessary communication pathways with the GPU.

The CUDA driver is not simply a software package; it's a complex piece of low-level code that directly interacts with the GPU's hardware. This interaction requires deep integration with the operating system kernel, exploiting kernel-level features for memory management, interrupt handling, and direct hardware access.  Changes in the kernel between macOS 10.7.5 and later versions introduce significant divergences in these crucial functionalities.  Attempting to force a CUDA installation on 10.7.5 would lead to driver crashes, kernel panics, or system instability at best. At worst, it could damage the system's functionality, necessitating a complete reinstallation.

Let's examine the issue through the lens of driver architecture.  The CUDA driver relies heavily on several key components:

1. **Kernel-level drivers:** These low-level drivers act as the interface between the operating system and the GPU hardware.  They manage memory allocation, DMA transfers, and interrupt handling â€“ all critical for GPU operation.  Compatibility issues at this level are practically insurmountable without significant reverse engineering, an unlikely scenario given Nvidia's commercial interests.

2. **User-space libraries:**  These libraries, like `cuda.h` and `libcuda.so` (or their equivalents on macOS), provide the higher-level APIs that developers use to write CUDA programs. While these libraries are themselves platform-dependent, their proper functioning completely depends on the underlying kernel-level drivers working correctly.  A mismatch at the kernel level will invariably lead to failures here.

3. **Hardware-specific components:** The CUDA driver incorporates hardware-specific code that's tailored to the precise architecture of the GPU in use.  While this part may appear less prone to OS-level compatibility issues, its interaction with the kernel-level components remains paramount for successful operation.  Any divergence between the driver's expectations and the kernel's behavior will inevitably result in errors.


The following code examples illustrate the fundamental reliance on the CUDA driver's proper functioning, emphasizing the futility of trying to bypass the architectural incompatibilities present with macOS 10.7.5:


**Example 1: Basic CUDA Kernel Launch**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  int *a, *b, *c;
  int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

  // Memory allocation on host and device
  a = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  b = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  c = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(int));

  // ... (Initialization and data transfer omitted for brevity) ...

  // Kernel launch
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  addKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

  // ... (Data transfer back to host and memory deallocation omitted for brevity) ...

  cudaError_t error = cudaGetLastError();
  if (error != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(error));
    return 1;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This code, even if compiled successfully, will inevitably fail on macOS 10.7.5 due to the driver's inability to manage device memory (`cudaMalloc`), launch kernels (`<<<...>>>`), or handle errors correctly.


**Example 2: CUDA Driver API Call**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int deviceCount;
  cudaError_t error = cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

  if (error != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(error));
    return 1;
  }

  printf("Number of CUDA devices: %d\n", deviceCount);
  return 0;
}
```

This simple code attempts to obtain the number of CUDA-enabled devices.  On macOS 10.7.5, `cudaGetDeviceCount` will almost certainly fail due to the missing or incompatible driver, returning a CUDA error code.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Context Creation (Illustrative)**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  CUcontext cuContext;
  CUresult result = cuCtxCreate(&cuContext, 0, 0); // Creates a CUDA context

  if(result != CUDA_SUCCESS){
    fprintf(stderr, "CUDA Context Creation Failed: %d\n", result);
    return 1;
  }

  // ... further CUDA operations would follow here ...

  cuCtxDestroy(cuContext);
  return 0;
}

```

This example, using the older CUDA Driver API, attempts to create a CUDA context.  This low-level operation will also fail on macOS 10.7.5 because the driver lacks the necessary support to create a valid context on that outdated OS version.  The function would return an error code indicating the failure.


In conclusion, the inability to install CUDA on macOS 10.7.5 is not a matter of simple driver updates or missing libraries; it is a deep-seated incompatibility between the operating system kernel and the fundamental architecture of the CUDA driver.  The examples provided showcase the dependency of CUDA applications on a fully functional driver, highlighting the inherent impossibility of circumventing the underlying OS-level limitations.  Resources such as the official CUDA documentation, Nvidia's developer forums, and advanced texts on parallel computing and GPU programming would be invaluable for gaining a deeper understanding of CUDA's intricacies and limitations.
