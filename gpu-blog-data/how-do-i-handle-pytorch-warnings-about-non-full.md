PyTorch's warning regarding non-full backward hooks, triggered when multiple autograd nodes are involved in the forward pass, typically indicates that not all gradients are being intercepted by a hook attached to a single Tensor. This is a critical issue because it can result in incomplete debugging or unintended modifications to gradients within complex computational graphs, especially when working with custom autograd functions. In my experience debugging deep learning models, this warning often surfaces when implementing operations that involve multiple Tensors and thus multiple nodes in the computational graph which each will hold their part of the computation in forward, and then during the backward pass will backpropagate the accumulated gradient.

The core issue stems from how PyTorch's autograd engine manages gradients. Each Tensor maintains a `.grad` attribute that stores the gradient of the Tensor with respect to the loss function. When backward pass is triggered, the autograd engine traverses the computational graph, calculating local gradients based on each node's `forward` operation, and accumulating them into the respective tensors. Hooks allow us to intercept this process, inspecting or altering gradients at a chosen point. However, a hook is attached to *a single tensor*, and if the forward pass involves calculations spanning multiple Tensors, not all gradients will pass through that *single* hook. This results in a scenario where parts of the graph are not covered by the hook, hence the "non-full" warning.

To comprehend this thoroughly, consider an operation involving the addition of two Tensors, `a` and `b`, producing a result `c`. If we attach a backward hook to `c`, when we call backward the hook will intercept the gradient that goes to `c`. However, the backward pass will also produce gradients for `a` and `b`. Therefore, the backward hook on `c` will not see these gradients and we have a non-full hook because we missed a portion of the gradient flow.  The gradients produced for `a` and `b` will be the same as the gradient from `c`. But in more complex cases of custom autograd functions, the situation can become difficult to debug.

The primary method to address this warning is to attach hooks to *every* Tensor involved in the forward pass where gradients are required for observation or manipulation, ensuring full coverage of the backward flow through the computational graph. Instead of attaching the hook to the result of an operation, you must hook directly to each input tensor you wish to observe.

Here are three code examples illustrating the problem and its resolution.

**Example 1: The Issue - Non-Full Hook on a Resultant Tensor**

```python
import torch

def my_custom_function(a, b):
    c = a + b
    return c

a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

def hook_function(grad):
    print("Gradient:", grad)
    return grad

c = my_custom_function(a, b)
hook_handle = c.register_hook(hook_function)

loss = c.sum()
loss.backward()

hook_handle.remove()

print("Gradient of a:", a.grad)
print("Gradient of b:", b.grad)
```

In this example, the `my_custom_function` simply adds two tensors. We then attach a backward hook to `c`, the result of the addition. The warning will appear when the backward pass is executed. The hook intercepts the gradient of `c`, but the gradients of `a` and `b`, computed during the backpropagation but not intercepted by hook because the hook was on `c`, are also required. This leads to the warning because the hook didn't see all the backpropagating gradients.

**Example 2: Partial Resolution - Hooks on Input Tensors**

```python
import torch

def my_custom_function(a, b):
    c = a + b
    return c

a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

def hook_function_a(grad):
    print("Gradient of a:", grad)
    return grad

def hook_function_b(grad):
    print("Gradient of b:", grad)
    return grad

a_hook_handle = a.register_hook(hook_function_a)
b_hook_handle = b.register_hook(hook_function_b)

c = my_custom_function(a, b)

loss = c.sum()
loss.backward()

a_hook_handle.remove()
b_hook_handle.remove()

print("Gradient of a:", a.grad)
print("Gradient of b:", b.grad)
```

Here, the backward hooks are registered on both `a` and `b`, the inputs to the `my_custom_function` which are also inputs of the addition operation performed within. This will display gradients for both `a` and `b` during back propagation, addressing the previous example's issue with missing gradients from our hook. The warning should not appear.

**Example 3: Complex Custom Autograd Function with Multiple Inputs**

```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Function

class MyComplexFunction(Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, a, b, scale):
        ctx.save_for_backward(a, b, scale)
        output = (a * b) * scale
        return output

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        a, b, scale = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_a = grad_output * b * scale
        grad_b = grad_output * a * scale
        grad_scale = grad_output * (a * b).sum()
        return grad_a, grad_b, grad_scale

my_complex_func = MyComplexFunction.apply

a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)
scale = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)

def hook_function_a(grad):
    print("Gradient of a:", grad)
    return grad

def hook_function_b(grad):
    print("Gradient of b:", grad)
    return grad

def hook_function_scale(grad):
    print("Gradient of scale:", grad)
    return grad

a_hook_handle = a.register_hook(hook_function_a)
b_hook_handle = b.register_hook(hook_function_b)
scale_hook_handle = scale.register_hook(hook_function_scale)


c = my_complex_func(a, b, scale)

loss = c.sum()
loss.backward()

a_hook_handle.remove()
b_hook_handle.remove()
scale_hook_handle.remove()

print("Gradient of a:", a.grad)
print("Gradient of b:", b.grad)
print("Gradient of scale:", scale.grad)
```

In this more complex example, we've defined a custom `torch.autograd.Function`. The `forward` function multiplies the input Tensors `a` and `b` element-wise, then multiplies each element of the result by the `scale` tensor. The backward pass then calculates the gradients for each input. To monitor all the gradients through our hook, we must attach the hook to each Tensor involved in the forward pass. Failure to do so, would result in a non-full hook, since we would miss either the gradient of `a`, `b`, or `scale`.

To summarise, to avoid the non-full backward hook warning, ensure that backward hooks are registered on *every* tensor that requires gradient inspection or manipulation after the forward pass, especially with custom autograd functions or operations with multiple input tensors.

For further learning I would recommend diving deeper into:

1.  **PyTorch Autograd documentation:** Review the specific mechanisms of how back propagation functions and how each Tensor is tied to the computation graph.
2.  **Custom `torch.autograd.Function` tutorials:** Gaining mastery over custom functions is a core element in understanding the gradient flow.
3.  **Debugging techniques for PyTorch models:** Developing proficiency in PyTorch debugging strategies can aid in handling similar warnings and errors.

By adhering to these principles and expanding your knowledge base, you can effectively manage gradient flow and avoid pitfalls arising from non-full backward hooks in PyTorch.
