TensorBoard's epoch visualization isn't always comprehensive due to its internal logging mechanism and the optional nature of epoch-level data recording.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale model training projects has highlighted the crucial role of logging frequency and the interplay between training loops and TensorBoard's data ingestion capabilities.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorBoard relies on summary writers to ingest and display training metrics. These writers typically operate at a specified frequency, often determined by the `log_every_n_steps` parameter within the `tf.summary` API (or equivalent in other frameworks like PyTorch).  If this frequency is set higher than the number of steps per epoch, not every epoch will have a corresponding data point logged. Consequently, TensorBoard will only visualize the epochs for which data is available, creating the impression of missing epochs. This is further complicated by the fact that epoch boundaries aren't inherently tracked by TensorFlow or PyTorch; they're a construct defined within your training loop.  The frameworks primarily log at a step level.  If your custom training loop doesn't explicitly log data at the end of each epoch, or logs data infrequently compared to the epoch length, gaps will appear in the TensorBoard visualization.

Another contributing factor is the handling of exceptions or early stopping. If your training process encounters an error or the training is prematurely terminated, the summary writer might not have a chance to flush its buffer, resulting in a truncated TensorBoard display. Finally, data serialization and network latency can also play a minor role; though rarely a significant contributor to completely missing epochs, these factors can cause delays in data reaching TensorBoard.

In essence, the problem stems from a mismatch between the desired visualization granularity (epoch-level) and the actual logging frequency and reliability within the training script.  It is not an inherent limitation of TensorBoard, but rather a consequence of how data is provided to it.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Insufficient Logging Frequency:**

This example demonstrates a scenario where the logging frequency is too low to capture every epoch.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (model definition, optimizer, etc.) ...

log_dir = "logs/scalars/"
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

epochs = 10
steps_per_epoch = 100
log_every_n_steps = 200  # Log every 200 steps, less frequent than epochs

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for step in range(steps_per_epoch):
        # ... (training step) ...
        loss =  # ... (calculate loss) ...
        if (epoch * steps_per_epoch + step) % log_every_n_steps == 0:
            with writer.as_default():
                tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=epoch * steps_per_epoch + step)
```

In this code, because `log_every_n_steps` is 200, and `steps_per_epoch` is only 100, we will only log approximately every other epoch, resulting in incomplete TensorBoard visualization.  To resolve this, you'd need to adjust `log_every_n_steps` to a value less than or equal to `steps_per_epoch`.


**Example 2: Epoch-level Logging:**

This example demonstrates explicitly logging at the end of each epoch, ensuring every epoch is represented, even with a higher `log_every_n_steps`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (model definition, optimizer, etc.) ...

log_dir = "logs/scalars/"
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

epochs = 10
steps_per_epoch = 100
log_every_n_steps = 50

for epoch in range(epochs):
    epoch_loss = 0
    for step in range(steps_per_epoch):
        # ... (training step) ...
        loss =  # ... (calculate loss) ...
        epoch_loss += loss
        if step % log_every_n_steps == 0:
            with writer.as_default():
                tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=epoch * steps_per_epoch + step)

    # Log epoch summary
    with writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('epoch_loss', epoch_loss / steps_per_epoch, step=epoch)
```

This approach guarantees that an epoch-level summary is written regardless of the `log_every_n_steps` parameter. This approach is generally preferred for better visualization of epoch-level trends.


**Example 3: Handling Exceptions:**

This demonstrates how to handle exceptions to ensure that even if an error occurs, the existing data is written to TensorBoard.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (model definition, optimizer, etc.) ...

log_dir = "logs/scalars/"
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

epochs = 10
steps_per_epoch = 100

try:
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for step in range(steps_per_epoch):
            # ... (training step) ...
            loss = # ... (calculate loss) ...
            with writer.as_default():
                tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=epoch * steps_per_epoch + step)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    writer.flush() # Ensures all data is written before exiting.
```

The `finally` block guarantees that the `writer.flush()` method is called, even if an exception is raised during training, ensuring all logged data is written to disk and subsequently visible in TensorBoard.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, PyTorch documentation (if using PyTorch), and any relevant deep learning textbook covering logging and visualization practices will provide comprehensive details on using summary writers and related APIs.  Furthermore, thoroughly examining your specific framework's documentation on logging mechanisms is essential for nuanced control over the data displayed in TensorBoard.  Paying close attention to error handling and data writing procedures within training scripts will significantly improve the robustness and completeness of your TensorBoard visualizations.
