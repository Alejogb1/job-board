The core challenge in observing print statements from Airflow tasks stems from the asynchronous and distributed nature of its execution.  Print statements originating within a task's Python code don't automatically surface in the Airflow UI; they're typically logged to the worker's standard output, often inaccessible without direct access to the worker machine.  Effective solutions involve redirecting this output to a more observable channel, either through Airflow's logging mechanisms or by employing alternative output methods.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues on large-scale ETL pipelines, involving hundreds of tasks, honed my approach to these problems.


**1. Leveraging Airflow's Logging System:**

Airflow's logging capabilities are the most straightforward and recommended method for displaying task output.  The key is to ensure the print statements are directed to the logging system, which Airflow then aggregates and presents within the task instance details in the UI.  This involves utilizing Python's `logging` module within your task functions.  Improper configuration of the logging level can lead to missing output.  It's crucial to set the logging level appropriately â€“ generally `logging.INFO` is suitable for displaying print statements.  Lower levels like `logging.DEBUG` may produce excessive output, while `logging.WARNING` and above may filter out intended output.

**Code Example 1: Using Python's `logging` module**

```python
import logging
from airflow.decorators import task

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@task
def my_task():
    log.info("Task execution started.")
    result = some_computation()
    log.info(f"Computation result: {result}")
    log.info("Task execution completed.")

# ... rest of your Airflow DAG ...

```

This example leverages Airflow's automatic logging integration.  The `logging.getLogger(__name__)` obtains a logger associated with the current module, which Airflow automatically handles.  Using `log.info()` directs messages to the Airflow logging system, ensuring they are displayed in the task logs within the Airflow UI.  This method prevents the need for manual file handling or external services, simplifying debugging and monitoring.


**2. Utilizing XComs for Inter-Task Communication:**

While not strictly designed for real-time output display, Airflow's XComs provide a robust mechanism for passing data between tasks.  By pushing print statements (or any other relevant data) into an XCom, you can then access and display this information in downstream tasks or even directly within the Airflow UI using custom sensors or operators. This approach, while not providing immediate feedback during task execution, facilitates post-mortem analysis and monitoring of task progress.  It's especially beneficial for complex workflows where tracking intermediate results is crucial.

**Code Example 2: Using XComs to capture and display output:**

```python
from airflow.decorators import task
from airflow.models.xcom_arg import XComArg

@task
def my_task():
    result = some_computation()
    return {"result": result, "message": "Task completed successfully!"}

@task
def display_results(results: XComArg):
    result_data = results.get()
    print(f"Task Result: {result_data['result']}")  #This print statement will be in the Airflow logs.
    print(f"Task Message: {result_data['message']}") #This print statement will be in the Airflow logs.


# ... rest of your Airflow DAG ...
#  my_task() >> display_results(my_task())
```


Here, `my_task` returns a dictionary containing the computation result and a status message.  `display_results` retrieves this data using `XComArg` and subsequently prints it, which is again logged by Airflow.  The use of `print` within `display_results` will be logged because this task also runs within the Airflow environment.  This provides a structured way to observe task outputs, especially useful when needing to correlate results from multiple tasks.


**3. Custom Operators with File Output and UI Integration (Advanced):**

For more complex scenarios requiring specific output formatting or integrations with external monitoring systems, creating a custom Airflow operator is a viable solution. This involves implementing a custom operator that performs the desired task, captures the standard output (stdout), and then writes this output to a file.  This file can then be made accessible to the Airflow UI either through a custom sensor that checks for file existence and content, or through other UI-specific integrations (like incorporating the output into a task's description via a hook or external script after execution).  This approach offers maximum flexibility but requires more advanced programming skills and understanding of Airflow's extensibility features.  Incorrectly handling file paths can lead to permissions issues or output not being correctly displayed.

**Code Example 3: Outline for a custom operator (pseudocode):**

```python
from airflow.models.baseoperator import BaseOperator
from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults

class CustomOutputOperator(BaseOperator):
    @apply_defaults
    def __init__(self, output_file, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.output_file = output_file

    def execute(self, context):
        with open(self.output_file, 'w') as f:
            # Execute the task and redirect stdout to the file f
            # ... task code ...
            # Instead of print statements use f.write() to write to the file.

        # Post-execution: Implement logic to display content of self.output_file in Airflow UI (e.g., using a sensor, a hook, or external scripting).
        # ...

```

This is a simplified representation.  The actual implementation would require detailed handling of file operations, error management, and UI integration using Airflow's API or other mechanisms.  Care should be taken to manage the file location and access permissions, considering the security implications of storing sensitive information in such files.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official Airflow documentation, particularly the sections on logging, operators, and XComs.  Furthermore,  refer to Python's `logging` module documentation for advanced logging configuration.  Consider exploring Airflow's plugin architecture for more complex customizations.  Finally, review materials on Airflow best practices for DAG design and task management.  These resources provide a comprehensive understanding of the tools and techniques necessary to effectively manage and monitor Airflow task outputs.
