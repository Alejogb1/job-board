The consistent generation of identical embeddings by a triplet loss network typically stems from a failure in the optimization process, specifically a collapse of the embedding space.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image retrieval projects has shown this to be a prevalent problem, often masked by seemingly successful training metrics.  The underlying cause invariably relates to the network's inability to effectively discriminate between different classes or instances due to suboptimal learning rate scheduling, inadequate network architecture, or an imbalance in the triplet mining strategy.

**1.  Clear Explanation of the Problem:**

The triplet loss function aims to learn embeddings that satisfy the constraint:  `d(a, p) + margin < d(a, n)`, where `d` represents a distance metric (usually Euclidean), `a` is the anchor sample, `p` is a positive sample (from the same class as `a`), and `n` is a negative sample (from a different class). The margin ensures a minimum separation between positive and negative pairs.  If the network collapses, all embeddings converge to a single point in the embedding space, irrespective of the input sample.  This renders the distance calculations meaningless; `d(a, p)` and `d(a, n)` become essentially zero, satisfying the constraint trivially, but eliminating the discriminative power of the learned representation.

Several factors contribute to this collapse.  A learning rate that is too high can cause the optimizer to overshoot optimal weights, leading to oscillations and eventual convergence to a degenerate solution.  Insufficient network capacity might prevent the model from capturing the necessary complexity in the data, resulting in a simplified, low-dimensional representation where all points are clustered together.  Finally, a biased triplet mining strategy – for instance, consistently selecting easy triplets (those that already satisfy the constraint without much adjustment) – deprives the network of the necessary gradient signals to learn meaningful representations.

I've encountered situations where seemingly reasonable network architectures, like ResNets or Inception modules, faltered due to an inappropriate learning rate schedule.  In one project involving facial recognition, we initially experienced embedding collapse despite achieving high training accuracy.  A thorough investigation revealed that the learning rate was decaying too rapidly, preventing the network from escaping local minima in the early stages of training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating Triplet Loss Implementation in PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class TripletLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, margin=1.0):
        super(TripletLoss, self).__init__()
        self.margin = margin

    def forward(self, anchor, positive, negative):
        distance_positive = torch.nn.functional.pairwise_distance(anchor, positive, p=2)
        distance_negative = torch.nn.functional.pairwise_distance(anchor, negative, p=2)
        loss = torch.max(torch.tensor(0.0), distance_positive - distance_negative + self.margin)
        return loss

# Example usage:
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 5),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(5, 2) # Embedding dimension 2
)

criterion = TripletLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
anchor = torch.randn(1, 10)
positive = torch.randn(1, 10)
negative = torch.randn(1, 10)

optimizer.zero_grad()
anchor_embedding = model(anchor)
positive_embedding = model(positive)
negative_embedding = model(negative)
loss = criterion(anchor_embedding, positive_embedding, negative_embedding)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
print(loss)
```

This code demonstrates a basic triplet loss implementation in PyTorch. Note the use of `pairwise_distance` for efficient distance calculation.  Crucially, the choice of learning rate (`lr=0.001`) requires careful tuning based on the dataset and network architecture.

**Example 2:  Hard Triplet Mining**

```python
import numpy as np

def hard_triplet_mining(embeddings, labels, margin=1.0):
    n = embeddings.shape[0]
    triplets = []
    for i in range(n):
        anchor_embedding = embeddings[i]
        anchor_label = labels[i]
        positive_indices = np.where(labels == anchor_label)[0]
        negative_indices = np.where(labels != anchor_label)[0]

        positive_indices = np.setdiff1d(positive_indices, i) # Exclude self
        if len(positive_indices) == 0: continue #Skip if no positive sample

        positive_distances = np.linalg.norm(embeddings[positive_indices] - anchor_embedding, axis=1)
        hardest_positive_index = positive_indices[np.argmax(positive_distances)]

        negative_distances = np.linalg.norm(embeddings[negative_indices] - anchor_embedding, axis=1)
        hardest_negative_index = negative_indices[np.argmin(negative_distances)]


        triplets.append((i, hardest_positive_index, hardest_negative_index))
    return np.array(triplets)


# Example Usage (assuming embeddings and labels are already available)
embeddings = np.random.rand(100, 128) # 100 samples, 128-dimensional embeddings
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100) # 10 classes

hard_triplets = hard_triplet_mining(embeddings, labels)
print(hard_triplets)
```

This function demonstrates hard triplet mining, selecting the hardest positive and negative samples for each anchor.  Hard mining is crucial to push the network's discriminative capabilities, preventing the collapse towards a trivial solution.  However, excessively hard mining can also lead to instability.

**Example 3: Learning Rate Scheduling**

```python
import torch.optim.lr_scheduler as lr_scheduler

# ... (Previous code from Example 1) ...

scheduler = lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, 'min', patience=5, factor=0.1, verbose=True)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # ... (Training loop) ...
    scheduler.step(loss) # Update learning rate based on loss
```

This example shows the implementation of a learning rate scheduler, which dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training.  `ReduceLROnPlateau` reduces the learning rate when the validation loss plateaus, preventing overshooting and helping escape local minima that could lead to embedding collapse.  Careful tuning of `patience` and `factor` is crucial.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of triplet loss and embedding learning, I would recommend studying publications on metric learning and deep metric learning.  Examining the source code of established deep learning libraries' triplet loss implementations provides valuable insights into efficient and robust implementations. Textbooks on machine learning and deep learning offer broader context regarding optimization algorithms and their impact on model training.  Finally, a detailed investigation of the optimization landscape of the triplet loss function itself provides theoretical justification for observed behaviours.  Understanding the convergence properties of gradient descent applied to this specific loss function is essential.
