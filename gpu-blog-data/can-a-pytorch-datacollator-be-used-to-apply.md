The core challenge in applying n-gram masking with PyTorch's `datacollator` lies in its inherent design for batch-level transformations, whereas n-gram masking often requires token-level, and potentially context-aware, manipulations. I've navigated this complexity several times while training language models for specialized domain adaptation, and the solution requires careful orchestration between dataset preparation, the `datacollator` itself, and sometimes adjustments to the model’s input layer.

The fundamental problem arises because a standard `datacollator` operates on entire batches of tokenized input. In the typical masked language modeling (MLM) scenario, a random selection of individual tokens is masked. However, n-gram masking mandates that contiguous sequences of tokens, with varying lengths, be masked instead. The built-in functionality of typical `datacollator` implementations, which primarily handle padding, truncation, or label preparation, isn't directly designed for this variable-length masking.

To address this, we must extend or replace the standard `datacollator` with a custom solution capable of: (1) identifying appropriate n-gram spans within each input sequence, (2) generating the corresponding masking tensor based on chosen n-grams, and (3) applying this mask to the input tokens. Crucially, this logic should be implemented such that it operates on a per-sequence basis *within* the batch, rather than as a batch-wide operation, to correctly preserve sequence boundaries during masking.

Let’s begin with a foundational implementation of the basic `datacollator` functionality we need to build upon:

```python
import torch
from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence

class BasicDataCollator:
    def __init__(self, tokenizer, max_seq_length=512):
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_seq_length = max_seq_length

    def __call__(self, batch):
        input_ids = [torch.tensor(item['input_ids'])[:self.max_seq_length] for item in batch]
        attention_mask = [torch.ones_like(ids) for ids in input_ids]
        input_ids = pad_sequence(input_ids, batch_first=True, padding_value=self.tokenizer.pad_token_id)
        attention_mask = pad_sequence(attention_mask, batch_first=True, padding_value=0)
        labels = input_ids.clone()
        return {"input_ids": input_ids, "attention_mask": attention_mask, "labels": labels}

# Example Usage:
# tokenizer = ... (Assume tokenizer is already defined)
# collator = BasicDataCollator(tokenizer=tokenizer)
# batch = [{'input_ids': [1,2,3]}, {'input_ids': [4,5]}]
# output = collator(batch)
# print(output['input_ids'])
```

This `BasicDataCollator` illustrates how sequences are padded to form a consistent batch, also creating corresponding attention masks and setting the labels. However, this only handles padding and not n-gram masking. Therefore, I’ll outline a custom data collator with n-gram masking.

```python
import torch
import random
from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence

class NgramMaskingCollator:
    def __init__(self, tokenizer, mask_token_id, max_seq_length, min_ngram=1, max_ngram=3, mask_probability=0.15):
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.mask_token_id = mask_token_id
        self.max_seq_length = max_seq_length
        self.min_ngram = min_ngram
        self.max_ngram = max_ngram
        self.mask_probability = mask_probability

    def _mask_sequence(self, input_ids):
        masked_ids = input_ids.clone()
        mask = torch.zeros_like(input_ids, dtype=torch.bool)
        sequence_length = len(input_ids)

        if sequence_length == 0:
            return masked_ids, mask

        i = 0
        while i < sequence_length:
            if random.random() < self.mask_probability:
                ngram_length = random.randint(self.min_ngram, min(self.max_ngram, sequence_length - i))
                masked_ids[i:i+ngram_length] = self.mask_token_id
                mask[i:i+ngram_length] = True
                i += ngram_length
            else:
                i += 1
        return masked_ids, mask

    def __call__(self, batch):
      input_ids = [torch.tensor(item['input_ids'])[:self.max_seq_length] for item in batch]
      attention_mask = [torch.ones_like(ids) for ids in input_ids]
      masked_input_ids = []
      mask_positions = []
      for ids in input_ids:
          masked_ids, mask = self._mask_sequence(ids)
          masked_input_ids.append(masked_ids)
          mask_positions.append(mask)


      masked_input_ids = pad_sequence(masked_input_ids, batch_first=True, padding_value=self.tokenizer.pad_token_id)
      attention_mask = pad_sequence(attention_mask, batch_first=True, padding_value=0)
      mask_positions = pad_sequence(mask_positions, batch_first=True, padding_value=False)
      labels = torch.where(mask_positions, input_ids, torch.tensor(self.tokenizer.pad_token_id).to(input_ids.dtype)) #masking targets using mask positions
      return {"input_ids": masked_input_ids, "attention_mask": attention_mask, "labels": labels}
```

This `NgramMaskingCollator` introduces a `_mask_sequence` function to apply n-gram masking to individual sequences. Inside, n-gram spans are randomly selected, and the tokens within these spans are replaced with the mask token. The collator applies this process to each sequence independently and generates the appropriate labels, ensuring the model has the unmasked tokens as targets for prediction where the input was masked.

Finally, to clarify the usage with a model, assume a standard Transformer-based masked language model that accepts an input ID tensor, an attention mask, and expects targets (labels) of the same type as the input ID tensor with non-padded tokens for the positions that were masked:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM

# Example data set class
class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, input_texts, tokenizer):
      self.tokenizer = tokenizer
      self.input_ids = [tokenizer.encode(text, add_special_tokens=True) for text in input_texts]


    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.input_ids)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
       return {"input_ids": self.input_ids[idx]}


#Model and tokenizer setup
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

mask_token_id = tokenizer.mask_token_id

# Datacollator and data loader setup
max_length = 128
masking_collator = NgramMaskingCollator(tokenizer=tokenizer, mask_token_id=mask_token_id, max_seq_length=max_length)
texts = ["This is a first sentence.", "Here's another one.", "And a third short sequence."]
dataset = CustomDataset(texts, tokenizer)
data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size = 2, collate_fn=masking_collator)

# Training Loop (very abbreviated for example)
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr = 5e-5)
model.train()

for batch in data_loader:
    outputs = model(**batch)
    loss = outputs.loss
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    print(f"Batch Loss: {loss}")

```

This final example connects everything together. We are using `AutoModelForMaskedLM` which has native support for MLM and loss calculation given the input, and labels. The data, `CustomDataset`, gets sent to a `DataLoader` along with our previously defined `NgramMaskingCollator`, which prepares the inputs with n-gram masking as well as the targets. The model then computes and loss and backpropogates. The training cycle is extremely abbreviated, and in a proper setup would include more epochs and iterations, but this shows how to wire up the previously mentioned masking data collator with a model.

For continued learning and refinement, I'd recommend exploring these resources: the Hugging Face Transformers library documentation for a deep dive into `Dataset`, `DataLoader`, and model handling; documentation on tokenization and vocabulary management; and papers discussing various masking strategies for language model pre-training. Examining implementations within NLP libraries like fairseq can also provide insights on effective batching and parallel processing strategies when doing complex transformations. These resources together will allow deeper control and more robust experimentation with these advanced techniques.
