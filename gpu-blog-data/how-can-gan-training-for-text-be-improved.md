Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), while demonstrating proficiency in image generation, present unique challenges when applied to text. The discrete nature of language, unlike the continuous pixel space of images, fundamentally complicates the gradient-based optimization that underpins GAN training. I've encountered this firsthand while developing a model for generating synthetic code documentation and can attest to the difficulties in obtaining stable, coherent results.

The core issue lies in the inherent discreteness of text. Consider that during backpropagation, the discriminator provides gradients to the generator, guiding it toward producing more realistic outputs. With images, these gradients flow smoothly because a slight perturbation of pixel values still yields a valid image. In text, however, the generator outputs discrete tokens (words or subwords). A small change in the generator's output might translate to swapping one token for another entirely, resulting in a large, discontinuous change in the output space. This abrupt shift makes it difficult for the generator to incrementally improve, as the discriminator feedback often becomes noisy and erratic. The gradients, in essence, can’t reliably guide the generator towards an optimal point on a smooth manifold, as is assumed in the GAN framework.

A significant improvement strategy involves mitigating this discrete gradient problem. Straight-Through (ST) estimators provide a technique for handling this discontinuity. These estimators introduce a differentiable approximation to the non-differentiable argmax operation that is used when the generator selects tokens. In a standard GAN, the generator would output a probability distribution over a vocabulary, and then the argmax would select the most probable token. In this process, all other information is lost. ST estimators, however, instead of completely zeroing out other values, use the probabilities before the hard selection, during the backward pass.

Another pivotal challenge involves the evaluation of text quality. The discriminator in a text-based GAN often struggles to learn subtle linguistic patterns, such as contextual coherence and long-range dependencies. An untrained or weakly trained discriminator can inadvertently push the generator toward producing outputs that are superficially similar to training data without any real meaning or logical sense. It's a common occurrence to see a text GAN trained on technical articles produce sentences that sound superficially “techy” but do not express coherent thought.

Furthermore, training stability is a major hurdle. Text GANs, especially with recurrent architectures, are prone to mode collapse, where the generator learns to produce a narrow range of outputs, thereby lacking diversity. This is amplified by the lack of a proper evaluation metric that precisely quantifies the “quality” of the generated text, forcing a reliance on discriminator feedback, which as noted previously, can be unreliable.

Several strategies aim to address these problems. The most common approach involves improved loss functions, and architecture selection. For example, utilizing sequence-to-sequence architectures, combined with reinforcement learning techniques, offers significant improvements over basic GAN structures. Such techniques allow for direct optimization on metrics, like BLEU score, or ROUGE score, which are correlated with human judgment, although still imperfect. This circumvents the need for the generator to rely solely on discriminator feedback. The use of self-attention mechanisms has also demonstrated a capacity to learn longer contextual dependencies, thereby improving the coherence and overall quality of generated text.

Here are three code examples illustrating some of these strategies, using simplified PyTorch implementations:

**Example 1: Straight-Through Estimator**

This example demonstrates how to approximate the non-differentiable sampling with a Straight-Through estimator during token selection in a recurrent generator.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class GeneratorST(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size):
        super(GeneratorST, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.rnn = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, input_seq):
        embedded = self.embedding(input_seq)
        output, _ = self.rnn(embedded)
        logits = self.fc(output)
        
        # Apply softmax to get probabilities
        probabilities = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
        
        # Select token with argmax during forward pass (non-differentiable)
        sampled_tokens = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=-1)
        
        # Straight-through estimator for backward pass
        sampled_tokens_one_hot = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(sampled_tokens, num_classes=probabilities.shape[-1]).float()
        
        # During backprop use probabilities
        output = (sampled_tokens_one_hot - probabilities).detach() + probabilities
      
        return output, logits, sampled_tokens
```

In this generator, during the forward pass, we use the argmax to sample tokens, which is non-differentiable. During the backward pass, we approximate the gradient using the full output probabilities, effectively propagating information about all the words, rather than just a single selected one. This significantly reduces the discontinuity.

**Example 2: Reinforcement Learning with a Reward Function**

This example showcases the use of reinforcement learning to optimize for a specified reward metric. We simulate the reward calculation using a BLEU score here, although in a real scenario, an external evaluation script would be used.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

def calculate_bleu(generated, reference):
    # Simplified BLEU score for demonstration. Replace with proper method
    generated = ' '.join([str(token) for token in generated])
    reference = ' '.join([str(token) for token in reference])
    
    score = 1/(1+abs(len(generated.split(" "))-len(reference.split(" "))))
    
    return score

class GeneratorRL(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size):
        super(GeneratorRL, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.rnn = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size)
    
    def forward(self, input_seq, greedy=True):
        embedded = self.embedding(input_seq)
        output, _ = self.rnn(embedded)
        logits = self.fc(output)
        probabilities = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
        
        if greedy:
          sampled_tokens = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=-1)
        else:
          sampled_tokens = torch.multinomial(probabilities, 1).squeeze(-1)
        
        return logits, sampled_tokens, probabilities

def train_generator_rl(generator, optimizer, reference, generated_sequence, log_probs, gamma=0.99):
    rewards = []
    for sequence in generated_sequence:
        reward = calculate_bleu(sequence.tolist(), reference.tolist())
        rewards.append(reward)
    rewards = torch.tensor(rewards).float()
    
    
    policy_loss = -torch.mean(log_probs * rewards)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    policy_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    return policy_loss
```
Here, we train the generator with a defined reward function, which optimizes the generated output directly to be better compared to a reference output. The `train_generator_rl` function computes a reward based on the generated and reference outputs. Instead of relying on discriminator feedback, we directly optimize the generator based on a chosen metric. This can lead to greater control over the generation process.

**Example 3: Attention Mechanism for Long-Range Dependencies**

This example includes a self-attention mechanism, allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating each token.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super(SelfAttention, self).__init__()
        self.query = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.key = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.value = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        Q = self.query(x)
        K = self.key(x)
        V = self.value(x)

        attn_weights = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / (K.shape[-1]**0.5)
        attn_weights = F.softmax(attn_weights, dim=-1)
        attn_output = torch.matmul(attn_weights, V)
        return attn_output

class GeneratorAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size):
        super(GeneratorAttention, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.rnn = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, hidden_size, batch_first=True, bidirectional = True)
        self.attention = SelfAttention(2 * hidden_size)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(2 * hidden_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, input_seq):
      embedded = self.embedding(input_seq)
      output, _ = self.rnn(embedded)
      attn_output = self.attention(output)
      logits = self.fc(attn_output)
      probabilities = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
      sampled_tokens = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=-1)

      return logits, sampled_tokens, probabilities

```

This `GeneratorAttention` class uses a self-attention layer following the RNN layer. This allows the generator to weigh different parts of the input sequence based on their contextual relevance. This capability significantly enhances the model’s capacity to handle long-range dependencies and generate more coherent text.

To further explore this area, I recommend consulting literature on sequence-to-sequence models with attention, and exploring advanced GAN variants like Wasserstein GANs which can be more stable. Additionally, investigating research papers on techniques combining reinforcement learning and adversarial learning could be fruitful. Resources on natural language processing with deep learning can also provide further theoretical and practical insights. These advancements aim to bridge the gap between the theoretical foundations of GANs and the intricacies of the discrete text domain, a crucial step in the path toward robust and reliable text generation.
