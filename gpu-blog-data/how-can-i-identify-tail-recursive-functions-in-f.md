Tail-recursive functions, crucial for avoiding stack overflow exceptions in functional programming, can be identified by examining their call structure. The defining characteristic is that the recursive call is the very last operation within the function, not merely the last line of code. This specific placement allows the compiler (or interpreter) to reuse the current stack frame, effectively turning recursion into iteration behind the scenes, a process known as tail-call optimization. Without tail recursion, each recursive call consumes more stack memory until the available stack space is exhausted, leading to a runtime error. I have encountered numerous situations where seemingly identical recursive functions behaved drastically differently in terms of resource utilization, underscoring the importance of this concept.

The key to identifying tail recursion lies in scrutinizing the operations performed *after* the recursive call. If the result of the recursive call is further manipulated, such as being added to a constant, or if the recursive call is embedded within another function call, it is *not* tail-recursive. In contrast, if the recursive call constitutes the final action, with the result immediately passed back as the function’s return value, then it is a tail-recursive call. This distinction is critical. A recursive call within a `match` expression can be tail-recursive provided the matching arm itself does no further computation on the result of the recursive call.

Consider this first illustrative example, a classic implementation of factorial:

```fsharp
let rec factorialNonTail (n:int) : int =
    if n <= 1 then 1
    else n * factorialNonTail (n - 1)
```

This function, `factorialNonTail`, is *not* tail-recursive. The recursive call `factorialNonTail (n - 1)` produces a result that is then multiplied by `n`. This multiplication operation means the function's current stack frame must remain active and cannot be discarded. The interpreter needs to retain context for the multiplication to be performed when the recursive calls ultimately return. Consequently, for large values of `n`, a stack overflow is highly likely because each call adds a new layer of context to the stack.

The following example presents a tail-recursive version of factorial:

```fsharp
let factorialTail (n:int) : int =
    let rec factorialHelper (current:int, accumulator:int) : int =
        if current <= 1 then accumulator
        else factorialHelper (current - 1, current * accumulator)
    factorialHelper (n, 1)
```

Here, the function `factorialTail` uses an inner, helper function called `factorialHelper`. The key difference is that the recursive call to `factorialHelper` is the absolute last operation inside the function. The result of this recursive call is not combined or modified before being returned. The `accumulator` parameter carries along the intermediate results, accumulating the product as it recurses.  Because there are no pending operations after the recursive call, the compiler optimizes it to jump back to the beginning of the helper with new parameters, reusing the same stack frame. This mechanism enables the function to compute factorials of even substantial numbers without stack overflow. I have personally used this exact pattern in simulations that required high performance with deep recursion.

The third example demonstrates tail recursion within a `match` expression. This is crucial as some learners might incorrectly presume all `match` expressions involving recursion are not tail-recursive.

```fsharp
type Tree<'a> =
    | Leaf
    | Node of 'a * Tree<'a> * Tree<'a>

let rec treeSumTail (tree:Tree<int>) (accumulator:int) : int =
    match tree with
    | Leaf -> accumulator
    | Node(value, left, right) ->
       let accumulator' = accumulator + value
       treeSumTail left (treeSumTail right accumulator')
```

In this function, `treeSumTail`, the recursive call on `left` *is not* tail-recursive. The recursive call to `treeSumTail right accumulator'` is executed after the result of `treeSumTail left accumulator'` has been returned. This illustrates that even when there are no *explicit* mathematical operations between the recursive calls, the compiler cannot apply tail call optimization if there are any pending calls at all. I have seen instances of similar code where the developer expected tail-call optimization, only to be surprised by stack overflows.

To correct this, we need to rewrite the function using an accumulator:

```fsharp
let treeSumTailCorrect (tree:Tree<int>) : int =
    let rec helper tree acc =
        match tree with
        | Leaf -> acc
        | Node(value, left, right) -> helper left (helper right (acc + value))
        helper tree 0
```
Here, the `helper` function is now properly tail recursive, although it achieves this by using an accumulator, in a way that is perhaps not as clear as one might initially imagine. It is important to note that the function is now tail-recursive despite being nested, because we do not perform any actions on the returned values before passing them up.

Identifying tail recursion requires a deliberate examination of the call structure, ensuring the recursive call is the final operation. This attention to detail is essential when crafting performant and resilient functional code. Specifically for F#, it is important to understand the difference between a *last line* and a *last operation*. A helpful approach is always to ask the question: “What happens to the result of the recursive call? Is it used, combined, modified or is it immediately returned?” If it is not immediately returned, then you do not have a tail-recursive function.

For further study, I recommend examining classic functional programming texts that discuss recursion and its optimization strategies. Books focusing on compiler construction often delve deeper into the mechanisms of tail-call optimization. Additionally, exploring the documentation for F# compiler optimizations may shed light on how the F# compiler handles different recursion patterns. Practice in rewriting non-tail-recursive functions to their tail-recursive counterparts is also a very useful learning exercise and a must-have skill for any functional programmer.
