Accessing and executing methods within a neural network class, while seemingly straightforward, requires a clear understanding of object-oriented programming principles and the specific framework you’re employing (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). The core challenge lies not in the syntax itself, but in the context of how neural network classes are typically structured and how they are designed to interact during the training and inference phases.

Let’s consider a typical scenario. In my experience, after several iterations of building deep learning models, I've found that neural network classes usually encapsulate the model's architecture (layers, activation functions, etc.) and their forward pass. These classes often inherit from a base class provided by the deep learning framework (e.g., `torch.nn.Module` in PyTorch or `tf.keras.Model` in TensorFlow). Consequently, accessing your custom methods requires proper instantiation of the class and then invoking those methods on the created instance.

The key distinction to remember is between *defining* the method within the class and *calling* the method on an *instance* of that class. The class definition merely lays out the blueprint; instantiation creates a concrete object based on that blueprint, making the method accessible through that specific instance.

For instance, if we've defined a method within our neural network class named `calculate_gradient_norm()`, we don’t call it directly on the class itself (e.g., `MyNeuralNetwork.calculate_gradient_norm()`). That would raise an error as it’s trying to execute a method on the class definition, not an instance of that class. Instead, we have to create an instance (e.g., `model = MyNeuralNetwork(...)`), and then call the method via that instance (`model.calculate_gradient_norm()`).

I have found it helpful to think of it in terms of 'object-oriented logic'. Classes define the object structure and behavior, while objects are the concrete entities where actions take place. In Python, methods are the actions an object can take.

**Example 1: PyTorch**

Here's an example using PyTorch, demonstrating how to call a custom method within a simple neural network class.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

    def calculate_layer_sizes(self):
        """Returns a tuple containing the input, hidden, and output sizes."""
        input_size = self.fc1.in_features
        hidden_size = self.fc1.out_features
        output_size = self.fc2.out_features
        return (input_size, hidden_size, output_size)


# Create an instance of the SimpleNN class
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
output_size = 5
model = SimpleNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)

# Call the custom method
layer_sizes = model.calculate_layer_sizes()
print(f"Layer sizes: {layer_sizes}")

# Alternatively, call an existing method
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, input_size)
output_tensor = model(input_tensor) #calls the forward method via the instance 'model'
print(f"Output tensor shape: {output_tensor.shape}")
```

*Commentary:* In this example, `calculate_layer_sizes()` is our custom method. It's defined within the `SimpleNN` class. We create an instance named `model` and then call the method using `model.calculate_layer_sizes()`. We also call the existing `forward` method of the module class using the instance `model(input_tensor)`. This shows the correct instantiation and method calling pattern.

**Example 2: TensorFlow (Keras)**

The same principle applies in TensorFlow using Keras.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleNN(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_size, input_shape=(input_size,))
        self.relu = tf.keras.layers.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_size)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

    def count_trainable_parameters(self):
        """Returns the total number of trainable parameters in the model."""
        return sum([tf.reduce_prod(var.shape).numpy() for var in self.trainable_variables])

# Create an instance of the SimpleNN class
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
output_size = 5
model = SimpleNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)


# We must build the model by passing an input through it once for the layers to initialize.
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, input_size))
model(input_tensor)

# Call the custom method
num_params = model.count_trainable_parameters()
print(f"Number of trainable parameters: {num_params}")

#Alternatively, we can call the keras call method via the instance 'model'
output_tensor = model(input_tensor)
print(f"Output tensor shape: {output_tensor.shape}")
```

*Commentary:* Here, `count_trainable_parameters()` is the custom method, defined within the `SimpleNN` class, which inherits from `tf.keras.Model`. Similar to the PyTorch example, we instantiate the `SimpleNN` model before calling the custom method using `model.count_trainable_parameters()`. We must build the Keras model by calling it with sample data before layers are fully created. We also call the existing call method of the module via `model(input_tensor)`.

**Example 3: Passing Data to Methods**

Methods can also take arguments, as shown below.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class AdvancedNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(AdvancedNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.fc1(x)
      x = self.relu(x)
      x = self.dropout(x)
      x = self.fc2(x)
      return x

    def apply_dropout(self, x, training_mode=True):
        """Applies dropout to the input tensor based on the training mode."""
        if training_mode:
            self.dropout.train()
        else:
            self.dropout.eval()
        return self.dropout(x)


# Create an instance of the AdvancedNN class
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
output_size = 5
model = AdvancedNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)

# Example using the apply_dropout method
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, input_size)
dropout_output_train = model.apply_dropout(input_tensor, training_mode=True)
print(f"Dropout output (training mode): {dropout_output_train.shape}")

dropout_output_eval = model.apply_dropout(input_tensor, training_mode=False)
print(f"Dropout output (eval mode): {dropout_output_eval.shape}")

#Example using the forward method
output_tensor = model(input_tensor)
print(f"Output tensor shape from forward method : {output_tensor.shape}")
```

*Commentary:* This demonstrates how to call a method (`apply_dropout`) with arguments. We pass the `input_tensor` and `training_mode` as parameters to this custom method. The state of the dropout module is set within the method before dropout is applied. The method is then invoked via the instance `model`. This illustrates that methods can have multiple arguments, which allow for more flexible interactions with the model's internal state. The forward method is also shown being called through the instance.

In summary, when calling a method within a neural network class, be sure you have:
1. Created an instance of the class.
2. Used the instance name to invoke the desired method, following the `instance.method_name()` pattern.
3. Passed all required arguments to the method, as defined in the method signature.

For further exploration and a deeper understanding of these concepts, I recommend consulting the official documentation for the specific deep learning framework you are using (e.g., PyTorch documentation for `torch.nn`, TensorFlow documentation for `tf.keras`). Additionally, textbooks on object-oriented programming principles often provide invaluable insight into class design and instance management. I have also found reading research papers implementing different models helpful as it provides a practical view of class usage. Exploring practical tutorials that utilize these frameworks can also solidify your understanding through direct application of the concepts. Remember, the precise syntax and best practices can vary slightly between frameworks, so consulting the appropriate documentation is vital.
