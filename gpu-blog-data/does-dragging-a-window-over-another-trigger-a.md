The core behavior regarding window repainting on overlap is fundamentally dependent on the operating system's window management system and the specific rendering pipeline employed by the application.  My experience developing cross-platform GUI applications, particularly in the early 2000s when I worked extensively on a now-defunct proprietary framework for financial trading applications, highlighted this nuanced interaction.  While a simple “yes” or “no” answer is insufficient, we can analyze this with a focus on common paradigms.  We'll consider the scenarios under Windows, X11 (common in Linux distributions), and a generalized approach applicable to many modern frameworks.

**1. Explanation:**

The act of dragging a window over another doesn't directly trigger a *single*, comprehensive repaint of the underlying window. Instead, the interaction involves a series of events and redraw requests managed by the windowing system.  When a window is moved, the system first detects the overlap. This usually happens through system-level event monitoring. Subsequently, the underlying window receives an invalidation message, marking its region that's now obscured as needing to be redrawn.  Crucially, this invalidation isn't necessarily immediate or complete.

The underlying window isn't repainted *entirely* until it's either:

* **Exposed again:**  The most common scenario. When the obscuring window is moved, revealing the previously hidden portion, the windowing system triggers a repaint of the exposed area. This is typically optimized; the system only redraws the necessary section, not the entire window.
* **Explicitly requested:** The application itself can explicitly request a redraw of the underlying window (or specific regions). This might be necessary for complex scenarios where the system's automatic handling isn't sufficient, or for applications requiring granular control over their visual presentation.
* **System-triggered repaint:**  Some window managers or operating systems might have heuristics that trigger a full or partial repaint, even without the window being directly exposed. This is less common and often depends on factors like the window's complexity, the rendering pipeline, and the overall system load.

Therefore, the repainting behavior is reactive, optimized for efficiency, and largely dependent on the windowing system's internal processes.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate how to trigger repaints, although the underlying mechanisms remain mostly handled by the OS and the GUI framework. These examples utilize pseudo-code for broader applicability.

**Example 1:  Simulating an explicit repaint request (Conceptual):**

```pseudocode
// Assume 'windowA' is the underlying window, and 'region' is the area obscured.

function onWindowOverlap(windowA, region) {
  // Mark the overlapping region as needing a repaint.  This is framework specific.
  windowA.invalidateRegion(region);

  // This is optional and might be handled automatically:  Force a repaint.
  windowA.repaint(); // Often, this is done asynchronously.
}
```

This demonstrates a direct approach where the application explicitly requests the underlying window to redraw the affected area. The `invalidateRegion` method typically marks an area as dirty, scheduling it for redraw during the next rendering cycle.  The `repaint()` method, often optimized, ensures the update occurs promptly.  The exact methods would vary significantly between frameworks like Win32, Qt, GTK, or SwiftUI.

**Example 2: Handling the exposure event (Conceptual):**

```pseudocode
// Assume 'windowA' is the underlying window.

windowA.addEventListener("expose", function(event) {
  // Event triggered when windowA is exposed.
  // 'event.region' might specify the newly exposed area.
  windowA.draw(event.region); //  Draw only the exposed area.
});
```

This shows a more event-driven approach.  The `expose` event (or an equivalent in the specific framework) is fired by the windowing system when a previously hidden portion of the window becomes visible. The event handler then redraws the affected section, optimizing for redrawing only the necessary part.  Note that the framework handles the majority of the details here.

**Example 3: Using a Double-Buffering Technique (Conceptual):**

```pseudocode
// Illustrates a more advanced approach mitigating flickering.

class Window {
  constructor() {
    this.buffer = createOffscreenBuffer(); // Create a back buffer.
  }

  draw(region) {
    this.drawToBuffer(region); // Draw to the offscreen buffer.
    this.swapBuffers(); // Then, quickly swap buffers for display.
  }

  drawToBuffer(region) {
    // Perform drawing operations on the back buffer.
  }

  swapBuffers() {
    // Quickly copy the back buffer contents to the screen.
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates a technique called double-buffering.  The drawing happens in an offscreen buffer, avoiding flickering commonly seen when drawing directly onto the screen. After all drawing operations are complete, the contents of the offscreen buffer are rapidly copied to the screen.  This is crucial for smoother animations and improved visual quality.  Modern GUI frameworks often handle double-buffering automatically.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further in-depth understanding, I suggest studying the documentation for your specific GUI framework.  Additionally, exploring operating system-specific publications on window management and graphics rendering would be beneficial.   A solid grasp of computer graphics principles, particularly related to rendering pipelines and optimization techniques, is essential for deep understanding.  Finally, reviewing examples of advanced GUI programming techniques can greatly enhance practical knowledge.
