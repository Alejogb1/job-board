CUDA stream execution and the behavior of events within those streams are crucial for maximizing GPU utilization.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications has repeatedly highlighted a key fact: while operations *within* a single CUDA stream execute serially, operations across different streams *can* overlap, provided careful synchronization is implemented using CUDA events.  However, achieving true parallelism requires a nuanced understanding of event dependencies and potential hazards.


**1.  Explanation:**

CUDA streams provide a mechanism for concurrently executing kernels and other asynchronous operations on the GPU.  Each stream maintains its own instruction queue and manages its resources independently.  This enables parallel execution of multiple kernels, potentially improving throughput.  CUDA events, on the other hand, act as synchronization points. They allow us to track the completion of specific operations within a stream and, crucially, to establish dependencies between operations across different streams.

An event is created in a specific stream. When a kernel or memory operation in a stream completes, the corresponding event can be recorded. This recording doesn't block execution; subsequent operations in the same stream continue immediately.  Other streams can then wait for that event to signal completion before proceeding with their own operations.  This waiting is achieved using `cudaStreamWaitEvent`.  Critically, if a stream is waiting on an event recorded in a different stream, operations in the waiting stream will only commence *after* the event's corresponding operation has finished. This synchronization point is essential for correctness when data dependencies exist between operations in different streams.

However, merely having different streams does not guarantee overlap.  For example, if stream A launches kernel K1, records event E1, and stream B waits for E1 before launching kernel K2, K2 will only execute *after* K1 completes.  Overlap only occurs when streams are independent and have no explicit dependencies established through events. In these situations, the GPU scheduler can interleave execution of instructions from different streams, maximizing hardware utilization.  This interleaving is non-deterministic; the exact order of execution is not guaranteed and is determined by the GPU scheduler based on factors like resource availability and kernel characteristics.  However, the results are guaranteed to be consistent provided no data races are introduced.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Sequential Execution (No Overlap)**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void kernel1() { /* ... */ }
__global__ void kernel2() { /* ... */ }

int main() {
  cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
  cudaEvent_t event;

  cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);
  cudaEventCreate(&event);

  kernel1<<<1, 1, 0, stream1>>>();
  cudaEventRecord(event, stream1);
  cudaStreamWaitEvent(stream2, event, 0); // blocks stream2 until event is recorded
  kernel2<<<1, 1, 0, stream2>>>();

  cudaEventDestroy(event);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates sequential execution.  `kernel2` in `stream2` will only begin after `kernel1` in `stream1` finishes and records `event`. No overlap occurs.  This is a crucial baseline to understand before attempting parallelism.

**Example 2: Potential for Overlap**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void kernelA() { /* ... */ }
__global__ void kernelB() { /* ... */ }

int main() {
  cudaStream_t streamA, streamB;
  cudaStreamCreate(&streamA);
  cudaStreamCreate(&streamB);

  kernelA<<<1, 1, 0, streamA>>>();
  kernelB<<<1, 1, 0, streamB>>>();

  cudaStreamSynchronize(streamA);
  cudaStreamSynchronize(streamB);

  cudaStreamDestroy(streamA);
  cudaStreamDestroy(streamB);
  return 0;
}
```

Here, `kernelA` and `kernelB` are launched concurrently in separate streams.  There are no explicit dependencies between them. The scheduler *may* overlap their execution, leading to faster overall execution.  Note the use of `cudaStreamSynchronize` to ensure both kernels complete before the program exits.  This is essential for correctness even when overlap is possible.

**Example 3: Overlap with Data Transfer and Event Synchronization**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void kernelC(const float* input, float* output) { /* ... */ }

int main() {
  cudaStream_t streamA, streamB;
  cudaEvent_t event;
  float *h_data, *d_data; // host and device pointers

  // ... memory allocation ...

  cudaStreamCreate(&streamA);
  cudaStreamCreate(&streamB);
  cudaEventCreate(&event);

  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_data, h_data, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, streamA);
  cudaEventRecord(event, streamA);
  cudaStreamWaitEvent(streamB, event, 0); // wait for data transfer to complete

  kernelC<<<1, 1, 0, streamB>>>();

  // ... further operations ...

  cudaEventDestroy(event);
  cudaStreamDestroy(streamA);
  cudaStreamDestroy(streamB);
  return 0;
}
```

This example illustrates more complex scenario. Data is transferred from host to device asynchronously in `streamA`.  `kernelC` in `streamB` depends on this data.  The event ensures `kernelC` doesn't execute before the data transfer is complete. However, the data transfer and kernel execution can potentially overlap.  The transfer happens in `streamA` and computation in `streamB`, allowing concurrent operation.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official CUDA Programming Guide.  Thorough exploration of the CUDA C++ API documentation is also essential.  Furthermore, reviewing examples from the CUDA SDK and studying performance analysis tools will provide invaluable practical experience in managing streams and events effectively.  Finally, a strong grasp of parallel programming concepts will underpin your understanding of this complex topic.  Careful consideration of memory management and data dependencies is crucial for avoiding common pitfalls such as race conditions.  Remember that thorough testing and profiling are vital for verifying the correctness and efficiency of your implementations.
