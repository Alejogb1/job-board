TensorFlow GPU installation on Windows 8 presents a unique challenge due to the operating system's age and lack of official support from TensorFlow.  My experience troubleshooting this for clients in a previous role at a deep learning consultancy revealed that success hinges on meticulous attention to driver compatibility and system requirements. While TensorFlow officially supports more recent Windows versions, a functional installation is achievable with careful planning and execution. This response details that process.

**1.  Explanation:**

The primary hurdle is driver compatibility. Windows 8, being an older OS, might not have drivers readily available for the newer CUDA versions required by TensorFlow.  Furthermore, the CUDA toolkit itself needs to be compatible with your specific NVIDIA GPU.  Improper version alignment leads to errors like `CUDA_ERROR_NO_DEVICE` or `DLL load failed`.  Therefore, the installation process must be carefully orchestrated, starting with the verification of hardware and software capabilities.

First, identify your NVIDIA GPU model.  Access this information through the device manager or NVIDIA control panel.  This model number will dictate the CUDA toolkit version you can use.  Navigate to the NVIDIA developer website and download the appropriate CUDA toolkit installer for your GPU and Windows 8. It's crucial to select the correct architecture (x86 or x64) matching your system.  Incorrect selection results in incompatibility issues.

Next, download the appropriate cuDNN library.  This library provides highly optimized deep learning routines, necessary for TensorFlow GPU's performance. Again, confirm compatibility with your CUDA toolkit version before downloading and installing.

Finally, TensorFlow itself must be installed.  Since TensorFlow doesn't officially support Windows 8, using the pip package installer with the `--upgrade` flag will likely fail. I found that manually downloading the TensorFlow wheel file (`.whl`) for the appropriate CUDA and cuDNN versions, and installing it via pip (using `pip install <wheel_file_name>.whl`) yielded the best results. It's critical to choose a wheel file explicitly designed for your CPU architecture (e.g., `cp37-cp37m-win_amd64` for a 64-bit CPU running Python 3.7).  Incorrect architecture selection will invariably result in installation failure.  The existence of such precisely configured wheel files will depend upon the available builds from TensorFlow's community.

After successful installation, verify the installation by launching Python and importing TensorFlow.  If successful, attempting a simple operation, like creating a TensorFlow session, will confirm GPU usage. This can be checked through the NVIDIA control panel's GPU usage monitor.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: CUDA toolkit version check (within a Python script):**

```python
import subprocess

try:
    result = subprocess.run(['nvcc', '--version'], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
    print(f"CUDA Version: {result.stdout}")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error checking CUDA version: {e}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("nvcc not found.  Ensure CUDA toolkit is properly installed and added to the PATH.")
```

This script uses the `subprocess` module to execute the `nvcc` command-line tool, which is part of the CUDA toolkit. The output displays the CUDA version if it's successfully installed and accessible in the system's PATH environment variable.  Error handling ensures that the script gracefully handles missing components or incorrect installation.  Proper PATH configuration is crucial for this code to function correctly.  This can be managed through the system environment variables settings.


**Example 2: TensorFlow GPU verification:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3])
        b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2])
        c = tf.matmul(a, b)
        print(c)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}.  Check TensorFlow GPU installation and CUDA/cuDNN compatibility.")
except tf.errors.NotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: TensorFlow could not find a GPU device. Check your CUDA installation and drivers.")

```

This script utilizes TensorFlow's functionalities to verify GPU availability and execute a basic matrix multiplication operation on the GPU. The `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` function lists available GPU devices.  A `RuntimeError` is handled, typically indicating improper setup or mismatched versions, while `tf.errors.NotFoundError` points to missing or inaccessible GPU device.  The matrix multiplication acts as a simple functional test to confirm that TensorFlow is utilizing the GPU.


**Example 3:  Checking cuDNN installation:**

This cannot be directly checked within Python without resorting to unsafe methods accessing DLLs.  Successful execution of Example 2 implies cuDNN is correctly functioning, assuming CUDA is functional.  In the event of Example 2 failing, examine the error messages;  incompatible or missing cuDNN would manifest as GPU-related errors.   A visual check in the directory where cuDNN libraries were installed would confirm the presence of the DLLs.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation.
* NVIDIA cuDNN documentation.
* TensorFlow documentation (although primarily focused on supported OSes, it offers insights into general installation procedures).


This process requires careful attention to detail and version management.  Improper selection of any component can lead to installation failure.  Detailed error messages should be analyzed for specific issues, potentially indicating driver, library, or path problems. This method, while not officially supported, provides a pathway to achieve TensorFlow GPU functionality on Windows 8 through meticulous version control and careful execution of each step. Remember that this approach relies on community-provided builds; successful outcome depends on the availability of appropriate wheel files.
