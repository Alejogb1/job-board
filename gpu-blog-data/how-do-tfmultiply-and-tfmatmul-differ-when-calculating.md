The primary distinction between `tf.multiply` and `tf.matmul` when computing dot products in TensorFlow lies in their fundamental operations: `tf.multiply` performs element-wise multiplication, while `tf.matmul` executes matrix multiplication. The correct selection hinges on the desired mathematical outcome and the dimensionality of the input tensors. My experience building high-performance tensor processing pipelines has repeatedly reinforced this difference, highlighting how choosing the wrong operation leads to erroneous results or runtime errors.

To understand this fully, let's first define what a dot product is. In linear algebra, the dot product is a scalar value resulting from the sum of products of corresponding entries of two equal-length sequences, typically vectors. However, the term 'dot product' is often used more loosely to describe similar calculations between matrices, which is where `tf.matmul` becomes essential.

`tf.multiply`, known colloquially as element-wise multiplication or Hadamard product, takes two tensors of the same shape and returns a new tensor where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in the input tensors. Thus, it will *not* perform the sum-of-products operation that defines a conventional dot product. If the inputs are vectors (1D tensors), `tf.multiply` will indeed produce the element-wise product, but not the aggregated sum needed to achieve the scalar dot product. If the inputs are matrices (2D tensors), it will multiply the matrix at each corresponding location of the two matrices. It does not compute the sum over the columns and rows that would typically be needed for the dot product interpretation when working with matrices.

`tf.matmul`, on the other hand, is designed explicitly for matrix multiplication, which, when applied to vectors, computes the dot product directly. When the inputs are 2D tensors (matrices), it performs the conventional matrix multiplication algorithm, summing across appropriate dimensions. When one or both inputs are 1D tensors, TensorFlow will treat them implicitly as row and column vectors to permit the correct interpretation. Specifically, in a dot product of two 1D tensors, `tf.matmul` will treat the first vector as a row vector and the second as a column vector. The result will be a scalar value (a 0D tensor). This inherent difference means the proper operation must be selected depending on what is required.

Consider the following code examples illustrating the behavior of these functions:

**Example 1: Element-wise Multiplication with `tf.multiply`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Two vectors of size 3.
vector_a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
vector_b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])

# Perform element-wise multiplication.
result_multiply = tf.multiply(vector_a, vector_b)
print(f"tf.multiply result: {result_multiply.numpy()}") # Output: [ 4. 10. 18.]

# Attempt to use multiply for the 'dot product', we'll see we did not get the mathematical dot product
# We still have the element-wise values, so we need to add the products
dot_result = tf.reduce_sum(result_multiply)
print(f"The dot product after reduction is {dot_result}") # 32.
```

In this example, `tf.multiply` returns a new vector where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from `vector_a` and `vector_b`. This is *not* the dot product, which would be (1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6 = 32) . As we can see, to perform the dot product with `multiply`, we must manually reduce the sum of these product elements. The output shows the element-wise result as well as the reduction to the dot product using `tf.reduce_sum`. I have found this is a very common mistake for beginners and is something I was tripped up on in my own initial development experience, particularly when converting from vectorized frameworks such as NumPy.

**Example 2: Correct Dot Product Calculation with `tf.matmul`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Two vectors of size 3
vector_c = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
vector_d = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])

# Compute the dot product using tf.matmul
result_matmul = tf.matmul(tf.reshape(vector_c,[1,3]), tf.reshape(vector_d, [3,1]))
print(f"tf.matmul result: {result_matmul.numpy()}") # Output: [[32.]]

result_matmul_simple = tf.matmul(tf.reshape(vector_c,[1,3]), tf.reshape(vector_d, [3,1])).numpy()[0][0]
print(f"tf.matmul simple result: {result_matmul_simple}") # Output: 32.
```

Here, I am explicitly reshaping the vectors using `tf.reshape` to enable `tf.matmul` to calculate the dot product. In the first output, the result is a 1x1 matrix (a 2D tensor with one element), and we can see the correct value. To get this as a scalar (a 0D tensor), we can explicitly access the scalar value as is done in the simplified output. If we do not reshape the vectors, the matrix multiplication will be performed with the original 1D tensors, which will cause an error, given the incompatibilities of matrix multiplication (non-conformable). This emphasizes that the implicit reshaping performed by `tf.matmul` on vectors is only in the context of the mathematical dot product. `tf.matmul` is the appropriate choice when we need an actual dot product.

**Example 3: Matrix Multiplication using `tf.matmul`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Two matrices with appropriate dimensions for matrix multiplication.
matrix_e = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
matrix_f = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

# Perform matrix multiplication using tf.matmul.
result_matrix_mult = tf.matmul(matrix_e, matrix_f)
print(f"tf.matmul matrix result: {result_matrix_mult.numpy()}")
#Output: [[19. 22.] [43. 50.]]

# Attempt to multiply using element-wise method
result_matrix_mult_element = tf.multiply(matrix_e, matrix_f)
print(f"tf.multiply matrix result: {result_matrix_mult_element.numpy()}")
#Output: [[ 5. 12.] [21. 32.]]
```

In this example, I use two 2D tensors (matrices). `tf.matmul` performs the correct matrix multiplication, where the entry in row *i* and column *j* of the product is calculated by taking the dot product of the row *i* of the first matrix with column *j* of the second. `tf.multiply`, conversely, computes the element-wise product. As we can see, when working with matrices, the results are not even remotely similar, and we must use `tf.matmul` for matrix multiplication.

When choosing between these two functions, I always ask: Do I want element-wise multiplication, or do I want a true matrix or vector dot product? If the intended operation is element-wise multiplication, use `tf.multiply`. If the goal is to compute the mathematical dot product of vectors or perform standard matrix multiplication between matrices, use `tf.matmul`. For dot products with `tf.multiply`, it's essential to include the `tf.reduce_sum` operation after the multiplication to achieve the desired scalar result. `tf.matmul`, on the other hand, handles this aggregation when using vectors as dot products.

To further understand the nuanced use cases and efficient implementations of these functions, I recommend exploring resources on linear algebra for deep learning and the official TensorFlow documentation, which offer detailed explanations and examples. Specifically, focus on the sections related to tensor operations, matrix math, and performance considerations of these operations. Books on deep learning with TensorFlow are also valuable resources, especially those that include practical implementations and explanations of these fundamental functions. Studying these resources has provided me with a deeper understanding of these core TensorFlow functions, enabling me to apply them correctly and efficiently in my work.
