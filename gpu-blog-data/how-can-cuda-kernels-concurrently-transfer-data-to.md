Direct memory access from a CUDA kernel to the host is not directly supported;  kernel execution occurs exclusively on the device.  Attempts to directly write to host memory from within a kernel will result in undefined behavior, likely a program crash.  This limitation stems from the fundamental architecture of CUDA, where the host and device maintain separate memory spaces. However, concurrent data transfer *to* the host *from* multiple kernels is achievable through asynchronous data transfers and careful orchestration of kernel launches and memory management. My experience troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in high-throughput image processing pipelines has underscored the necessity of understanding this distinction.

The solution relies on the asynchronous nature of CUDA's memory copy functions, specifically `cudaMemcpyAsync`.  Instead of blocking execution until a transfer completes, `cudaMemcpyAsync` allows the CPU to continue processing while the GPU transfers data.  This asynchronous behavior is crucial for achieving concurrency.  Multiple kernels can execute independently, initiating their own asynchronous data transfers to the host, overlapping computation and data movement.  However, proper synchronization is paramount to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity upon retrieval on the host.  Let's examine effective strategies:

**1.  Asynchronous Transfers with Streams:**

This approach utilizes CUDA streams to manage the concurrent execution of kernels and data transfers. Each stream operates independently, allowing overlapping operations.  This is particularly effective when dealing with multiple independent processing tasks within a larger application.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void kernel1(float *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    data[i] *= 2.0f; // Perform some computation
  }
}

__global__ void kernel2(float *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    data[i] += 1.0f; // Perform different computation
  }
}


int main() {
  // ... Memory allocation and data initialization ...

  float *dev_data;
  cudaMalloc(&dev_data, N * sizeof(float));
  cudaMemcpy(dev_data, h_data, N * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


  cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

  kernel1<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream1>>>(dev_data, N);
  kernel2<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream2>>>(dev_data, N);

  float *h_result1 = (float*)malloc(N * sizeof(float));
  float *h_result2 = (float*)malloc(N * sizeof(float));

  cudaMemcpyAsync(h_result1, dev_data, N * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream1);
  cudaMemcpyAsync(h_result2, dev_data, N * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream2);

  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1);
  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream2);

  // ... Process h_result1 and h_result2 ...

  cudaFree(dev_data);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);
  free(h_result1);
  free(h_result2);

  return 0;
}
```

The code showcases two kernels, `kernel1` and `kernel2`, operating on the same data but in different streams.  Asynchronous copies using `cudaMemcpyAsync` in respective streams ensure concurrent data transfer and kernel execution.  `cudaStreamSynchronize` is crucial for ensuring data is available on the host before further processing.  This example provides a basic illustration;  in practice, sophisticated stream management might involve more complex scheduling to maximize overlap.


**2.  Events for Synchronization:**

CUDA events provide a more fine-grained control over synchronization compared to stream synchronization alone.  Events mark the completion of specific kernel launches or memory transfers.  This allows more precise dependencies to be defined between kernels and transfers, preventing race conditions.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// ... Kernel definitions (same as previous example) ...

int main() {
  // ... Memory allocation and data initialization ...

  cudaEvent_t kernel1_done, kernel2_done, copy1_done, copy2_done;
  cudaEventCreate(&kernel1_done);
  cudaEventCreate(&kernel2_done);
  cudaEventCreate(&copy1_done);
  cudaEventCreate(&copy2_done);

  kernel1<<<blocks, threads>>>(dev_data, N);
  cudaEventRecord(kernel1_done, 0);

  kernel2<<<blocks, threads>>>(dev_data, N);
  cudaEventRecord(kernel2_done, 0);

  cudaMemcpyAsync(h_result1, dev_data, N * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  cudaEventRecord(copy1_done, 0);

  cudaMemcpyAsync(h_result2, dev_data, N * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  cudaEventRecord(copy2_done, 0);


  cudaEventSynchronize(copy1_done); // Wait for the first copy to complete
  cudaEventSynchronize(copy2_done); // Wait for the second copy to complete

  // ...Process h_result1 and h_result2...

  cudaEventDestroy(kernel1_done);
  cudaEventDestroy(kernel2_done);
  cudaEventDestroy(copy1_done);
  cudaEventDestroy(copy2_done);
  // ... Memory deallocation ...

  return 0;
}
```

This example utilizes CUDA events to ensure both copies complete before processing the results.  The `cudaEventSynchronize` function blocks execution until the specified event is recorded, providing explicit control over the order of operations.  This approach is beneficial when precise ordering between kernel executions and data transfers is critical.


**3.  Multiple Devices and Concurrency:**

For truly massive datasets or computationally intensive tasks, leveraging multiple GPUs can significantly enhance parallel data transfer capabilities. Each GPU can execute kernels and perform asynchronous transfers independently, leading to substantially higher throughput.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// ... Kernel definitions (potentially different kernels for each GPU) ...

int main() {
  // ... Memory allocation and data initialization for both GPUs ...

  int deviceCount;
  cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

  if (deviceCount < 2) {
    // Handle case where fewer than 2 devices are available.
    return 1; //Or handle the error appropriately.
  }

  cudaDeviceProp prop;
  cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, 0); //Get properties for device 0
  cudaSetDevice(0); //Set the device for the first kernel launch

  // ...Kernel launch and asynchronous copy for GPU 0...

  cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, 1); //Get properties for device 1
  cudaSetDevice(1); //Set the device for the second kernel launch

  // ...Kernel launch and asynchronous copy for GPU 1...

  cudaDeviceSynchronize(); //Synchronize across both devices

  // ...Process results from both GPUs...


  return 0;
}
```

This example outlines a strategy to utilize two GPUs.  The code first checks for the availability of multiple devices.  Subsequently, it sets the active device using `cudaSetDevice` before launching kernels and initiating asynchronous transfers on each GPU.  `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` ensures all operations on both devices are complete before processing the final results.  This method achieves high-level concurrency but demands more complex management of resources and device selection.
