The core challenge in efficiently restructuring SAS data based on date and a grouping variable lies in selecting the appropriate data step procedure and leveraging its features to minimize redundant processing.  My experience working with large longitudinal datasets in clinical trials highlighted the importance of this; inefficient restructuring could easily increase processing time from minutes to hours, especially when dealing with millions of observations. The key is to strategically use the `BY` statement in conjunction with `OUTPUT` and potentially array processing to control data aggregation and formatting.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Efficient restructuring depends heavily on the desired output structure.  Are you aiming for a wide format (multiple variables representing different dates for each group), a long format (a single date variable and corresponding values), or a summary table?  Each requires a slightly different approach.

For wide formats, the process typically involves sorting the data by grouping variable and date, then using a `BY` group processing within a data step.  The `FIRST.` and `LAST.` variables, automatically created when using a `BY` statement, are crucial for identifying the start and end of each group.  Within each group, observations are processed sequentially, allowing the assignment of values to different date-specific variables. This requires pre-defined variables for each expected date or a dynamic approach using arrays.

Long formats are generally easier to achieve.  Simply sorting the data by grouping variable and date and outputting each observation in the original format results in a long format. However, if transformations are required, such as calculating differences or aggregations across dates, further data step manipulations become necessary.

Summary tables typically involve aggregating values for each group across all dates.  This can be accomplished using PROC MEANS or PROC SUMMARY with the `CLASS` and `BY` statements, followed by data step processing to format the results into the desired table structure.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Wide Format Restructuring**

This example transforms a dataset with daily sales data into a wide format, where each column represents a day of the week.  This assumes your data has a consistent weekly pattern.


```sas
/* Initial data: Long format */
data sales_long;
  input store $ date:mmddyy10. sales;
  datalines;
A 01JAN2024 100
A 02JAN2024 120
A 03JAN2024 110
A 04JAN2024 130
A 05JAN2024 150
A 06JAN2024 140
A 07JAN2024 160
B 01JAN2024 80
B 02JAN2024 90
B 03JAN2024 100
B 04JAN2024 110
B 05JAN2024 120
B 06JAN2024 130
B 07JAN2024 140
;
run;

/* Restructuring to wide format */
data sales_wide;
  set sales_long;
  by store date;
  retain mon tue wed thu fri sat sun;
  if first.store then do;
    mon=.; tue=.; wed=.; thu=.; fri=.; sat=.; sun=.;
  end;
  if weekday(date)=2 then mon=sales; /* Monday */
  if weekday(date)=3 then tue=sales; /* Tuesday */
  /* ...and so on for other weekdays... */
  if last.store then output;
run;
```

This code leverages the `BY` statement, `FIRST.` and `LAST.` variables, and `retain` statement to efficiently manage memory and avoid redundant computations. The `weekday()` function determines the day of the week.  Note that this approach requires knowing the days of the week in advance.  For a more flexible solution with varying date ranges, an array-based approach (shown in Example 3) is preferred.


**Example 2: Long Format with Aggregation**

This demonstrates creating a long format with calculated weekly totals.


```sas
/* Calculate weekly sales */
proc sql;
  create table weekly_sales as
  select store, year(date) as year, week(date) as week, sum(sales) as weekly_total
  from sales_long
  group by store, year, week;
quit;

/* Output in long format */
data weekly_sales_long;
  set weekly_sales;
run;
```

PROC SQL is used here for its efficient aggregation capabilities. This approach is concise and avoids explicit looping within a data step.


**Example 3: Dynamic Wide Format with Arrays**

This example addresses the limitation of Example 1 by dynamically handling different date ranges using arrays.  This is a more robust and adaptable solution for diverse datasets.


```sas
proc sort data=sales_long;
  by store date;
run;

data sales_wide_dynamic;
  set sales_long;
  by store;
  length date_var $ 8;
  retain date_var;
  array sales_array(*) _numeric_; /* Array to hold sales values */
  array date_array(*) date_var; /* Array to hold date values */

  if first.store then do;
    call missing(of sales_array(*)); /* Initialize sales array */
    i = 1;
  end;

  date_var = put(date, yymmddn8.);
  do j=1 to dim(sales_array);
    if date_array(j) = date_var then do;
      sales_array(j) = sales;
      leave;
    end;
    else if missing(sales_array(j)) then do;
      date_array(j) = date_var;
      sales_array(j) = sales;
      leave;
    end;
  end;
  if last.store then output;
run;
```

This code utilizes arrays to dynamically store sales data for each date within each store.  The `_numeric_` automatic variable list simplifies array handling. It dynamically allocates space, handling varying numbers of dates for each store without the need for pre-defined variables.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

SAS documentation on DATA step processing, specifically the `BY` statement, `FIRST.` and `LAST.` variables, and array processing.  Furthermore, consult SAS documentation on PROC MEANS, PROC SUMMARY, and PROC SQL for efficient data summarization and aggregation.  Consider exploring advanced SAS programming techniques such as hash objects for improved efficiency with very large datasets.  Finally, dedicated SAS performance tuning guides can prove invaluable.
