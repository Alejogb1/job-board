Having spent the last five years immersed in deep learning projects, I’ve frequently encountered the subtle nuances between Keras and TensorFlow, especially when debugging model behavior. Your observation about potential implementation flaws is common, and it usually stems not from inherent issues in either library, but rather how they’re interwoven and utilized. Specifically, what might appear to be a "Keras" problem often boils down to differences in API usage, underlying TensorFlow mechanics, and potential implicit assumptions about data handling.

Fundamentally, Keras serves as a high-level API for building and training neural networks, while TensorFlow is the low-level computation engine. Keras, in most scenarios, is running atop TensorFlow. A ‘flaw’ isn’t generally in Keras itself, but in how we’re crafting the models, preparing data, or specifying training parameters via its API, potentially not aligning with the expected TensorFlow execution. The key differences influencing this perceived 'flaw' are typically in areas like model construction (functional vs. sequential API), custom training loops, data handling (Tensor datasets vs. in-memory arrays), and eager execution vs. graph compilation.

Let’s analyze some illustrative scenarios. I've seen numerous times where the root cause was the improper initialization of layers. Keras, by default, uses sensible initializers. However, if you explicitly define a custom weight initialization without understanding how it interacts with the chosen activation function within the TensorFlow backend, you can end up with vanishing or exploding gradients—making it seem like Keras itself is the problem.

The following code exemplifies a potential issue that, on the surface, might appear to be a Keras limitation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Incorrect custom initializer - can lead to issues
def bad_init(shape, dtype=tf.float32):
    return tf.random.normal(shape, mean=5, stddev=1, dtype=dtype)

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_initializer=bad_init, input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.eye(10)[np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)]

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```
In this example, the `bad_init` initializer produces initial weights that are significantly off-center (mean of 5). The Relu activation only passes values greater than zero, and because the weights start too high, these tend to saturate very quickly. While it's all running under Keras, the problem originates within the TensorFlow operations stemming from the custom initialization logic, resulting in extremely slow learning or no learning at all. If the initializer was not custom made, the results would likely be vastly improved.

Another common source of confusion emerges when moving from Keras' `model.fit` paradigm to a completely custom training loop using TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape`.  While `model.fit` handles many nuances (data batching, gradient calculation, loss tracking) automatically, a custom loop requires precise understanding of how these elements are connected. Consider this scenario using a custom training loop:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10).astype(np.float32)
y_train = np.eye(10)[np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)].astype(np.float32)

batch_size = 32

# Custom training loop
for epoch in range(10):
  for batch in range(x_train.shape[0] // batch_size):
    x_batch = x_train[batch * batch_size : (batch+1) * batch_size]
    y_batch = y_train[batch * batch_size : (batch+1) * batch_size]
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      logits = model(x_batch)
      loss = loss_fn(y_batch, logits)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
  print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```
In this example, the core logic of backpropagation and gradient application is now explicitly defined.  While the model architecture is built using Keras, the training mechanism leverages the `tf.GradientTape` and underlying TensorFlow operations. Debugging here requires scrutinizing the gradient flow, ensuring correct loss calculation, and precise alignment of variables. If a similar model was trained using the more conventional model.fit paradigm from Keras, any issues might not be immediately transparent, thus giving the illusion that there was an issue with Keras itself, and not the implementation of the training process.

Finally, data loading and preprocessing can introduce inconsistencies when moving between different Keras and TensorFlow approaches, especially when dealing with large datasets. Keras often encourages in-memory NumPy arrays when initially working, but that is not always ideal. TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset` API provides significant benefits, enabling optimized data pipelining. If your initial Keras workflow relied heavily on loading all data into memory before training, then switching to TensorFlow without incorporating the appropriate data handling practices, the performance may appear sub-par:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Model definition remains the same as in previous example

x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10).astype(np.float32)
y_train = np.eye(10)[np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000)].astype(np.float32)


# Using Keras, training data is passed directly to the fit method
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)


# Using TensorFlow's tf.data, large datasets can be handled efficiently
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

for epoch in range(10):
    for batch_x, batch_y in dataset:
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          logits = model(batch_x)
          loss = loss_fn(batch_y, logits)
        grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```
Here, we see how using the Keras model.fit() paradigm with a numpy dataset can lead to issues with performance and data loading. By utilizing the tensorflow Dataset API, specifically `tf.data.Dataset`, data can be loaded and pipelined much more efficiently. While on a small dataset, performance may seem comparable, scaling to larger datasets would show a clear advantage to the `tf.data.Dataset` usage.

Therefore, rather than a flaw in Keras itself, the observed discrepancies are most often due to differences in how users leverage the underlying TensorFlow functionality, along with assumptions that might not hold true when migrating between different ways of interacting with the two libraries. Specifically, focusing on clear definition of layers with good initializers, understanding custom training loop functionality, and properly using the data loading mechanisms that best fit the use case can alleviate most of these issues.

For further exploration, consider resources that delve into TensorFlow internals. The official TensorFlow documentation and API guides are crucial. Look into books focused on the interplay between Keras and TensorFlow for a deeper technical understanding. Specific tutorials and guides that walk through the various use cases of each library will also be helpful.
