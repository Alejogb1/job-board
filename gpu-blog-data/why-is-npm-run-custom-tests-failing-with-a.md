The failure of `npm run custom-tests` with a non-200 HTTP response almost always stems from an issue within the script itself, specifically how it handles HTTP requests and their responses.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, particularly involving asynchronous testing frameworks and external API interactions, has consistently highlighted this core problem.  The error isn't inherently within npm's execution, but rather within the logic of your custom test script.  The script likely lacks robust error handling for non-successful HTTP responses.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

`npm run custom-tests` executes a command defined within your `package.json`'s `scripts` section.  This command frequently involves a custom script (e.g., a shell script, a node script, or a batch file) responsible for running your tests.  If these tests involve making HTTP requests (e.g., to an external API for data retrieval or verification), the failure to properly handle responses other than a 200 (OK) status code will lead to a script termination or unexpected behavior.  The testing framework used might also have specific mechanisms for handling failed requests, and neglecting these can also cause the tests to fail silently or produce confusing error messages.


The failure manifests as a non-zero exit code from your test script, which npm interprets as a failure.  Identifying the exact cause requires careful examination of:

* **HTTP Request Library:** The library used for making HTTP requests (e.g., `axios`, `node-fetch`, `request`) and how it's integrated into your test suite.
* **Response Handling:** The mechanism for checking the HTTP status code after the request.  Missing or inadequate error handling will cause the script to crash or proceed with potentially erroneous data.
* **Testing Framework:** The framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Jasmine) and its associated assertion libraries.  These frameworks often provide utilities to handle promises and asynchronous operations, and failing to use them correctly can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **API Endpoint Availability:** Ensure the API endpoint you're targeting is operational and responding correctly. Network issues or server-side problems can lead to non-200 responses.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Insufficient Error Handling with Axios**

```javascript
// test.js
const axios = require('axios');

async function testAPI() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    //Success, but only check status
    if (response.status === 200){
        console.log('Success!');
    }

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Request failed:', error); //This is only partly sufficient
    process.exit(1); //Explicit exit code for npm
  }
}

testAPI();
```

* **Commentary:** This example only partially addresses error handling. While it catches exceptions, it doesn't explicitly check the `response.status` before accessing response data, and only logs the error. More robust handling should include verification of the response status code (200 OK). A more complete solution would verify specific data within the response body based on test expectations.  This is crucial, as a non-200 response doesn't always throw an exception.  A 404, for example, might return a valid JSON payload, but one that doesn't align with the expectation of a successful request.


**Example 2:  Correct Error Handling with Node-Fetch**

```javascript
// test.js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function testAPI() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json(); //Attempt to parse error response
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}, message: ${errorData.message || response.statusText}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    // Assertions on data would go here
    console.log('Test passed!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Test failed:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

testAPI();
```

* **Commentary:**  This example demonstrates better error handling. It uses `response.ok` to efficiently check for successful responses. The attempt to parse errorData provides more contextual information which is invaluable for debugging.  Crucially, it explicitly throws an error if `response.ok` is false, providing context for the failure.  Note the inclusion of `process.exit(1)`, signaling failure to npm.


**Example 3:  Using Jest with Async/Await**

```javascript
// test.js
const axios = require('axios');

test('API returns expected data', async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  expect(response.data.someProperty).toBe('someValue'); //Example assertion
});
```

* **Commentary:** This leverages Jest's built-in `async/await` support and assertion capabilities.  The `expect` statements directly verify both the HTTP status code and the content of the response.  Jest inherently handles promise rejection and provides detailed error messages, improving debugging significantly.  The use of Jest simplifies the error handling process; the framework manages the asynchronous aspects and provides a streamlined mechanism for assertions.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of HTTP request handling in Node.js, I highly recommend consulting the documentation for the specific HTTP client library you're using (axios, node-fetch, etc.). Familiarize yourself with the asynchronous programming paradigms in JavaScript, especially Promises and async/await.  Invest time in mastering your chosen testing framework's documentation, as itâ€™s crucial for constructing reliable and robust tests.  Understanding HTTP status codes is fundamental; refer to relevant RFCs or comprehensive documentation for a thorough understanding.  Finally, effective debugging strategies, including logging and breakpoint usage (within your IDE or debugger), are crucial in isolating the problem within your custom test script.
