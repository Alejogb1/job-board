The core issue with `var.to(device)` when utilizing `nn.DataParallel` in PyTorch stems from the inherent distributed nature of the operation.  `nn.DataParallel` replicates the model across multiple devices, and a straightforward `to(device)` call only affects the main process's copy.  This results in data mismatches and potential runtime errors.  My experience debugging distributed training in large-scale image classification projects highlighted this repeatedly.  The solution requires a more nuanced understanding of how data tensors are managed within the `nn.DataParallel` context.

**1. Clear Explanation**

`nn.DataParallel` automatically handles data distribution across available devices, but this distribution is implicit and managed internally.  Explicitly sending tensors to specific devices using `var.to(device)` bypasses this internal mechanism, leading to inconsistencies.  Instead of directing tensors manually, we must rely on PyTorch's automatic data handling features integrated within `nn.DataParallel`.  This involves careful consideration of how data is initially loaded and subsequently fed to the model during the training loop.

The key is to ensure the input data to your model is already correctly distributed across the devices *before* it reaches `nn.DataParallel`.  This typically involves utilizing PyTorch's `DataLoader` with appropriate settings for distributed data loading and sampling.  This ensures each device receives a portion of the data relevant only to its assigned computations.

The underlying principle is maintaining data locality.  If the model and data reside on different devices, significant communication overhead results, negating the performance benefits of distributed training.  Furthermore, improperly managed data can lead to synchronization errors, corrupting the training process and producing unreliable results.  This is precisely what I encountered during the development of a real-time object detection system, where inconsistent data handling due to misplaced `to(device)` calls caused significant instability.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Correct Data Loading with `DataLoader`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp
import torch.utils.data as data

# ... (Your model definition and dataset setup) ...

def run(rank, world_size):
    dist.init_process_group("gloo", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)
    torch.manual_seed(42)

    model = YourModel().to(rank) #Assign model to correct device
    model = nn.DataParallel(model) # Wrapping the model after assignment is crucial.

    sampler = data.distributed.DistributedSampler(YourDataset, num_replicas=world_size, rank=rank)
    dataloader = data.DataLoader(YourDataset, batch_size=32, sampler=sampler)

    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

    for epoch in range(10):
        for data, target in dataloader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            output = model(data) # DataParallel automatically handles distribution
            loss = nn.functional.cross_entropy(output, target)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
        dist.barrier() # Ensure synchronization between devices

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()
    mp.spawn(run, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size, join=True)
```

This example demonstrates the correct approach. The `DistributedSampler` ensures each device gets a unique subset of the data, and `model.to(rank)` assigns the model to the correct device *before* wrapping it with `nn.DataParallel`.  The `dist.barrier()` call ensures synchronization between processes.  The key here is the data already being correctly localized before reaching the model.

**Example 2: Incorrect Use of `to(device)`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
#... (Model and dataset) ...

model = nn.DataParallel(YourModel())
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

for data, target in dataloader:
    data = data.to(device)  # Incorrect: Bypasses DataParallel's handling
    target = target.to(device) # Incorrect: Bypasses DataParallel's handling
    output = model(data)
    # ... (rest of the training loop) ...
```

This shows an incorrect implementation. Although the model is wrapped in `nn.DataParallel`, explicitly moving the data to a specific device using `to(device)` interferes with the internal data distribution mechanism of `nn.DataParallel`, leading to potential errors.

**Example 3:  Handling Model Output**

Retrieving the output from `nn.DataParallel` also requires attention.  The output is typically a tuple containing outputs from each device.  Proper aggregation is often needed.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
#... (Model and dataset) ...


model = nn.DataParallel(YourModel())
# ... (Training loop) ...

output = model(data) # Output is a tuple from different devices

#Aggregate outputs (example for simple averaging)
if isinstance(output, tuple):
    averaged_output = torch.mean(torch.stack(output), dim=0)
else:
    averaged_output = output
```

This illustrates how to handle the output, which is a crucial step. If you need a single prediction, you'll need to aggregate the outputs from each GPU. Averaging, as shown, is suitable for some tasks but may not always be appropriate.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on `nn.DataParallel`, `DistributedSampler`, and the `torch.distributed` package.  A thorough understanding of distributed data loading is vital.  Consult advanced tutorials and examples demonstrating distributed training with complex model architectures.  Examining source code of established distributed training frameworks can provide valuable insights into best practices and advanced techniques.  Finally, studying papers that benchmark distributed training strategies will be insightful.
