Newline handling in an ASP.NET DetailsView, specifically when displaying data originating from a textarea, presents a common challenge: the preservation of line breaks. Textareas, in their native HTML form, represent newlines with `\r\n` (Windows) or `\n` (Unix/Linux) character sequences. However, when displayed within a DetailsView, these sequences are often rendered as spaces or ignored entirely, collapsing the intended multi-line text into a single, unbroken string. This results in a poor user experience and a significant misrepresentation of the entered data. Having spent considerable time wrestling with this across various projects, I've developed several approaches that effectively address this issue, and I'll outline my preferred methods.

The core problem stems from HTML's default interpretation of whitespace. Standard HTML, absent specific instructions, treats consecutive whitespace characters, including newlines, as a single space. The `DetailsView` control, by default, outputs data without any specific manipulation of these newline characters. Consequently, the raw text retrieved from the data source, complete with newlines, is rendered as plain text, neglecting its multi-line structure. My preferred solution centers around replacing these newline character sequences with HTML break tags (`<br />`), which explicitly instruct the browser to render a line break. This transformation can be achieved either programmatically or declaratively within the ASP.NET context.

My first method involves programmatic transformation, performed in the code-behind of the ASP.NET page. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with data that may not consistently contain the expected newline characters or requires other forms of sanitization. This process typically occurs during the `ItemCreated` event of the DetailsView, which fires for each row, including data rows. Inside this event handler, I retrieve the rendered text of the relevant label control, identify any newline sequences, and replace them with `<br />` tags.

```csharp
protected void DetailsView1_ItemCreated(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (DetailsView1.CurrentMode == DetailsViewMode.ReadOnly) //Ensures this logic only applies in view mode
    {
        foreach (DetailsViewRow row in DetailsView1.Rows)
        {
            if (row.Cells.Count > 1 && row.Cells[0].Text == "Description:")  //Assuming column header is "Description:"
            {
                 Label label = row.FindControl("DescriptionLabel") as Label; //Assumes relevant Label ID
                 if (label != null)
                 {
                      label.Text = label.Text.Replace("\r\n", "<br />").Replace("\n", "<br />");
                 }
            }
         }
     }
}
```

In the above example, I iterate through the rows of the `DetailsView`. I'm checking for a column heading equal to "Description:" to isolate the specific row containing the textarea data. Within this row, I obtain a reference to the `Label` control used to display the text and replace both Windows-style (`\r\n`) and Unix-style (`\n`) newline characters with `<br />` tags using the `Replace` method. The conditional check `DetailsView1.CurrentMode == DetailsViewMode.ReadOnly` ensures that these transformations only apply when the `DetailsView` is in view mode, preserving the original data. The use of `FindControl` is crucial as it provides direct access to the specific control. The conditional handling `if (row.Cells.Count > 1)` avoids errors when the label control is not present in the row.

Another practical approach involves using a custom HTML encoding function in tandem with data binding. This method allows the data transformations to occur automatically through data binding without code-behind intervention. This technique is most appropriate when a consistent transformation is desired and can reduce the code overhead in situations involving multiple DetailsViews on a single page. It also adds better separation of concerns in presentation layer.

I typically define a static helper class with methods for encoding purposes:

```csharp
public static class HtmlHelper
{
    public static string EncodeNewLines(string text)
    {
       if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(text))
         return string.Empty;
       
       return text.Replace("\r\n", "<br />").Replace("\n", "<br />");
    }
}
```

Within the ASP.NET markup file, I would then reference this function within the `Text` property of the label, utilising a data binding expression:

```aspx
<asp:DetailsView ID="DetailsView2" runat="server" AutoGenerateRows="False" DataKeyNames="Id" DataSourceID="SqlDataSource2">
     <Fields>
          <asp:BoundField DataField="Id" HeaderText="ID" ReadOnly="True" />
          <asp:BoundField DataField="Title" HeaderText="Title" />
          <asp:TemplateField HeaderText="Notes">
               <ItemTemplate>
                    <asp:Label ID="NotesLabel" runat="server" Text='<%# HtmlHelper.EncodeNewLines(Eval("Notes").ToString()) %>'></asp:Label>
               </ItemTemplate>
          </asp:TemplateField>
    </Fields>
</asp:DetailsView>
```

Here, `HtmlHelper.EncodeNewLines` is called during the data binding process, which replaces the newline characters with `<br />` tags before the text is rendered within the `Label` control. The `Eval("Notes")` syntax retrieves the value of the "Notes" field from the data source, converting it to a string to ensure compatibility with my encoding method. This approach enables a cleaner separation of concerns by keeping the transformation logic within the helper class and the data binding process within the markup. This eliminates any need for custom `ItemCreated` event handling or inline logic. The check for `string.IsNullOrEmpty` in the helper method avoids errors if the text being processed is empty.

The third alternative I've utilized is a declarative approach, leveraging the built-in `HtmlEncode` property of the BoundField control in conjunction with a small code-behind function. This is particularly useful for cases where we don't want to use templates. The idea is to encode the content first, including the newlines, but with the newlines encoded as literal strings, which can be reversed at the display step. I've found this most appropriate in scenarios where data consistency is paramount. This also helps to avoid security vulnerabilities.

Within the ASP.NET markup, set `HtmlEncode` to true:

```aspx
<asp:DetailsView ID="DetailsView3" runat="server" AutoGenerateRows="False" DataKeyNames="Id" DataSourceID="SqlDataSource3">
     <Fields>
          <asp:BoundField DataField="Id" HeaderText="ID" ReadOnly="True" />
          <asp:BoundField DataField="Title" HeaderText="Title" />
          <asp:BoundField DataField="Comments" HeaderText="Comments" HtmlEncode="True"  />
     </Fields>
</asp:DetailsView>
```

Then, in the code-behind, use a suitable method to reverse the newline escaping on `DetailsView_DataBound` event handler:

```csharp
protected void DetailsView3_DataBound(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
   if (DetailsView3.CurrentMode == DetailsViewMode.ReadOnly)
   {
       foreach (DetailsViewRow row in DetailsView3.Rows)
      {
         if (row.Cells.Count > 1 && row.Cells[0].Text == "Comments:")
          {
              TableCell cell = row.Cells[1];
              cell.Text = cell.Text.Replace("&lt;br /&gt;", "<br />");
          }
      }
    }
}
```

By setting `HtmlEncode="True"`, the `BoundField` will automatically encode all text, including newlines, into HTML entities before displaying the data. This effectively turns `\r\n` into `&lt;br /&gt;`, preserving its multi-line nature in a single-line string, albeit encoded. By using a DataBound event, you are able to traverse through the rows and replace the encoded `<br />` strings with actual html break lines. The condition `row.Cells.Count > 1` is in place to avoid errors when the data column is absent from the data view.

For resources, I would suggest delving into the ASP.NET documentation concerning the `DetailsView` control, specifically its events and properties related to data binding and control rendering. Additionally, thoroughly studying HTML and JavaScript encoding practices is essential. The concepts of HTML entities and how they are handled by browsers are very important to grasp. Lastly, consider exploring best practices related to handling text from various sources when displaying data within an ASP.NET application, paying close attention to potential security risks of accepting unencoded input, specifically cross-site scripting.

In summary, these three techniques, through programmatic manipulation of the rendered label control text, utilization of data-binding expressions with a custom encoding function, or a declarative approach using `HtmlEncode` properties and reversal during the databound event, provide robust solutions to the problem of handling newlines in an ASP.NET DetailsView when displaying textarea content. The optimal approach depends heavily on the specific requirements of the project and, often, personal coding preferences.
