The core distinction between `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits()` and `tf.contrib.seq2seq.sequence_loss()` lies in their scope: the former operates on a single time step, calculating the cross-entropy loss between a predicted logits vector and a one-hot encoded target, while the latter aggregates losses across multiple time steps within a sequence, typically in the context of sequence-to-sequence models.  My experience building large-scale machine translation systems heavily relied on understanding this nuanced interplay. Misinterpreting their individual roles often resulted in incorrect loss calculations and poor model performance.

**1.  Detailed Explanation:**

`tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits()` (now `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2` in TensorFlow 2.x) computes the softmax cross-entropy loss between the predicted logits and the true labels.  Crucially, it assumes the input logits represent the unnormalized log probabilities for a single time step.  The function internally applies the softmax function to the logits, converting them into probabilities, then computes the cross-entropy loss between these probabilities and the provided one-hot encoded target.  This loss is a measure of the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution. The output is a tensor of the same shape as the labels, where each element represents the loss for the corresponding example at that time step.

`tf.contrib.seq2seq.sequence_loss()` (deprecated in TensorFlow 2.x, functionality largely replaced by custom implementations using `tf.reduce_mean` and masking techniques), on the other hand, is designed to handle sequences.  It takes as input the logits (typically a 3D tensor of shape [batch_size, max_time, num_classes]), the targets (also a 3D tensor of the same batch size and max time, but with one-hot encoding for each time step), and a sequence length tensor specifying the actual length of each sequence in the batch.  This function calculates the cross-entropy loss for each time step of each sequence, applies masking to ignore padded time steps (common in variable-length sequences), and averages the loss across all time steps and sequences.  This average loss then serves as the training objective.

The critical interaction stems from the fact that `sequence_loss` often uses `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` internally.  `sequence_loss` iterates through each time step, feeding the logits for that time step to `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` to compute the per-time-step loss.  The results are then aggregated, masked, and averaged to produce the final sequence loss.  Therefore, `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` provides the foundational per-step loss calculation that `sequence_loss` leverages for sequence-level loss computation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Usage of `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

logits = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 0.5], [0.2, 0.8, 1.5]]) # Logits for two examples, three classes
labels = tf.constant([[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]) # One-hot encoded labels

loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2(labels=labels, logits=logits)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    loss_value = sess.run(loss)
    print(loss_value) # Output: array([1.3132616, 0.4645756], dtype=float32) - Per-example loss
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental usage. Note the individual loss for each example, reflecting the discrepancy between predicted and actual probabilities for each.


**Example 2:  Illustrative Sequence Loss Calculation (pre-TensorFlow 2.x approach)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Simulate logits and targets for a sequence
logits = tf.constant([[[1.0, 0.5, 2.0], [0.2, 1.5, 0.8], [0.1, 0.9, 0.6]],
                     [[0.8, 1.2, 0.3], [1.1, 0.7, 0.9], [0.5, 0.2, 1.0]]]) # Shape: (2, 3, 3) - 2 sequences, 3 time steps, 3 classes
targets = tf.constant([[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]],
                       [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0]]]) # Shape: (2, 3, 3)
sequence_length = tf.constant([3, 2]) # First sequence has length 3, second has length 2

# Note:  This code is illustrative and employs a simplified approach.  In actual practice,
#  more robust handling of masking and averaging is necessary.  The tf.contrib.seq2seq
#  module offered more sophisticated tools for this purpose.

# Calculate loss for each time step using softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits
per_step_loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2(labels=targets, logits=logits)

# Apply masking (simplified example) - a real-world scenario would require more sophisticated masking
masked_loss = tf.boolean_mask(per_step_loss, tf.sequence_mask(sequence_length, maxlen=tf.shape(per_step_loss)[1]))

# Calculate average loss
average_loss = tf.reduce_mean(masked_loss)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    average_loss_value = sess.run(average_loss)
    print(average_loss_value)
```

This example sketches out the core steps involved. It mimics the internal workings of `sequence_loss` by explicitly applying masking and averaging.  Again, I emphasize the significance of proper masking for handling variable-length sequences, which was crucial in my projects.


**Example 3: TensorFlow 2.x approach with `tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

logits = tf.constant([[[1.0, 0.5, 2.0], [0.2, 1.5, 0.8], [0.1, 0.9, 0.6]],
                     [[0.8, 1.2, 0.3], [1.1, 0.7, 0.9], [0.5, 0.2, 1.0]]])
targets = tf.constant([[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]],
                       [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0]]])
mask = tf.constant([[True, True, True], [True, True, False]])

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
loss = loss_fn(targets, logits, sample_weight=mask)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    loss_value = sess.run(loss)
    print(loss_value)
```

This illustrates a modern TensorFlow 2.x approach.  `tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy` elegantly handles the calculation, and the sample weight (`mask`) is used for masking.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation.  Thoroughly understanding the APIs and their parameters is critical.
*   "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. This text provides a comprehensive theoretical background.
*   A strong grasp of linear algebra and probability theory. This foundational knowledge is essential for understanding the mathematical underpinnings of these functions.


These resources, combined with practical experience building and debugging sequence-to-sequence models, were invaluable in my own journey to mastering the intricacies of these TensorFlow functions.  The deprecation of `tf.contrib.seq2seq` highlights the importance of keeping abreast of changes in the TensorFlow ecosystem.  Understanding the underlying principles—softmax, cross-entropy, and sequence masking—is key to effective model development and optimization.
