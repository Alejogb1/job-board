The `RuntimeError` encountered with `F.relu(self.fc1(x))` most often stems from a shape mismatch between the output of the fully connected layer (`self.fc1(x)`) and the expectation of the ReLU activation function (`F.relu`).  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous PyTorch projects points to this as the primary culprit, although other less frequent causes exist.  Let's systematically explore this, covering both the common and less obvious scenarios.

**1. Clear Explanation: Shape Mismatches and their Origin**

The ReLU function, implemented here as `F.relu`, operates element-wise.  This means it expects a tensor of arbitrary dimensionality (e.g., a vector, matrix, or higher-order tensor), and applies the `max(0, x)` operation to each element independently.  If `self.fc1(x)` produces a tensor whose shape is incompatible with this element-wise operation, PyTorch will raise a `RuntimeError`.  This incompatibility frequently manifests as a mismatch in the expected number of dimensions or a mismatch in the dimensions themselves.

Several aspects of your code structure might lead to these mismatches. First, ensure `self.fc1` is correctly defined. A common mistake is an incorrect specification of the `in_features` and `out_features` parameters in the `torch.nn.Linear` layer definition.  These parameters define the input and output dimensions of the linear transformation performed by `self.fc1`.  A discrepancy between the output shape of the preceding layer (providing input `x`) and the `in_features` of `self.fc1` will lead to a runtime error. Similarly, if the shape of `x` is unexpected due to data preprocessing issues, a shape mismatch can propagate through the network.

Further, other transformations before the ReLU activation can indirectly cause shape mismatches. For instance, if a reshape operation or a pooling operation precedes `self.fc1`, it's essential to verify the resulting tensor shape matches the expected `in_features` of the linear layer.  I've personally encountered this problem several times when refactoring code or incorporating new layers into existing networks.  Finally, errors in batching data can result in unexpected tensor dimensions, again leading to a runtime error at the ReLU activation step.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate with specific examples demonstrating potential shape mismatches and their resolutions:

**Example 1: Incorrect `in_features` and `out_features`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class MyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MyNetwork, self).__init__()
        # INCORRECT: in_features should match the output of the previous layer
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)  
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = F.relu(x) # This will likely throw an error if input_size doesn't match
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

#Example usage with incorrect input size
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 5
output_size = 2
model = MyNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 20) # Input size mismatch
output = model(input_tensor)  # RuntimeError: expected scalar type Float but found Double

#Corrected version
model = MyNetwork(20, hidden_size, output_size) # Correct the input_size
input_tensor = torch.randn(1,20)
output = model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape) #Correct output shape

```

This example demonstrates how incorrect `in_features` in `self.fc1` directly causes a shape mismatch when the input tensor's shape differs from the expected value.  The correction involves aligning the input size of the network with the dimensions of the input tensor.


**Example 2:  Unexpected Reshape Operation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class MyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(-1, 5) #incorrect reshape operation
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

#Example usage
input_size = 20
hidden_size = 5
output_size = 2
model = MyNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1,20)
output = model(input_tensor) # This may or may not fail depending on the input

# Corrected version: Remove incorrect view operation or correct the input size and view operation
model2 = MyNetwork(5, hidden_size, output_size)
input_tensor2 = torch.randn(1,5)
output2 = model2(input_tensor2)
print(output2.shape)
```

Here, an ill-placed `view` operation unintentionally modifies the tensor shape before it reaches `self.fc1`, creating a mismatch.  The corrected code either removes the reshape operation or modifies the network and input to correctly match the reshaped tensor.


**Example 3:  Batching Issues**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class MyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

#Example usage
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 5
output_size = 2
model = MyNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
input_tensor = torch.randn(10, input_size) # added batch size
output = model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape) #Output will now be a batch
```

This example shows how an unexpected batch dimension can cause confusion if the model isn't designed to handle it correctly. While not strictly a shape mismatch with ReLU, the issue stems from the earlier layers not properly managing the batch, causing an unexpected shape at the ReLU stage.  The solution typically involves adjusting data loading and the network architecture to manage batches effectively.  Proper understanding and use of `unsqueeze` and `squeeze` operations are crucial here.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch's tensors and neural network layers, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation.  The PyTorch tutorials provide excellent practical examples. Thoroughly exploring linear layer properties and tensor manipulation techniques will significantly assist in debugging similar errors.  Familiarity with PyTorch's debugging tools is also beneficial in pinpointing the exact location and nature of the shape mismatch. Finally, carefully reviewing the documentation for each layer in your model is essential to ensure the shapes of inputs and outputs meet expectations.
