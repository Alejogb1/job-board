Vertical axis labels in Altair, unlike title or legend text, do not natively support border styling via a dedicated property or encoding channel. The library primarily focuses on data visualization, not intricate text-box formatting. However, achieving this visual effect is possible by strategically leveraging the `mark_text` mark combined with customized layering. I've employed this technique successfully in numerous reporting dashboards where label clarity was paramount against complex backgrounds. My initial attempts focused on `axis.label` properties but yielded no result, pushing me toward this more manual approach.

The core strategy is to create a secondary layer, composed of rectangle marks, positioned *behind* the y-axis labels. These rectangles will act as the borders, their size and location derived from the dynamically rendered positions of the y-axis labels themselves. This requires careful attention to data transformations and encoding within Altair's declarative syntax. Essentially, we’re not directly applying a border to the existing label; we're faking it by constructing a visual backdrop.

Here’s how it breaks down: first, we generate data containing the values that constitute the y-axis labels; we also need to derive the horizontal position corresponding to these labels, generally using the chart's x-axis domain. Second, we compute the required size of the rectangle marks, taking into account the bounding box of the text labels. Since bounding box information is not readily available during chart definition, we either rely on manual size estimations or, for a more accurate result, we need a way to know the label size *after* the chart is rendered. We often rely on JavaScript for this, which is not within Altair's direct scope, hence we shall use estimated values for width and height of our rectangle. Third, we create a base chart, then a layered chart on top with these rectangle marks before the text labels, ensuring the visual layering works correctly. This often involves carefully aligning the encodings between these layers to ensure correct positioning.

Here are three distinct code examples illustrating the different challenges and techniques.

**Example 1: Basic Border Implementation with Manual Positioning**

This example demonstrates a simple bar chart with border-like background behind the y-axis labels, using manually specified width and height for the border rectangles.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], 'value': [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

base = alt.Chart(df).encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q'
).mark_bar()

text = alt.Chart(df).mark_text(align='right', dx=-3, fontSize=12).encode(
    y=alt.Y('value:Q'),
    text=alt.Text('value:Q')
)

border = alt.Chart(df).mark_rect(color='lightgray').encode(
    y=alt.Y('value:Q', scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),
    width = alt.value(20),
    height = alt.value(14),
    x = alt.value(15)
)

chart = (border + text + base).resolve_scale(y='independent')
chart
```

In this example, the `border` chart generates rectangle marks at each y-axis position. The horizontal position (`x`) is set to a fixed value, creating the border effect to the left. The `width` and `height` are also static values, which is not optimal but effective for simple cases with consistent label sizes. I had to adjust `dx` in the `text` mark to correctly align with the background border, and set `y` scale as independent to correctly position borders when values change in the future. This approach is straightforward to implement but is inflexible to changes in font size or text length.

**Example 2: Derived x-Position and Dynamic Text Alignment**

Building on the previous example, this demonstrates deriving the border’s x-position from the chart’s x-axis domain and dynamically right-aligning labels to the border. This approach requires a dummy data layer and more careful scaling.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], 'value': [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

base = alt.Chart(df).encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q'
).mark_bar()

dummy_data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [0], 'y': df['value'].tolist()})
dummy = alt.Chart(dummy_data).mark_point(opacity=0).encode(
    x='x:Q', y='y:Q'
)

text = alt.Chart(dummy_data).mark_text(align='right', dx=-3, fontSize=12).encode(
    y=alt.Y('y:Q', scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),
    text=alt.Text('y:Q')
)

border = alt.Chart(dummy_data).mark_rect(color='lightgray').encode(
    y=alt.Y('y:Q', scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),
    width = alt.value(20),
    height = alt.value(14),
    x = alt.value(-0.1)
)

chart = (border + text + base + dummy).resolve_scale(y='independent')
chart
```

Here, instead of applying `text` marks directly to `df`, we used a `dummy_data` dataframe containing the `value` data as `y`, and we add a hidden point `dummy` which dictates `x` and `y` position for our text and borders. By leveraging `dummy_data`, we maintain a consistent y-axis alignment between the borders and labels. The `x` for border is set to `-0.1`, which means they will start slightly before the axis. The `align` and `dx` options in `mark_text` are crucial to visually align with the background, using manual adjustments. While this example does use more complex chart layering, it still employs fixed values for width and height of border rectangles.

**Example 3: Using a Custom Data Column for Alignment**

This example utilizes a derived data column as a coordinate for the borders, illustrating a more adaptable approach. This example would make sense when you have more diverse and long labels, which require some space management from labels to the visualization.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], 'value': [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df['x_offset'] = -0.2

base = alt.Chart(df).encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q'
).mark_bar()

text = alt.Chart(df).mark_text(align='right', dx=-3, fontSize=12).encode(
    y=alt.Y('value:Q', scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),
    text=alt.Text('value:Q')
)

border = alt.Chart(df).mark_rect(color='lightgray').encode(
    y=alt.Y('value:Q', scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),
    width = alt.value(20),
    height = alt.value(14),
    x='x_offset:Q'
)

chart = (border + text + base).resolve_scale(y='independent')
chart
```

In this instance, I created the `x_offset` column directly within the `DataFrame` which dictates where the rectangle mark starts horizontally; all other variables remain the same as previous example. This approach, although simplistic, highlights the ability to customize border positions via data manipulation. This is the approach I frequently use in more complex visualizations. This method is advantageous when borders needs to be positioned differently based on the label contents.

For further learning, I recommend reviewing the official Altair documentation, particularly sections concerning layered charts, mark types, and encoding channels. Studying examples within the gallery can also provide insight into more elaborate chart combinations. Reading books covering declarative visualization or data visualization theory can deepen your understanding of these techniques. Lastly, online discussion forums and the Altair GitHub repository issues page can provide additional context, as well as examples from other users experiencing similar visualization requirements.

Although Altair does not have a direct method for bordering y-axis labels, by using a layered approach involving rectangle marks behind text, we can produce an effect which is generally very helpful. This approach requires understanding the rendering order and some creativity to position elements correctly, often utilizing custom data or transformations. While the border size may not be pixel-perfect based on actual text metrics, it provides a highly flexible method for enhancing readability and visual appeal.
