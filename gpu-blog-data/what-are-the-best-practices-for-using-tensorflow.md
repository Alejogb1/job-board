TensorFlow embeddings, when integrated with Estimators, necessitate a careful approach beyond the basic API to achieve optimal performance and model generalization. From my experience working on large-scale recommendation systems, I've observed that neglecting proper embedding configuration and handling can lead to both training instability and suboptimal results in production. Using categorical features, especially high-cardinality ones, without a robust embedding strategy effectively prevents the model from learning meaningful relationships.

The primary concern when working with embeddings within Estimators stems from managing the learned representation of discrete data. An embedding layer essentially transforms each categorical value into a dense vector, which is then fed into the subsequent layers of the neural network. A crucial aspect of these vector representations is their dimensionality; too low, and you risk losing critical information, resulting in underfitting; too high and the model can overfit or become computationally intractable. Choosing the embedding dimension therefore must be informed by the cardinality of the feature, the complexity of the problem, and the available computational resources. It's often necessary to experiment with different dimensions to find the sweet spot.

Within Estimators, embeddings are often implemented using `tf.feature_column.embedding_column`. This column definition then gets passed to the `input_layer` function which generates the embedding lookup operation during the model construction phase. One needs to account for more than just dimensional setting. Consider situations involving new, unseen values during inference. If a new category value appears that wasn’t observed during training, the embedding lookup will fail, leading to an unexpected error or a default embedding value being assigned (depending on the specifics of the API version used), which may degrade performance. Thus, one must consider incorporating an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) bucket, also sometimes referred to as the "unknown" bucket. This technique handles out-of-vocabulary or missing values by assigning them all to the same index of the embedding matrix.

Another aspect is handling embedding initialization. By default, the embedding matrix is initialized randomly, which, while sufficient in many cases, can sometimes hinder model convergence, especially with highly complex datasets. Pre-trained embeddings, such as those based on Word2Vec or GloVe when dealing with text data, can dramatically improve model performance by starting the training process with already meaningful feature representations. Furthermore, it’s crucial to maintain a consistent handling of embedding weights during training, which the Estimator manages internally. However, you, as the developer, must ensure they are properly utilized. For example, using regularizers on the embedding weights can prevent overfitting, and careful monitoring of the embedding weights during training can reveal potential issues such as saturation.

The Estimator’s `input_fn` plays a vital role too. It's responsible for converting the raw data into a format that TensorFlow can understand. When using high-cardinality categorical features, memory consumption is a significant concern. One must perform all data preprocessing steps carefully in order to keep memory usage as efficient as possible. For large datasets, using techniques like `tf.data` to build the input pipelines is necessary for efficient data loading and preprocessing.

Let's look at some specific code examples illustrating these points.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_feature_columns(vocabulary_size, embedding_dimension):
    """
    Creates feature columns including an embedding column for categorical data.

    Args:
        vocabulary_size: The total size of the categorical vocabulary.
        embedding_dimension: The size of the embedding vector.

    Returns:
        A list of feature columns including the embedding column.
    """
    # Feature column for a categorical feature
    categorical_column = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_identity(
        key="categorical_feature", num_buckets=vocabulary_size)

    # Embedding column for the categorical feature
    embedding_column = tf.feature_column.embedding_column(
        categorical_column=categorical_column, dimension=embedding_dimension)

    return [embedding_column]

def simple_model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
  """
    A basic model function demonstrating embedding use within an Estimator.

    Args:
        features: The input features to the model.
        labels: The ground-truth labels for training.
        mode:  Specifies the training, evaluation or prediction mode.
        params: A dictionary containing the model's hyper-parameters.

    Returns:
        EstimatorSpec defining the model's behavior.
  """
  feature_columns = create_feature_columns(params['vocabulary_size'],
                                          params['embedding_dimension'])

  input_layer = tf.feature_column.input_layer(features, feature_columns)

  dense = tf.layers.dense(inputs=input_layer, units=128, activation=tf.nn.relu)
  logits = tf.layers.dense(inputs=dense, units=2)

  predicted_classes = tf.argmax(logits, 1)

  if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT:
    predictions = {
        'classes': predicted_classes,
        'probabilities': tf.nn.softmax(logits)
    }
    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, predictions=predictions)

  loss = tf.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy(labels=labels, logits=logits)

  if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
    optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer()
    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, global_step=tf.train.get_global_step())
    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op)

  eval_metric_ops = {
      'accuracy': tf.metrics.accuracy(labels=labels,
                                      predictions=predicted_classes)
  }
  return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, loss=loss, eval_metric_ops=eval_metric_ops)
```

This example shows how to create a basic embedding and incorporate it into a simple Estimator model. The `create_feature_columns` function sets up the embedding column based on the feature's vocabulary size and the desired embedding dimension. The `simple_model_fn` shows how to use this feature column in a basic classification setting using a `input_layer`.

Here's another example demonstrating OOV handling with `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list`:

```python
def create_feature_columns_with_vocabulary(vocabulary_list, embedding_dimension):
    """
        Creates feature columns with a vocabulary list, handling out of vocabulary values.

    Args:
        vocabulary_list: List of known vocabulary terms.
        embedding_dimension: Size of embedding vector.

    Returns:
        List of feature columns that handle out of vocabulary values.
    """

    categorical_column = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(
        key="categorical_feature",
        vocabulary_list=vocabulary_list,
        num_oov_buckets=1
    )

    embedding_column = tf.feature_column.embedding_column(
        categorical_column=categorical_column, dimension=embedding_dimension)

    return [embedding_column]
```
In this example, using  `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list` and the `num_oov_buckets` parameter, new unseen categories will be automatically assigned to the out-of-vocabulary bucket. This prevents runtime errors during the inference phase.

Finally, consider the case of using a pre-trained embedding matrix. This would involve initializing the embedding weights with the loaded matrix. Although the following does not show the actual loading (since this is dependent on file format and specific needs), it demonstrates the process of providing the weights and not letting them be randomly initialized.

```python
def create_feature_columns_pre_trained(vocabulary_size, embedding_dimension, pre_trained_embedding_matrix):
    """
        Creates feature columns with a vocabulary list, handling out of vocabulary values.

    Args:
      vocabulary_size: size of vocabulary to use.
      embedding_dimension: the dimension of embedding vector.
      pre_trained_embedding_matrix: a numpy array containing pre-trained embedding matrix.

    Returns:
        List of feature columns that handle out of vocabulary values.
    """

    categorical_column = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_identity(
        key="categorical_feature", num_buckets=vocabulary_size)


    embedding_column = tf.feature_column.embedding_column(
        categorical_column=categorical_column, dimension=embedding_dimension,
        initializer=tf.constant_initializer(pre_trained_embedding_matrix)
      )

    return [embedding_column]
```

Here, the `initializer` argument within the `embedding_column` definition takes a `tf.constant_initializer` and preloads the embedding weights using the `pre_trained_embedding_matrix`, providing a starting point better than a random initialization. Note that the shape of `pre_trained_embedding_matrix` must match the intended vocabulary size and the embedding dimension being used.

For further exploration, the official TensorFlow documentation provides detailed information on feature columns, especially the various methods for creating categorical columns. The TensorFlow guide on data input pipelines also contains valuable insights regarding the efficient usage of `tf.data` for preprocessing and feeding data to the Estimator, as mentioned earlier. Consider searching on the tensorflow web site, and use search terms that focus on these points, along with  "Estimator", and "embedding". For more theoretical underpinnings of embeddings, reading about word embeddings used in NLP will be instructive to understanding how feature representations can improve performance.  Finally, reviewing research papers on recommended systems can provide concrete examples and best practices when dealing with categorical variables in real-world problems.
