The core issue lies in the fundamental design of `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization` when the `trainable` parameter is set to `False`.  Contrary to initial intuition, setting `trainable=False` does *not* simply freeze the layer's weights; it prevents the layer from participating in the backpropagation process entirely. This directly impacts the update mechanisms for the moving mean and variance statistics, which are inherently dependent on gradient updates.


My experience working on large-scale image classification models highlighted this subtle point repeatedly.  I encountered this during a project optimizing inference time.  The initial approach involved freezing all batch normalization layers via `trainable=False` to accelerate prediction. However, unexpected performance degradation resulted because the frozen batch normalization layers were not adapting to the distribution of the input data during inference. This underscored the critical distinction between weight freezing and the operational behavior of moving statistics updates within the layer.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization` calculates its moving mean and variance using exponential moving averages (EMA).  The update rules for these statistics are not directly coupled with the layer's weights (gamma and beta) but are indirectly affected by the training process. Specifically, during training, the batch statistics (mean and variance computed on the current mini-batch) are used to normalize the activations. These batch statistics contribute to the update of the moving averages.  The update equations are typically as follows:


`moving_mean = momentum * moving_mean + (1 - momentum) * batch_mean`
`moving_variance = momentum * moving_variance + (1 - momentum) * batch_variance`


where `momentum` is a hyperparameter controlling the weighting between the current batch statistics and the previous moving averages.

When `trainable=False`,  the entire layer is excluded from gradient calculations.  Consequently, the backpropagation algorithm never calculates the batch statistics. There is no `batch_mean` or `batch_variance` computed.  The update equations above become:

`moving_mean = momentum * moving_mean + (1 - momentum) * 0`
`moving_variance = momentum * moving_variance + (1 - momentum) * 0`

Leading to the moving mean and variance effectively stagnating; they only decay gradually towards zero due to the `momentum` factor.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Training with `trainable=True` (Moving statistics update)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(name='bn_layer'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

# Sample data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))


model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Access and print moving mean and variance
bn_layer = model.get_layer('bn_layer')
print("Moving mean:", bn_layer.moving_mean.numpy())
print("Moving variance:", bn_layer.moving_variance.numpy())
```

This example demonstrates the standard behavior. The moving mean and variance are updated during training because `trainable` defaults to `True`.


**Example 2: Inference with `trainable=False` (No update)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(name='bn_layer', trainable=False),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Load pre-trained weights (Assume weights exist)
model.load_weights("my_model_weights.h5")  #Replace with actual path if needed

# Sample data for inference
x_test = tf.random.normal((10, 10))

# Inference 
predictions = model.predict(x_test)

# Access and print moving mean and variance (No change expected)
bn_layer = model.get_layer('bn_layer')
print("Moving mean:", bn_layer.moving_mean.numpy())
print("Moving variance:", bn_layer.moving_variance.numpy())

```

Here, `trainable=False` prevents updates, even during the `predict` step.  The moving statistics retain their values from the training phase. The loaded weights ensure that the batch norm layer is initialized correctly prior to inference.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Decay with `trainable=False`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

bn = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(trainable=False)
momentum = bn.momentum.numpy()

# Initial values (replace with your specific values if needed)
moving_mean = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
moving_var = np.array([0.5, 1.0, 1.5])

# Simulate several inference steps
for _ in range(5):
    #No update, decay observed below
    new_moving_mean = momentum * moving_mean
    new_moving_var = momentum * moving_var
    print("Updated Moving Mean:", new_moving_mean)
    print("Updated Moving Variance:", new_moving_var)
    moving_mean = new_moving_mean
    moving_var = new_moving_var

```

This code manually demonstrates the decay effect on the moving statistics when no batch statistics are used for updates, simulating the behavior in a layer with `trainable=False`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization` provides comprehensive details on its parameters and behavior.  Furthermore, in-depth explanations of batch normalization and its intricacies can be found in various machine learning textbooks focusing on deep learning architectures.  Consider reviewing materials on exponential moving averages and their application in adaptive optimization algorithms for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  Finally, searching for  "Batch Normalization moving statistics update" in relevant research papers can offer more theoretical and practical insights.
