TensorFlow's `pow(x, y)` function's differentiability with respect to `y` depends critically on the values of both `x` and `y`, specifically focusing on the domain where the function is mathematically well-defined and continuous.  In my experience optimizing complex neural networks, overlooking this nuanced behavior frequently led to unexpected gradients and training instability. The crucial point is that while the power function is generally differentiable, edge cases involving negative bases and non-integer exponents introduce discontinuities necessitating careful handling.

**1. Explanation:**

The mathematical function f(x, y) = x<sup>y</sup> exhibits varying differentiability properties depending on the input values.  When x > 0, the function is differentiable with respect to y for all real y.  The partial derivative ∂f/∂y is given by:

∂f/∂y = x<sup>y</sup> * ln(x)

This derivative is well-defined and continuous for positive x.  However, when x ≤ 0, complications arise.

* **x = 0:**  If x = 0, and y > 0, then x<sup>y</sup> = 0. If y ≤ 0, the function is undefined.  TensorFlow will likely raise an error or produce a NaN (Not a Number) gradient in this case.

* **x < 0:** If x is negative and y is an integer, the function is defined and differentiable, but the derivative will depend on the integer exponent's parity (even or odd).  If y is not an integer,  x<sup>y</sup> may involve complex numbers, introducing complexities in differentiation.  For example, if x = -1 and y = 0.5, then x<sup>y</sup> = i (the imaginary unit), and defining a real-valued derivative becomes problematic within the context of a real-valued neural network. TensorFlow's automatic differentiation system will attempt to compute a gradient, but the results might not be numerically stable or meaningful in a practical training context.

Therefore, TensorFlow's automatic differentiation engine will attempt to compute a gradient, but the result's validity hinges entirely on the input range.  For positive x, the gradient calculation is straightforward and numerically sound.  However, for non-positive x, the gradient computation becomes mathematically challenging and prone to numerical instability, resulting in inaccurate or undefined gradients.  The specific behavior will also depend on the chosen automatic differentiation method (e.g., forward-mode or reverse-mode).

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate different scenarios using TensorFlow 2.x:

**Example 1: Positive Base**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant(2.0)  # Positive base
y = tf.Variable(3.0)  # Exponent

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  z = tf.pow(x, y)

dz_dy = tape.gradient(z, y)

print(f"x: {x.numpy()}, y: {y.numpy()}, z: {z.numpy()}, dz/dy: {dz_dy.numpy()}")
```

This example uses a positive base, ensuring a well-defined and accurate gradient. The output will be a numerically stable derivative consistent with the analytical solution.


**Example 2: Negative Base, Integer Exponent**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant(-2.0)  # Negative base
y = tf.Variable(3.0)   # Integer exponent

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  z = tf.pow(x, y)

dz_dy = tape.gradient(z, y)

print(f"x: {x.numpy()}, y: {y.numpy()}, z: {z.numpy()}, dz/dy: {dz_dy.numpy()}")
```

This code demonstrates a case with a negative base and an integer exponent. TensorFlow will compute a gradient, but the numerical stability is not guaranteed for all possible input values.  The accuracy will depend on the underlying implementation of `tf.pow` and the automatic differentiation algorithm.

**Example 3: Negative Base, Non-Integer Exponent**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant(-2.0) # Negative base
y = tf.Variable(0.5)  # Non-integer exponent

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  z = tf.pow(x, y)

dz_dy = tape.gradient(z, y)

print(f"x: {x.numpy()}, y: {y.numpy()}, z: {z.numpy()}, dz/dy: {dz_dy.numpy()}")
```

This example presents the most challenging scenario. The resulting `z` will involve complex numbers, leading to potential numerical instability and difficulties in obtaining a meaningful real-valued gradient.  The output may contain NaN values or produce unexpected results depending on TensorFlow's internal handling of complex numbers within the automatic differentiation process.  The computed gradient might not be consistent with expectations from real-valued calculus.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on automatic differentiation and gradient computation.  Furthermore, a comprehensive calculus textbook covering multivariate calculus and the theory of differentiation will be invaluable.  Finally,  numerical analysis literature addressing the stability and accuracy of numerical differentiation methods will provide critical context for interpreting the results obtained from these TensorFlow computations.  These resources will help to solidify the theoretical framework underlying the practical observations from the code examples.  Analyzing the source code of TensorFlow's `pow` function (if publicly available) would also offer valuable insights into its specific implementation details and handling of edge cases.
