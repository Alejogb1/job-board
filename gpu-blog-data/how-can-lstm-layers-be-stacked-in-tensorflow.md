Recurrent neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, gain enhanced modeling capabilities when stacked. This technique allows the network to learn hierarchical representations of sequential data, often leading to improved performance in tasks such as natural language processing and time series forecasting. Stacking, however, isn't a trivial concatenation; each layer must correctly propagate its output as the input to the subsequent layer, and TensorFlow provides specific mechanisms for this.

I’ve implemented numerous sequence-to-sequence models involving stacked LSTMs for tasks ranging from stock price prediction to dialogue generation, and the core concept is consistent: you are essentially creating a network of LSTM cells where each layer processes the output of the previous layer. This is distinct from merely increasing the number of hidden units within a single LSTM layer. The stacking creates deeper, more nuanced representations as the data moves through the network.

The crucial consideration lies in the `return_sequences` parameter of the `tf.keras.layers.LSTM` layer. By default, an LSTM layer outputs only the final hidden state of the sequence. This single vector is appropriate when you're using the LSTM as an encoder and need just a summary of the input sequence. However, when stacking LSTMs, we need each LSTM layer to output the entire sequence of hidden states, as each time step's information is relevant to the next layer. Setting `return_sequences=True` ensures that the LSTM layer returns a 3D tensor of shape `(batch_size, timesteps, features)`, instead of a 2D tensor. This tensor is then fed into the next LSTM layer. The final layer in the stack, or the layer directly connected to the output layer (e.g., a Dense layer), typically does *not* need `return_sequences=True` unless the subsequent layer processes the sequence output.

Consider the following illustrative code snippet.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input shape: (batch_size, timesteps, features)
input_shape = (None, 10, 1) # Time series data, 10 timesteps, 1 feature

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=32, return_sequences=True), # Output: (batch_size, timesteps, 32)
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True), # Output: (batch_size, timesteps, 64)
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=128),                       # Output: (batch_size, 128) - last hidden state
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1)                        # Output: (batch_size, 1) - single prediction
])

model.summary()

# Generate dummy input
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((32, 10, 1))  # Batch of 32 sequences
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output.shape) # Output Shape: (32, 1)
```

Here, the input is a time series, with each sequence being composed of 10 time steps and a single feature. The initial LSTM layer with 32 units processes the input sequence, and because `return_sequences` is set to True, it outputs a sequence of hidden states, each with 32 features. The subsequent LSTM layer with 64 units takes this output as input. This process is repeated. The final LSTM layer, with 128 units, does not need to return sequences, because its output is fed directly into a Dense layer, which produces a single numeric prediction. The model summary will show the architecture including the output shapes from each layer.

Now, suppose we are dealing with a sequence to sequence problem like machine translation or sequence generation. In such scenarios, we might need to output sequences and not a single value. In this case, the last LSTM layer also requires `return_sequences = True` and we often connect it to a time-distributed dense layer.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input shape: (batch_size, timesteps, features)
input_shape = (None, 20, 10) # Time series data, 20 timesteps, 10 features

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(20, 10)),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=128, return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=32, return_sequences=True), # Return sequences for time distributed output
    tf.keras.layers.TimeDistributed(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=15)), # Output: (batch_size, timesteps, 15)
    tf.keras.layers.Activation('sigmoid') # Output between 0 and 1
])

model.summary()
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((32, 20, 10))  # Batch of 32 sequences
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output.shape)  # Output shape (32, 20, 15)
```

The key difference in this example is the `TimeDistributed` layer after the stacked LSTMs. This layer applies the same `Dense` layer at each time step of the output from the last LSTM layer. The `Activation` layer forces an output between 0 and 1. Therefore, the output of this network has the shape `(batch_size, timesteps, output_features)`.

Finally, it's worth illustrating how to explicitly pass the state between layers, as sometimes required for more complex use cases. While not always necessary with the sequential API, manually handling the state can provide finer control, particularly when creating encoder-decoder architectures. This approach allows us to use the output hidden state and cell state of one LSTM and pass it to subsequent ones.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input shape: (batch_size, timesteps, features)
input_shape = (None, 10, 5)  # 10 timesteps, 5 features

inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10, 5))

lstm1 = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
output1, state_h1, state_c1 = lstm1(inputs)

lstm2 = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=128, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
output2, state_h2, state_c2 = lstm2(output1, initial_state=[state_h1,state_c1])

lstm3 = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=256) # No return sequences, only last hidden state
output3 = lstm3(output2)


output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1)

outputs = output_layer(output3)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

model.summary()

dummy_input = tf.random.normal((32, 10, 5))
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output.shape)  #Output shape (32,1)
```

Here we're using the functional API. Crucially, we set `return_state=True` for the first two LSTM layers. This causes the layer to output not just the sequence of hidden states, but also the final hidden state (`state_h1`) and the final cell state (`state_c1`). These states become the `initial_state` argument for the next LSTM layer. This pattern allows for the creation of sophisticated stateful LSTM networks. By explicitly controlling the passing of states, one gains greater flexibility in architectures. Note the last LSTM layer doesn't use `return_sequences=True` or `return_state=True`, since its output feeds directly to a Dense layer, and only the last hidden state is used.

For further reading, TensorFlow’s official documentation for the `tf.keras.layers.LSTM` layer is indispensable. Detailed tutorials focused on RNNs and time series modeling using Keras can also provide useful insight. Academic articles covering advanced RNN architectures, particularly those delving into encoder-decoder networks with attention mechanisms, can offer deeper theoretical understanding. Consider exploring literature on natural language processing that often employs stacked LSTMs as a fundamental building block. Books on deep learning, which contain entire chapters dedicated to sequence models, are also beneficial resources.
