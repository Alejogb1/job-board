The absence of `output.grad` after calling `loss.backward()` in PyTorch is frequently due to a disconnect between the computational graph's construction and the `requires_grad` attribute of the tensors involved.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, particularly those involving complex neural network architectures and custom loss functions, points to several recurring causes.  This lack of gradients isn't necessarily an error; rather, it reflects a specific state within the automatic differentiation mechanism PyTorch employs.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's automatic differentiation relies on the computational graph built dynamically.  Each operation applied to a tensor with `requires_grad=True` adds a node to this graph, recording the operation and its inputs. When `loss.backward()` is invoked, PyTorch traverses this graph backward, computing gradients for each tensor participating in the computation leading to the loss.  The absence of `output.grad` indicates that `output` was not part of this graph, or that the gradient calculation was prevented by a specific setting or operation.

Several factors contribute to this outcome:

* **`requires_grad=False`:**  The most common cause. If the tensor `output` was created from tensors with `requires_grad=False`, or if `output.requires_grad_()` was never called, then PyTorch will not compute its gradient.  The backward pass simply skips over nodes associated with tensors lacking this flag.

* **`detach()` operation:** The `detach()` method creates a new tensor that is detached from the computational graph.  Any operations performed on this detached tensor will not contribute to the gradients of preceding tensors in the graph. If `output` is a result of operations involving a detached tensor, its gradient will be `None`.

* **`with torch.no_grad():` context:** Operations performed within a `torch.no_grad()` block are excluded from gradient computation.  If the calculation of `output` happens within such a block, it will not participate in the backward pass.

* **Incorrect loss function:** Although less frequent, an improperly defined custom loss function might inadvertently prevent gradient propagation to certain tensors.  Thorough inspection of the loss function's calculation is crucial in these scenarios.

* **In-place operations:**  While not always the culprit, excessive use of in-place operations (e.g., `+=`, `-=`) can sometimes interfere with the gradient computation.  While PyTorch largely supports in-place operations, it's safer to avoid them when possible, especially in complex models to maintain graph integrity.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: `requires_grad=False`**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=False)
w = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)

output = torch.mm(x, w) + b  # Output won't have grad because x doesn't require it

loss = output.sum()
loss.backward()

print(output.grad)  # Output: None
print(w.grad)      # Output: A tensor (gradients are computed for w)
```

In this example, `x` lacks `requires_grad=True`.  The matrix multiplication propagates this attribute, preventing the computation of `output.grad`.

**Example 2: `detach()` operation**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
w = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)

intermediate = torch.mm(x, w)
detached_intermediate = intermediate.detach()
output = detached_intermediate + b

loss = output.sum()
loss.backward()

print(output.grad)  # Output: None
print(x.grad)       # Output: A tensor (gradients are computed for x, before detaching)
```

Here, `detach()` creates a new tensor independent of the computational graph.  Gradients are not propagated backward through `detached_intermediate`.

**Example 3: `torch.no_grad()` context**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
w = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)

with torch.no_grad():
    intermediate = torch.mm(x, w)
    output = intermediate + b

loss = output.sum()
loss.backward()

print(output.grad)  # Output: None
print(x.grad)       # Output: None (No gradients were computed inside the context)
```

The `torch.no_grad()` context explicitly prevents gradient tracking for operations within it, leading to `output.grad` being `None`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I strongly advise consulting the official PyTorch documentation on automatic differentiation.  Thoroughly review the sections on computational graphs, the `requires_grad` attribute, and the behavior of functions like `detach()` and `torch.no_grad()`.  Additionally, examining the PyTorch source code, specifically the modules involved in automatic differentiation, can offer valuable insights for advanced users. Carefully study examples provided in tutorials focusing on custom loss functions and complex network architectures; these will illustrate best practices to ensure gradient propagation.  Finally,  understanding the concept of computational graphs in the context of automatic differentiation, beyond PyTorch's specific implementation, will significantly enhance troubleshooting abilities.
