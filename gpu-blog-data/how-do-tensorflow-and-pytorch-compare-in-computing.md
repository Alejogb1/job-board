TensorFlow and PyTorch, while both powerful deep learning frameworks, diverge significantly in their approaches to gradient computation, affecting usability and performance. Having spent several years migrating models between these two platforms, I've observed that the fundamental difference lies in their graph construction methodologies: TensorFlow uses a static graph, while PyTorch employs a dynamic, define-by-run approach. This impacts how gradients are calculated and managed.

TensorFlow, prior to Eager Execution becoming prominent, relied on a computational graph that was defined first and then executed. This static graph requires that all operations be symbolically described before any numerical calculations commence. When training a model, TensorFlow internally maintains a separate graph dedicated to calculating gradients. These gradients are derived by applying the chain rule backward through the forward computation graph. This reverse-mode automatic differentiation requires that TensorFlow track dependencies and intermediate tensors involved in the forward pass, using this information to determine derivatives during backpropagation. Once the forward pass is complete, the backward pass proceeds along the gradient computation graph which is an auxiliary graph, constructed automatically by Tensorflow. Since all operations are specified in advance within the graph, TensorFlow can perform several optimizations before execution, like kernel fusion and graph pruning, potentially leading to faster training times on dedicated hardware. However, it can also make debugging and experimentation more challenging, as modifying the graph requires rebuilding it from scratch. This rigidity used to require a firm grasp of TensorFlow's low-level APIs like sessions and placeholders, something that has been mitigated significantly by Eager Execution. Eager Execution fundamentally changes TensorFlow's behavior, making it dynamic. While many prefer eager execution it is still fundamentally different from Pytorch's approach to gradient computation.

PyTorch, conversely, adopts a dynamic graph methodology, often termed "define-by-run" or "tape-based." The computational graph in PyTorch is implicitly defined during the execution of the forward pass. As each operation is performed on tensors, PyTorch records these operations on a tape, maintaining information necessary to compute gradients. Gradients are determined using the same reverse-mode automatic differentiation as in TensorFlow. However, since the graph is constructed on the fly, PyTorch allows for more flexibility in code structure and facilitates more intuitive debugging. The lack of a pre-defined static graph means the framework does not need to reconstruct it whenever changes are made, enabling interactive experimentation and easier implementation of complex control flow statements within the model itself. As the graph is not statically optimized ahead of time, performance benefits can sometimes trail static graph systems, however the ease of debugging usually more than makes up for this. This dynamism makes it considerably easier to implement dynamic neural architectures.

Let's examine some concrete code examples to illustrate these differences. First, consider a simple linear regression model implemented in both frameworks and then specifically focusing on their gradient calculations.

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression**

```python
# TensorFlow (Eager Execution assumed)
import tensorflow as tf

# Parameters
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1, 1], 0, 0.1), dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), dtype=tf.float32)

# Loss function
def loss(y_pred, y_true):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y_true))

# Training step
@tf.function
def train_step(x, y_true):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
        loss_val = loss(y_pred, y_true)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss_val, [W, b])
    W.assign_sub(0.01 * gradients[0])
    b.assign_sub(0.01 * gradients[1])
    return loss_val

# Dummy data
x = tf.constant([[1], [2], [3], [4]], dtype=tf.float32)
y_true = tf.constant([[2], [4], [5], [8]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Training Loop
for i in range(100):
    l = train_step(x, y_true)
    if (i+1) % 20 == 0:
        print(f'Iteration: {i+1}, loss = {l}')


```

In this TensorFlow example, while utilizing Eager Execution, the `tf.GradientTape` explicitly creates a recording of the operations within the `train_step` function. The gradient method of this tape is then used to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the trainable parameters. Eager execution allows us to trace this graph in a manner closer to standard Python programming.

Now, consider the PyTorch equivalent:

```python
# PyTorch
import torch

# Parameters
W = torch.randn(1, 1, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.zeros(1, requires_grad=True)

# Loss function
def loss(y_pred, y_true):
    return torch.mean((y_pred - y_true)**2)

# Training Step
def train_step(x, y_true, learning_rate=0.01):
    y_pred = torch.matmul(x, W) + b
    loss_val = loss(y_pred, y_true)
    loss_val.backward() # Calculate Gradients

    with torch.no_grad():
        W.sub_(learning_rate * W.grad)
        b.sub_(learning_rate * b.grad)
        W.grad.zero_()
        b.grad.zero_()
    return loss_val

# Dummy Data
x = torch.tensor([[1], [2], [3], [4]], dtype=torch.float32)
y_true = torch.tensor([[2], [4], [5], [8]], dtype=torch.float32)

# Training Loop
for i in range(100):
    l = train_step(x, y_true)
    if (i+1) % 20 == 0:
        print(f'Iteration: {i+1}, loss = {l}')
```

In the PyTorch example, notice that gradients are computed implicitly by calling `loss_val.backward()`. PyTorch dynamically constructs the computational graph based on the operations performed on tensors which have the `requires_grad` attribute set to true. The `.backward()` function computes the gradients and stores them in the `.grad` attribute of the tensors on which the backward pass was calculated. We then zero these gradients to prevent their accumulation on each iteration.

This contrast highlights the core difference. TensorFlow uses a `GradientTape` to capture the operations in order to derive the gradient calculation graph when using eager execution. Without eager execution the computation graph would need to be statically defined. PyTorch automatically builds the graph as operations are executed. This difference becomes more pronounced when dealing with complex models with loops and conditional branches.

**Example 2: Using a Custom Training Loop with branching**

```python
# TensorFlow (Eager Execution)
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dummy Data
x = tf.random.normal((10, 5), dtype=tf.float32)
y_true = tf.random.normal((10, 2), dtype=tf.float32)

# Parameters
W1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((5, 4), dtype=tf.float32), dtype=tf.float32)
b1 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((4,), dtype=tf.float32), dtype=tf.float32)
W2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((4, 2), dtype=tf.float32), dtype=tf.float32)
b2 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((2,), dtype=tf.float32), dtype=tf.float32)

# Model
def model(x, training):
    out = tf.matmul(x, W1) + b1
    out = tf.nn.relu(out)
    if training:
      out = tf.nn.dropout(out, 0.5) # example of a branching logic
    out = tf.matmul(out, W2) + b2
    return out

# Loss function
def loss(y_pred, y_true):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred))

# Training step
@tf.function
def train_step(x, y_true):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x, training=True)
    loss_val = loss(y_pred, y_true)

  gradients = tape.gradient(loss_val, [W1, b1, W2, b2])
  learning_rate = 0.001
  W1.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[0])
  b1.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[1])
  W2.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[2])
  b2.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[3])
  return loss_val


# Training Loop
for epoch in range(10):
    loss_val = train_step(x, y_true)
    if (epoch + 1) % 5 == 0:
      print(f"Epoch: {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss_val}")


```
```python
# PyTorch
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Dummy Data
x = torch.randn(10, 5, dtype=torch.float32)
y_true = torch.randn(10, 2, dtype=torch.float32)

# Model
class MyModel(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.W1 = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5, 4))
    self.b1 = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(4))
    self.W2 = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(4, 2))
    self.b2 = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(2))
    self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)

  def forward(self, x, training=True):
    out = torch.matmul(x, self.W1) + self.b1
    out = self.relu(out)
    if training:
      out = self.dropout(out)
    out = torch.matmul(out, self.W2) + self.b2
    return out

# Loss function
def loss(y_pred, y_true):
    return torch.mean((y_pred - y_true)**2)


# Training step
model = MyModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

def train_step(x, y_true, model):
    y_pred = model(x, training=True)
    loss_val = loss(y_pred, y_true)
    optimizer.zero_grad() # zero accumulated gradient
    loss_val.backward() # Compute Gradients
    optimizer.step()
    return loss_val

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(10):
  loss_val = train_step(x, y_true, model)
  if (epoch + 1) % 5 == 0:
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss_val}")
```
This example demonstrates how both frameworks handle conditional logic in the forward pass and its impact on gradients. The training parameter is passed into the model so that if dropout can be included during training but excluded at test time. In the TensorFlow example we again use `tf.GradientTape` to capture gradients whereas Pytorch does this implicitly. Note the PyTorch example uses an optimizer from `torch.optim` which is the more commonly used way of updating weights in PyTorch.

**Example 3: Higher-Order Derivatives**

Neither example above needed to calculate higher order derivatives. But both TensorFlow (with Eager Execution or otherwise) and PyTorch support calculation of higher order derivatives using nested tape contexts.  The details will differ across the frameworks but the conceptual logic is the same.

```python
# TensorFlow Example
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0, dtype=tf.float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape1:
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape2:
        y = x * x * x # y = x**3
    dy_dx = tape2.gradient(y, x) # dy/dx = 3x**2
d2y_dx2 = tape1.gradient(dy_dx, x) # d2y/dx2 = 6x

print(f"f(x) = x**3, where x = 2.0:")
print(f"dy/dx = {dy_dx.numpy()}") # Result will be 12.0
print(f"d2y/dx2 = {d2y_dx2.numpy()}") # Result will be 12.0


```
```python
# PyTorch Example
import torch

x = torch.tensor(2.0, dtype=torch.float32, requires_grad=True)
y = x * x * x # y = x**3

dy_dx = torch.autograd.grad(y, x, create_graph=True)[0] # dy/dx = 3x**2
d2y_dx2 = torch.autograd.grad(dy_dx, x)[0] # d2y/dx2 = 6x

print(f"f(x) = x**3, where x = 2.0:")
print(f"dy/dx = {dy_dx.item()}") # Result will be 12.0
print(f"d2y/dx2 = {d2y_dx2.item()}") # Result will be 12.0

```

In both cases, we have used nested scopes or functions to derive higher order derivatives. Note that Pytorch requires that the `create_graph` argument to `torch.autograd.grad` be set to true to allow differentiation of the gradient calculation.

In summary, TensorFlow's static graph approach, even with Eager Execution, requires a more explicit graph definition, leading to potential performance benefits but possibly increasing the difficulty in debugging. PyTorch's dynamic approach, where the graph is constructed on the fly, prioritizes flexibility, readability, and interactive debugging. Both platforms effectively implement reverse-mode automatic differentiation, allowing us to focus on the high-level design of our models.

For further learning on automatic differentiation, resources on the underlying mathematics of reverse-mode automatic differentiation can be beneficial. Additionally, studying documentation of both frameworks is essential for practical use. There are many books discussing deep learning concepts in detail which should include the nuances of these gradient calculation methods. Finally, I would recommend going through any well regarded introductory courses covering deep learning since these should include a detailed treatment of backpropagation.
