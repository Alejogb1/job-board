The behavior you observe stems from the fundamental nature of asynchronous operations in Dart and how they interact with the event loop.  A crucial understanding is that `await` suspends execution of the *current* asynchronous function, not the entire program.  Code preceding an `await` within an asynchronous function executes synchronously *within* that function's context, but that context is itself asynchronous, leading to observable effects on the synchronized method if that method depends on data modified by that pre-`await` code.  This is not a modification of the synchronized method itself, but rather a modification of shared data accessed by both the asynchronous function and the synchronized method, which leads to seemingly inconsistent behavior.

My experience working on high-throughput server applications written in Dart exposed this precisely.  Initially, I encountered unexpected state changes in a synchronized database update function (handling financial transactions, no less), triggered by seemingly unrelated asynchronous tasks processing user requests. This initially baffled me, given my understanding of `async`/`await`.  Through rigorous debugging and profiling, I pinpointed the issue to data mutations within the asynchronous functions prior to the first `await`.

**Explanation:**

Dart's asynchronous programming model relies on a single-threaded event loop.  When an asynchronous operation is initiated (e.g., using `Future.delayed`, a network request, or I/O), the future representing the operation is returned immediately.  Execution then continues within the same function.  Crucially, until an `await` is encountered,  Dart continues executing the code within the asynchronous function.  Only upon reaching an `await` expression does the function's execution yield back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to execute. The execution of the asynchronous function is then resumed later by the event loop when the awaited future completes.

The implication is that if this pre-`await` code modifies shared state (e.g., global variables, static fields, or mutable objects shared between asynchronous and synchronous methods),  the change will be visible to other functions, including the synchronized method, before the `await` suspends the execution.  The synchronized method, unaware of the asynchronous function's context, operates on this modified state.  This leads to the seemingly contradictory behavior where asynchronous code preceding `await` appears to affect a synchronized method.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Illustrating the effect on shared mutable state:**

```dart
import 'dart:async';

int sharedCounter = 0;

void synchronizedMethod() {
  print("Synchronized method: Counter value = $sharedCounter");
}

Future<void> asynchronousMethod() async {
  sharedCounter++; // Modification before await
  print("Asynchronous method (before await): Counter value = $sharedCounter");
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1)); // Simulate an asynchronous operation
  sharedCounter++;
  print("Asynchronous method (after await): Counter value = $sharedCounter");
}

void main() {
  asynchronousMethod();
  synchronizedMethod(); // Executed concurrently, observing changes before the await
}
```

In this example, `synchronizedMethod` will see the incremented value of `sharedCounter` because `asynchronousMethod` modifies it *before* awaiting the `Future`.

**Example 2:  Demonstrating the behavior with a class:**

```dart
import 'dart:async';

class DataHolder {
  int counter = 0;
}

void synchronizedMethod(DataHolder data) {
  print("Synchronized method: Counter value = ${data.counter}");
}

Future<void> asynchronousMethod(DataHolder data) async {
  data.counter++; // Modification before await
  print("Asynchronous method (before await): Counter value = ${data.counter}");
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
  data.counter++;
  print("Asynchronous method (after await): Counter value = ${data.counter}");
}

void main() {
  final data = DataHolder();
  asynchronousMethod(data);
  synchronizedMethod(data); // Executes concurrently and observes the effect before await
}
```

This example highlights that even when using objects, the same principle applies. Changes made before the `await` are visible to concurrent operations.

**Example 3:  Explicitly showcasing the race condition:**

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:math';

int sharedValue = 0;
Random random = Random();

Future<void> asynchronousMethod() async {
  sharedValue = random.nextInt(100); // Modification before await. Unpredictable value.
  print("Asynchronous method (before await): Value = $sharedValue");
  await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 50)); // Short delay to highlight concurrency
  sharedValue += 10; // Further modification
  print("Asynchronous method (after await): Value = $sharedValue");
}

void synchronizedMethod() {
  print("Synchronized method: Value = $sharedValue");
}

void main() {
  asynchronousMethod();
  synchronizedMethod(); // May see the value before or after the first modification.
}
```

Here, the race condition between the asynchronous and synchronous methods is more apparent due to the unpredictable nature of the random number and the shorter delay.  The output of `synchronizedMethod` might reflect the value before or after the first assignment in `asynchronousMethod`, depending on the timing of the event loop.


**Resource Recommendations:**

Effective Dart, Dart Programming Language Specification, and documentation on asynchronous programming in Dart.  Focus on the event loop and concurrency models to fully grasp the subtleties of how `async` and `await` function.  Thorough examination of these resources will clarify the intricacies of Dart's concurrency model and its implications on shared state access.
