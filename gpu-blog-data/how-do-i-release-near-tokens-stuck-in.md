The core problem in releasing NEAR tokens locked in a staking pool due to a key issue stems from the fundamental design of NEAR's delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) mechanism.  Specifically, the inability to access funds often arises from a compromised, lost, or improperly managed validator key, not necessarily a fault within the staking pool itself.  My experience working with NEAR's infrastructure over the past three years troubleshooting similar situations has highlighted the critical role of key management in avoiding this predicament.  While there's no single solution, the approach depends heavily on the specific nature of the key issue.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Releasing NEAR tokens requires the correct cryptographic keys authorized to perform the unstaking action.  In a typical NEAR staking scenario, a user delegates their tokens to a validator node.  This validator node operates using a private key that authorizes transactions affecting the delegated tokens. If this key is compromised, lost, or otherwise inaccessible, the user cannot directly initiate the unstaking process.  The complexity arises because the NEAR blockchain's security model relies heavily on the irretrievability of private keys.  Attempts to circumvent this security could introduce vulnerabilities to the entire network.  Therefore, recovering access depends on identifying the root cause of the key inaccessibility.

There are three primary scenarios to consider:

* **Compromised Key:** A malicious actor gained access to the private key.  This requires immediate action to secure any remaining assets and potentially reporting the incident to the NEAR Foundation.  The compromised key must be immediately revoked and replaced.

* **Lost Key:** The private key is simply lost or forgotten.  This is a common occurrence, but unfortunately, without proper backups, recovery is virtually impossible.  The tokens are effectively lost.

* **Key Management Error:**  Incorrect procedures during key generation, storage, or rotation have resulted in an inaccessible key.  This highlights a failure in operational security and underlines the importance of best practices in managing cryptographic keys.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how key management impacts unstaking. These examples are simplified for demonstration purposes and do not represent the full complexity of the NEAR SDK.  They are intended to show conceptual interactions.  In real-world applications, you’d interact with the NEAR SDK using established libraries within a suitable programming environment (e.g., Javascript, Rust).

**Example 1: Successful Unstaking (with functional key)**

This example showcases the standard process of unstaking using a correctly managed key.  Error handling is omitted for brevity.

```javascript
// Assume 'near' is a properly initialized NEAR API instance.
// 'accountId' is your account ID, 'validatorId' is the validator you staked with.

const unstakeAmount = '10'; // Amount to unstake

near.account(accountId).functionCall(
    validatorId,
    'unstake',
    { amount: unstakeAmount },
    1000000000000000, // Gas limit
    1000000000000000 // Attached deposit (Adjust as needed)
)
.then(result => {
    console.log('Unstaking transaction successful:', result);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error('Unstaking failed:', error);
});

```

**Example 2: Failed Unstaking (incorrect key)**

This example demonstrates the error that results from using an incorrect or inaccessible key. The `near` instance would either fail to connect or return an error related to signature verification.

```javascript
// Attempting to unstake with an incorrect key would fail at the signature verification stage.
// The NEAR network would reject the transaction due to an invalid signature.

// ... (same code structure as Example 1) ...
// ... however, the provided key during near initialization is incorrect ...
// ... this will result in an error related to signature verification failure within the .then or .catch block.
```

**Example 3:  Illustrative Key Rotation (Prevention, not recovery)**

This example showcases a crucial aspect of proactive key management—rotation.  Replacing keys regularly mitigates risks associated with compromised keys. This example is conceptual and would need adaptation based on the specific NEAR SDK version.

```javascript
//  Conceptual example; actual implementation requires use of the NEAR SDK and secure key management systems.

//  Function to rotate the validator key (This is highly simplified and illustrative).
function rotateValidatorKey(currentKey, newKey) {
    // 1. Verify the authority of the currentKey to perform the key rotation.
    // 2. Update the validator's configuration with the newKey.
    // 3. Verify that the newKey can successfully sign transactions.
    // 4.  Log the successful key rotation event, including timestamps and key hashes.
    // 5. Securely destroy the currentKey.
}

// Invoke the key rotation:
rotateValidatorKey(oldValidatorKey, newValidatorKey);
```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official NEAR documentation.  Familiarize yourself with best practices for secure key management and cryptographic operations.  Engage with NEAR's community forums and support channels for assistance and peer-to-peer problem-solving.  Thoroughly review the documentation related to the specific staking pool you’re using, as individual pool providers might have unique instructions or procedures for handling key-related issues.  Seek guidance from experienced blockchain developers and security experts if you encounter complex key management issues.  Remember, preventing key issues through robust practices is far more effective than attempting recovery after a loss.  Always maintain multiple backups of your keys, following industry best practices for key storage and rotation.  Never share your private keys with anyone.
