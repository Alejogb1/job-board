TensorFlow, unlike NumPy, requires careful consideration when modifying tensors in place, especially when targeting specific elements via a sequence of indices. Directly assigning elements via index sequences using the standard Pythonic approach results in an error because TensorFlow tensors are immutable after creation. Instead, TensorFlow relies on operations that produce new tensors, reflecting the desired modification, without altering the original. This involves using `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` or other related operations, which creates a new tensor from an existing one, with selectively updated elements specified by indices.

Specifically, if I'm aiming to modify specific elements based on a sequence of indices, I can utilize `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`. This function accepts three arguments: the initial tensor, a set of indices representing the locations of modification, and the corresponding values to be assigned to those locations. The critical aspect is that indices are specified as a tensor of shape `(N, K)`, where `N` is the number of updates, and `K` is the rank of the target tensor. For instance, in a 2D tensor, each index will be a pair of numbers. The values also have a specific structure, typically a tensor of shape `(N, ...)`, where `...` matches the rank of a single element of the target tensor. In the case of modifications to individual elements, the shape of values is `(N,)`.

I encountered a practical scenario in a previous project involving neural network output manipulation. During the post-processing phase of a segmentation model, I needed to selectively alter certain predicted class probabilities based on secondary processing rules. Naively attempting in-place modification threw a series of errors. This experience drove home the necessity of understanding TensorFlowâ€™s tensor immutability.

Here are three code examples that demonstrate various aspects of element assignment using index sequences within TensorFlow:

**Example 1: Modifying elements in a 1D tensor.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial tensor
initial_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=tf.int32)

# Indices for modification
indices = tf.constant([[0], [2], [4]], dtype=tf.int32)

# New values
updates = tf.constant([10, 30, 50], dtype=tf.int32)

# Apply tensor_scatter_nd_update
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(initial_tensor, indices, updates)

# The updated tensor will be [10, 2, 30, 4, 50]
print(updated_tensor.numpy())
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates modifying three specific elements of a 1D tensor. The `indices` tensor specifies the positions to be modified using column vectors (e.g. `[0]` addresses the element at index 0). The corresponding new values are provided by the `updates` tensor. `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` creates a copy of `initial_tensor` where these positions have been updated with new values. This exemplifies that operations are done by copying rather than direct modification. The resulting tensor is the same as initial tensor except for those changes.

**Example 2: Modifying elements in a 2D tensor.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial tensor
initial_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Indices for modification
indices = tf.constant([[0, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1]], dtype=tf.int32)

# New values
updates = tf.constant([10, 60, 80], dtype=tf.int32)

# Apply tensor_scatter_nd_update
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(initial_tensor, indices, updates)

# The updated tensor will be [[10, 2, 3], [4, 5, 60], [7, 80, 9]]
print(updated_tensor.numpy())
```

*Commentary:* Here the index tensor is now of rank 2, representing the row and column of the target. For example `[0,0]` refers to row 0, column 0 in the target `initial_tensor` and its value is changed to `10`. Similarly the index `[1, 2]` addresses row 1 column 2 and its value is changed to `60`.. The values tensor is again of rank 1 because we are updating individual elements. The same pattern applies to higher dimensional tensors.

**Example 3: Modifying blocks within a higher-rank tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial Tensor (3D)
initial_tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]],
                            [[5, 6], [7, 8]],
                            [[9, 10], [11, 12]]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Indices for modification, targeting entire sub-tensors
indices = tf.constant([[0, 0], [1, 1]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Values to assign
updates = tf.constant([[[100, 200], [300, 400]],
                         [[500, 600], [700, 800]]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Applying tensor_scatter_nd_update
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(initial_tensor, indices, updates)

# The updated tensor will be [[[100, 200], [300, 400]],
#                          [[5, 6], [500, 600]],
#                          [[9, 10], [11, 12]]]
print(updated_tensor.numpy())
```

*Commentary:* In this example, the `indices` specify whole subtensors that are to be replaced. The `updates` tensor is of shape `(N, 2, 2)` which means that the update values have the same shape as the elements to be replaced. For instance, index `[0, 0]` of `indices` corresponds to element `initial_tensor[0,0]` which is a sub tensor equal to `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`. The corresponding values tensor is `[[[100, 200], [300, 400]]]` with shape `(1, 2, 2)` which is correctly paired with `indices[0,0]`. Similarly index `[1,1]` corresponds to the element at `initial_tensor[1, 1]`, which is the sub tensor `[[7, 8]]` with values updated from `[[[500, 600], [700, 800]]]`. In this case the `updates` are higher rank. This exemplifies the generality of `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` when used with higher ranks.

In summary, `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` stands as a fundamental operation for assigning elements within a TensorFlow tensor using an index sequence. The key distinction from Python's standard list modification lies in the immutability of TensorFlow tensors and the resultant generation of a new tensor following modification. Understanding the data structures involved in each tensor argument (particularly the indices tensor and the values tensor) is critical.

For further exploration, I would recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on tensor manipulation functions, specifically around `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`, `tf.scatter_nd`, and related operations. Studying the concept of tensor immutability in the context of TensorFlow is also crucial. Resources that cover the nuances of TensorFlow's execution model will further enhance understanding of why these operations are designed as they are, particularly the graph based execution approach.
