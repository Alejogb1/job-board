Directly addressing the issue: I've encountered situations requiring multiple traversals of Map values, a seemingly straightforward task that can become nuanced when performance and code clarity are paramount. While a single iteration over a `Map`'s values using `map.values()` is simple, subsequent iterations necessitate careful consideration to avoid inefficiencies. The critical fact is that `map.values()` returns a *view* of the values, not a distinct collection. This view is backed by the original map, implying modifications to the map directly affect the view, and the iterator provided by `values()` is only suitable for single sequential traversal.

Fundamentally, achieving two iterations over a `Map`'s values in Java without re-querying the map can be accomplished in a few principal ways, each exhibiting different trade-offs with respect to memory consumption, speed, and code elegance. The first method involves creating a new `Collection` containing the values using the `ArrayList` constructor, while the second leverages Java 8's streams API and `Collectors.toList()`. A third, less performant, approach involves the `forEach` method.

**Explanation**

The core challenge lies in the nature of the `map.values()` return. It's not an independent container of values. Calling `map.values()` multiple times generates new *views* tied to the underlying map. The consequence is that, while iterating the view is possible, you can not repeatedly iterate the same iterator, because it cannot be reset to start over. Similarly, the view is not stable. If other threads or operations modify the `Map`, the state of the view becomes unpredictable.

Therefore, if a second iteration is necessary, one needs to either re-access the `values()` and start from the beginning, or create an independent copy. The trade-offs between these approaches lie in performance and memory usage.

Creating an independent copy using the `ArrayList` constructor results in a new data structure that consumes additional memory, equivalent in size to the number of values in the map. This approach offers good performance for repeated iterations because the copied `ArrayList` is a concrete, independent collection, offering multiple ways to traverse it independently.

Utilizing Java 8's Streams API, specifically `map.values().stream().collect(Collectors.toList())`, achieves a similar outcome. This stream-based solution is often considered more concise and readable and, internally, performs essentially the same copying operation.

The `forEach` method provides iteration capabilities directly via lambdas, but does not lend itself to iterating twice on the same data. If you attempt a second call, a new iteration is performed on the `map` values.

**Code Examples**

*Example 1: Copying Map Values to an ArrayList*

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public class MapIterationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Integer, String> myMap = new HashMap<>();
        myMap.put(1, "Value One");
        myMap.put(2, "Value Two");
        myMap.put(3, "Value Three");

        // Create a copy of map values into an ArrayList
        List<String> valueList = new ArrayList<>(myMap.values());


        System.out.println("First iteration:");
        for (String value : valueList) {
           System.out.println(value);
        }


        System.out.println("\nSecond iteration:");
        for (String value : valueList) {
            System.out.println(value);
        }
    }
}
```

The above example demonstrates the creation of an `ArrayList` to store the map's values. This `ArrayList` then enables iteration, first to display values and then to repeat the process. This approach is highly performant for multiple iterations because the `ArrayList` provides random access, making repeated traversals efficient. No repeated method calls to `map.values` are needed, resulting in no redundant lookups.

*Example 2: Using Java 8 Streams API to copy Map Values*

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class StreamIterationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Integer, String> myMap = new HashMap<>();
        myMap.put(1, "Value One");
        myMap.put(2, "Value Two");
        myMap.put(3, "Value Three");

        // Creating a list using Streams API
       List<String> valueList = myMap.values().stream().collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println("First iteration using streams:");
       valueList.forEach(System.out::println);
        
       System.out.println("\nSecond iteration using streams:");
       valueList.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

This example utilizes Java 8 Streams and `Collectors.toList()` to achieve a similar outcome as the previous example. The values are collected from the map's value stream into a new `List`, and the list can then be iterated as needed, using `forEach` in this case. This approach is equally performant, while providing a somewhat more functional, declarative coding style. It also allows for potential stream-based operations (filtering, mapping etc) on values prior to collecting.

*Example 3: Showing Multiple Iterations with `forEach`*

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class ForEachIterationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Integer, String> myMap = new HashMap<>();
        myMap.put(1, "Value One");
        myMap.put(2, "Value Two");
        myMap.put(3, "Value Three");

        System.out.println("First Iteration:");
        myMap.values().forEach(value -> System.out.println(value));

        System.out.println("\nSecond Iteration:");
        myMap.values().forEach(value -> System.out.println(value));

    }
}
```

This example uses the `forEach` method directly on the view returned by `map.values()`. Each time `myMap.values().forEach` is called, a new view, backed by the map, is created. This results in separate iterations over the values in the map, achieving the desired output, but without retaining a copy of the values for future use. The performance is lower than the first two options because the map needs to be consulted every iteration to retrieve the views.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of Java Collections, consult the official Java documentation. Specifically, explore the interfaces `java.util.Map`, `java.util.Collection`, and `java.util.List`. The documentation explains the nature of *views* in detail. Books focusing on Java concurrency can provide further insight into the risks associated with modifying maps while iterating views. For detailed information about Java 8 streams and their applications, several books on the topic are available. Finally, consulting resources on algorithmic complexity will shed light on the performance implications of different data structures and traversal methods.
