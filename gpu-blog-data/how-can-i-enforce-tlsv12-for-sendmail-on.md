Enforcing TLSv1.2 for sendmail on CentOS 7 requires a multifaceted approach, focusing not just on sendmail's configuration but also on the underlying OpenSSL library and system-wide TLS settings.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues on enterprise mail servers has highlighted the importance of a methodical, layered strategy, as a simple sendmail configuration tweak often proves insufficient.

**1.  System-Wide OpenSSL Configuration:**

CentOS 7, by default, may include older, less secure TLS versions.  Sendmail, inheriting its TLS capabilities from OpenSSL, will use the system's default unless explicitly overridden.  Therefore, the first step is verifying and adjusting the OpenSSL configuration to prioritize TLSv1.2.  This involves modifying the `/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf` file, but caution is advised. Incorrect changes here could severely impact system security and functionality.  In my experience, directly modifying this file is rarely necessary. Instead, leveraging environment variables during the sendmail process generally suffices.

**2. Sendmail Configuration Modifications:**

While system-wide OpenSSL settings influence available cipher suites, sendmail's configuration dictates which ones it uses.  The `/etc/mail/sendmail.mc` file is the central configuration point. Direct modification is rarely recommended, and instead, using `m4` macros to introduce TLSv1.2-specific directives is the safest and most manageable approach. We need to define which ciphers to use, ensuring that only TLSv1.2 and higher are allowed.  This involves careful selection of ciphers from the OpenSSL suite, prioritizing strong, modern algorithms.


**3. Cipher Suite Selection:**

The selection of appropriate cipher suites is critical.  Using outdated or weak cipher suites negates the security benefits of enforcing TLSv1.2. I've encountered situations where seemingly secure configurations were vulnerable due to inclusion of weak cipher suites.  The goal is to choose a suite that balances security, compatibility, and performance.  Avoid generic wildcard settings like `ALL` or `DEFAULT`, as these may inadvertently include weak or deprecated options.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Verification of OpenSSL Version and Enabled Ciphers**

```bash
# Check OpenSSL version
openssl version

# List available ciphers
openssl ciphers -v 'TLSv1.2'
```

This provides a baseline understanding of your system's OpenSSL capabilities and available cipher suites supporting TLSv1.2. This is crucial before proceeding with sendmail configuration.  Note that the output of `openssl ciphers` is extensive; carefully examine the list to choose strong ciphers.


**Example 2: Modifying sendmail.mc (Illustrative)**

This example demonstrates how to use `m4` macros to add TLSv1.2-specific options within sendmail.mc.  Note that this is a simplified illustration and may require adjustments depending on your specific sendmail configuration.  It is crucial to back up your `sendmail.mc` file before any modifications.


```m4
dnl Add TLSv1.2 specific options
define(`confTLS_OPTIONS', `-DHAS_TLS_1_2 -DUSE_TLSv1_2')

dnl Define a custom cipher suite.  Choose strong, modern ciphers from OpenSSL's output in Example 1.
define(`confTLS_CIPHERS', `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384')

dnl ... rest of your sendmail.mc configuration ...

FEATURE(`tls')dnl Enable TLS
FEATURE(`tls_cert', `path_to/your/cert.pem')dnl Specify certificate path
FEATURE(`tls_key', `path_to/your/key.pem')dnl Specify key path
FEATURE(`tls_options', `$confTLS_OPTIONS $confTLS_CIPHERS')dnl Apply TLS options and ciphers

dnl ... remaining sendmail.mc content ...
```

After making changes, rebuild the sendmail configuration:

```bash
makemap hash /etc/mail/genericstable < /etc/mail/genericstable.cf
makemap hash /etc/mail/access < /etc/mail/access.cf
service sendmail restart
```



**Example 3:  Testing TLS Connection (Using OpenSSL)**

After implementing the changes, test the TLS connection to ensure it utilizes TLSv1.2.  Replace `your.mail.server` with your mail server's hostname or IP address.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect your.mail.server:587 -tls1_2 -cipher AES256-GCM-SHA384
```

Examine the output carefully.  The output should clearly indicate that TLSv1.2 is being used and the selected cipher suite is among the ones you defined.  The presence of error messages suggests an issue in either your OpenSSL configuration, sendmail configuration, or your server's certificate.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official sendmail documentation.  Consult this for detailed information on configuration options and best practices.  Pay close attention to the sections on TLS and security.
*   The OpenSSL documentation. Understanding OpenSSL's cipher suite options is essential for selecting strong and compatible cipher suites.
*   A reputable security guide or standard, such as the NIST Special Publication 800-52, to consult regarding the selection of strong cryptographic algorithms and key sizes.  This will help you choose the right cipher suite for optimal security.


**Important Considerations:**

*   **Certificate Management:**  Ensure your server's certificate is valid and properly configured.  An expired or improperly configured certificate will prevent secure connections, regardless of your TLS settings.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Verify your firewall allows traffic on the necessary ports (typically 587 for TLS connections).
*   **Client Compatibility:** Be mindful of client compatibility.  While enforcing TLSv1.2 increases security, some older email clients might not support it.  Consider allowing a fallback to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.0 (only if absolutely necessary and after carefully evaluating the security implications) for compatibility with legacy clients but prioritize TLSv1.2 as the default and strictly preferred option.

By systematically addressing these aspects – system-wide OpenSSL configuration, sendmail configuration, careful cipher suite selection, and thorough testing – you can reliably enforce TLSv1.2 for sendmail on your CentOS 7 server. Remember to thoroughly test your changes and monitor for any unforeseen issues.  Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix.
