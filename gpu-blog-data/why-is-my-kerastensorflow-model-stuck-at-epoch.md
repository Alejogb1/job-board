When a Keras/TensorFlow model using a GPU becomes seemingly unresponsive during training, remaining stalled at epoch one, the primary bottleneck usually revolves around inefficient data loading and preprocessing pipelines, rather than inherent problems with the model architecture or GPU drivers themselves. I have encountered this behavior frequently over several years, across different projects, and the resolution often involves pinpointing these pipeline inefficiencies. The training loop itself, typically executed in Python, can become bottlenecked by tasks handled on the CPU, preventing the GPU from being adequately fed with data.

The first component to examine when confronted with this issue is the way the data is being loaded into TensorFlow. High-performance tensor computations benefit significantly from fast access to data; if the data pipeline is slower than the computational capabilities of the GPU, the GPU will spend most of its time idle, waiting for the next batch of data. Python, being an interpreted language, often exhibits slower speeds when handling complex data transformations directly. Consequently, the common approach of pre-processing data within Python iterators or generators, while seemingly straightforward, can severely impact training efficiency. In scenarios where I initially utilized `ImageDataGenerator` with heavy image augmentations or custom Python generator functions, the GPU often appeared stuck, essentially due to the constant CPU load preventing the data from reaching the GPU.

Specifically, look for bottlenecks in functions that perform tasks like image decoding, augmentation, or data shuffling. These operations, if performed on the CPU during the training loop, will be considerably slower than equivalent operations done by TensorFlow on the GPU or its optimized CPU instructions. The key is to move as much of the data preprocessing as possible to the TensorFlow graph or to leveraging efficient data loading APIs. This ensures that preprocessing happens concurrently with model training, reducing the overall waiting time for the GPU.

The second issue often relates to dataset format and size. TensorFlow performs best when data is organized in an efficient format such as `TFRecord`, where data can be pre-batched and readily accessed. When using datasets composed of individual image files or other inefficient formats, data loading becomes a major overhead. Furthermore, if a dataset does not fit into system memory, disk reads and their associated latency will also significantly contribute to poor GPU utilization. Thus, I have found that converting data into `TFRecord` files and utilizing the `tf.data` API has often yielded substantial improvement in training performance.

Another significant factor, particularly during initial stages of experimentation, might be the batch size. A smaller batch size might lead to the GPU spending too much time processing small workloads. Conversely, too large a batch size may exceed the GPU memory and stall the process, often with less conspicuous errors. Consequently, determining the optimum batch size for the available GPU memory is crucial.

The following code examples illustrate these concepts, moving from problematic implementations to more performant versions. Note that the data paths are placeholders that should be replaced with actual locations relevant to your setup.

**Example 1: Problematic CPU-Bound Data Loading**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os
from PIL import Image

def create_data_generator(image_paths, labels, batch_size):
    while True:
        indices = np.random.permutation(len(image_paths))
        for i in range(0, len(image_paths), batch_size):
            batch_indices = indices[i:i + batch_size]
            batch_images = []
            batch_labels = []
            for index in batch_indices:
                image_path = image_paths[index]
                try:
                    image = Image.open(image_path)
                    image = image.resize((256, 256)) #Example pre-processing.
                    image = np.array(image) / 255.0
                except FileNotFoundError:
                    continue
                batch_images.append(image)
                batch_labels.append(labels[index])
            if len(batch_images) > 0:
                yield np.array(batch_images), np.array(batch_labels)

# Setup dummy data paths
image_paths_dummy = [f"data/image_{i}.png" for i in range(1000)]
labels_dummy = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=1000)

# This will be slow, since data loading and augmentation is done within the Python generator.
train_gen = create_data_generator(image_paths_dummy, labels_dummy, batch_size=32)

# Assume model and optimizer are defined elsewhere.
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

# Training loop; likely stuck at epoch 1.
model.fit(train_gen, steps_per_epoch=len(image_paths_dummy) // 32, epochs=10)

```

This code demonstrates a common scenario where data loading and resizing are executed within a Python generator function, specifically within the `create_data_generator` function. This setup results in a bottleneck because every batch processing involves individual file reads, image decoding via `PIL`, resizing, and array conversion, all being performed by Python on the CPU.

**Example 2: Improved Data Loading using `tf.data` and image loading**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os

image_paths_dummy = [f"data/image_{i}.png" for i in range(1000)]
labels_dummy = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=1000)

image_paths_tensor = tf.constant(image_paths_dummy)
labels_tensor = tf.constant(labels_dummy)

def process_image(file_path, label):
  image_string = tf.io.read_file(file_path)
  image_decoded = tf.io.decode_image(image_string, channels=3)
  image_resized = tf.image.resize(image_decoded, [256, 256])
  image_normalized = tf.cast(image_resized, tf.float32) / 255.0
  return image_normalized, label

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((image_paths_tensor, labels_tensor))
dataset = dataset.map(process_image, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1024).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

model.fit(dataset, epochs=10)
```

This example shifts data loading and processing to TensorFlow's `tf.data` API. The `process_image` function now uses TensorFlow functions for file reading, image decoding, resizing, and data type conversions. This allows TensorFlow to optimize operations by executing them on the GPU or optimized CPU instructions, depending on the available devices. The `map` function with `num_parallel_calls` enables concurrent processing. `prefetch` ensures that the CPU prepares the next batch while the GPU trains, further optimizing resource usage.

**Example 3: Optimized Data Loading with TFRecords**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os

# Assume images are written into a TFRecord file named `data.tfrecord` already
def parse_tfrecord_function(example_proto):
  feature_description = {
      'image': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),
      'label': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64),
  }
  parsed_features = tf.io.parse_single_example(example_proto, feature_description)
  image = tf.io.decode_jpeg(parsed_features['image'], channels=3) #Change jpeg to png if using png
  image = tf.image.resize(image, [256, 256])
  image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0
  label = tf.cast(parsed_features['label'], tf.int32)
  return image, label

dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(["data.tfrecord"])
dataset = dataset.map(parse_tfrecord_function, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1024).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

model.fit(dataset, epochs=10)
```
This example shows how to utilize `TFRecord` datasets. Here, we assume that the images and corresponding labels have already been converted into a `TFRecord` file. The `parse_tfrecord_function` is responsible for parsing a single record in the dataset. TFRecord format allows data to be loaded in an optimized and pre-batched manner, further improving data load times. Notice the continued use of parallel mapping and prefetching for optimizing resource usage. This method often results in superior performance when dealing with large datasets.

For those seeking further understanding, I recommend delving into the TensorFlow documentation. Specifically, the `tf.data` module's guides and API references.  "Deep Learning with Python" by Chollet provides extensive insight into Keras and TensorFlow and touches on efficient data handling. Additionally, the official TensorFlow tutorials on data input pipelines offer practical examples and best practices. Finally, browsing the TensorFlow blog, focusing on data loading efficiency, will offer more targeted strategies. Examining specific cases in those resources has usually been my go-to approach for resolving data loading bottlenecks.
