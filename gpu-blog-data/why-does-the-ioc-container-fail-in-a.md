The failure of an Inversion of Control (IoC) container within a WebForms application frequently stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the framework's lifecycle and how it contrasts with the dependency injection principles that underpin IoC containers. Specifically, the tight coupling between WebForms controls and their associated code-behind classes presents a significant hurdle to effectively employing constructor-based dependency injection, the typical method for IoC container utilization.

WebForms, unlike its successor ASP.NET MVC or modern frameworks like Blazor, relies heavily on the page lifecycle. Controls are created, initialized, and managed by the framework directly. When a page request arrives, the ASP.NET runtime instantiates the page class itself, along with all declared controls within the `.aspx` markup. Crucially, the instantiation mechanism used by the framework does not involve the IoC container. Consequently, injecting dependencies into controls via constructor injection, a cornerstone of container usage, is not automatically handled. The container is effectively bypassed, rendering the configured dependency mappings useless within the standard WebForms pipeline.

Consider a simple scenario: a WebForm `MyPage.aspx` with an associated code-behind file `MyPage.aspx.cs`. This page requires a service, `IMyService`. In a proper dependency injection context, we would expect the IoC container to resolve `IMyService` and inject it into the `MyPage` class’s constructor or a public property. However, the WebForms framework instantiates `MyPage` directly, using `Activator.CreateInstance` (or similar mechanisms), which doesn't honor the IoC container's configuration. As a result, attempting to inject a dependency this way will inevitably fail. The injected dependencies will remain null or uninitialized, potentially leading to `NullReferenceException` errors or unexpected behavior further down the execution path.

Furthermore, controls themselves are also created directly, not through the container. Therefore, any attempt to inject dependencies into user controls or custom server controls' constructors will suffer the same fate. This prevents any substantial use of dependency injection across the application's UI tier.

The common workaround, often seen but not ideal, is service location using the container. This approach involves accessing the container directly within the code, often through a static method or property, retrieving the required dependency explicitly from it. This violates the core principles of dependency injection; the class now has direct knowledge of the container's existence, losing the benefits of loose coupling. Such implementations result in code that is harder to maintain, test, and refactor.

To illustrate the problem and contrast it with a successful implementation in a console application, consider the following code examples:

**Example 1: WebForms – Failed Dependency Injection**

```csharp
// MyService.cs
public interface IMyService
{
    void DoSomething();
}

public class MyService : IMyService
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        // Service Logic
    }
}

// MyPage.aspx.cs (WebForms Code-behind)
using System;
using System.Web.UI;

public partial class MyPage : Page
{
    private IMyService _myService;

    public MyPage(IMyService myService) // Constructor injection, which will FAIL in WebForms
    {
        _myService = myService;
    }

    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
      _myService.DoSomething(); // This WILL throw NullReferenceException since the constructor isn’t called by the IoC
    }
}
```

In this first example, a constructor attempts dependency injection. However, as explained, ASP.NET WebForms does not leverage the IoC container during page instantiation, bypassing our configured dependencies. Consequently, `_myService` remains null at the `Page_Load` stage, and invoking `DoSomething()` causes a runtime error. Note that the `aspx` markup is irrelevant in this context; the instantiation happens entirely within the ASP.NET runtime.

**Example 2: WebForms - Service Location (Poor Practice)**

```csharp
// Using a global static container (this is problematic)
public static class Container
{
    private static IContainer _container;

    public static void Configure(IContainer container)
    {
        _container = container;
    }

    public static T Resolve<T>()
    {
       return _container.Resolve<T>();
    }
}

// MyPage.aspx.cs (WebForms Code-behind, Service Location pattern)
using System;
using System.Web.UI;

public partial class MyPage : Page
{
    private IMyService _myService;

    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        _myService = Container.Resolve<IMyService>();
        _myService.DoSomething(); // This will now work, BUT with tight coupling
    }
}
```

Example 2 demonstrates the service location pattern. Although it works, it introduces a dependency on the `Container` class, making the page class coupled to the IoC implementation. This creates testability issues and violates the key principles of DI. This solution, while practical, is not recommended due to its inherent limitations. It makes the code harder to maintain and test.

**Example 3: Console Application – Successful Dependency Injection**

```csharp
// Program.cs (Console Application Example)
using System;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var services = new ServiceCollection();
        services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
        var provider = services.BuildServiceProvider();

        var myService = provider.GetService<IMyService>(); // Resolve dependency
        var app = new MyConsoleApp(myService); // Inject via constructor
        app.Run();
    }
}

public class MyConsoleApp
{
    private IMyService _myService;

    public MyConsoleApp(IMyService myService)
    {
      _myService = myService;
    }

    public void Run()
    {
       _myService.DoSomething(); // No error, dependency correctly injected
    }
}
```

In contrast, Example 3 showcases a correct dependency injection implementation in a console application. Here, the `ServiceProvider` correctly resolves `IMyService` and injects it into the `MyConsoleApp`'s constructor. The application's dependency on the service is made explicit and resolved by the container, adhering to the principles of dependency injection.

The fundamental issue isn't the container’s functionality but rather its incompatible interaction with the WebForms framework’s lifecycle management. WebForms directly instantiates pages and controls without the involvement of an IoC container, rendering constructor injection ineffective within its standard lifecycle.

For WebForms applications, the best practices involve attempting to minimize the amount of dependency injection required by moving as much logic as possible out of the code behind to other classes that can be managed by the IoC container. Consider utilizing other patterns, such as the Model-View-Presenter pattern (MVP), to isolate complex logic from the WebForms controls and enabling testability.

While WebForms can become more maintainable with careful structuring, its inherent limitations regarding IoC integration highlight a strong reason for migrating to more modern web development platforms such as ASP.NET Core or Blazor where dependency injection is deeply integrated.

**Resource Recommendations:**

*   **Dependency Injection in .NET:** Books and articles explaining the fundamentals of DI and IoC containers
*   **ASP.NET WebForms Lifecycle:** Detailed documentation on the framework's page lifecycle
*   **Design Patterns:**  Learning specific patterns like Model-View-Presenter can help structure WebForms projects in a more maintainable way
