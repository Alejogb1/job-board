The core challenge in selectively excluding a value within PyTorch's `torch.no_grad()` context isn't directly addressed by the mode itself.  `torch.no_grad()` globally disables gradient calculation for all operations within its scope.  The key, therefore, lies in conditional logic combined with targeted tensor manipulation to achieve selective exclusion.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural network training pipelines has frequently necessitated precisely this level of granular control.  Effective strategies involve masking, conditional operations, and, in certain scenarios, custom autograd functions.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The absence of a direct "exclude value" functionality within `torch.no_grad()` necessitates a workaround. We cannot instruct PyTorch to ignore gradient computation for specific values *only*. Instead, we must devise methods to isolate the target value and manage its computation separately.  This involves three primary approaches:

* **Masking:**  Create a boolean mask identifying elements *not* equal to the excluded value.  Perform operations only on the masked portion of the tensor.  This is generally the most efficient approach for large tensors.

* **Conditional Operations:** Employ conditional statements (`torch.where`) to differentiate operations based on whether an element equals the excluded value.  This offers flexibility but might be less efficient than masking for large-scale operations.

* **Custom Autograd Functions:** For extremely complex scenarios requiring precise control beyond what masking or conditional statements can provide, creating a custom autograd function provides the ultimate level of granularity. This, however, introduces significant complexity and should only be considered when other methods prove insufficient.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Masking Technique**

```python
import torch

# Sample tensor
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 5.0], requires_grad=True)
# Value to exclude
exclude_value = 2.0

# Create a boolean mask
mask = x != exclude_value

# Apply the mask within torch.no_grad()
with torch.no_grad():
    x_masked = x[mask]
    # Perform operations on the masked tensor; gradients for these operations are disabled
    y = x_masked * 2

# Operations outside the context will have gradient calculations enabled.
z = torch.sum(x)  # Gradient calculation for z is enabled

print(f"Original Tensor: {x}")
print(f"Masked Tensor: {x_masked}")
print(f"Result (y): {y}")
print(f"Result (z): {z}")

# Demonstrating gradient calculation for z, but not for y
z.backward()
print(f"Gradient of z: {x.grad}") # x.grad will reflect contribution to z
try:
    y.backward()  # This will raise an error as y's gradients are disabled
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #Expected RuntimeError indicating no gradient available
```

This example demonstrates how a boolean mask effectively isolates the excluded value (2.0), preventing its contribution to gradient calculations within the `torch.no_grad()` block.  Note the error raised when attempting to backpropagate through `y`.

**Example 2: Conditional Operations**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 5.0], requires_grad=True)
exclude_value = 2.0

with torch.no_grad():
    y = torch.where(x == exclude_value, torch.tensor(0.0), x * 2) #Replace excluded values with 0, others are doubled.

z = torch.sum(x)
z.backward()

print(f"Original Tensor: {x}")
print(f"Result (y): {y}")
print(f"Result (z): {z}")
print(f"Gradient of z: {x.grad}")

```

Here, `torch.where` conditionally applies different operations based on whether an element matches the `exclude_value`.  Values equal to 2.0 are replaced with 0.0, while others are doubled. Note that the gradient calculation is still enabled for all elements of `x` in this example, unlike the masking approach.  The choice between this and masking depends on the desired outcome; masking offers superior efficiency for large tensors.

**Example 3: Custom Autograd Function (Illustrative)**

```python
import torch

class ExcludeValueFunction(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input, exclude_value):
        ctx.save_for_backward(input, torch.tensor(exclude_value))
        mask = input != exclude_value
        return input[mask] * 2

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        input, exclude_value = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_input = torch.zeros_like(input)
        mask = input != exclude_value
        grad_input[mask] = grad_output
        return grad_input, None

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 5.0], requires_grad=True)
exclude_value = 2.0

y = ExcludeValueFunction.apply(x, exclude_value)
z = torch.sum(y)
z.backward()

print(f"Original Tensor: {x}")
print(f"Result (y): {y}")
print(f"Gradient of z: {x.grad}")
```

This example outlines a custom autograd function. This approach provides very fine-grained control; however, it is considerably more complex to implement and debug than the previous two methods.  Itâ€™s crucial to thoroughly understand automatic differentiation within PyTorch before undertaking this approach.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on automatic differentiation and tensor manipulation, are invaluable.  Dive deep into the `torch.no_grad()` context manager's behavior and the specifics of how PyTorch manages gradients.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of NumPy's array manipulation techniques will significantly aid in designing effective masking and conditional operations. Studying advanced topics such as custom autograd function creation would be beneficial for more complex scenarios.  Thorough testing and experimentation with each approach is crucial to select the most appropriate solution for specific use cases.
