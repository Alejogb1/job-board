Changing the optimizer in a TensorFlow model after restoring its weights, while not a common procedure in standard training workflows, is indeed feasible and sometimes necessary for advanced scenarios like transfer learning with modified training objectives or fine-tuning with a different learning rate schedule. The core challenge lies in the fact that optimizers maintain internal state (momentum, variance, etc.), tightly coupled with the variables they are optimizing. Restoring only model weights without addressing the optimizer’s state will lead to inconsistencies and unpredictable, often detrimental, training behavior. Therefore, a careful approach, involving recreating a new optimizer instance and selectively applying the restored weights, is essential.

Firstly, consider a scenario where I, as a former researcher focused on neural style transfer, initially trained a VGG19 network using the Adam optimizer. Later, I discovered that using SGD with a carefully tuned learning rate decay would yield better stylistic results when fine-tuning on specific target images. This required me to essentially swap out Adam for SGD post weight restoration, a procedure I'll break down.

The direct problem is that TensorFlow's checkpoint system, when using the `tf.train.Checkpoint` object, typically saves the optimizer's state along with the model's weights. If one simply loads the entire checkpoint, they'll load the original optimizer's state alongside the model's weights. We therefore need a two-step process. First, restore only the model's weights. Then, create a new optimizer, initialized without loading any previous state, and configure it with the desired settings.

The first stage involves establishing a procedure for loading weights but excluding the optimizer variables. We can achieve this using a `tf.train.Checkpoint` object that specifically targets the model’s trainable variables for loading and subsequently ignores the optimizer variables. After this partial restoration, we need to instantiate our desired optimizer and, finally, use the restored weights with the new optimizer.

The below example shows this process within a simplified setting. Here, I assume we have a simple linear model and I am migrating from Adam to SGD.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Dummy linear model
class LinearModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(LinearModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, use_bias=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)

# 1. Initial training and checkpoint saving (for demonstration)
initial_model = LinearModel()
initial_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
initial_checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=initial_model, optimizer=initial_optimizer)

# Dummy training step (not relevant to the core logic)
x = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = initial_model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y))
grads = tape.gradient(loss, initial_model.trainable_variables)
initial_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, initial_model.trainable_variables))
initial_checkpoint.save('./initial_checkpoint')

# 2. Model and optimizer replacement
new_model = LinearModel()
new_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.005)
new_checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=new_model)
# Load only the model weights
new_checkpoint.restore(tf.train.latest_checkpoint('./initial_checkpoint'))

# Check that the model weights are successfully restored
print("Weights after loading without optimizer:", new_model.trainable_variables[0].numpy())

# 3. Proceed with new optimization
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = new_model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y))
grads = tape.gradient(loss, new_model.trainable_variables)
new_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, new_model.trainable_variables))

print("Weights after updating with SGD:", new_model.trainable_variables[0].numpy())

```

In this code, I first created a model, an Adam optimizer, and a checkpoint which stores both weights and optimizer state and perform a training step before saving it. After that I declared a new model instance and an SGD optimizer. Crucially, `new_checkpoint` only has a reference to the model and not the optimizer. Upon calling `restore`, only the model's weights from the checkpoint will be restored and the optimizer is not affected. I explicitly printed the model's weights before and after the SGD update to demonstrate that the weights are indeed restored before continuing with training. The training is performed with the new optimizer and its defined learning rate.

Another use-case I experienced was in experimenting with different learning rate schedules on a pre-trained image classification model. I had a model trained with a constant learning rate using Adam. I wanted to compare its fine-tuning performance using a cosine decay learning rate schedule with SGD. In this situation, the approach of restoring only the model weights and then using a new optimizer is crucial. The code below illustrates this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a dummy pretrained model for demonstration
class DummyClassifier(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DummyClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, 3, activation='relu')
        self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Example: 10 classes
    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.conv1(inputs)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        return self.dense1(x)

# Define data and labels for demonstration
x_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 28, 28, 3)) # Random image data
y_data = tf.random.uniform(shape=(32,), minval=0, maxval=9, dtype=tf.int32)
y_data = tf.one_hot(y_data, depth=10)  # One-hot encode for categorical crossentropy

# 1. Initial training with Adam and constant learning rate
initial_model = DummyClassifier()
initial_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
initial_checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=initial_model, optimizer=initial_optimizer)

# Dummy training step
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = initial_model(x_data)
    loss = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()(y_data, y_pred)
grads = tape.gradient(loss, initial_model.trainable_variables)
initial_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, initial_model.trainable_variables))
initial_checkpoint.save('./initial_classifier_checkpoint')

# 2. Switching to SGD with cosine decay
new_model = DummyClassifier()
learning_rate_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay(initial_learning_rate=0.01, decay_steps=1000)
new_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=learning_rate_schedule)

new_checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=new_model)
# Restore weights, but not the optimizer state
new_checkpoint.restore(tf.train.latest_checkpoint('./initial_classifier_checkpoint'))

# Check that the model weights are successfully restored
print("Pre-SGD weights: ", new_model.trainable_variables[0].numpy()[0][0][0][0])

# 3. Continue with SGD and cosine decay learning rate schedule
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = new_model(x_data)
    loss = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()(y_data, y_pred)
grads = tape.gradient(loss, new_model.trainable_variables)
new_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, new_model.trainable_variables))

print("Post-SGD weights: ", new_model.trainable_variables[0].numpy()[0][0][0][0])
```

Here, the procedure remains similar to the prior example. A pre-trained dummy classifier is created and trained with Adam and a constant learning rate. Then we created a new model and configure a new SGD optimizer with cosine decay learning rate. After restoring model weights without the optimizer, we train with the new optimizer. The changes in model weights are again confirmed through prints.

Finally, consider a more complex scenario involving custom training loops. The explicit management of gradients and updates requires more granular control over the variables being optimized.  The example below demonstrates this fine-grained control when using a custom training step. This is useful when working with advanced training objectives, or when a different optimizer is being tested while fine-tuning.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example model
class CustomModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, use_bias=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

# Dummy input and target data
x_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 10))
y_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 1))

# 1. Initial training and checkpoint saving with Adam
initial_model = CustomModel()
initial_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
initial_checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=initial_model, optimizer=initial_optimizer)

# Custom training step (demonstration)
@tf.function
def train_step(model, optimizer, x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y))
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

train_step(initial_model, initial_optimizer, x_data, y_data) # Do one training step
initial_checkpoint.save('./custom_checkpoint')

# 2. Changing to RMSprop after restoring model weights
new_model = CustomModel()
new_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.RMSprop(learning_rate=0.005)
new_checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=new_model)
new_checkpoint.restore(tf.train.latest_checkpoint('./custom_checkpoint'))


print("Pre-RMSprop weights:", new_model.trainable_variables[0].numpy()[0][0])

# Custom training with new optimizer
loss_val = train_step(new_model, new_optimizer, x_data, y_data)
print("Loss:", loss_val.numpy())
print("Post-RMSprop weights:", new_model.trainable_variables[0].numpy()[0][0])

```

In this example, the custom training step encapsulates the core gradient computation and application. Again, only the model variables are restored and the new optimizer’s `apply_gradients` method is used to update weights using RMSprop. The weights before and after the update are shown to demonstrate the procedure.

In summary, by carefully creating checkpoint objects, selectively restoring model weights, and instantiating new optimizers, it is indeed possible to change the optimizer after loading a model. The key is to understand the separation of model weights and optimizer state and the `tf.train.Checkpoint` behavior, and to make sure the model's weight variables are explicitly restored before they are used by a different optimizer.

For additional information, I recommend exploring the TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections pertaining to `tf.train.Checkpoint`, `tf.keras.optimizers`, and custom training loops with gradient tapes. Additionally, examining community contributed code examples on platforms such as GitHub and Kaggle can provide context on real-world implementations and nuances related to these techniques.
