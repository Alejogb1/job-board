The emergence of NaN (Not a Number) values during TensorFlow training, particularly when transitioning from smaller array sizes (e.g., <=16) to larger ones, often stems from numerical instability issues related to floating-point arithmetic and gradient calculation within the neural network. This is not strictly tied to the number 16 itself; rather, it's a consequence of how larger input scales, interacts with model weights, and propagates through network layers, often amplifying small numerical errors into substantial deviations. I’ve seen this countless times debugging models across different architectures, and while the specific symptoms manifest in varied ways, the root cause frequently boils down to a few key culprits.

The primary mechanism driving NaN proliferation is the exponential nature of operations performed during both the forward and backward passes of a neural network. Consider a simple sigmoid activation function, commonly used in the output layers of binary classification problems. The sigmoid squashes values to the range of (0, 1). However, for very large positive or negative inputs, the sigmoid output is extremely close to 1 or 0, respectively. This, in itself, isn't a problem. However, when these nearly saturated values are passed to subsequent layers or used during the backward pass to calculate gradients, derivatives of these saturated portions of the sigmoid curve are nearly zero. Consequently, during training with backpropagation, if these near-zero gradients are further multiplied by small weight values or learning rates, the result can vanish towards zero. This can mean weights stop learning, a problem, but more importantly, during backprop, you also have to work with the *inverse* of these tiny changes. In other words, we're now taking numbers near zero and multiplying by them on a constant basis, and these small changes can become quite large given that floating point representation only has a finite amount of precision.

Furthermore, consider the squared error loss function, a common loss metric. For small errors, the squared error remains manageable, but the derivative of the loss also contains the error term, thus for larger input values/outputs, we’re not necessarily working with *errors* that are directly linked to the weight or parameter change we're trying to make. Instead, they are simply *large* and can quickly balloon and cause numerical instability, especially during backpropagation where error gradients are multiplied by weight values and learning rates. This issue becomes more pronounced with larger array sizes because they lead to more pronounced activation values, and correspondingly larger, or smaller, activations and derivatives and losses and gradients. Also larger models with more layers and weights will exacerbate this effect.

The initial scale of the input data is crucial. If the input values are large or have a wide dynamic range, subsequent operations can further magnify the differences. For example, multiplying larger input values by the model's weights during the forward pass can cause very large or small activations. Similarly, in some operations, you’re constantly multiplying values, so very small values start to move closer to 0. However, for large values, they might exceed the maximum value that can be represented with floating-point numbers, leading to `inf` (infinity) which subsequently can cause `NaN` during subsequent calculations. It is often helpful to normalize or standardize the input data prior to training.

I will now present three practical scenarios observed during my work, including the associated code and their explanations.

**Code Example 1: Unscaled Input Data**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate data with larger values
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 20) * 100  # Input values range from 0 to 100
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000, 1))

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0)

# Check if NaNs are present in loss
print(f"Final Loss: {history.history['loss'][-1]}")
```

In this first example, the input data `x_train` is scaled to range from 0 to 100. This range, in combination with the activation functions and weight matrices used by the model, is sufficient to cause gradients to explode. If we run this code, we will see NaN losses in the print output. In contrast, if the input data was scaled to something smaller (0-1), the model would likely converge as expected.

**Code Example 2: Improper Weight Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate data
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 20)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000, 1))

# Define a model with specific kernel initializer
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.RandomUniform(minval=10, maxval=20), input_shape=(20,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0)

# Check if NaNs are present in loss
print(f"Final Loss: {history.history['loss'][-1]}")
```

Here, we've introduced an explicit weight initializer, `RandomUniform` with a wide range (10 to 20). The purpose here is to start our network with relatively large weights to show how large initial weights can lead to problems in training. Running this code will likely show NaN losses. While it's possible to use these initial values, they must be combined with a small learning rate.

**Code Example 3: Vanishing Gradients with Deep Network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate data
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 20)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000, 1))

# Define a deep model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0)

# Check if NaNs are present in loss
print(f"Final Loss: {history.history['loss'][-1]}")
```

In this example, we've deepened the model by introducing more layers. When gradients pass through each activation function, they are multiplied by their derivatives. If these derivatives are small (due to activations in the flat portions of functions like sigmoid), the gradients vanish as we move backwards towards the earlier layers. Though this example might not immediately yield NaNs, it's indicative of the type of instability that can lead to them in more complex configurations. It illustrates how deeper networks can make models unstable and introduce issues like vanishing gradients which is a pre-cursor to exploding gradients and NaN outputs.

To avoid these issues, I recommend several strategies. *Data scaling* is essential. Normalizing or standardizing input data to a range of roughly [0, 1] or [-1, 1] is beneficial. *Careful weight initialization* plays a large part. Using initializers such as Xavier/Glorot initialization or He initialization can help prevent vanishing and exploding gradients. These ensure weights start with a small, reasonable range of values. Additionally, *gradient clipping* can limit the magnitude of gradients during backpropagation, thereby preventing extremely large weight updates. Finally, *adjusting learning rate* might also help. Smaller learning rates will make smaller weight updates and can result in more stable convergence. Finally, using a different, more robust optimizer (AdamW or NAdam) might help, which are less prone to numerical instability.

For learning more, I suggest researching “Numerical Stability in Deep Learning.” Also, resources covering data normalization techniques, weight initialization strategies, and gradient clipping are indispensable. Reading more about different optimizers and their convergence properties is also strongly encouraged.
