The core challenge in assigning meaningful values to each timestep in a Keras many-to-many LSTM lies not in the LSTM itself, but in the preprocessing and feature engineering of your input data.  My experience working on financial time series forecasting highlighted this repeatedly; directly feeding raw data into an LSTM often leads to suboptimal performance.  Effective value assignment hinges on transforming raw data into representations that capture temporal dependencies and relevant information for the LSTM to learn.

My approach centers around three key strategies:  feature scaling, lagged features, and feature extraction via domain-specific knowledge.  Let's explore these with illustrative examples.

**1. Feature Scaling:**  LSTMs are sensitive to the scale of their input features.  Unscaled features with vastly different ranges can lead to instability during training and hinder the learning process.  I've consistently found that standardization or min-max scaling significantly improves model performance.

**Code Example 1: Data Preprocessing with Standardization**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def preprocess_data(data):
    """
    Standardizes input data using StandardScaler.

    Args:
        data: A NumPy array of shape (samples, timesteps, features).

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the standardized data and the scaler object.
    """
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    reshaped_data = data.reshape(-1, data.shape[-1]) # Reshape for scaler
    scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(reshaped_data)
    scaled_data = scaled_data.reshape(data.shape) # Reshape back to original
    return scaled_data, scaler

# Example Usage:
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 3) # 100 samples, 20 timesteps, 3 features
scaled_data, scaler = preprocess_data(data)

#Note:  In a real-world scenario, you would apply this scaler to your test data as well using scaler.transform()
```

This function standardizes each feature independently across all samples and timesteps, ensuring that features with larger ranges don't dominate the learning process.  The use of `StandardScaler` is crucial; it centers the data around zero and scales it to unit variance, which is generally beneficial for gradient-based optimization algorithms used in training LSTMs.  Remember to apply the same scaling parameters to your test data to ensure consistent results.


**2. Lagged Features:**  LSTMs excel at capturing temporal dependencies, but they often require explicit representation of these dependencies in the input data. Creating lagged features involves adding previous timesteps' values as additional features for the current timestep.  This allows the LSTM to directly observe the evolution of the variables over time.

**Code Example 2: Generating Lagged Features**

```python
def create_lagged_features(data, lags):
    """
    Generates lagged features for a given dataset.

    Args:
        data: A NumPy array of shape (samples, timesteps, features).
        lags: A list or tuple of lag values (e.g., [1, 2, 3] for lags of 1, 2, and 3).

    Returns:
        A NumPy array with lagged features added.  Returns None if input is invalid.
    """
    if not isinstance(data, np.ndarray) or len(data.shape) != 3:
        return None
    timesteps, features = data.shape[1], data.shape[2]
    new_features = []
    for lag in lags:
        lagged_data = np.concatenate([np.zeros((data.shape[0], lag, features)), data[:, :-lag, :]], axis=1)
        new_features.append(lagged_data)
    new_features.append(data)
    return np.concatenate(new_features, axis=2)

#Example Usage:
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 3)
lagged_data = create_lagged_features(data, [1, 2])  #Add lags of 1 and 2 timesteps

```

This function adds lagged features to the input data.  Notice the careful handling of edge cases; zero padding is used to handle the beginning of the sequence where lags are not available.  The choice of lag values should be informed by domain knowledge and experimentation. For example, in financial time series, lags corresponding to daily, weekly, or monthly periods might be relevant.


**3. Feature Extraction using Domain Knowledge:**  Raw data often contains irrelevant or redundant information.  Leveraging domain expertise to extract relevant features can significantly improve model performance.  In my experience with financial modelling, I've found that using technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD) as input features proved far superior to simply using raw price data.

**Code Example 3: Incorporating Technical Indicators**

```python
import pandas as pd
import talib as ta

def add_technical_indicators(data, close_price_col):
    """
    Adds technical indicators (e.g., moving averages) to input data.

    Args:
      data: Pandas DataFrame containing time series data with a 'close' column.
      close_price_col: The name of the column containing the closing prices.

    Returns:
      Pandas DataFrame with added technical indicators.  Returns None on error.
    """
    try:
        data['SMA_20'] = ta.SMA(data[close_price_col], timeperiod=20) #Simple Moving Average
        data['RSI_14'] = ta.RSI(data[close_price_col], timeperiod=14) #Relative Strength Index
        # Add more indicators as needed...
        return data
    except KeyError:
        return None

# Example usage (assuming a pandas DataFrame named 'df' with a 'Close' column)
df = add_technical_indicators(df, 'Close')
```

This example utilizes the TA-Lib library to calculate commonly used technical indicators.  The choice of indicators depends heavily on the specific problem.  For example, in the context of forecasting stock prices, indicators reflecting momentum or volatility might be particularly relevant.  It is crucial to ensure that the indicators are calculated consistently across training and testing data.

Remember that the optimal preprocessing strategy is highly dependent on the nature of your data and the specific problem you are trying to solve.  Thorough experimentation and careful evaluation are essential for achieving optimal results.  Consider techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to further refine your model's performance.  Furthermore, always carefully consider data leakage during your preprocessing steps; ensure that information from the future is not inadvertently incorporated into the training data.
