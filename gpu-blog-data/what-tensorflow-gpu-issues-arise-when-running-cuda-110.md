TensorFlow's compatibility with CUDA 11.0 on Ubuntu 20.04 hinges critically on the precise TensorFlow version employed.  My experience troubleshooting this on numerous projects highlighted a consistent pattern: mismatch between TensorFlow's internal CUDA dependencies and the system's installed CUDA toolkit is the primary source of errors.  This isn't simply a matter of having CUDA 11.0 installed; TensorFlow often requires a specific, often more recent, cuDNN version, and a precisely matched CUDA driver version.  Ignoring these nuances inevitably leads to GPU-related failures.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core problem stems from the complex interplay between TensorFlow, CUDA, cuDNN, and the underlying NVIDIA driver.  TensorFlow relies on CUDA for GPU acceleration.  However, it doesn't directly use the CUDA toolkit files; instead, it utilizes CUDA libraries through a layer of abstraction provided by cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library).  This library optimizes deep learning operations for NVIDIA GPUs.  Therefore, having CUDA 11.0 installed is only the first step.  The crucial aspect lies in ensuring complete compatibility across all three layers: the NVIDIA driver, CUDA toolkit, and cuDNN.  A mismatch – for instance, a TensorFlow build compiled against CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN 8.2 running on a system with only CUDA 11.0 and cuDNN 8.0 installed – is a recipe for runtime errors.

These errors manifest in various ways.  The most common are:

* **`Could not find CUDA GPUs`:** This error, despite having a GPU and CUDA installed, usually indicates a mismatch between the TensorFlow build and the available CUDA toolkit or driver.  This could be due to an incorrect version of CUDA libraries linked during TensorFlow's compilation or an incompatibility between the driver version and the CUDA toolkit.

* **`Invalid CUDA context` or `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT`:** These errors typically signal an issue with the CUDA context creation or management. They often appear due to conflicting library versions, incorrect CUDA driver installation, or resource contention issues.

* **Segmentation faults (SIGSEGV):** These crashes, often occurring during intense GPU computations, usually indicate memory access violations.  While not exclusively a CUDA problem, they frequently stem from issues within the CUDA runtime environment caused by version mismatches.

* **Performance degradation:** Even without explicit error messages, performance degradation can indicate a compatibility problem.  TensorFlow may be falling back to CPU execution, or suffering from unexpected slowdowns due to inefficient resource utilization as a result of a version mismatch.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different aspects of this problem.  These are simplified for illustrative purposes; real-world scenarios involve considerably more complex models and datasets.

**Example 1:  Checking TensorFlow and CUDA Versions:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
print(f"CUDA is available: {tf.test.is_built_with_cuda}")
print(f"CUDA version: {tf.test.gpu_device_name()}") #This might not always reliably give CUDA version
```

**Commentary:**  This code snippet helps verify if TensorFlow is built with CUDA support and prints the version information.  The output from `tf.test.gpu_device_name()` can be misleading, as it may only reflect the presence of a GPU, not the exact CUDA version.  It's essential to also check the `nvcc` version separately (using the command `nvcc --version` in the terminal) and compare that with the CUDA version TensorFlow is expecting (found in the TensorFlow installation details or documentation).


**Example 2:  Simple GPU Computation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

if tf.test.is_built_with_cuda:
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
        b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
        c = a + b
        print(f"Result on GPU: {c.numpy()}")
else:
    print("TensorFlow is not built with CUDA support.")
```

**Commentary:**  This illustrates a simple addition operation performed on the GPU if available.  If a CUDA-related error occurs during execution, it points to an incompatibility.  The error message should offer a clue regarding the nature of the issue (e.g.,  invalid context, memory allocation failure).  The absence of an error doesn't guarantee complete compatibility, but it suggests that the most basic CUDA operations work.  Further testing with more complex models is necessary.


**Example 3:  Handling Potential Errors:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        # Complex model or computation here
        pass  # Replace with actual model operations
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"RuntimeError encountered: {e}")
except tf.errors.OpError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow OpError: {e}")
except Exception as e:  #Broad exception handling
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates robust error handling.  It catches specific TensorFlow errors (like `OpError`) and generic `RuntimeError`, providing more informative error messages than a simple crash.  This is crucial for debugging CUDA-related problems since the error messages are often cryptic.  A well-structured `try-except` block is essential in any TensorFlow code that utilizes the GPU.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official TensorFlow documentation for detailed compatibility information between TensorFlow versions, CUDA versions, and cuDNN versions.  Refer to the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation for installation and configuration details, and carefully review the release notes for any known compatibility issues.  NVIDIA's official forums and community support channels often contain valuable troubleshooting information and solutions to common CUDA-related problems.  Finally, meticulously examine the TensorFlow installation logs for any warning messages or errors related to CUDA initialization during the installation process; these often provide crucial hints about underlying issues.
