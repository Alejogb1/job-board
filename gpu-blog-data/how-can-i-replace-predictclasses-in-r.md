`predict_classes()` was a function formerly offered by the Keras package in R for obtaining class predictions from a trained model. Its deprecation, often encountered after Keras API updates, stems from the shift toward a more unified prediction framework utilizing the `predict()` function in conjunction with manual thresholding or `argmax` operations for classification tasks. My past experience transitioning numerous machine learning projects away from this now-absent function has provided me a deep understanding of the necessary adaptation strategies. The core issue arises not from a loss of capability, but rather a change in how classification outputs are generated and interpreted.

In essence, `predict_classes()` served as a convenient wrapper that combined the raw output of a model's prediction with a thresholding or argmax operation. This single step encapsulated both obtaining probability distributions or logits and converting them into discrete class assignments. The `predict()` function, however, now provides only the raw output (typically probabilities or logits, depending on the output layer's activation function). The responsibility for transforming these probabilities or logits into class predictions now rests with the user, introducing a necessary but straightforward extra layer of control and flexibility. The methodology is largely consistent whether dealing with binary or multi-class classification problems, differing primarily in the interpretation and handling of the output format. The direct implications are a slight modification of code, a slight addition of logic, but not necessarily any increase in complexity once the core understanding is established.

**Binary Classification**

For binary classification, where models output a single probability representing the likelihood of belonging to the positive class, the `predict()` function returns a matrix of these probabilities. The replacement for `predict_classes()` involves setting a threshold to convert these probabilities into binary class predictions (typically 0 or 1). Often, this threshold is set at 0.5, which is suitable if the data is balanced. However, in unbalanced datasets, adjusting this threshold may provide better results.

```r
# Example 1: Binary classification replacement
library(keras)

# Assuming 'model' is a trained Keras model for binary classification
# and 'test_data' is your input data for prediction
predictions_prob <- predict(model, test_data)

# Apply thresholding (0.5 used here as the standard)
predictions_class <- ifelse(predictions_prob > 0.5, 1, 0)

# Inspect the output
head(predictions_class)
```

In this example, the `predict()` call outputs a matrix or a vector of probabilities. The `ifelse()` function then takes each of these probabilities and compares it to 0.5. Values greater than 0.5 are assigned a class of 1, while the remainder are assigned a class of 0. The result, `predictions_class`, is a vector of predicted binary classes. This effectively replicates what `predict_classes()` would have output for binary classification. It is crucial to remember that threshold of 0.5 can be adjusted.

**Multi-class Classification**

For multi-class problems, the `predict()` function returns a matrix where each row corresponds to an input sample, and each column corresponds to a class, containing the predicted probabilities for each class. The deprecation of `predict_classes()` in this context necessitates that we select the class with the highest probability. This operation is commonly known as `argmax`, which identifies the index of the maximum value along each row of the output matrix and maps that index back to its corresponding class label.

```r
# Example 2: Multi-class classification replacement using argmax
library(keras)
library(dplyr)

# Assuming 'model' is a trained Keras model for multi-class classification
# and 'test_data' is the input for prediction
predictions_prob_multi <- predict(model, test_data)

# Determine the index of the maximum probability for each instance
predictions_class_multi <- apply(predictions_prob_multi, 1, function(x) which.max(x) - 1)

#Inspect the output
head(predictions_class_multi)
```

In this code snippet, `predict()` outputs a probability matrix for multi-class classification. The `apply` function then applies the `which.max` function, row-wise, to identify the index of the highest probability for each input sample. We subtract 1 from the `which.max()` result, as `which.max()` returns indices starting at 1, while most data representation and class labels in machine learning begin at 0. This provides `predictions_class_multi`, a vector of the predicted class labels for each input.

**Alternative Approach with `dplyr`**

An alternative approach for multi-class classification predictions involves the use of `dplyr`, providing an often preferred, more readable methodology. This method can be especially useful for downstream data manipulation, but will not be fundamentally different than using `apply()`.

```r
# Example 3: Multi-class classification with dplyr
library(keras)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)

# Assuming 'model' is a trained Keras model for multi-class classification
# and 'test_data' is the input for prediction
predictions_prob_df <- as_tibble(predict(model, test_data))


predictions_class_df <- predictions_prob_df %>%
  mutate(predicted_class = across(everything(), .fns = \(x) which.max(x)) - 1) %>%
  select(predicted_class)


# Inspect the output
head(predictions_class_df)
```

Here, the output of the `predict()` call is converted into a tibble using `as_tibble`. The `across` function from the `dplyr` package applies the `which.max` operation to all columns, finding the index of the maximum probability. As before, 1 is subtracted to obtain the zero-indexed class. The `select()` command then extracts the resulting 'predicted_class' column. `dplyr` offers a clear, chainable syntax, often preferred by R users.

**Resource Recommendations**

To deepen understanding of this process, examining general resources on model evaluation and classification is helpful. There are several comprehensive books covering model building and interpretation. These books tend to cover the fundamentals of model output, activation functions, threshold selection and `argmax`. Keras documentation, even for python (where the core development is located) can provide insight into expected return types for the `predict()` function and how output layer activations influence results.

Official documentation, although not often in R itself, can reveal the underpinnings of what functions such as `predict()` do. Many online resources and educational programs that focus on building models with Keras will have examples of making such predictions outside of the convenience of `predict_classes`. These resources, though not specific to R, will often cover common conventions that may be helpful in understanding what is happening behind the scenes in the function. Lastly, seeking clarification within the R machine learning communities often provides different perspectives and code examples demonstrating common practice.

The removal of `predict_classes()` represents a shift towards explicit handling of the output from `predict()`. This forces the user to consider the implications of choosing a threshold or `argmax` operation and the interpretation of the model's outputs. While seemingly a small change, it reinforces crucial understanding of core classification procedures. I've found that adapting to this change ultimately leads to a more rigorous and thoughtful model development process.
