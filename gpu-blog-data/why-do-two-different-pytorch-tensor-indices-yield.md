Tensor identity in PyTorch, specifically the shared memory aspect, can be confusing, particularly when dealing with indexing operations. I've spent a considerable amount of time debugging situations where seemingly distinct tensors were unexpectedly modifying each other, leading me to a deeper understanding of how PyTorch manages memory under the hood. The core issue stems from the fact that indexing operations, under certain conditions, do not create new copies of tensors. Instead, they return *views* of the original data. These views, while behaving like separate tensors in terms of indexing syntax, share the same underlying data buffer and consequently, the same memory address. The ID function in Python, when applied to tensors, returns the memory address of the tensor's data. Thus, two tensors seemingly different due to their indexing structure, can return the same ID if they point to the same underlying memory.

This design choice in PyTorch is deliberate and geared towards optimizing memory usage and computation speed. Copying tensors, especially large ones, is an expensive operation both in terms of memory consumption and computation overhead. By creating views, PyTorch avoids unnecessary memory duplication and allows operations to be performed directly on the original data. However, this also implies that modifications made to a view will also be reflected in the original tensor and other views derived from the same data.

The most common scenario where you will observe this is when you use standard indexing with slices (colon notation). Let's illustrate this with code.

```python
import torch

original_tensor = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
print("Original Tensor:", original_tensor)
print("Original Tensor ID:", id(original_tensor.data))

view_tensor = original_tensor[1:3, 1:3]
print("View Tensor:", view_tensor)
print("View Tensor ID:", id(view_tensor.data))

print("Are IDs the same?:", id(original_tensor.data) == id(view_tensor.data))


view_tensor[0,0] = 99
print("Original Tensor After View Modification:", original_tensor)
print("View Tensor After Modification:", view_tensor)

```

In this example, `original_tensor` is a 3x4 tensor. `view_tensor` is created using a slice, selecting a 2x2 portion of the original.  The print statements show the tensor values, as expected. Crucially, both the `original_tensor.data` and `view_tensor.data` share the same memory address; the IDs are identical. Furthermore, after modifying a value within `view_tensor`, the corresponding value in `original_tensor` is also modified. This clearly demonstrates the "view" nature, or shared memory, of the indexed tensors. It's not a shallow copy, itâ€™s the same data being accessed with a different shape/stride context. If you are performing computations on the original tensor after modifying the view, you can have silent and very painful errors.

The key to understanding this is to distinguish between the tensor *object* itself and the tensor's *data*.  The tensor object contains metadata like the shape, stride, and data type. The `data` attribute of the tensor references the actual memory buffer holding the numerical values. When a view is created, a new tensor object is instantiated but its `data` attribute points to the same memory as the original tensor's `data` attribute.

A second key area where this occurs, which is less obvious than simple indexing, is transposing and reshaping.  While these appear to change the structure of the tensor, they often create new views, rather than copying, particularly when the reshaping operation does not require a change in contiguous storage (the order of the elements in memory). Consider the following:

```python
import torch

tensor_a = torch.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
print("Tensor A:", tensor_a)
print("Tensor A ID:", id(tensor_a.data))

tensor_b = tensor_a.transpose(0, 1)
print("Transposed Tensor B:", tensor_b)
print("Transposed Tensor B ID:", id(tensor_b.data))

print("Are IDs the same:", id(tensor_a.data) == id(tensor_b.data))

tensor_b[0,0] = 100
print("Tensor A After Transpose Modification:", tensor_a)
print("Tensor B After Modification:", tensor_b)

```

Here, we start with `tensor_a`. Then we create `tensor_b` by transposing `tensor_a`. Again, while the tensor values are as expected given the transpose, the IDs for `tensor_a.data` and `tensor_b.data` are identical. This means changing the data in `tensor_b` directly alters the data in `tensor_a`. The memory was not copied during the transpose. While not universally true of all reshape/transpose actions, it is a common optimization, and this demonstrates how operations that seem structural can also lead to shared memory.

Finally, a less direct example involves more advanced indexing, which at times can also still create views, as opposed to always creating a copy.

```python
import torch

base_tensor = torch.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
print("Base Tensor:", base_tensor)
print("Base Tensor ID:", id(base_tensor.data))

index_tensor = torch.tensor([0, 2])
indexed_tensor = base_tensor[:, index_tensor, :]
print("Indexed Tensor:", indexed_tensor)
print("Indexed Tensor ID:", id(indexed_tensor.data))

print("Are IDs the same?:", id(base_tensor.data) == id(indexed_tensor.data))


indexed_tensor[0,0,0] = 200
print("Base Tensor After Index Modification:", base_tensor)
print("Indexed Tensor After Modification:", indexed_tensor)

```

In this case, `index_tensor` provides explicit indices along the second dimension. The result, `indexed_tensor`, selects specific slices from the second dimension of `base_tensor`. Despite involving a non-contiguous selection of elements, under certain conditions, PyTorch is still able to produce this with a view, and here you can again see the modification to `indexed_tensor` also alters the `base_tensor`. Again, this demonstrates how even more advanced indexing can, at times, lead to shared memory.

To avoid unintentional shared memory situations, PyTorch provides the `clone()` method.  Using `clone()` forces a copy of the tensor data to a new location in memory. Using `clone()` will prevent unintended modifications through shared memory. If the purpose is to work with independent copies of tensors, not views, clone is crucial.

For further study, I would recommend focusing on these areas for deeper understanding: PyTorch documentation related to tensor operations specifically focusing on the operations that create views versus copies, detailed discussions on memory management in PyTorch, and explorations of stride and contiguous memory layout within tensors. Understanding these will solidify the concepts of views versus copies and better predict the conditions when shared memory is present. Textbooks that explain the underlying data structures of array-based numerical computation can also help clarify the specific implementations of tensors.  I've found those particularly beneficial for navigating the subtleties of PyTorch. The concept is not PyTorch specific, and those general principles translate well across different numerical frameworks.
