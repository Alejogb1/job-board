TensorFlow's memory management behavior regarding CPU versus GPU allocation is not a simple matter of one consistently exhausting before the other.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks over the past five years has shown that the order of exhaustion depends critically on several interacting factors: the model architecture, the training data size, the TensorFlow configuration, and the available system resources.  There's no universal rule; it's a dynamic interplay of resource allocation and consumption.

**1.  Explanation of Memory Allocation in TensorFlow:**

TensorFlow employs a sophisticated memory management system designed to optimize resource utilization across multiple devices, including CPUs and GPUs.  It dynamically allocates memory as needed, attempting to place tensors on the most suitable device based on several heuristics. The primary factor is the placement of operations within the computation graph.  Operations explicitly assigned to the GPU will, ideally, allocate memory on the GPU.  Conversely, operations lacking explicit placement will default to the CPU.

However, the picture is rarely this clean.  Data transfer between CPU and GPU introduces significant overhead. To mitigate this, TensorFlow utilizes techniques like asynchronous data transfer and memory pinning to overlap computation with data transfer.  Nevertheless, if the model is heavily reliant on GPU computation but the training data resides primarily in CPU memory, you'll observe significant CPU memory consumption while the data is being transferred and processed by the GPU.  In essence, the CPU might be acting as a bottleneck, filling its memory with data destined for the GPU, before the GPU memory itself becomes fully utilized.

Furthermore, TensorFlow's eager execution mode (especially when not meticulously managed) can lead to excessive CPU memory usage. Eager execution executes operations immediately, often without the same level of optimization as graph mode. This results in intermediate tensors being retained in CPU memory, even if their lifetime within the computation graph is short.  This behavior is especially problematic for larger models and datasets.

Lastly, the system's overall memory capacity and available swap space influence the outcome. If the system is constrained by total RAM, TensorFlow might resort to aggressively swapping memory to disk, leading to a significant performance degradation regardless of whether the CPU or GPU memory is exhausted first.  In such scenarios, determining the primary cause of memory exhaustion becomes less relevant as the entire system becomes starved.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate scenarios where CPU memory might exhaust before GPU memory, highlighting how configuration and data handling significantly impact resource usage.  Note that I'm using a simplified setup for clarity, and real-world scenarios involve far more complex considerations.

**Example 1:  Data-bound training with insufficient CPU memory**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate large dataset in CPU memory
data = np.random.rand(1000000, 1000).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000000)

# Define model (GPU placement is important for this example)
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(1000,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training - entire dataset is loaded in CPU before being fed to GPU
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=1, batch_size=32)
```

In this example, the entire dataset is loaded into CPU memory before being processed by the model residing on the GPU. If the dataset is too large for the available CPU RAM, the system will exhaust CPU memory before the GPU is fully utilized.  The key here is the data's location; it's crucial to efficiently manage data loading and transfer to the GPU.

**Example 2: Eager execution with intermediate tensor accumulation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Eager execution causes intermediate tensor buildup in CPU memory
tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)  # Turn eager execution ON

x = tf.random.normal((100000, 1000))
for _ in range(100):  # Multiple iterations exacerbate the problem
    x = tf.matmul(x, tf.random.normal((1000, 1000)))

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(False) # Turn eager execution OFF
```

This demonstrates how repeated operations in eager execution mode, without appropriate memory management, will lead to the accumulation of intermediate tensors in CPU memory.  This is independent of GPU utilization, making CPU memory exhaustion the dominant issue.  The loop continuously creates large tensors, leading to rapid CPU memory exhaustion.


**Example 3: Efficient data pipeline mitigating CPU memory pressure**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Efficient data pipeline using tf.data to manage data flow to the GPU
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((
    np.random.rand(1000000, 1000).astype(np.float32),
    np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000000)
)).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE) #prefetching and batching

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(1000,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(dataset, epochs=1)
```

This example showcases the use of `tf.data` to create an efficient data pipeline.  `prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)` ensures data is pre-fetched and ready for the GPU, minimizing the CPU's role as an intermediary data buffer and potentially preventing CPU memory exhaustion.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To address memory issues in TensorFlow, consult the official TensorFlow documentation on memory management and performance optimization. Investigate and understand the concept of memory pinning, asynchronous data transfer, and different ways to manage dataset loading.  Familiarize yourself with tools for profiling memory usage in TensorFlow, which can help identify memory bottlenecks.  Consider utilizing graph mode for more advanced control over resource allocation, and explore memory-saving techniques like mixed-precision training (using fp16).  Understanding the limitations of your hardware and its memory capacity is crucial for effective resource allocation.
