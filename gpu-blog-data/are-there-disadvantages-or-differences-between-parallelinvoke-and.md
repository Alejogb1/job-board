The crucial distinction between `Parallel.Invoke` and `await Task.Run` lies in their intended use cases and underlying mechanisms, not simply whether they execute code concurrently. `Parallel.Invoke` is designed for executing a set of *actions* in parallel, often with a predetermined count and aiming for efficient utilization of thread pool threads, whereas `await Task.Run` is principally employed to offload work from the current thread to a thread pool thread, returning a task for subsequent asynchronous continuation. This divergence in purpose leads to different performance characteristics and suitability for various scenarios.

A primary difference emerges from how exceptions are handled. With `Parallel.Invoke`, if any of the invoked actions throw an exception, these exceptions are collected and wrapped within an `AggregateException`. The entire operation will not stop execution prematurely; it will strive to execute as many actions as possible and then throw the consolidated exception. `await Task.Run`, on the other hand, typically returns a `Task` that, when awaited, will propagate the first exception that occurs in the underlying task. This different exception handling mechanism impacts how you might structure error management within concurrent applications. I've seen this behavior trip up new developers who assume immediate halt-on-error behavior with `Parallel.Invoke`, leading to unexpected partially completed states.

Secondly, the scope of control differs. `Parallel.Invoke` is explicitly meant for *data-parallel* problems, where you're performing the same or similar operations on independent chunks of data, or different actions simultaneously. The degree of parallelism is implicitly managed by the .NET thread pool, based on the system's resources and the number of available threads. You provide it with actions; it manages the threads and the concurrency. `await Task.Run`, however, provides more fine-grained control. You can create a `Task` that embodies an operation, and you can orchestrate and compose multiple such tasks, allowing for asynchronous patterns that don't necessarily fit the mold of simple parallel execution. This flexibility is critical in creating complex asynchronous workflows, event-driven architectures, or when interacting with I/O operations.

The third difference arises in overhead. Because `Parallel.Invoke` is optimized for data-parallel processing, it may have a lower overhead when executing multiple simple actions simultaneously. The thread pool is more adept at managing and reusing threads, reducing context switches. `Task.Run`, although efficient, still incurs the overhead of creating a `Task` object and scheduling the work onto the thread pool. Iâ€™ve noticed, in high-throughput applications, small performance gains using `Parallel.Invoke` when the operations are homogeneous and can be executed independently.

Let's look at some code examples to illustrate these points.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Threading;

public class ParallelInvokeExample
{
    public static void ProcessData(int data)
    {
       //Simulate some work
       Console.WriteLine($"Thread ID:{Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId} Processing data: {data}");
       Thread.Sleep(1000); 
        if(data%3 == 0){
            throw new InvalidOperationException($"Error processing {data}");
        }
    }

    public static void RunExample()
    {
        try
        {
             Parallel.Invoke(
                    () => ProcessData(1),
                    () => ProcessData(2),
                    () => ProcessData(3),
                    () => ProcessData(4),
                    () => ProcessData(5)
             );
        }
        catch (AggregateException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Parallel.Invoke Aggregate Exception Caught: {ex.Message}");
            foreach(var innerEx in ex.InnerExceptions){
                Console.WriteLine($"Inner Exception: {innerEx.Message}");
            }
            
        }
    }
}
```

This `ParallelInvokeExample` showcases how `Parallel.Invoke` handles multiple actions. Notice the use of `AggregateException`. Although `ProcessData(3)` throws an error, other calls, such as `ProcessData(1)`, will continue to execute. The `AggregateException` consolidates all the exceptions into one exception. Also, note the thread IDs; `Parallel.Invoke` leverages thread pool threads to do its work. In scenarios where you have a set of independent operations to be executed concurrently with uniform time, `Parallel.Invoke` is ideal.

The next example demonstrates a basic use case of `await Task.Run`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Threading;

public class TaskRunExample
{
     public static async Task<int> LongRunningOperation()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Long Running Task on Thread ID:{Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
        await Task.Delay(2000);
        Console.WriteLine($"Long Running Task on Thread ID:{Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}, Done");
        return 42;
    }

    public static async Task RunExample()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Main Thread ID:{Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
        var resultTask =  Task.Run(() => LongRunningOperation());
        Console.WriteLine($"Main Thread Id, Before Await : {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
        int result = await resultTask;
        Console.WriteLine($"Main Thread Id, After Await : {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");

    }
}
```

Here, `Task.Run` executes a long-running operation on a thread pool thread, returning a `Task`. The main thread will continue executing immediately and wait asynchronously using `await`, allowing for responsive user interfaces or asynchronous service calls. This example demonstrates the fundamental asynchronous programming pattern facilitated by `await Task.Run`. I've personally found that for UI applications and complex task orchestration, it provides greater control and responsiveness compared to a purely parallel execution approach.

Finally, the last example demonstrates how exceptions are handled with `Task.Run`, in contrast to the behavior of `Parallel.Invoke`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Threading;

public class TaskRunExceptionExample
{
    public static async Task<int>  FailingOperation(int input)
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"Failing operation start on Thread ID:{Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
        await Task.Delay(1000);
       if(input%2==0){
           throw new InvalidOperationException("Input is even");
       }
      return 42;

    }

   public static async Task RunExample(){

        try{
         var task1 = Task.Run(() => FailingOperation(1));
         var task2 = Task.Run(() => FailingOperation(2));
            
         await Task.WhenAll(task1,task2);
         
        
         Console.WriteLine("All tasks completed without Exception");
        } catch(Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Exception Caught: {ex.Message}");
        }

   }
}
```

In this `TaskRunExceptionExample`, the `await Task.WhenAll(task1,task2)` operation waits for both tasks to complete and will throw the first exception it encounters. Therefore only the exception from the call to `FailingOperation(2)` which throws an exception, will be bubbled up. This behaviour is different to the exception handling of `Parallel.Invoke`, which bundles all exceptions that occur within it, as demonstrated in the first example.

Regarding resource recommendations, I would suggest exploring the documentation on asynchronous programming patterns in .NET, paying particular attention to `Task`, `Task<T>`, and `async/await`. Furthermore, detailed reviews of the Parallel Task Library (PTL) documentation are essential for fully understanding `Parallel.Invoke` and other parallel execution functionalities. Finally, reviewing the threading model in .NET, specifically the workings of the thread pool, is critical to optimizing the performance of your concurrent applications.
