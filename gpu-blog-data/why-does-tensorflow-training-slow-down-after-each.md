TensorFlow training slowdown after each epoch is frequently attributable to the accumulation of temporary files and the increasing size of the computational graph in memory, particularly when dealing with large datasets or complex models.  My experience debugging performance issues in large-scale image recognition projects has highlighted this consistently.  The slowdown isn't inherently tied to the epoch completion itself, but rather to the cumulative effect of several factors exacerbated by each iteration.

**1.  Explanation:**

The primary culprit is often the gradual growth of the computational graph within TensorFlow's memory. Each epoch involves forward and backward passes through the network. During the forward pass, TensorFlow constructs a computational graph representing the operations needed to calculate the loss.  While this graph is optimized through techniques like graph optimization passes, the intermediate tensors and variables generated during each forward pass aren't automatically discarded, especially if you're not carefully managing resource allocation.  This leads to a progressively larger memory footprint.  Further compounding this issue is the accumulation of temporary files created during the training process. These temporary files, often related to checkpointing, summaries, and profiling data, can occupy significant disk space and slow down I/O operations as the training progresses.

Another contributing factor, especially relevant to distributed training setups which I've worked with extensively, is the communication overhead between workers.  As the epoch count increases, so does the amount of data exchanged between workers, potentially bottlenecking the training process.  This is especially pronounced if the network bandwidth or inter-worker communication protocols aren't optimized.

Finally, the inherent nature of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants means that, while each epoch aims to improve the model's performance, the magnitude of improvement diminishes over time.  This is because the model converges towards an optimal solution, and the gradients become smaller, leading to smaller parameter updates and, consequently, potentially slower perceived progress. However, this is usually a minor factor compared to the resource management issues.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Efficient Memory Management with `tf.function` and `tf.GradientTape`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels, model, optimizer):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(images)
    loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(labels, predictions)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  return loss

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
  for batch in dataset:
    loss = train_step(batch['images'], batch['labels'], model, optimizer)
  print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}: Loss {loss.numpy()}')

```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates efficient memory management through the use of `tf.function`.  This compiles the training step into a graph, allowing for optimizations and reducing overhead.  Furthermore, `tf.GradientTape` ensures that gradients are calculated efficiently, automatically releasing resources after use. This approach significantly mitigates the memory bloat associated with building and discarding the computational graph repeatedly in each iteration.


**Example 2:  Utilizing Checkpointing Strategically:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

checkpoint_path = "training_checkpoints/cp-{epoch:04d}.ckpt"
checkpoint_dir = os.path.dirname(checkpoint_path)

cp_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=checkpoint_path,
    verbose=1,
    save_weights_only=True,
    period=5  # Save every 5 epochs
)

model.fit(..., callbacks=[cp_callback])
```

**Commentary:** This example shows how to use the `ModelCheckpoint` callback to save the model's weights periodically.  Saving after every epoch can be unnecessarily resource-intensive.  Adjusting the `period` parameter (here set to 5 epochs) allows for checkpointing at strategic intervals, balancing the need to recover from training interruptions with the overhead of saving numerous checkpoints.  Moreover, `save_weights_only=True` minimizes the size of the saved checkpoints.


**Example 3:  Managing Temporary Files:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os
import shutil

# ... training code ...

# After training, remove temporary files (adjust path as needed)
temp_dir = "/tmp/tensorflow_training_temp"
if os.path.exists(temp_dir):
    shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)

# Clear the default TensorFlow log directory
tf.compat.v1.logging.set_verbosity(tf.compat.v1.logging.ERROR)  #Suppress warnings

```

**Commentary:** This illustrates the manual cleanup of temporary files generated during training. TensorFlow, by default, stores numerous temporary files.  This example shows how to locate and remove a specific directory containing these files after training concludes.  Itâ€™s important to understand your specific TensorFlow configuration to identify the location of these temporary files.  Remember, improper deletion of critical files could lead to errors; hence, thorough understanding and caution are necessary.  Suppression of unnecessary logging also contributes to decreased I/O operations and improved training speed.
