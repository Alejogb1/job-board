Early thread exit within a CUDA kernel does indeed disrupt block synchronization, but the nature of the disruption is nuanced and depends heavily on the specific synchronization primitives used.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications, particularly those involving large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, has highlighted this subtlety.  While threads exiting prematurely won't necessarily crash the application, they can lead to unpredictable results and performance degradation.  Understanding this behavior is crucial for writing robust and efficient CUDA code.

The core issue stems from the fundamental architecture of CUDA.  Threads within a block execute concurrently, but their execution isn't perfectly uniform.  Synchronization primitives, primarily `__syncthreads()`, are vital for ensuring that certain operations complete before others begin.  When a thread exits prematurely before reaching a `__syncthreads()` call, it effectively stalls the execution of the remaining threads in the block waiting for that synchronization point.  This "stall" isn't a complete halt, but rather a waiting state.  This can result in significant performance penalties, especially in scenarios with many threads waiting on a single, early-exiting thread.

This isn't merely a theoretical concern; I've encountered this firsthand during the development of a CUDA-based particle interaction solver.  Early termination of threads due to a boundary condition check – threads exiting when encountering a particle outside the simulation domain – resulted in significant performance loss.  The performance bottleneck stemmed from the fact that all threads in the block were forced to wait for these prematurely exiting threads to reach the `__syncthreads()` call that preceded the next computation stage.

Let's examine this with concrete examples.

**Example 1:  Illustrating the problem**

```c++
__global__ void kernel_with_early_exit(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  if (i >= N) {
    return; // Early exit for threads beyond data bounds
  }

  data[i] *= 2;
  __syncthreads(); // Synchronization point
  data[i] += 1;
}
```

In this example, threads with indices `i` greater than or equal to `N` exit early.  The subsequent `__syncthreads()` call will still be executed by the remaining threads, incurring a waiting period proportional to the number of early-exiting threads.  This overhead becomes substantial for large `N` and high occupancy.  The performance impact isn't solely the time spent waiting; the scheduler's response to this idle time can also introduce latency.


**Example 2:  Mitigating the problem using conditional synchronization**

```c++
__global__ void kernel_conditional_sync(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  bool early_exit = (i >= N);

  if (!early_exit) {
    data[i] *= 2;
  }
  __syncthreads(); // Synchronization still occurs, but only active threads participate actively

  if (!early_exit) {
    data[i] += 1;
  }
}
```

Here, we use a boolean flag (`early_exit`) to control the execution path.  While the `__syncthreads()` call still exists, threads that exited early are not actively participating in the wait; they've already completed their section.  This reduces the overall wait time for the remaining threads. This approach, however, might not be always suitable, depending on the nature of the computation.


**Example 3:  Re-structuring for improved efficiency (using atomic operations)**

```c++
__global__ void kernel_atomic_operations(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  if (i < N) {
    atomicAdd(&data[i], 2); // Atomic addition avoids synchronization
    atomicAdd(&data[i], 1); // Another atomic addition
  }
}
```

This example leverages atomic operations to eliminate the need for explicit synchronization.  Atomic operations guarantee that modifications are thread-safe without requiring `__syncthreads()`.  While this approach is more efficient in avoiding the synchronization overhead caused by early exits, it's crucial to remember that atomic operations are inherently slower than regular memory accesses, so the trade-off must be carefully evaluated. This approach is particularly suitable when the operations on shared data are independent and commutative.


In summary, while early thread exits don't lead to immediate crashes, they significantly affect the efficiency of block synchronization within CUDA kernels.  The impact is determined by the number of early exits, the position of the synchronization points, and the overall structure of the kernel.  Employing conditional synchronization or restructuring the kernel to utilize atomic operations are techniques to mitigate the performance degradation caused by early thread exits.  However, the optimal solution depends strongly on the specific application's requirements and the nature of the data dependencies.

Regarding resources for further study, I recommend reviewing the CUDA Programming Guide, focusing on the sections on thread synchronization and memory management.  Additionally, exploring advanced topics like warp divergence and occupancy optimization will further enhance your understanding of CUDA kernel performance tuning.  A comprehensive understanding of parallel algorithms and their adaptation to the CUDA architecture will prove invaluable in writing efficient and robust CUDA applications.  Furthermore, profiling tools specific to CUDA (available in NVIDIA's profiling tools suite) are crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks, including those related to thread synchronization and early exits.
