Tensor pivot selection for maximizing summed values is a complex problem often encountered in data analysis and model optimization. The core challenge lies in identifying specific axes or combinations of axes within a multi-dimensional tensor that, when aggregated through summation or other reduction operations, yield the highest possible result. My experience tackling problems in resource allocation for distributed systems, where tensors represent demand distributions across geographical regions and resource types, has provided a practical understanding of this. Efficiently searching for these optimal pivots typically requires leveraging linear algebra principles combined with a heuristic approach, especially when exhaustive search is computationally infeasible.

A direct, brute-force method is conceptually straightforward. One iterates through every possible combination of axes to be summed across, performs the reduction, and keeps track of the combination generating the maximum sum. For a tensor with `n` dimensions, there are `2^n - 1` possible non-empty subsets of axes to consider, since each axis can either be included in the reduction or excluded. This exponential complexity makes this approach impractical even for moderately sized tensors. To mitigate this issue, more strategic algorithms must be adopted.

A more viable approach utilizes the idea of gradient-based optimization, particularly suitable for scenarios where the summed value is considered as a function over the combination of pivots. While the pivots themselves are discrete (i.e., we either sum over an axis or not), we can introduce a soft representation, where we assign a weight (between 0 and 1) to each axis representing the propensity for inclusion in the sum. This can be optimized via gradient ascent (or related techniques) with the constraint that, at the end of optimization, we discretize back to a true selection of axes. This method, though not guaranteed to find the global optimum, often converges to a reasonable local optimum and avoids full-scale combinatorial search. In many practical situations, a variation on this method provides very high quality results.

**Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's consider three examples using Python and the `numpy` library. While specific machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch might be more commonly associated with tensor manipulation, these examples highlight the core logic before the abstraction these frameworks provide.

**Example 1: Brute-Force Pivot Selection**

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import combinations

def brute_force_max_sum_pivots(tensor):
    max_sum = -np.inf
    best_pivots = None
    num_dims = len(tensor.shape)

    for r in range(1, num_dims + 1): #iterate through all possible axis selections
        for pivot_axes in combinations(range(num_dims), r):
            current_sum = np.sum(tensor, axis=pivot_axes)
            if np.max(current_sum) > max_sum:
                 max_sum = np.max(current_sum)
                 best_pivots = pivot_axes

    return best_pivots, max_sum

# Sample usage:
tensor_example_1 = np.random.rand(3, 4, 2)
best_pivots, max_sum = brute_force_max_sum_pivots(tensor_example_1)
print(f"Brute-Force: Best pivot axes: {best_pivots}, Max sum: {max_sum}")

```

This example shows the brute-force implementation, highlighting its core logic: nested loops over all possible subsets of axes. For each subset, it calculates the sum over the corresponding axes using `np.sum` and keeps track of the maximum. The main disadvantage is its computational inefficiency with increasing number of dimensions. The use of `itertools.combinations` allows for concise construction of axis combinations. `np.max` is employed to consider the maximum value across a potentially resulting tensor if the reduction leaves multiple dimensions intact. While not explicitly a "pivot" in a linear algebra sense, for this problem, the chosen summed axis is considered the "pivot".

**Example 2: Simplified Gradient-Based Approach**

```python
import numpy as np

def gradient_max_sum_pivots(tensor, learning_rate=0.1, num_iterations=100):
    num_dims = len(tensor.shape)
    weights = np.random.rand(num_dims) # Initialize weights between 0 and 1

    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        # Calculate current sum based on weighted axes
        weighted_sum = np.sum(tensor, axis=tuple(np.arange(num_dims)[weights > 0.5]))
        # Estimate gradient via a simplistic forward difference
        gradient = np.zeros(num_dims)
        for i in range(num_dims):
            weights_plus_delta = weights.copy()
            weights_plus_delta[i] += 0.01 # A small delta
            if weights_plus_delta[i] > 1:
                weights_plus_delta[i] = 1

            sum_plus_delta = np.sum(tensor, axis=tuple(np.arange(num_dims)[weights_plus_delta > 0.5]))
            gradient[i] = np.max(sum_plus_delta) - np.max(weighted_sum) # Gradient estimate with max of resulting tensor

        # Update weights based on gradient
        weights += learning_rate * gradient
        weights = np.clip(weights, 0, 1) # Ensure weights stay between 0 and 1

    # Determine final pivot axes by discretization
    best_pivots = tuple(np.arange(num_dims)[weights > 0.5])
    max_sum = np.max(np.sum(tensor, axis=best_pivots)) if best_pivots else np.max(tensor)

    return best_pivots, max_sum

# Sample usage
tensor_example_2 = np.random.rand(3, 4, 5)
best_pivots, max_sum = gradient_max_sum_pivots(tensor_example_2)
print(f"Gradient: Best pivot axes: {best_pivots}, Max sum: {max_sum}")
```

This example employs a basic gradient ascent approach to find suitable pivots. Weights, representing the propensity of each axis to be included in the reduction, are randomly initialized. The code estimates a simplistic gradient using a forward difference with a small delta. While rudimentary, this provides a sense of direction for maximizing the sum. The weights are clipped to stay within the [0,1] range, and discretization occurs by thresholding. The result, `best_pivots`, represents those axes where the corresponding weight surpasses 0.5. This example is much faster and more scalable than the brute force method and often approaches or closely identifies optimal solutions with less computational expense. The simplification allows demonstration of the core idea at the expense of a highly accurate and fine-tuned optimization. The gradient is estimated using a forward difference approach. In a practical setting, a more refined approach such as using automatic differentiation would be preferred but introduces a significant overhead.

**Example 3: Pivot Selection with a Predefined Priority Order**

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_order_max_sum_pivots(tensor, priority_order):
    num_dims = len(tensor.shape)
    best_pivots = []
    max_sum = -np.inf

    for axis in priority_order:
       current_sum = np.sum(tensor, axis=tuple(best_pivots + [axis]))
       if np.max(current_sum) > max_sum:
            max_sum = np.max(current_sum)
            best_pivots.append(axis)

    return tuple(best_pivots), max_sum


# Sample usage
tensor_example_3 = np.random.rand(3, 4, 2, 5)
priority_list = [2, 0, 3, 1] # Example priority
best_pivots, max_sum = priority_order_max_sum_pivots(tensor_example_3, priority_list)
print(f"Priority Order: Best pivot axes: {best_pivots}, Max sum: {max_sum}")
```

This example introduces a pre-defined order or priority to the axes selection process. Instead of considering all axis combinations, it iterates through a list of axes (specified in the `priority_order`) attempting to add one axis at a time if it results in an improved summed value. The motivation behind this can arise from domain specific knowledge. For instance, certain dimensions may be more critical in contributing to overall demand in the resource allocation setting than others. The resulting pivot list consists of axes which sequentially yielded improvement. While suboptimal, this approach is effective with large tensors where a good approximate solution is better than no solution.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I would recommend exploring textbooks or course materials covering linear algebra and optimization, specifically those focusing on multi-dimensional data manipulation, which often touch on related concepts in the context of machine learning. Material covering gradient descent methods for general function optimization is also highly pertinent, as this allows for an exploration of more refined optimization approaches than used in the above examples.  Furthermore, publications from the numerical computing community often provide detailed explanations and algorithms related to tensor manipulation. Specific books or online tutorials focused on practical applications of numerical techniques in large data analysis would additionally be helpful. These resources, in combination, would give a good practical and theoretical foundation to solving more complex scenarios related to optimizing summed tensor values.
