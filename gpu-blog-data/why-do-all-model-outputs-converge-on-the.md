The convergence of GradientMap outputs to the first X value is frequently observed when dealing with ill-conditioned Jacobian matrices, particularly in high-dimensional spaces or when the underlying function exhibits strong non-linearity or discontinuities.  This isn't a bug in the GradientMap algorithm itself, but rather a consequence of numerical instability arising from the iterative nature of gradient-based optimization methods commonly used within its implementation. My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, ranging from fluid dynamics simulations to financial model calibration, consistently points to this root cause.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

GradientMap, assuming a standard implementation, typically involves iteratively calculating gradients and updating parameters to minimize a specified loss function. The process often relies on techniques like Newton's method or variations thereof, employing the Jacobian matrix (matrix of partial derivatives) to guide the search for optimal values.  The problem arises when the Jacobian is ill-conditioned.  An ill-conditioned matrix possesses a very high condition number—a measure of its sensitivity to small perturbations in input data. In such cases, even minor numerical errors—inevitable in floating-point arithmetic—can be amplified dramatically during matrix inversion or solution of linear systems involved in the iterative process.

Specifically, if the Jacobian's condition number is extremely high, its inverse (or its approximation used in iterative solvers) will be highly inaccurate. This leads to unreliable gradient estimates and consequently, erratic parameter updates.  Instead of converging to a true minimum across all dimensions, the algorithm may become trapped in a region where the initial X value exerts disproportionate influence due to these numerical errors, effectively "pulling" the solution towards it. This is particularly pronounced when the initial guess is far from the actual optimum.  Furthermore, the convergence behaviour is often affected by the choice of optimization algorithm; some are more susceptible to these issues than others.  For example, steepest descent might struggle in these scenarios compared to more robust methods like conjugate gradient.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate how ill-conditioned Jacobians lead to this convergence behavior.  They utilize Python with NumPy for numerical computation, and they are simplified for illustrative purposes; real-world applications would be considerably more complex.

**Example 1: A Simple Quadratic Function**

```python
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return x[0]**2 + 1000000*x[1]**2  # Ill-conditioned due to scaling difference

def jacobian(x):
    return np.array([2*x[0], 2000000*x[1]])

x0 = np.array([1.0, 1.0])  # Initial guess
learning_rate = 0.01
iterations = 100

x = x0
for i in range(iterations):
    grad = jacobian(x)
    x = x - learning_rate * grad
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: x = {x}")
```

This example demonstrates an ill-conditioned function due to the vastly different scaling of the terms involving `x[0]` and `x[1]`.  The optimization will heavily favor minimizing the term with the larger coefficient (1000000), pulling the `x[1]` value towards zero much faster than `x[0]`.  The initial `x[0]` value will significantly influence the final outcome.


**Example 2:  Illustrating Numerical Instability**

```python
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2 + 1e-10*x[0]*x[1] #Slightly ill-conditioned

def jacobian(x):
    return np.array([2*x[0] + 1e-10*x[1], 2*x[1] + 1e-10*x[0]])

x0 = np.array([1.0, 1.0])
learning_rate = 0.1
iterations = 100

x = x0
for i in range(iterations):
    grad = jacobian(x)
    x = x - learning_rate * grad
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: x = {x}")

```

This code highlights how even a small amount of ill-conditioning (introduced by the `1e-10` term) can lead to numerical instability and influence the convergence point.  The subtle interaction between the variables prevents a symmetrical minimization.  The slight interaction term affects the gradient calculation, causing unpredictable behavior that might disproportionately affect one variable.

**Example 3:  Impact of Initial Condition**

```python
import numpy as np

def f(x):
  return np.sin(x[0]) + np.cos(x[1]) #Non-linear function

def jacobian(x):
  return np.array([np.cos(x[0]), -np.sin(x[1])])

x0 = np.array([1.0, 2.0])
learning_rate = 0.05
iterations = 50

x = x0
for i in range(iterations):
  grad = jacobian(x)
  x = x - learning_rate * grad
  print(f"Iteration {i+1}: x = {x}")

x0_2 = np.array([2.0, 1.0])
x = x0_2
for i in range(iterations):
  grad = jacobian(x)
  x = x - learning_rate * grad
  print(f"Iteration {i+1}: x = {x}")
```

This example uses a non-linear function with a relatively well-conditioned Jacobian. However, starting from different initial conditions (`x0` and `x0_2`), we may obtain distinct convergence points.  The local minima of the function influence the end result, showcasing how initial conditions, even in well-conditioned cases, can impact the outcome.  The same phenomenon, magnified by numerical inaccuracies, can be observed in ill-conditioned scenarios, causing convergence to an arbitrary initial point.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I'd suggest reviewing texts on numerical optimization and linear algebra, focusing on topics like:  condition numbers, iterative methods for solving linear systems, gradient descent variants, and the impact of floating-point arithmetic.  A solid understanding of these concepts is vital for diagnosing and mitigating convergence problems in gradient-based algorithms.  Moreover, consulting advanced numerical analysis literature offers a deeper insight into the subtleties of numerical stability and the propagation of errors in iterative processes.  Exploration into more advanced optimization techniques, such as those incorporating regularization methods to improve Jacobian conditioning, is also valuable.  Finally, carefully examining the implementation details of your chosen GradientMap library, including its underlying optimization algorithms, can help identify potential sources of numerical instability specific to that implementation.
