Determining the Keras backend in use requires a direct examination of the Keras configuration, not inference based on circumstantial evidence.  My experience troubleshooting deep learning deployments across diverse hardware platforms, including embedded systems and high-performance clusters, has highlighted the importance of this explicit verification.  Ambiguity on this point can lead to significant debugging headaches, particularly concerning incompatibility issues between custom operations and backend-specific functionalities.

The backend selection isn't implicitly revealed within typical Keras model training output.  While the underlying computations leverage the backend, Keras itself doesn't consistently log this information unless specifically requested. The key lies in accessing the `backend` module within Keras and inspecting its properties.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras operates as a high-level API, abstracting away the intricacies of lower-level tensor manipulation libraries.  TensorFlow and Theano (now largely superseded, but still relevant for legacy projects) are examples of such backends.  They provide the core functionality for tensor operations, automatic differentiation, and optimization algorithms that power the neural network training process.  The choice of backend impacts the underlying implementation of Keras operations, potentially influencing performance and compatibility with specific hardware or custom layers.  Crucially, the selected backend is determined during the Keras initialization process and generally remains fixed throughout a given session unless explicitly modified.  Attempts to switch backends mid-session are prone to errors and are generally discouraged.

Several strategies can be used to ascertain the active backend. The most straightforward involves directly querying the Keras backend module.  This approach provides a definitive answer without relying on indirect clues or assumptions.  Less direct approaches exist, such as examining specific tensor attributes, which I have found to be less reliable and prone to misinterpretation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following code examples demonstrate three distinct methods to confirm the Keras backend.  Each method offers a slightly different level of detail and approach.


**Example 1: Direct Backend Identification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf #Import tensorflow to ensure Keras uses TF backend
import keras
import keras.backend as K

print(f"The Keras backend is: {K.backend()}")
print(K.floatx()) #Prints the default floating-point precision


#Example demonstrating backend specific functions
if K.backend() == 'tensorflow':
    print("TensorFlow backend specific operation")
    tensor = tf.constant([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
    print(K.sum(tensor))

elif K.backend() == 'theano':
    print("Theano backend specific operation (Not recommended due to Theano's deprecation)")
    # Implement Theano-specific code here.  This section would typically involve importing theano and using its specific functions.  Due to the deprecation of Theano, I've chosen not to include this portion for clarity and to avoid promoting outdated practices.
else:
    print("Unsupported backend detected.")
```

This example leverages the `keras.backend` module's `backend()` function for a direct and unambiguous determination of the backend.  The inclusion of a conditional statement illustrates how backend-specific code can be executed based on this identification. The `floatx()` function returns the default floating-point precision used, which is another characteristic differentiating backends.  In my experience, handling the potential for unsupported backends, as shown with the `else` statement, is critical for robust code.


**Example 2:  Inspecting Tensor Attributes (Less Reliable)**

```python
import keras
import keras.backend as K
from keras.layers import Input, Dense
import numpy as np

#Simple model definition for demonstration purposes
input_tensor = Input(shape=(10,))
x = Dense(5)(input_tensor)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=x)

#Attempting to infer backend from tensor type - Less reliable than Example 1
tensor = model.input
print(f"Tensor type: {type(tensor)}")

# This method is inherently less reliable because the underlying tensor type might be abstracted in more recent versions of Keras
# and might vary depending on the backend's implementation, not providing a definitive backend identification.
```

This approach attempts to infer the backend from the type of tensors used within Keras. However, this method is less reliable than directly querying `K.backend()`. The underlying tensor types might be abstracted or change between Keras versions, making this approach unreliable and unsuitable for robust code.


**Example 3: Checking Keras Configuration File (Not Recommended)**

While not directly a code example, it's pertinent to address the potential examination of Keras configuration files.  Keras maintains configuration settings, which *may* reflect the backend choice. However, I strongly advise against relying on this method due to its indirect nature and potential for variations across different Keras installations and environments.  Directly accessing the backend module, as shown in Example 1, remains the most dependable method.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation, the TensorFlow documentation (if using TensorFlow as a backend), and any relevant documentation for older, deprecated backends should be consulted for comprehensive information and troubleshooting guidance.  Examining the source code of Keras (should advanced debugging be required) can offer further insights into the backend interaction.  Understanding the differences between Keras and the underlying backend is fundamental to effective debugging and optimization.  Focusing on the official documentation will always provide the most up-to-date and reliable information compared to other, less controlled sources.
