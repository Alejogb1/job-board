Custom Keras loss functions often require more than just a single scalar value to represent the loss.  In my experience debugging complex generative models, the need to access intermediate computations within a custom loss function frequently arises for monitoring, analysis, and debugging purposes.  Simply returning a single loss value obscures crucial information regarding the model's performance across different aspects of the output.  Effectively retrieving these outputs necessitates understanding how Keras handles tensor manipulation and leveraging appropriate data structures for return values.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A Keras custom loss function is essentially a Python function that accepts two arguments: `y_true` (the ground truth) and `y_pred` (the model's prediction).  The standard practice is to return a single tensor representing the overall loss.  However, to retrieve additional information, we must return a tuple or a dictionary containing both the loss scalar and any desired intermediate computations.  The key is structuring this return value such that Keras understands which element represents the loss to be minimized during the training process.  This is crucial because Keras's backpropagation mechanism relies on this scalar loss value.  Returning a dictionary offers superior clarity and organization compared to using a tuple, particularly when dealing with numerous intermediate outputs, each requiring meaningful identification.

The structure of the return value is vital.  For a tuple, the first element *must* be the loss scalar; subsequent elements represent the additional outputs. For a dictionary, the key representing the scalar loss should be explicitly defined, often as `"loss"` or a similarly clear identifier.  The choice depends on the complexity and quantity of additional information needed.  If only one or two extra pieces of data are needed, a tuple might suffice.  For more complex scenarios, a dictionary provides significantly better organization and readability.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Tuple Return for Simple Additional Output**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def custom_loss_tuple(y_true, y_pred):
    mse = K.mean(K.square(y_true - y_pred)) # Mean Squared Error
    mae = K.mean(K.abs(y_true - y_pred)) # Mean Absolute Error
    return mse, mae #Tuple: First element is loss, second is additional output

model.compile(loss=custom_loss_tuple, optimizer='adam')

# Accessing outputs during training:  Requires custom training loop or callbacks to access the secondary output (mae in this case).
# This isn't directly accessible through standard Keras history.

```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates returning a tuple. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the primary loss, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is an additional output.  Direct access to `mae` during standard `model.fit()` training requires a custom training loop or callbacks to capture and store the additional output returned from the loss function. Standard `model.fit()` history only contains the primary loss (MSE).


**Example 2: Dictionary Return for Multiple Outputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def custom_loss_dict(y_true, y_pred):
    mse = K.mean(K.square(y_true - y_pred))
    mae = K.mean(K.abs(y_true - y_pred))
    rmse = K.sqrt(mse)
    return {'loss': mse, 'mae': mae, 'rmse': rmse}

model.compile(loss={'loss': custom_loss_dict}, optimizer='adam') #Specify 'loss' key

# Accessing outputs during training:  Requires custom callbacks for detailed output access.

```

**Commentary:** This improves on the first example by using a dictionary.  The `'loss'` key explicitly identifies the loss scalar.  This structure is preferable for multiple additional outputs, enhancing readability and making it clear which value represents the loss minimized by the optimizer.  Again, standard Keras history only logs the 'loss' value.  Additional metrics would require custom callbacks.


**Example 3: Handling Multiple Outputs with Weighted Loss**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def custom_loss_weighted(y_true, y_pred):
    mse = K.mean(K.square(y_true[:,0] - y_pred[:,0])) # MSE for first output
    mae = K.mean(K.abs(y_true[:,1] - y_pred[:,1]))  # MAE for second output

    weighted_loss = 0.7 * mse + 0.3 * mae # Weighted average of losses

    return {'loss': weighted_loss, 'mse': mse, 'mae': mae}

model.compile(loss={'loss': custom_loss_weighted}, optimizer='adam')

#Accessing outputs requires custom callbacks.


```

**Commentary:** This example showcases a more advanced scenario involving multiple outputs with a weighted average loss. It highlights how multiple loss components can be combined to reflect the relative importance of different aspects of the model's prediction.  The dictionary return allows tracking individual components ('mse', 'mae') alongside the final weighted loss ('loss').  Note how the output shapes from y_true and y_pred are handled for the MSE and MAE calculations separately.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Keras custom loss functions and tensor manipulations, I strongly recommend consulting the official Keras documentation.  Thoroughly studying the section on custom layers and models will provide valuable context for understanding the underlying mechanisms.  Furthermore, reviewing materials on TensorFlow's tensor operations and broadcasting will prove indispensable for manipulating tensors within the loss function.  Finally, exploring resources related to custom training loops and Keras callbacks will be crucial for capturing and utilizing those additional outputs returned by your customized loss function.  These resources offer a comprehensive approach to handling advanced Keras functionalities, particularly concerning loss functions.
