The performance of weighted cross-entropy loss in TensorFlow hinges significantly on the specific imbalance characteristics of the dataset. I've found through numerous projects involving image segmentation and text classification that a blanket recommendation doesn't apply; the 'better' approach is highly context-dependent. Standard weighted cross-entropy assigns static weights to each class based on their frequency, while more advanced approaches dynamically adjust these weights during training, often providing superior results with highly imbalanced data.

Fundamentally, cross-entropy loss calculates the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and the true label distribution. In binary classification scenarios, the loss function can be expressed as:

```
L = - [y * log(p) + (1 - y) * log(1 - p)]
```

Where 'y' is the true label (0 or 1), and 'p' is the predicted probability of class 1. In multi-class classification, this extends to:

```
L = - Σ [y_i * log(p_i)]
```

Here, 'y_i' is a one-hot encoded vector representing the true class, and 'p_i' is the predicted probability for each class. Class imbalance occurs when certain classes are drastically underrepresented compared to others. If left unaddressed, the model often overfits to the majority class, essentially ignoring the minority classes. Weighted cross-entropy mitigates this by incorporating weights that amplify the contribution of underrepresented classes to the total loss. The underlying principle is to increase the penalty for misclassifying minority samples.

Let's first consider the standard weighted approach, applied in TensorFlow using `tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits`. In this method, weights are usually calculated *a priori* based on the inverse class frequency. For example, if class A has 1000 instances and class B has 100, the weight for class A could be 0.1, and the weight for class B could be 1.  This strategy, though simple, proves surprisingly effective in many common scenarios where imbalance is not exceedingly extreme. Here's how it's implemented:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'logits' are the pre-softmax output of a model and 'labels' are one-hot encoded.
def standard_weighted_loss(logits, labels, class_weights):
  """Calculates weighted cross-entropy loss using static class weights."""
  return tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=logits, pos_weight=class_weights)

# Example: Class weights calculated based on inverse frequency.
# For instance, if there are two classes, one has 100 samples and other 1000, then
# we can set the pos_weight for class 0 to be 1000/100 = 10, and class 1 to be 1
class_weights = [10.0, 1.0]  # Manually specified weights
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0]]) # Example labels (one-hot)
y_pred = tf.constant([[2.1, -0.1], [-0.5, 1.5], [1.8, 0.2]])  # Example logits


loss = standard_weighted_loss(y_pred, y_true, class_weights)
print(loss)
```

In this example, `class_weights` act as positional weights. If your classes are labeled 0 and 1 (as is the case in the sample tensor `y_true`), then `class_weights[0]` is the penalty multiplier for the loss function associated with class 0 and `class_weights[1]` for class 1. This function calculates the loss based on the provided logits, labels, and weights, returning a tensor of loss values which need further aggregation to produce a scalar loss value. This method is easily applied to binary or multi-class classification using one-hot encoded labels.  The critical part is determining suitable values for `class_weights`. While inverse frequency is a common approach, experimentation may be necessary.

However, static weights can be suboptimal when the data distribution changes over time or when some classes are incredibly rare. In these cases, employing a *dynamic* weighting strategy can be more effective. Focal Loss, introduced to tackle the problem of class imbalance, attempts to address this issue. Focal Loss addresses the issue of easy negatives dominating the loss during training, as most negatives are easy to classify.  It down-weights correctly classified examples, thus focusing training on difficult examples. The key formulation is:

```
L_focal = - α_t (1 - p_t)^γ log(p_t)
```

Where 'p_t' is the probability of the ground truth class. α_t is a balancing factor similar to class weights, γ is the focusing parameter and regulates the rate of down-weighting of easy examples. γ is commonly set to 2, but it’s a hyperparameter that might need adjustment. It significantly increases the weight of the hard and often minority examples. In TensorFlow, focal loss isn't available directly but is readily implemented:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def focal_loss(logits, labels, alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0):
  """Implements focal loss."""
  labels = tf.cast(labels, dtype=tf.float32) # ensure dtype is float for calculations
  p = tf.nn.sigmoid(logits)
  ce = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=logits)
  p_t = p * labels + (1 - p) * (1 - labels)
  alpha_t = labels * alpha + (1 - labels) * (1 - alpha)
  loss = alpha_t * tf.pow(1 - p_t, gamma) * ce
  return loss

# Example usage.
alpha_value = 0.25
gamma_value = 2.0
y_true_binary = tf.constant([[1.0], [0.0], [1.0]]) # Example binary labels
y_pred_binary = tf.constant([[2.1], [-0.5], [1.8]]) # Example logits (single output for binary)

focal_loss_val = focal_loss(y_pred_binary, y_true_binary, alpha=alpha_value, gamma=gamma_value)

print(focal_loss_val)

```

This example calculates binary focal loss.  It is important to note, that the sigmoid function is explicitly applied within the implementation before calculating the cross entropy loss, since focal loss is primarily used in binary classification.

A less explored but equally powerful dynamic weighting technique is class-balanced loss. This method directly adjusts the weights in relation to the number of effective samples for each class instead of just the raw number of samples. If the same training samples are provided multiple times, it is considered that the model has seen fewer *effective* samples. This addresses the issues with over-sampling of samples to account for imbalance.  The weight is calculated based on the number of effective samples (e.g., the frequency of a class), then a reciprocal square root scaling of the total number of effective samples is applied.  While the formal calculation is more complex, it often leads to more stable training with extremely skewed distributions. The direct implementation in TensorFlow is more involved and depends on the particulars of how one performs resampling/weighting of batches:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def class_balanced_loss(logits, labels, samples_per_class, beta=0.9999):
  """Calculates class-balanced loss."""
  labels = tf.cast(labels, dtype=tf.float32) # ensure dtype is float for calculations
  num_classes = labels.shape[-1]
  effective_num = 1.0 - tf.pow(beta, tf.cast(samples_per_class, dtype=tf.float32))
  weights = (1.0 - beta) / effective_num
  weights = weights / tf.reduce_sum(weights) * num_classes

  ce = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=logits)
  weights = tf.reduce_sum(labels * tf.reshape(weights, [1, -1]), axis=1) # Match the weights to the correct class in labels
  loss = weights * ce
  return loss

# Example
beta_value = 0.9999
samples_in_classes = [100, 1000] # Sample count per class
labels_one_hot = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0]]) # Example labels (one-hot)
logits_multiclass = tf.constant([[2.1, -0.1], [-0.5, 1.5], [1.8, 0.2]])  # Example logits

loss_class_balanced = class_balanced_loss(logits_multiclass, labels_one_hot, samples_in_classes, beta=beta_value)
print(loss_class_balanced)
```
This example requires pre-calculated class frequencies stored in the variable `samples_per_class` that is then used to calculate the actual class weights and is different from the standard static weights of the first example.  This approach is particularly useful when the class imbalances are extremely skewed. The `beta` is a hyperparameter that controls the weighting, which you may need to tune.  It should be a value close to one (e.g., 0.9999).

Determining the "better" weighted cross-entropy loss function for TensorFlow models is inherently an empirical exercise.  Standard static weighting offers a practical starting point and is often sufficient with mild imbalances.  Focal loss is designed for binary classification and can significantly improve results when the classifier has to distinguish between difficult examples. For more severe class imbalances, especially within multi-class classification tasks, class-balanced loss tends to deliver more robust training. I recommend starting with a simplified model with static weights. From that baseline, assess the performance on your minority classes and use it as a guide to explore more dynamic weighting strategies such as Focal Loss or class-balanced loss. Careful validation and consideration of your specific imbalance profile remain essential.

For further understanding of this topic I recommend the following resources: research papers describing the use of focal loss, material describing techniques for class imbalance in machine learning, as well as the official TensorFlow documentation on loss functions.
