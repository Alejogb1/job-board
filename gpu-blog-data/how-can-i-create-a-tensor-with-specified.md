TensorFlow's graph mode, while offering performance advantages through optimized execution plans, introduces complexities in dynamically manipulating tensor values.  Directly assigning values at specific indices within a pre-defined tensor shape isn't as straightforward as in eager execution. The key lies in leveraging `tf.scatter_nd` or `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` in conjunction with placeholder tensors defined during graph construction.  My experience optimizing large-scale graph-based models for natural language processing frequently necessitated this precise control over tensor initialization.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

In graph mode, tensors are not mutable in the same way as NumPy arrays. You cannot simply index into a tensor and assign a new value. Instead, you need to construct a new tensor based on the desired modifications. This is where `tf.scatter_nd` and `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` become critical.  `tf.scatter_nd` creates a new tensor filled with a default value (often zero) and then overwrites specified indices with given values. `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`, on the other hand, takes an existing tensor and updates it in-place, returning a *new* tensor reflecting these changes. The distinction is subtle but significant for memory management, particularly in resource-constrained environments.  Both operations require three arguments:

* **indices:** A tensor of shape `[N, M]` specifying the indices to update.  Each inner vector `indices[i]` represents the index of the element to modify in the output tensor.
* **updates:** A tensor of shape `[N, ...]` containing the values to write at the specified indices. The "..." denotes that the shape of this tensor can vary depending on the dimensionality of the targeted elements.
* **shape:** A 1-D integer tensor representing the shape of the output tensor.

The crucial element is the careful definition of these three tensors *prior* to graph execution.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `tf.scatter_nd` to create a new tensor:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()  # Essential for graph mode

with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default() as graph:
    indices = tf.constant([[0, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1]], dtype=tf.int64)
    updates = tf.constant([10, 20, 30], dtype=tf.int32)
    shape = tf.constant([3, 3], dtype=tf.int64)
    tensor = tf.scatter_nd(indices, updates, shape)

    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
        result = sess.run(tensor)
        print(result)
        # Expected Output:
        # [[10  0  0]
        # [ 0  0 20]
        # [ 0 30  0]]
```

This example demonstrates the creation of a 3x3 tensor initialized with zeros.  `tf.scatter_nd` then populates specific indices with the values from `updates`. Note the use of `tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()` and the `tf.compat.v1.Session` context, both necessary for operating within graph mode.


**Example 2: Utilizing `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` for an in-place update (in terms of creating a new tensor reflecting the updates):**


```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()

with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default() as graph:
    tensor = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([3, 3], dtype=tf.int32))  # Initialize a variable tensor
    indices = tf.constant([[0, 1], [1, 0], [2, 2]], dtype=tf.int64)
    updates = tf.constant([100, 200, 300], dtype=tf.int32)
    updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor, indices, updates)

    init_op = tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer() #Initialize variables

    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
        sess.run(init_op) # crucial for initializing the variable
        result = sess.run(updated_tensor)
        print(result)
        # Expected Output:
        # [[  0 100   0]
        # [200   0   0]
        # [  0   0 300]]
```

Here, we start with a zero-filled tensor represented by a `tf.Variable`.  `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` modifies the tensor at specified indices and returns a *new* tensor. It's important to initialize the `tf.Variable` using `tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()` before running the session.


**Example 3: Handling higher-dimensional tensors:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()

with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default() as graph:
    indices = tf.constant([[[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]], [[0, 1, 0], [2, 0, 0]]], dtype=tf.int64)
    updates = tf.constant([[10, 20],[30, 40]], dtype=tf.int32)
    shape = tf.constant([3, 2, 2], dtype=tf.int64)
    tensor = tf.scatter_nd(indices, updates, shape)

    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
        result = sess.run(tensor)
        print(result)
        #Expected Output (may vary depending on the default value):
        # [[[10  0]
        #   [ 0  0]]

        #  [[ 0  0]
        #   [ 0 20]]

        #  [[30  0]
        #   [ 0  0]]]
```

This example showcases the flexibility of handling higher-dimensional tensors. The `indices` tensor now specifies locations within a 3x2x2 tensor. Note how the `updates` tensor's shape aligns with the number of indices provided.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on `tf.scatter_nd` and `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`.  A thorough understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution model is crucial, especially when working with `tf.Variable` objects within the graph.  Studying examples involving variable initialization and session management is highly recommended.  Examining existing TensorFlow codebases focusing on custom layer implementations or graph-based model construction will further solidify your grasp of these techniques.  Consider exploring resources specifically targeting TensorFlow 1.x, given the question's focus on graph mode.  This ensures you are familiar with the appropriate methods and API calls for this legacy, yet still relevant, mode of operation.
