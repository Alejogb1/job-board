Abstractive text summarization, a complex NLP task, often benefits from employing beam search during inference, particularly within sequence-to-sequence models. While greedy decoding, selecting the highest probability token at each step, is computationally efficient, it can lead to suboptimal summaries that miss longer-range dependencies or context nuances. Beam search mitigates this by maintaining multiple candidate sequences (the beam) at each decoding step, exploring a wider space of possible outputs, and significantly improving summary quality. I’ve observed this firsthand while developing a summarization module for a large-scale document processing pipeline.

Fundamentally, beam search is a heuristic search algorithm that expands upon the basic idea of greedy decoding. Unlike greedy decoding, which always chooses the most probable next token, beam search keeps track of *k* most probable sequences of tokens at each time step, where *k* is the beam width, a hyperparameter determining the search breadth. Each of these *k* sequences is extended with all possible next tokens based on the model's probability distribution, and the resulting set of sequences is then pruned down to the top *k* most probable sequences again. This process continues until a stop condition is met—typically the generation of an end-of-sequence token or the achievement of a predefined maximum length. The final output is typically the sequence with the highest cumulative probability, although further post-processing (e.g., length penalties) might be applied.

In the context of TensorFlow, particularly with Keras-based sequence-to-sequence models (like encoder-decoder models using LSTMs or Transformers), beam search can be implemented via custom decoding logic outside of the typical `model.predict()` method, which usually relies on greedy decoding or sampling. The model typically outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary for each time step. It's this distribution that we work with in the custom decoding implementation to apply beam search.

Let's illustrate this with specific examples. Assume we have a trained seq2seq model capable of predicting the next token given an encoded input and a partial sequence, returning a probability distribution.

**Example 1: Basic Beam Search Implementation**

This example demonstrates the core steps of beam search, without incorporating TensorFlow specific components, to establish its algorithmic procedure.

```python
import numpy as np

def beam_search(model, initial_input, max_length, beam_width):
    """
    Simulates basic beam search.
    Args:
        model: Function that takes input and partial sequence and returns probability distribution over vocabulary.
        initial_input: Encoded input to the model.
        max_length: Maximum length of output sequence.
        beam_width: Number of beams.
    """
    vocabulary_size = 10 # Assume a vocabulary size of 10 for demonstration
    start_token = 0
    end_token = 1
    beams = [[(start_token,), 0.0]]  # (sequence, log_probability)

    for _ in range(max_length):
      new_beams = []
      for seq, prob in beams:
        if seq[-1] == end_token:
           new_beams.append((seq, prob))
           continue

        distribution = model(initial_input, seq) # Replace with actual model call
        top_k_indices = np.argsort(distribution)[-beam_width:] # Pick top k token ids
        top_k_probs = np.sort(distribution)[-beam_width:]

        for i in range(beam_width):
          new_seq = seq + (top_k_indices[i], )
          new_prob = prob + np.log(top_k_probs[i])
          new_beams.append((new_seq, new_prob))
      
      beams = sorted(new_beams, key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)[:beam_width] # Prune to top k

      all_ended = all([seq[-1] == end_token for seq, _ in beams])
      if all_ended:
          break

    best_seq, _ = beams[0]
    return best_seq


def mock_model(initial_input, partial_sequence):
  """
  Mocks a next token distribution given an input, and previous sequence.
  In a real case, this will be your trained model that returns probability distribution
  """

  if len(partial_sequence) > 2 and partial_sequence[-2] == 5:
    return np.array([0.1,0.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]) # forces end token for example
  if partial_sequence[-1] == 0:
    return np.array([0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0]) # a few viable tokens from initial
  return np.array([0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0])

initial_input = np.array([1,2,3])
max_length = 5
beam_width = 3
best_sequence = beam_search(mock_model, initial_input, max_length, beam_width)
print(f"Best Sequence: {best_sequence}")
```

The `mock_model` function in this example represents the output probability distribution of a real trained seq2seq model. The beam_search function then steps through the generation process, extending, and pruning beams at each step. This implementation highlights the core idea: maintaining *k* sequences and repeatedly expanding them. This simplified example provides a clearer conceptual understanding of beam search mechanics.

**Example 2: TensorFlow Implementation (Conceptual)**

This example demonstrates the integration with TensorFlow using a `tf.function`. While the exact model implementation details are omitted (as this varies greatly with architectures like LSTMs and Transformers), this highlights the general pattern to use a `while_loop` structure.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def beam_search_tf(model, initial_input, max_length, beam_width, vocabulary_size):
    """
    Conceptual TensorFlow beam search.
    Args:
        model: TensorFlow model that returns probability distribution over vocabulary.
        initial_input: Encoded input to the model.
        max_length: Maximum length of output sequence.
        beam_width: Number of beams.
    """
    start_token = tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int32)
    end_token = tf.constant(1, dtype=tf.int32)
    
    initial_beams = tf.constant([[start_token]], dtype=tf.int32)
    initial_probs = tf.constant([0.0], dtype=tf.float32)
    
    def cond(beams, probs, t):
        return tf.reduce_all(tf.logical_and(t<max_length, tf.reduce_any(tf.not_equal(beams[:, -1], end_token))))

    def body(beams, probs, t):
      
        flat_beams = tf.reshape(beams, [-1, t+1]) # flatten for batched inference

        output_probs = model(initial_input, flat_beams)
        
        output_probs = tf.reshape(output_probs, [-1, beam_width, vocabulary_size])

        top_k_probs, top_k_indices = tf.math.top_k(output_probs[:, -1, :], k=beam_width) 

        flat_beams = tf.tile(tf.expand_dims(flat_beams, axis=1), [1, beam_width, 1])
        flat_beams = tf.reshape(flat_beams,[-1,t+1])
        top_k_indices = tf.reshape(top_k_indices, [-1,1])
        
        new_beams = tf.concat([flat_beams, top_k_indices], axis=1)
        new_probs = tf.reshape(probs, [-1,1]) + tf.reshape(tf.math.log(top_k_probs),[-1,1])
        
        new_beams = tf.reshape(new_beams, [-1, t+2])
        new_probs = tf.reshape(new_probs,[-1])

        top_k_overall_prob_indices = tf.math.top_k(new_probs, k=beam_width)[1]

        beams = tf.gather(new_beams, top_k_overall_prob_indices)
        probs = tf.gather(new_probs, top_k_overall_prob_indices)

        return beams, probs, t+1
    
    final_beams, final_probs, _ = tf.while_loop(cond, body, loop_vars=[initial_beams, initial_probs, tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int32)])
    
    best_seq = final_beams[tf.argmax(final_probs)]

    return best_seq
```

This example utilizes TensorFlow's `tf.while_loop` to iterate over decoding steps. Inside, the model is called to get probabilities, and top-k selections and beam pruning are handled using TensorFlow operations. The critical change is the handling of batches and shaping of output tensors for efficient processing with TensorFlow. This example highlights the core ideas while integrating with TensorFlow's computation framework.

**Example 3: Using a Keras-Based Decoder Model with Beam Search**

This example focuses on using a pre-existing Keras model for the decoding step. Assume we have a trained model that encapsulates both encoder and decoder stages, returning a probability distribution. This example demonstrates a beam search decoder that would interface with the trained model, and is more realistic in a real production setting.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Model

class BeamSearchDecoder(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, model, max_length, beam_width, start_token, end_token, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.model = model
        self.max_length = max_length
        self.beam_width = beam_width
        self.start_token = start_token
        self.end_token = end_token


    @tf.function
    def call(self, encoder_input):
      batch_size = tf.shape(encoder_input)[0]
      initial_beams = tf.fill([batch_size, 1], self.start_token)
      initial_probs = tf.zeros([batch_size], dtype=tf.float32)
      
      def cond(beams, probs, t):
        return tf.reduce_all(tf.logical_and(t<self.max_length, tf.reduce_any(tf.not_equal(beams[:, -1], self.end_token), axis=1)))

      def body(beams, probs, t):
          output_probs = self.model(encoder_input, beams)
          vocab_size = tf.shape(output_probs)[-1]
          top_k_probs, top_k_indices = tf.math.top_k(output_probs[:, -1, :], k=self.beam_width) 

          flat_beams = tf.tile(tf.expand_dims(beams, axis=1), [1, self.beam_width, 1])
          flat_beams = tf.reshape(flat_beams, [batch_size, -1, t+1])
          top_k_indices = tf.reshape(top_k_indices, [batch_size, -1,1])
          
          new_beams = tf.concat([flat_beams, top_k_indices], axis=2)
          new_probs = tf.reshape(probs, [batch_size, -1,1]) + tf.reshape(tf.math.log(top_k_probs),[batch_size, -1,1])

          new_beams = tf.reshape(new_beams, [batch_size, -1, t+2])
          new_probs = tf.reshape(new_probs, [batch_size, -1])

          top_k_overall_prob_indices = tf.math.top_k(new_probs, k=self.beam_width)[1]
          
          beams = tf.gather(new_beams, top_k_overall_prob_indices, batch_dims=1)
          probs = tf.gather(new_probs, top_k_overall_prob_indices, batch_dims=1)
          
          return beams, probs, t+1

      final_beams, final_probs, _ = tf.while_loop(cond, body, loop_vars=[initial_beams, initial_probs, tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int32)])
      best_seq = tf.gather_nd(final_beams, tf.stack([tf.range(batch_size),tf.argmax(final_probs, axis=1)], axis=1))
      return best_seq

class MockDecoder(Model):
  def __init__(self, vocab_size, **kwargs):
      super().__init__(**kwargs)
      self.vocab_size = vocab_size
  
  def call(self, encoder_input, partial_seq):
        batch_size = tf.shape(encoder_input)[0]
        seq_length = tf.shape(partial_seq)[1]
        #Mocked output distributions:
        output_distributions = tf.random.uniform(shape=[batch_size, seq_length, self.vocab_size], minval=0, maxval=1, dtype=tf.float32)
        
        
        #Mock force end condition for testing:
        last_token_indices = tf.reshape(partial_seq[:,-1], [batch_size,1])
        end_indices_condition = tf.cast(tf.equal(last_token_indices, 5), tf.float32)
        end_token_distribution = tf.zeros([batch_size, 1, self.vocab_size])
        end_token_distribution = tf.concat([end_token_distribution[:,:,:1], tf.ones([batch_size, 1, 1]), end_token_distribution[:,:,2:]], axis=2)
        end_token_distribution = end_token_distribution * tf.reshape(end_indices_condition, [batch_size,1,1])

        output_distributions = tf.where(tf.reduce_any(tf.equal(last_token_indices, 5), axis=1, keepdims=True), end_token_distribution, output_distributions)


        return output_distributions

#Example usage:
vocab_size = 10
batch_size = 2
max_length = 10
beam_width = 3
start_token = 0
end_token = 1

mock_decoder = MockDecoder(vocab_size)
beam_search_decoder = BeamSearchDecoder(mock_decoder, max_length, beam_width, start_token, end_token)

encoder_input = tf.random.normal([batch_size, 10, 256])
generated_sequences = beam_search_decoder(encoder_input)
print(f"Generated Sequences: {generated_sequences}")
```
In this example, `BeamSearchDecoder` class is a layer encapsulating the decoding step and integrates directly into Keras-based workflows. It uses a passed model as the underlying generation method. The `MockDecoder` model simulates the output of a trained model during demonstration.

These examples provide concrete illustrations of implementing beam search, focusing on its core logic, TensorFlow's computational graph, and integration with Keras, respectively.

For further study, I suggest exploring resources that delve deeper into sequence-to-sequence models, specifically covering attention mechanisms and advanced decoding strategies. Publications focusing on Transformer-based architectures provide more nuanced understanding of their decoding procedure. Additionally, studying the relevant official TensorFlow documentation for text generation will be beneficial in developing robust practical implementations. While the provided examples are illustrative, real-world scenarios often require substantial optimization regarding batching and device (GPU/TPU) utilization for satisfactory performance.
