Neural network architectures often require flexibility in the number of hidden layers, which presents a challenge when building models in a framework like PyTorch. Rather than defining a separate class for each possible configuration, I've found the most efficient approach involves using dynamic module lists and conditional layer creation within a single class definition. This method allows for a single model definition to adapt to various hidden layer counts determined by parameters supplied at instantiation.

The core idea lies in the `torch.nn.ModuleList` container. Instead of statically declaring layers as class attributes, `ModuleList` allows you to create a list of layers which are themselves PyTorch Modules. PyTorch tracks and registers the parameters within this list, ensuring proper gradient backpropagation and model management. Furthermore, conditional logic during the model’s initialization allows for the creation of a specific number of layers depending on the user’s specifications.

To illustrate, consider a scenario where I am designing an image classification model, but I want to allow for varying degrees of complexity by altering the number of hidden fully-connected layers prior to the final output layer. The simplest approach, manually specifying a static network, would force me to define new classes for each potential number of layers. This is both tedious and difficult to maintain.

Instead, using `ModuleList`, I can create a single class that handles this variability:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class DynamicHiddenLayerClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_sizes, output_size):
        super(DynamicHiddenLayerClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_sizes = hidden_sizes
        self.output_size = output_size

        self.layers = nn.ModuleList()
        current_size = input_size
        for hidden_size in hidden_sizes:
            self.layers.append(nn.Linear(current_size, hidden_size))
            current_size = hidden_size

        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(current_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(-1, self.input_size) # Flatten the input
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = F.relu(layer(x))
        x = self.output_layer(x)
        return x
```

In this example, the `hidden_sizes` parameter is a list where each element specifies the size of a particular hidden layer. The `__init__` method then iterates through this list, appending `nn.Linear` modules to the `self.layers` ModuleList. The `forward` method simply iterates through the layers, applying a ReLU activation after each linear transformation. Observe that the input `x` is reshaped to be a flat vector before the first linear layer. This is typical for fully connected networks handling non-flattened input like images.

This first example demonstrates the basic usage of `ModuleList` for fully connected layers. However, the approach can easily be extended to other types of layers, such as convolutional layers. This is crucial when needing a dynamic architecture to respond to different input characteristics.

Assume I have a need for a convolution network with a varying number of conv and max pool layer blocks. Similar to previous instance, defining specific classes for each scenario is undesirable. This model handles that:

```python
class DynamicConvolutionClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, conv_filters, kernel_sizes, pooling_kernel_sizes, output_size):
        super(DynamicConvolutionClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.input_channels = input_channels
        self.conv_filters = conv_filters
        self.kernel_sizes = kernel_sizes
        self.pooling_kernel_sizes = pooling_kernel_sizes
        self.output_size = output_size

        self.layers = nn.ModuleList()
        current_channels = input_channels

        for filters, kernel_size, pool_size in zip(conv_filters, kernel_sizes, pooling_kernel_sizes):
            self.layers.append(nn.Conv2d(current_channels, filters, kernel_size))
            self.layers.append(nn.MaxPool2d(pool_size))
            current_channels = filters

        # Assume a fully connected layer at the end.
        # Need to calculate the output of conv/pool layers to know input size to this FC layer
        # Here assuming image is squarish, might require a more general calcuation.
        dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_channels, 32, 32) # Placeholder. The size does not matter too much.
        with torch.no_grad(): # Disable gradient during dummy forward propagation
          x = dummy_input
          for layer in self.layers:
              x = layer(x)

          flat_input_size = x.view(-1).shape[0]

        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(flat_input_size, output_size)


    def forward(self, x):
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1) # flatten
        x = self.output_layer(x)
        return x

```

The `DynamicConvolutionClassifier` constructor accepts lists for filter sizes, kernel sizes and pooling kernel sizes. Inside the constructor loop, convolutional and max pooling layers are added in tandem to the `ModuleList`. The example includes important detail: the shape after convolutional layers are applied must be calculated to define the size of the first fully connected layer. Rather than hardcoding this value, a small dummy input is propagated through the network (without gradient calculations) to determine the flat size at the point where we connect to a final linear layer.

This approach not only simplifies the code, but also improves the ability to handle varied network depths. This technique has broad applicability to various network types. For example, one can dynamically create recurrent layers in sequence-to-sequence models. Consider a scenario where I want to use a stacked recurrent neural network but allow the number of recurrent layers to be a hyperparameter:

```python
class DynamicRecurrentClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size, rnn_type='LSTM'):
        super(DynamicRecurrentClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        self.output_size = output_size
        self.rnn_type = rnn_type

        if rnn_type == 'LSTM':
            self.rnn = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers, batch_first=True)
        elif rnn_type == 'GRU':
           self.rnn = nn.GRU(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers, batch_first=True)
        else:
          raise ValueError("Unsupported RNN type. Choose 'LSTM' or 'GRU'.")

        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)



    def forward(self, x):
        output, _ = self.rnn(x)
        # Use the hidden state of the last time step
        last_output = output[:, -1, :]
        x = self.output_layer(last_output)
        return x
```

This example uses `LSTM` or `GRU` layers depending on the `rnn_type`. The key here is that the `num_layers` parameter is directly used to configure the RNN, eliminating the need to manually chain together layers of the RNN. The `forward` method shows how to select the final hidden output from the RNN to use in the final linear layer before output.

These examples illustrate a crucial design pattern for building flexible neural network models. In summary, I found it is far more efficient to dynamically create network layers using `torch.nn.ModuleList` based on user specifications rather than hardcoding layer configurations into separate classes. This method simplifies model creation and maintenance, and is applicable across various model types, including feedforward, convolutional, and recurrent networks.

For further understanding, I recommend studying the PyTorch documentation on the `torch.nn.Module` class, the `torch.nn.ModuleList` container and different layer types available in `torch.nn`, particularly `Linear`, `Conv2d`, `MaxPool2d`, `LSTM`, and `GRU`. Additionally, examining model implementations in the official PyTorch tutorials and various research papers will provide examples of best practices with these classes and containers.
