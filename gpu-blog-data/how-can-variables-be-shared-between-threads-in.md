TensorFlow, while designed for parallel computation, requires careful handling when sharing variables across threads to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity. Unlike shared memory paradigms prevalent in some languages, TensorFlow’s execution model, particularly with its graph-based nature, necessitates a different approach. The direct use of standard Python variables is generally unsuitable for threading in this context because of TensorFlow's asynchronous execution and graph construction. Instead, we need to rely on TensorFlow's mechanisms for creating and managing shared state.

Let’s first establish a foundational understanding. TensorFlow's computational graph is built separately from its execution. Therefore, simply defining a variable in Python and attempting to modify it from multiple threads won’t yield predictable or correct results. These threads are operating within the TensorFlow runtime, which manages its own data storage. Thus, we must use TensorFlow-specific objects to maintain shared state across different threads that participate in the graph execution. The primary tools to achieve this are TensorFlow’s `tf.Variable` class, and to a lesser extent when state management is not paramount, `tf.queue` objects. 

The correct approach primarily involves two scenarios. The first, and most frequent case, is when variables are used within a training or computation graph. The second is when external variables, often related to the input data or monitoring statistics, need to be managed in concurrent threads and accessible by the TensorFlow operations. We focus on the first scenario because it represents the core challenge in sharing variable state in typical TensorFlow workflows.

When dealing with variables that are part of the computation graph, we rely on TensorFlow's inherent thread-safety in its variable management. A single `tf.Variable` object, even if accessed by multiple graph operations run on separate threads, provides synchronized access and consistent state, as long as the underlying computations are within TensorFlow's operations. This relies on the TensorFlow runtime’s handling of variable access during the execution of the graph. However, the critical thing is how you use these variables in the computation graph and how you initiate the graph execution with threads.

Here's an illustrative code example focusing on training, where gradient application usually needs synchronized updates to model weights:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import threading

# Model parameters
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([10, 1]), name="weights")
bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name="bias")

# Placeholder for input data
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])
y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1])

# Model definition
prediction = tf.matmul(x, weights) + bias

# Loss function and optimizer
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(prediction - y))
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training operation
train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)


def train_thread(sess, data_x, data_y):
    for _ in range(100): # Simulate some training
        sess.run(train_op, feed_dict={x: data_x, y: data_y})

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

    data_x1 = tf.random.normal([100, 10]).eval()
    data_y1 = tf.random.normal([100, 1]).eval()

    data_x2 = tf.random.normal([100, 10]).eval()
    data_y2 = tf.random.normal([100, 1]).eval()

    thread1 = threading.Thread(target=train_thread, args=(sess, data_x1, data_y1))
    thread2 = threading.Thread(target=train_thread, args=(sess, data_x2, data_y2))

    thread1.start()
    thread2.start()

    thread1.join()
    thread2.join()

    print("Final weights after threaded updates:", sess.run(weights))
```

In this example, `weights` and `bias` are `tf.Variable` objects. Both `train_thread` functions run on different threads, using the same session, and access and modify these shared `tf.Variable` objects through the TensorFlow graph operation `train_op`. The TensorFlow runtime ensures updates are synchronized, even though the individual operations are being executed as different training steps on separate threads, by properly managing the global variables within the TensorFlow session. It's critical that we pass the same TensorFlow `Session` instance to the threads to facilitate synchronized updates. This showcases how `tf.Variable` inherently handles thread-safety when used with graph operations.

The key takeaway is that shared variables are maintained within the TensorFlow session, and you do not need explicit locking mechanisms when working with `tf.Variable` within the TensorFlow computation graph executed inside the same session.

Now, let's consider a second scenario where one might need to share information across threads *outside* the TensorFlow graph, but still influenced by it. Imagine we have a metric to track the training progress. It’s not a model parameter that changes through backpropagation but a summary value based on the loss.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import threading

# Global metric to track
global_loss_sum = 0.0
global_update_count = 0

# Model parameters (same as before)
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([10, 1]), name="weights")
bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name="bias")

# Placeholders (same as before)
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])
y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1])

# Model (same as before)
prediction = tf.matmul(x, weights) + bias

# Loss (same as before)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(prediction - y))
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training operation (same as before)
train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)

def train_thread(sess, data_x, data_y):
    global global_loss_sum
    global global_update_count

    for _ in range(100):
        loss_val, _ = sess.run([loss, train_op], feed_dict={x: data_x, y: data_y})
        global_loss_sum += loss_val
        global_update_count += 1
    print(f"Thread complete - total updates: {global_update_count}")


with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

    data_x1 = tf.random.normal([100, 10]).eval()
    data_y1 = tf.random.normal([100, 1]).eval()

    data_x2 = tf.random.normal([100, 10]).eval()
    data_y2 = tf.random.normal([100, 1]).eval()

    thread1 = threading.Thread(target=train_thread, args=(sess, data_x1, data_y1))
    thread2 = threading.Thread(target=train_thread, args=(sess, data_x2, data_y2))

    thread1.start()
    thread2.start()

    thread1.join()
    thread2.join()
    
    print(f"Final average loss across all threads: {global_loss_sum / global_update_count}")

```

In this modified example, we introduce `global_loss_sum` and `global_update_count`. These are regular Python variables, and while we use them inside the threads, they’re not managed by TensorFlow. Accessing them from different threads without synchronization can create a race condition, meaning the final result may be inaccurate due to overlapping write operations. While this example might run "successfully" without errors due to Python's GIL, it’s still generally incorrect and not thread-safe. To make this thread-safe, you should use threading primitives (like locks) when modifying these global variables. While this shows a potential problem, it highlights that you *should not* use basic Python variables for state shared across threads.

Finally, let us demonstrate the use of `tf.queue`. While not primarily designed for state sharing, they can serve a purpose in passing information between threads asynchronously. Let's simulate a producer thread creating tensors and a consumer thread processing them. Note that while `tf.queue` itself is thread-safe, the context of its use can still introduce concurrency issues if care isn't taken.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import threading
import time

# Queue to hold data
queue = tf.FIFOQueue(capacity=10, dtypes=[tf.float32])

# Enqueue operation
enqueue_op = queue.enqueue(tf.random.normal([10, 10]))

# Dequeue operation
dequeue_op = queue.dequeue()

def producer_thread(sess):
    for _ in range(50):
        sess.run(enqueue_op)
        time.sleep(0.01)  # Simulate producing data at intervals


def consumer_thread(sess):
    for _ in range(50):
        data = sess.run(dequeue_op)
        print(f"Consumed: {data.shape}")


with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

    producer = threading.Thread(target=producer_thread, args=(sess,))
    consumer = threading.Thread(target=consumer_thread, args=(sess,))

    producer.start()
    consumer.start()

    producer.join()
    consumer.join()

```

In this example, the producer thread adds tensors to the queue, and the consumer thread removes and "processes" them. This demonstrates a typical pattern for sharing data. This is fundamentally different from `tf.Variable` management since the variables are stored within the execution graph and managed through its graph execution mechanisms, while queues are for data transfer between threads.

To summarize, the key points to remember are that: `tf.Variable` objects are thread-safe for sharing model parameters when used in graph operations within the same TensorFlow session. Regular Python variables are *not* thread-safe and should be avoided for sharing state across threads in the context of TensorFlow. `tf.queue` objects provide a mechanism for asynchronous data transfer between threads within the TensorFlow execution framework.
