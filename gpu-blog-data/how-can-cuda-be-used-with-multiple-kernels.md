The execution efficiency of CUDA applications often hinges on the effective orchestration of multiple kernels.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) simulations for geophysical modeling revealed a critical limitation: na√Øve approaches to launching multiple kernels can lead to significant performance bottlenecks due to inefficient memory access patterns and synchronization overhead.  Optimizing for concurrency within and between kernels requires a deep understanding of CUDA's memory hierarchy and synchronization primitives.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

CUDA's power stems from its ability to parallelize computation across many threads organized into blocks and grids.  However, simply launching multiple kernels sequentially doesn't exploit the full potential of the GPU.  Effective multiple kernel execution requires careful consideration of data dependencies, memory management, and synchronization strategies.  Data transfer between kernels represents a significant performance concern.  Moving data between the host (CPU) and device (GPU) memory is orders of magnitude slower than operations within the GPU's global memory.  Similarly, frequent transfers between global and shared memory can impede performance.  Therefore, minimizing data movement and maximizing data reuse within and between kernels is crucial.

Efficient multiple kernel execution often involves designing a pipeline where the output of one kernel serves as the input for the subsequent kernel.  This pipeline parallelism minimizes idle time by overlapping computation and data transfer.  However, proper synchronization mechanisms are needed to ensure data consistency and avoid race conditions.  CUDA provides several synchronization primitives, such as `__syncthreads()` for thread-level synchronization within a block and atomic operations for thread-safe access to shared memory. For inter-kernel synchronization, events are generally preferred for their flexibility and efficiency compared to other approaches.

The choice of memory allocation strategy also significantly affects performance.  Allocating large buffers in pinned host memory using `cudaMallocHost()` can reduce the overhead of data transfers between the host and device.  Furthermore, utilizing shared memory judiciously can significantly speed up computations by reducing the latency of global memory accesses.  However, shared memory is a limited resource, so its use must be carefully planned.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Sequential Kernel Execution (Inefficient):**

```c++
__global__ void kernel1(float* input, float* output, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        output[i] = input[i] * 2.0f;
    }
}

__global__ void kernel2(float* input, float* output, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        output[i] = input[i] + 1.0f;
    }
}

int main() {
    // ... memory allocation and data transfer ...

    kernel1<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(input, intermediate, N);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize(); // Waits for kernel1 to complete

    kernel2<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(intermediate, output, N);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize(); // Waits for kernel2 to complete

    // ... data transfer back to host and memory deallocation ...

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates sequential kernel execution.  The `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` calls introduce significant latency, preventing overlap between kernel executions.  This approach is generally inefficient for multiple kernels.


**Example 2: Pipelined Kernel Execution with Events (Efficient):**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void kernel1(float* input, float* output, int N) { /* ... */ }
__global__ void kernel2(float* input, float* output, int N) { /* ... */ }

int main() {
    cudaEvent_t start, stop;
    cudaEventCreate(&start);
    cudaEventCreate(&stop);

    // ... memory allocation and data transfer ...

    cudaEventRecord(start, 0); // Record start event

    kernel1<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(input, intermediate, N);
    cudaEventRecord(stop, 0); // Record end of kernel1

    cudaStream_t stream;
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

    cudaEventSynchronize(stop); // Wait for kernel1 to finish before launching kernel2 on a separate stream
    kernel2<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(intermediate, output, N);
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream); // Wait for kernel2 to finish

    // ... data transfer back to host and memory deallocation ...
    cudaEventDestroy(start);
    cudaEventDestroy(stop);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
    return 0;
}
```

This example uses CUDA events and streams to overlap kernel execution.  `cudaEventRecord` marks the start and end of `kernel1`.  `cudaEventSynchronize` ensures `kernel2` doesn't begin until `kernel1` completes. The use of `cudaStreamCreate` and `cudaStreamSynchronize` enables concurrent execution of the second kernel on a separate stream.  This significantly reduces idle time and improves overall performance.


**Example 3: Shared Memory Optimization (Efficient):**

```c++
__global__ void combinedKernel(float* input, float* output, int N) {
    __shared__ float sharedData[256]; // Adjust size based on block size and data requirements

    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        sharedData[threadIdx.x] = input[i] * 2.0f;
        __syncthreads(); // Synchronize within the block

        sharedData[threadIdx.x] = sharedData[threadIdx.x] + 1.0f; // Kernel 2's operation
        __syncthreads();

        output[i] = sharedData[threadIdx.x];
    }
}
```

This example combines both kernels into a single kernel and leverages shared memory.  Data is loaded into shared memory, the operations of both kernels are performed, and the results are written back to global memory. This minimizes global memory accesses, leading to a performance improvement compared to separate kernel launches.  However, this approach requires careful consideration of shared memory size and potential bank conflicts.

In conclusion, effectively using multiple kernels in CUDA requires a holistic approach encompassing data dependency analysis, strategic memory allocation, efficient synchronization, and intelligent use of CUDA streams and events. While combining kernels into a single kernel might reduce overhead in some cases, the optimal strategy often involves careful pipelining of kernels to maximize GPU utilization.  Thorough profiling and understanding of CUDA's architecture are paramount to achieving the best possible performance.
