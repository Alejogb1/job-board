`tf.placeholder`, a cornerstone of TensorFlow 1.x’s computational graph construction, was removed in TensorFlow 2.x in favor of eager execution and a more Pythonic programming style. This shift fundamentally alters how input data is handled, transitioning from symbolic tensor definitions to concrete tensor manipulation. Consequently, one does not directly "replace" `tf.placeholder`; rather, the entire paradigm around data ingestion and processing has evolved. Understanding this shift requires appreciating the motivations behind eager execution and the alternative methods that replaced placeholder’s role.

In TensorFlow 1.x, `tf.placeholder` functioned as a symbolic variable, representing a tensor whose values would be supplied later during a session's run. This required building a complete computational graph before any actual computation could occur. While this approach allowed for optimizations and graph portability, it significantly increased complexity for users who needed more intuitive control over debugging and iterative development. The introduction of eager execution in TensorFlow 2.0 meant that operations are performed immediately, as they are defined, removing the intermediate graph construction step. This streamlined the process, rendering `tf.placeholder` redundant.

The primary means of providing data to TensorFlow 2.x models is through `tf.data.Dataset` objects and standard Python data structures like NumPy arrays. These methods directly supply data during the model’s execution phase, circumventing the need for symbolic placeholding. `tf.data.Dataset` offers a highly efficient and flexible mechanism for reading, transforming, and batching data from various sources, including files, memory, and even data generators. When working with smaller datasets that can fit comfortably in memory, NumPy arrays can also suffice as input. However, `tf.data.Dataset` is the recommended method for larger datasets, as it supports efficient loading and pipelining capabilities which optimize the overall training or prediction process. The transition from placeholder usage thus requires that one embrace the framework’s data handling mechanisms.

Let’s examine some practical examples of how data would be handled in a TensorFlow 2.x context, specifically focusing on replicating the core function of `tf.placeholder` – supplying data to a model's forward pass.

**Example 1: Using NumPy arrays for small datasets.**

Assume we have a simple linear regression problem. In TensorFlow 1.x, we'd use placeholders to feed training data. In TensorFlow 2.x, NumPy arrays can represent that data directly.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Data
X_train = np.array([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=np.float32)
y_train = np.array([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]], dtype=np.float32)


# Define model using tf.keras
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])

# Define loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training step
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

#Training loop
epochs = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
  loss_value = train_step(X_train, y_train)
  if epoch % 10 == 0:
    print(f'Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {loss_value.numpy():.4f}')

```
In this example, the training data `X_train` and `y_train` are represented by NumPy arrays, and passed directly into the `train_step` function. There is no need to define placeholders and feed them. The model is defined using `tf.keras.Sequential`.  The training occurs within a standard Python loop, with gradients computed within the context of `tf.GradientTape`.

**Example 2: Using `tf.data.Dataset` for batched training.**

For larger datasets or more complex input processing, `tf.data.Dataset` is preferred. Consider the same linear regression scenario with batching.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Data
X_train = np.array([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0], [5.0], [6.0]], dtype=np.float32)
y_train = np.array([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0], [8.0], [10.0], [12.0]], dtype=np.float32)


# Create a tf.data.Dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((X_train, y_train)).batch(2)

# Define model using tf.keras
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])

# Define loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training step
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss


# Training loop
epochs = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for x_batch, y_batch in dataset:
        loss_value = train_step(x_batch, y_batch)
    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {loss_value.numpy():.4f}')
```
Here, `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` creates a dataset from NumPy arrays. The `batch(2)` call batches the data for efficient training, in this case into batches of two. The training loop iterates over the dataset batches. No placeholders are used. Each iteration the batch of data is passed to the train step.

**Example 3: Working with image datasets using `tf.data.Dataset`**

Let us consider the use case where the input data is an image, which is more common in machine learning tasks.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create synthetic image data
num_images = 10
image_height = 64
image_width = 64
image_channels = 3
images = np.random.rand(num_images, image_height, image_width, image_channels).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, num_images) # 10 classes for example

# Create a tf.data.Dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((images, labels)).batch(4)

# Define model using tf.keras (a very basic model for example)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(image_height, image_width, image_channels)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')
])


# Define loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)


# Training step
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

# Training loop
epochs = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for images_batch, labels_batch in dataset:
        loss_value = train_step(images_batch, labels_batch)
    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {loss_value.numpy():.4f}')
```

In this case, we simulate image data with some random numbers, and create corresponding class labels. Again the `tf.data.Dataset` is used to feed this data to the model in batches. Note that the model input shape now matches the shape of images. This is a simple convolutional model. The same training loop structure applies here. The flexibility of `tf.data.Dataset` is showcased here to work with high dimensional data such as images.

In summary, these examples demonstrate that the functionality of `tf.placeholder` is replaced by a more direct data feeding approach using `tf.data.Dataset` and NumPy arrays. TensorFlow 2.x promotes a more Pythonic, imperative programming style, allowing for immediate execution and easier debugging.

For further exploration, consider researching: the `tf.data` API, particularly `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices`, `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor`, `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator`, and dataset transformation methods like `map`, `batch`, and `shuffle`. Also explore `tf.keras` models and custom training loops which use `tf.GradientTape`. Additionally, a deeper dive into eager execution and its benefits in debugging and workflow will provide context to why the transition from placeholders was needed. Review the official TensorFlow documentation concerning data input pipelines for a comprehensive understanding of the recommended practices.
