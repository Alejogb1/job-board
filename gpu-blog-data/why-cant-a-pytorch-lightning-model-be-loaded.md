The inability to load a PyTorch Lightning model from a checkpoint often stems from inconsistencies between the model's definition at training time and the loading environment.  This discrepancy manifests in several ways, most commonly through version mismatches of PyTorch Lightning itself, differing hardware configurations, or variations in the model architecture's definition.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on large-scale image recognition projects, and have honed specific debugging strategies to resolve it.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Successful checkpoint loading hinges on a precise replication of the model's state at the time of saving.  This includes not only the model's weights and biases (stored within the state_dict) but also the architecture's definition, the optimizer's parameters, and, crucially, the environment in which the model was trained.  Any deviation can lead to a `RuntimeError`, `KeyError`, or other exceptions during the `load_from_checkpoint` method call.

Consider the following scenarios that commonly cause loading failures:

* **PyTorch Lightning Version Mismatch:**  PyTorch Lightning undergoes frequent updates, sometimes introducing breaking changes in internal mechanisms.  Loading a checkpoint saved with a different version can result in incompatibility, even if the underlying PyTorch version is the same.

* **Model Architecture Discrepancies:** The most prevalent cause is a disagreement between the model's class definition used during training and the one used during loading. Even seemingly minor changes, such as adding or removing a layer, renaming a module, or altering activation functions, can prevent successful loading.  The checkpoint stores the state of the model's layers based on their names and indices; any alteration to this structure breaks the mapping.

* **Different Hardware:**  While less common, training on a GPU and attempting to load the checkpoint on a CPU (or vice-versa) can occasionally lead to subtle loading issues.  This is primarily due to differences in data type handling and memory allocation.

* **Missing Modules or Dependencies:** If the model uses custom modules or relies on specific external libraries, ensuring these are available and identically configured during loading is paramount. The absence of these components will lead to module import errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Version Mismatch**

```python
# Training script (using PyTorch Lightning 1.8.0)
import pytorch_lightning as pl
# ... model definition ...

model = MyModel()
trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=10)
trainer.fit(model)
trainer.save_checkpoint("model.ckpt")

# Loading script (using PyTorch Lightning 1.9.0)
import pytorch_lightning as pl
# ... same model definition ...
model = MyModel()
try:
    model = MyModel.load_from_checkpoint("model.ckpt")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error loading checkpoint: {e}")
    print("Check PyTorch Lightning version consistency.")
```

This example demonstrates a version mismatch. The `RuntimeError` likely indicates that internal structures within the checkpoint are incompatible with the newer version of PyTorch Lightning.  The solution is to ensure consistent versions across training and loading environments.


**Example 2: Architectural Discrepancy**

```python
# Training script
import pytorch_lightning as pl
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(20, 1)

# Loading script
import pytorch_lightning as pl
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(20, 1)
        self.layer3 = nn.Linear(1, 5) #Added layer!

model = MyModel.load_from_checkpoint("model.ckpt") #This will likely fail.
```

Here, adding `layer3` in the loading script introduces an architectural mismatch. The checkpoint only contains states for `layer1` and `layer2`. The solution requires aligning the model architecture definitions precisely.


**Example 3: Missing Module**

```python
# Training script
import pytorch_lightning as pl
import torch.nn as nn
from my_custom_module import MyCustomLayer

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.custom_layer = MyCustomLayer()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10,1)

#Loading script (without 'my_custom_module')
import pytorch_lightning as pl
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.custom_layer = MyCustomLayer() #Import Error Here!
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10,1)


model = MyModel.load_from_checkpoint("model.ckpt") #This will fail.
```

This example highlights the importance of having the necessary dependencies, including custom modules like `MyCustomLayer`, available during loading. The `ImportError` will halt the process.  Ensure all modules are correctly installed and accessible in the loading environment.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch Lightning documentation is your primary resource.  It provides comprehensive details on checkpointing, including advanced strategies for managing large models and distributed training.  Carefully review the sections on model saving and loading, paying close attention to best practices and potential pitfalls. Additionally, consult relevant PyTorch documentation concerning the handling of `state_dict` and model serialization. Familiarize yourself with debugging techniques specific to Python and PyTorch, as the error messages can sometimes be cryptic.  Thoroughly reviewing the code involved in model creation, training, and loading is often the most effective troubleshooting method.  Lastly, the PyTorch Lightning community forums and Stack Overflow (searching for similar errors) can be invaluable for finding solutions to specific problems.  Remember to provide relevant code snippets and precise error messages when seeking assistance in these communities.
