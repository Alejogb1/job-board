The core challenge in gathering elements from a 3D PyTorch tensor using a 2D index lies in the dimensionality mismatch.  A 2D index inherently lacks the information to specify the depth dimension of the 3D tensor.  To successfully perform this operation, we must strategically leverage PyTorch's advanced indexing capabilities, understanding that we need to implicitly or explicitly define the depth index for each element specified by the 2D index.  My experience debugging similar scenarios in large-scale image processing pipelines highlighted the importance of clarity in index construction and careful consideration of broadcasting behaviour.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Gathering elements using a 2D index on a 3D tensor necessitates constructing a 3D index. The 2D index provides the row and column coordinates, while the missing depth dimension must be supplied. There are three primary approaches to accomplish this:

* **Method 1: Explicit Depth Specification:**  This involves creating a 3D index where the third dimension contains the desired depth index for each element specified in the 2D index. This offers maximum control and is the most explicit method.

* **Method 2: Broadcasting with Depth Slices:** If the desired elements are contiguous along the depth dimension, broadcasting can simplify the process.  We can construct a 2D index and utilize PyTorch's broadcasting rules to automatically extend it to the third dimension.

* **Method 3: Advanced Indexing with a Depth Vector:**  This is a more flexible approach than broadcasting when the depth indices are not uniform or contiguous. A separate 1D tensor holding the depth indices can be used alongside the 2D index to gather the desired elements.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Explicit Depth Specification**

```python
import torch

# Define a 3D tensor
tensor_3d = torch.tensor([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], [[13,14,15],[16,17,18]]])

# Define a 2D index
index_2d = torch.tensor([[0, 1], [1, 0]])

# Explicitly define the depth indices (e.g., selecting the first depth slice for all elements)
depth_indices = torch.tensor([[0, 0], [0, 0]])

# Construct the 3D index using stacking
index_3d = torch.stack((index_2d[:, 0], index_2d[:, 1], depth_indices), dim=-1)


# Gather elements using advanced indexing
gathered_elements = tensor_3d[index_3d[:,0], index_3d[:,1], index_3d[:,2]]

print(gathered_elements) # Output: tensor([ 1,  5,  7, 10])

```
This example demonstrates creating a 3D index from a 2D index by explicitly specifying the depth for each element.  The `torch.stack` function is crucial here for combining the indices correctly.  Note that the output is a 1D tensor containing the gathered elements.  The order of elements in the output reflects the order in the 2D input index.  Modifying `depth_indices` allows for gathering elements from different depth slices.


**Example 2: Broadcasting with Depth Slices**

```python
import torch

tensor_3d = torch.tensor([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], [[13,14,15],[16,17,18]]])
index_2d = torch.tensor([[0, 1], [1, 0]])

# Gather elements from the first depth slice using broadcasting
gathered_elements = tensor_3d[index_2d, 0]

print(gathered_elements) # Output: tensor([ 1,  5,  7, 10])

```

In this case, we directly use the 2D index `index_2d` to access the first depth slice (index 0). PyTorch's broadcasting automatically expands the 2D index to include the depth dimension, effectively selecting the specified elements from the first slice. This approach is efficient when the target elements reside in a single depth slice.


**Example 3: Advanced Indexing with a Depth Vector**

```python
import torch

tensor_3d = torch.tensor([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], [[13,14,15],[16,17,18]]])
index_2d = torch.tensor([[0, 1], [1, 0]])
depth_indices = torch.tensor([0, 2, 1, 0])

#Advanced Indexing with separate depth vector
gathered_elements = tensor_3d[index_2d[:,0], index_2d[:,1], depth_indices]
print(gathered_elements) #Output: tensor([ 1, 15,  8, 10])
```

This method provides flexibility. The `depth_indices` tensor allows for arbitrary depth selection for each element specified in `index_2d`. The length of `depth_indices` must match the number of elements in `index_2d`. This is particularly useful when dealing with non-contiguous or irregular depth selections.  Incorrect sizing of `depth_indices` will lead to runtime errors.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I would recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation on tensor manipulation and advanced indexing.  Exploring tutorials focusing on multi-dimensional array operations in Python is also beneficial. A solid grasp of linear algebra principles will aid in conceptualizing these operations.  Working through practical exercises involving various indexing scenarios will solidify your understanding.  Finally, referencing relevant Stack Overflow discussions and community forums can provide valuable insights into specific problem-solving techniques.  Remember to carefully check your index dimensions and types to avoid common errors.  Through consistent practice and mindful debugging, you can effectively master these techniques.
