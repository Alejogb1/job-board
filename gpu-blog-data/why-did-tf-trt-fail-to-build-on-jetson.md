TensorRT's failure to build on a Jetson Nano often stems from a mismatch between the TensorRT version and the CUDA toolkit version installed, coupled with potential dependency conflicts.  In my experience troubleshooting embedded systems, this has been the single most frequent cause of build failures with TensorRT on ARM architectures like the one found in the Jetson Nano.  A seemingly minor version discrepancy can trigger cascading errors, ultimately preventing the successful compilation of the TensorRT libraries.


**1. Clear Explanation of the Build Process and Potential Failure Points:**

The TensorRT build process on Jetson Nano hinges on several critical components working in harmony:  the CUDA toolkit, cuDNN, and the TensorRT library itself.  CUDA provides the underlying parallel computing platform, cuDNN accelerates deep learning operations, and TensorRT optimizes the deep learning models for deployment on the target hardware.  Each component has specific version requirements, and a mismatch can disrupt the entire build chain.

The JetPack SDK, typically used for Jetson Nano development, bundles these components. However, manual installations or updates can easily introduce version mismatches.  For example, installing a newer TensorRT version without updating the corresponding CUDA toolkit will inevitably lead to build errors. This arises because the TensorRT library is compiled against specific CUDA header files and libraries. If those versions don't align precisely, the compiler will encounter undefined symbols or incompatible function calls, resulting in build failures.

Furthermore, dependency conflicts are a common source of problems.  TensorRT relies on various system libraries and other dependencies.  If these dependencies have conflicting versions or are missing entirely, the build will fail.  The Jetson Nano's limited resources and the potential for conflicting package managers (like apt and pip) further exacerbate this issue.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential scenarios leading to build failures, focusing on the `CMakeLists.txt` file which is central to the build process using CMake, a widely used build system for C++ projects.

**Example 1: Missing CUDA Toolkit:**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(TensorRT_Example)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)  #This line will fail if CUDA isn't found

# ... rest of the CMakeLists.txt  ...

add_executable(my_tensorrt_app main.cu)
target_link_libraries(my_tensorrt_app ${CUDA_LIBRARIES}
                                     ${TensorRT_LIBRARIES}) # Linking against TensorRT libraries
```

In this example, `find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)` attempts to locate the CUDA toolkit.  If the CUDA toolkit is not installed or is not found in the CMake search paths, this line will fail, halting the build process.  The error message will typically indicate that the CUDA package could not be found.

**Example 2: Inconsistent TensorRT and CUDA Versions:**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(TensorRT_Example)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)
find_package(TensorRT REQUIRED)

# ... rest of the CMakeLists.txt  ...

# This will likely fail if CUDA and TensorRT versions are incompatible.
add_executable(my_tensorrt_app main.cu)
target_link_libraries(my_tensorrt_app ${CUDA_LIBRARIES}
                                     ${TensorRT_LIBRARIES})
```

This example highlights the crucial interplay between CUDA and TensorRT.  Even if both packages are installed, incompatible versions will cause the `target_link_libraries` command to fail. The linker will report unresolved symbols, indicating that the TensorRT library expects functions or data structures that are not present or have changed in the installed CUDA version.  This often manifests as errors relating to missing functions or differing structure layouts.

**Example 3: Dependency Conflicts (Illustrative):**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(TensorRT_Example)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)
find_package(TensorRT REQUIRED)
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system filesystem) #Example dependency: Boost

# ... rest of the CMakeLists.txt  ...

add_executable(my_tensorrt_app main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tensorrt_app ${CUDA_LIBRARIES}
                                     ${TensorRT_LIBRARIES}
                                     ${Boost_LIBRARIES})

```

This example showcases potential dependency conflicts.  Boost, in this case, is a common C++ library used in many projects.  If Boost is installed with multiple versions through different package managers, or if there are incompatible versions of other dependencies required by Boost or TensorRT, compilation errors could result, often presenting cryptic error messages related to linker conflicts or symbol redefinitions.  These conflicts can be difficult to diagnose and often require careful examination of the system's installed packages and their dependencies.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official documentation for both the Jetson Nano and TensorRT.  Pay close attention to the compatibility matrices provided in those documents to ensure that the versions of the CUDA toolkit, cuDNN, and TensorRT are mutually compatible.  Furthermore, reviewing the TensorRT build instructions specific to the Jetson Nano is crucial for identifying any platform-specific considerations or prerequisites.  Finally, familiarizing oneself with CMake's error messages is invaluable for debugging build-related issues.  Systematic troubleshooting, involving the checking of each component's installation and version, followed by a methodical reconstruction of the build process, is paramount to achieving a successful TensorRT build.
