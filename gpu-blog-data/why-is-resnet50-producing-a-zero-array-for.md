ResNet50, while a powerful architecture, can yield unexpected outputs like all-zero arrays in binary classification if certain pre- and post-processing steps are mishandled.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues points to three primary culprits: incorrect data preprocessing, a faulty model configuration, and issues with the output layer's activation function.  Let's examine these systematically.


**1. Data Preprocessing Inconsistencies:**

The most frequent source of this problem lies in inconsistencies between the training and prediction data preprocessing pipelines.  ResNet50, like most convolutional neural networks, expects a specific input format.  Deviations from this standard, even seemingly minor ones, can lead to the network outputting nonsensical results, including arrays filled with zeros.  I've personally debugged several projects where a mismatch in image resizing, normalization parameters (mean and standard deviation), or data type (e.g., uint8 vs. float32) between training and inference resulted in this exact behavior.  The network, trained on a specific representation of the data, receives completely different input during prediction, leading to a failure mode that manifests as a zero array.  This is not necessarily a catastrophic failure within the network itself; rather, it's a fundamental mismatch in data handling.


**2. Model Configuration Errors:**

While less common than data preprocessing issues, errors in the model's configuration can also produce all-zero outputs.  During one particularly challenging project involving transfer learning with ResNet50, I encountered this problem due to an improperly configured output layer. Specifically, the use of an inappropriate activation function, in combination with the loss function,  created a scenario where the gradient flow became stagnant, effectively preventing learning. In binary classification, the output layer ideally should have a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function. This ensures the output is a probability between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of the input belonging to the positive class.  If this activation function is omitted or another function (like ReLU, which is unsuitable for probability estimation) is used, the output layer may fail to produce meaningful results.  Furthermore, a mismatch between the output layer's configuration and the loss function (e.g., using binary cross-entropy with an output layer producing multiple values) can lead to optimization difficulties and erratic behavior including zero arrays.


**3. Issues with the Output Layer's Activation Function:**

As alluded to above, the activation function of the final layer plays a critical role. The sigmoid activation function maps the network's output to a probability between 0 and 1, essential for binary classification.  However, if this activation function is absent, improperly implemented, or if numerical instability occurs (e.g., due to very large or very small internal network activations), the output can become saturated at 0. I once spent several days tracking down a subtle bug where a custom implementation of the sigmoid function contained a numerical overflow error that effectively zeroed out the outputs under certain conditions.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**


**Example 1: Incorrect Data Normalization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Incorrect normalization: Using different mean and std for training and prediction
train_mean = np.mean(train_images, axis=(0,1,2))
train_std = np.std(train_images, axis=(0,1,2))
test_images = (test_images - [100,100,100]) / [10,10,10] #Wrong normalization

model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224,224,3))
model.trainable = False #Example for transfer learning
x = model.output
x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=x)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

predictions = model.predict(test_images) #Will likely be near zero
```

This example demonstrates how inconsistent normalization between training and prediction can lead to flawed predictions.  The `test_images` are normalized using arbitrary values ([100,100,100] and [10,10,10]), different from what the model expects during training.


**Example 2: Missing Activation Function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
model.trainable = False
x = model.output
x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x) # Missing activation function!
model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=x)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

predictions = model.predict(test_images) #Likely to be meaningless
```

This example omits the activation function in the final dense layer.  The raw output of the dense layer is not suitable for binary classification.  The lack of bounded output can result in values far from the expected 0-1 range, potentially interpreted as near-zero by the prediction process.


**Example 3: Numerical Instability in Sigmoid:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def unstable_sigmoid(x):
  #Simulates numerical instability, potentially leading to zero
  return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x*100000)) # High multiplier for instability

model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
model.trainable = False
x = model.output
x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x) 
x = tf.keras.layers.Lambda(unstable_sigmoid)(x) #Custom, unstable sigmoid
model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=x)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

predictions = model.predict(test_images) #Possibly saturated near zero
```

Here, a custom, numerically unstable sigmoid function is used, leading to potential saturation near zero.  The large multiplier in the exponential term can cause overflow, effectively clamping the output to zero for many inputs.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of ResNet50 architecture, consult the original ResNet paper.  For TensorFlow and Keras specifics, refer to the official TensorFlow documentation and Keras guides.  Furthermore, explore comprehensive machine learning textbooks that cover deep learning architectures and practical implementation details. These resources provide a robust foundation for understanding and troubleshooting neural network issues.
