The input tensors to PyTorch's `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` function in sequence classification require a specific structure to avoid errors and ensure correct training. Specifically, `F.cross_entropy` expects the input to have the shape `(N, C, L)` where `N` represents the batch size, `C` the number of classes (vocabulary size in sequence tasks), and `L` the sequence length. The corresponding target tensor, containing the class indices, should be of shape `(N, L)` and contain integer values representing the correct class for each token in each sequence, ranging from 0 to `C-1`. Mismatches in these dimensions are a common source of confusion, and their implications extend beyond simple runtime errors to affect gradient calculations and model convergence.

The underlying issue often stems from a misunderstanding of how sequence data is structured for processing in deep learning models. Many beginners, particularly those transitioning from other machine learning techniques, may initially perceive sequences as simply a list of features or data points, overlooking the crucial distinction between individual tokens within a sequence and the aggregation of sequences within a batch. The `F.cross_entropy` function, as with many PyTorch loss functions, operates on batches of data, necessitating the batch dimension. Furthermore, in sequence classification where each token is independently classified, the target tensor reflects a sequence of class labels corresponding to each input token. Incorrectly shaping either the input or the target can lead to runtime errors like dimension mismatches or potentially, even worse, incorrect calculation of loss values that render model training ineffective.

The key point here is that the input tensor to `F.cross_entropy` is *not* the output of a sequence processing module like an LSTM or Transformer. Instead, it needs to be the unnormalized class score for each token. These scores are usually produced after a linear layer that maps the hidden representation of each token in the sequence into a vector whose dimension is equal to the vocabulary size (C). Consider a scenario where I am implementing a sentiment analysis model that predicts sentiment on a token-by-token basis. After passing a batch of input sequences through an embedding layer and a recurrent network, I would then project the output at each time step through a fully connected (linear) layer. The result would be a 3-dimensional tensor that can be fed into `F.cross_entropy`. The target, however, is the correct class index for each position of each sequence within the batch and should be represented as a 2D tensor.

Here's a concrete example demonstrating correct usage:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Example parameters
batch_size = 3
seq_length = 5
vocab_size = 10 # Assume 10 unique classes/tokens

# Generate sample inputs and targets
input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, vocab_size, seq_length)
target_tensor = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (batch_size, seq_length))

# Calculate the cross-entropy loss
loss = F.cross_entropy(input_tensor, target_tensor)
print(f"Loss: {loss.item()}")

# Example demonstrating backpropagation, although not the core focus here
input_tensor.requires_grad = True
loss = F.cross_entropy(input_tensor, target_tensor)
loss.backward()

print(f"Gradient shape: {input_tensor.grad.shape}")
```

In the first code example, `input_tensor` is of size (3, 10, 5), representing a batch size of 3, 10 classes and sequences of length 5, while `target_tensor` has the shape (3, 5) with class indices ranging between 0 and 9. The `F.cross_entropy` correctly computes the loss. I have also added an example of computing the gradients. It should be noted that when using cross_entropy in a neural network, you would usually directly pass the output of the fully connected layer, and during backpropagation, gradients will propagate through the connected layer.

A common mistake is to transpose the dimensions of the input tensor when one thinks the sequences are the batch, and the batch the sequence. The below example demonstrates how to create an error by switching the sequence and vocabulary axes.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Example parameters
batch_size = 3
seq_length = 5
vocab_size = 10

# Generate sample inputs and targets
input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_length, vocab_size) # Incorrect Input Shape
target_tensor = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (batch_size, seq_length))

try:
    # Attempt to calculate the cross-entropy loss (will error)
    loss = F.cross_entropy(input_tensor, target_tensor)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```

As shown in the code example, this results in a dimension error. PyTorch's cross-entropy implementation expects the class score dimension to be the second dimension, which is not the case here. The input tensor here has a wrong shape for the cross entropy loss function, and thus will cause an error. Such a mismatch not only prevents the training loop from completing but can lead to confusion about the correct use of tensor shapes in PyTorch.

Another subtle issue occurs when a developer attempts to compute the loss on the probabilities instead of the logits of a fully connected layer. The output of a fully connected layer are called logits. A softmax is usually applied to obtain a distribution. However, `F.cross_entropy` expects logits, not probabilities, and applying a softmax before calling `F.cross_entropy` usually doubles the number of computations (softmax then cross entropy which internally computes its own softmax), and more critically, can introduce numerical instability. The following example showcases this:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Example parameters
batch_size = 3
seq_length = 5
vocab_size = 10

# Generate sample inputs and targets
input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, vocab_size, seq_length)
target_tensor = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (batch_size, seq_length))

# Incorrect usage (probabilities, not logits)
probabilities = F.softmax(input_tensor, dim=1) # Applying softmax

try:
    loss = F.cross_entropy(probabilities, target_tensor)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct usage (logits directly)
loss = F.cross_entropy(input_tensor, target_tensor)
print(f"Correct Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

The first try block throws an error when passing the probabilies to the cross_entropy loss. This is a different error than in the previous examples, but equally important to avoid. This example clearly distinguishes between applying `softmax` before computing the cross entropy loss and directly passing in logits to the cross_entropy loss function, as intended. This practice of passing logits allows `F.cross_entropy` to handle the softmax transformation and loss computation in a stable and optimized manner.

In conclusion, ensuring correct input dimensions is paramount when using `F.cross_entropy` in PyTorch for sequence classification. It requires careful attention to the batch size, number of classes, and sequence length dimensions. Specifically, the input tensor representing logits must have the shape `(N, C, L)`, while the target tensor with class indices should have the shape `(N, L)`. When in doubt, checking tensor shapes with `print(tensor.shape)` and referring to the documentation is critical.  Understanding how to correctly represent the logits rather than probabilities and making sure not to accidentally transpose input dimensions, are equally critical steps in avoiding errors and achieving robust model training.

For deeper exploration of these concepts, several resources are particularly helpful. A thorough review of the official PyTorch documentation on `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` provides the formal specification. In addition, any credible deep learning textbook that includes a chapter on recurrent neural networks or sequence modeling will often address the proper input shaping requirements. Additionally, various online resources that cover PyTorch will cover the topic as part of explaining the application of models for text generation or text classification which will provide real examples to apply the concepts discussed.
