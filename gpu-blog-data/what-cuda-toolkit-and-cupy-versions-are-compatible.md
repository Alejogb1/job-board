The CUDA toolkit's compatibility with older GPUs hinges primarily on compute capability.  My experience troubleshooting this for legacy systems in high-performance computing projects underscores the critical nature of matching CUDA versions to the GPU's capabilities.  A mismatch will result in installation failures or, worse, runtime errors that are exceedingly difficult to debug.  Determining the correct toolkit version is therefore the first and most crucial step.

**1. Determining Compute Capability and CUDA Toolkit Compatibility:**

Before proceeding with any installation, you must ascertain your GPU's compute capability. This is a numerical identifier specifying the GPU's architectural generation and capabilities.  You can obtain this information through various methods.  I've found `nvidia-smi` to be consistently reliable. This command-line utility, part of the NVIDIA driver package, provides detailed information about your system's NVIDIA hardware. The output will list your GPU(s) and their respective compute capabilities (e.g., 3.5, 5.2, 7.5).  Note that the major number (e.g., 3, 5, 7) is more significant than the minor number.

Once you have this compute capability, consult NVIDIA's official CUDA Toolkit documentation.  This is the definitive source for compatibility information.  The documentation provides tables that clearly map compute capability to compatible CUDA toolkit versions.  Crucially, you need a toolkit version *at least* as old as the oldest version supporting your compute capability; newer toolkits might function, but selecting the oldest compatible one minimizes potential conflicts and ensures the most robust stability.

**2. CuPy Version Compatibility:**

CuPy, the NumPy-compatible array library for CUDA, relies directly on the CUDA Toolkit.  Therefore, CuPy version compatibility is intrinsically tied to the chosen CUDA Toolkit version.  Each CuPy release typically specifies the minimum and maximum compatible CUDA toolkit versions in its release notes or documentation.  Again, selecting the oldest compatible CuPy version with your CUDA toolkit version is a conservative approach that minimizes risk. This was a lesson I learned the hard way during a project involving legacy Tesla GPUs – mismatched versions resulted in weeks of debugging.  Thorough documentation review was crucial to the eventual resolution.

**3. Installation Process:**

The installation process depends on your operating system (Linux, Windows, or macOS). However, the basic steps remain consistent.

**Linux (Example):**

I primarily work on Linux systems, and my preferred method is using a package manager such as apt or yum (depending on the distribution) to install the CUDA toolkit.

**Code Example 1: (Linux - Ubuntu)**

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Add NVIDIA repository (replace with the correct repository for your CUDA version)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa  #Replace with the appropriate CUDA repository

# Update again after adding the repository
sudo apt update

# Install the CUDA Toolkit (replace with the correct version number)
sudo apt install cuda-toolkit-11-5 #Replace 11-5 with your verified CUDA toolkit version number

# Install CuPy (ensure pip is updated)
pip install cupy-cuda11x #Replace cuda11x with the corresponding CUDA version identifier; check CuPy documentation.
```

**Commentary:**  The critical aspect is selecting the correct CUDA toolkit version based on your GPU's compute capability and then matching the appropriate CuPy version as specified in its documentation. The repository addition and version numbers must be carefully verified according to the official NVIDIA repository instructions.  The `cuda11x` portion of the CuPy installation command needs careful attention, representing your CUDA version –  e.g., `cupy-cuda102` for CUDA 10.2.  Failure to do so will result in installation issues or runtime errors.


**Windows (Example):**

Windows installations usually involve downloading the installer from NVIDIA's website.

**Code Example 2: (Windows - Conceptual)**

```batch
# Download the CUDA Toolkit installer (choose the correct version for your GPU)
# ... (Download from NVIDIA website) ...

# Run the installer
# ... (Follow on-screen instructions) ...

# Install CuPy (using pip or conda, depending on your environment)
pip install cupy-cuda11x #Again, replace cuda11x with the correct version. Check documentation.
```

**Commentary:** The Windows installation is more straightforward in terms of commands.  The crucial part remains selecting the correct CUDA toolkit and CuPy versions based on compatibility. Always consult NVIDIA's official documentation to get the correct installer.


**macOS (Example - Conceptual):**

macOS installations might involve using a package manager like Homebrew or downloading the installer from NVIDIA.

**Code Example 3: (macOS - Conceptual)**

```bash
# (Using Homebrew - Verify Homebrew is installed)
brew update
brew install cuda #If this is available for the target toolkit version

#Or if you need to install from the NVIDIA site:
# Download the CUDA Toolkit installer (choose the correct version for your GPU)
# ... (Download from NVIDIA website) ...

# Run the installer
# ... (Follow on-screen instructions) ...

# Install CuPy (using pip or conda)
pip install cupy-cuda11x  # Again, ensure compatibility by checking CuPy documentation.

```


**Commentary:** macOS support for CUDA is comparatively limited, often requiring specific versions and system configurations.  Thorough checking of Homebrew's compatibility and the NVIDIA website is paramount for a successful installation.


**4. Verification:**

After installation, verify both CUDA and CuPy are installed correctly. For CUDA, you can run `nvcc --version` (Linux/macOS) or check the NVIDIA Control Panel (Windows).  For CuPy, import it in a Python script and check its version using `cupy.__version__`.  Attempting simple array operations within the script will help confirm that CuPy is working correctly with your CUDA setup.  Inconsistencies at this stage point back to the original version selection process – double-check your GPU's compute capability and your version selection against NVIDIA’s documentation.


**5. Resource Recommendations:**

NVIDIA's official CUDA Toolkit and CuPy documentation;  the NVIDIA developer website;  relevant system administrator guides (Linux distribution-specific documentation, for example).

Remember:  Always consult the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date compatibility information.  The information provided above is a general guideline based on my extensive experience, but specific steps may vary depending on your environment and chosen versions.  Careful attention to detail during the selection and installation phases is critical for a successful implementation.
