Modifying a pre-trained PyTorch Lightning model by adding custom layers requires a nuanced understanding of PyTorch's module architecture and the Lightning Trainer's interaction with it.  The key fact to remember is that pre-trained models are essentially complex collections of interconnected modules; adding custom layers necessitates careful integration to maintain the integrity of existing functionality and avoid unexpected behavior.  During my work on a large-scale image classification project using satellite imagery, I encountered this precise challenge and developed several strategies to address it.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process of adding custom layers to a pre-trained PyTorch Lightning model hinges on accessing and modifying the model's architecture.  We generally avoid directly altering the weights of the pre-trained layers, opting instead to add new layers either before or after the existing architecture.  The choice of placement depends on the intended functionality of the added layers.  If the goal is to adapt the pre-trained model to a new task with a different output space (e.g., fine-tuning a model trained on ImageNet for a specific object detection task),  we would usually add layers after the pre-trained layers.  This approach leverages the learned feature representations of the pre-trained model while introducing task-specific learning.  Conversely, if we need to process the input data differently before it is fed into the pre-trained model, we might add layers before it, potentially enriching the input features.

Crucially, the added layers must be compatible with the input and output shapes of the connected layers. This often involves careful consideration of dimensionality and data type. Failure to match these characteristics will lead to runtime errors. Additionally, understanding the gradient flow is paramount. If the added layers are not appropriately integrated (e.g., through correct definition of forward and backward passes), the gradients may not propagate correctly, hindering the training process.  The choice of activation functions within the custom layers should also be considered; inappropriate activation functions can lead to vanishing or exploding gradients.

Finally, we must also handle the loading of pre-trained weights.  The pre-trained weights should only be loaded onto the existing layers; otherwise, the pre-training effort is lost, and the model might perform poorly.  This is often achieved by defining the custom layers separately and then integrating them into the original model using sequential or parallel constructs.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Adding a linear layer after a pre-trained ResNet model for classification:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import pytorch_lightning as pl

class CustomResNet(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self, pretrained_model):
        super().__init__()
        self.resnet = pretrained_model
        self.resnet.fc = nn.Identity() #Replace the final fully-connected layer with an Identity layer.
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(pretrained_model.fc.in_features, 512) #New fully connected layer
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, num_classes) # Output layer for new classification task


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.resnet(x)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

    # ... (rest of the LightningModule definition - training_step, configure_optimizers, etc.) ...

#Load the pretrained model
pretrained_model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

#Instantiate the custom model
model = CustomResNet(pretrained_model)

```

This example replaces the final fully connected layer of a pre-trained ResNet18 model with a new linear layer configuration.  The `nn.Identity()` layer essentially removes the original final layer, preserving the pre-trained features. The subsequent linear layers adapt the output to a new number of classes (`num_classes`). Note the importance of replacing the original `fc` layer to avoid conflicting layer names during weight loading.

**Example 2:  Adding a convolutional layer before a pre-trained VGG model for feature enhancement:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import pytorch_lightning as pl

class CustomVGG(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self, pretrained_model):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv_add = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)  # Add a convolutional layer before VGG
        self.relu_add = nn.ReLU()
        self.vgg = pretrained_model

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv_add(x)
        x = self.relu_add(x)
        x = self.vgg(x)
        return x

    # ... (rest of the LightningModule definition - training_step, configure_optimizers, etc.) ...

#Load pretrained model (example using a VGG16)
pretrained_model = torchvision.models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

#Instantiate custom model
model = CustomVGG(pretrained_model)

```

Here, a convolutional layer (`conv_add`) is added before the pre-trained VGG model. This layer processes the input image before it reaches the VGG layers.  The added layer increases the number of feature maps, potentially enriching the feature representations fed into the pre-trained model. The input channels of `conv_add` should match the input channels of the pre-trained model; otherwise, an error will occur.

**Example 3: Using a sequential container for a more complex addition:**


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import pytorch_lightning as pl

class CustomModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self, pretrained_model):
        super().__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(
            pretrained_model,
            nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1, 1)),
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(pretrained_model.classifier[-1].in_features, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 10)  # Output layer
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.features(x)

    # ... (rest of the LightningModule definition - training_step, configure_optimizers, etc.) ...

#Load the pretrained model (example using AlexNet)
pretrained_model = torchvision.models.alexnet(pretrained=True)

#Instantiate custom model
model = CustomModel(pretrained_model)

```

This example demonstrates the use of `nn.Sequential` to chain the pre-trained model with additional layers. This improves code readability and maintainability, especially when multiple layers need to be added. `nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d` adjusts the output to a suitable size for the subsequent fully connected layers. The final linear layer produces the model's output.
