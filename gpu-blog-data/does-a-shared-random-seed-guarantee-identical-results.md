The assertion that a shared random seed guarantees identical results between TensorFlow 1 (TF1) and TensorFlow 2 (TF2) is, in practice, frequently untrue, despite theoretical expectations.  My experience debugging a large-scale image classification model migration from TF1 to TF2 highlighted this discrepancy. While both versions ostensibly used the same seed, subtle variations in internal random number generator (RNG) implementations and operational differences, particularly regarding operator ordering and optimizations, led to divergent outcomes. This isn't a bug, per se, but rather a consequence of evolving architectural decisions and optimization strategies within the TensorFlow ecosystem.  This response will clarify this behavior, demonstrating it through illustrative code examples.

**1. Explanation:**

The discrepancy stems from a combination of factors. First, both TF1 and TF2 employ pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). These algorithms generate sequences of numbers that appear random but are, in fact, deterministic, meaning that a given seed will always produce the same sequence.  However, the specific PRNG algorithm and its implementation details can differ between versions. While TensorFlow strives for consistency, internal changes, particularly in optimization routines, can indirectly affect the RNG's usage.  This is because many operations, especially those involving gradient calculations and automatic differentiation, rely on random number generation for tasks like dropout, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and initialization of weight matrices.  The sequence in which these operations are executed, and the specific implementations of these operators, influence the final RNG sequence employed.

Secondly, TF2's eager execution paradigm contrasts sharply with TF1's graph-based execution.  TF1's graph construction allows for static analysis and optimization, potentially reordering operations. This reordering, even if seemingly innocuous, can change the order in which the PRNG is called, leading to a different sequence of random numbers despite the identical seed. Eager execution in TF2, while providing increased flexibility and debuggability, can also lead to subtle differences due to variations in runtime environments and resource allocation which indirectly impacts the RNG calls.

Thirdly, even minor changes in the underlying libraries used by TensorFlow—such as updates to BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) or LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage)—can subtly influence the results. These libraries are highly optimized and their internal implementations might vary across versions, potentially introducing imperceptible variations in the random number generation process.  Such differences could compound across many operations within a complex model, leading to significant divergence in the final output.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the potential for discrepancies despite using identical seeds.

**Example 1: Simple Weight Initialization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# TF1-style session usage (for illustrative purposes only - avoid in modern TF)
# with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
#     tf.compat.v1.random.set_random_seed(1234)
#     weights_tf1 = tf.compat.v1.random.normal([2, 3])
#     weights_tf1_value = sess.run(weights_tf1)
#     print("TF1 Weights:\n", weights_tf1_value)

# TF2 equivalent
tf.random.set_seed(1234)
weights_tf2 = tf.random.normal([2, 3])
print("TF2 Weights:\n", weights_tf2.numpy())

# Example using NumPy for comparison (to illustrate the seed's effect)
np.random.seed(1234)
weights_np = np.random.normal(size=(2,3))
print("NumPy Weights:\n", weights_np)
```

This example demonstrates weight initialization. While NumPy (and therefore a consistent PRNG implementation) will return the same values given the same seed,  the TF1 and TF2 outputs might differ slightly due to internal differences in the RNG implementation and the operator execution order.  Note: The commented-out TF1 code shows how one would approach this in the older version using sessions; this method is deprecated and should not be used in new code.  


**Example 2: Dropout Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.random.set_seed(42)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5)
])

x = tf.random.normal((1, 5))
output1 = model(x)
print("Output 1:\n", output1.numpy())

# Resetting the seed to demonstrate non-determinism with dropout.
tf.random.set_seed(42)
output2 = model(x)
print("Output 2:\n", output2.numpy())
```

This example highlights the non-deterministic nature of dropout, even with a set seed.  Although the global seed is set, the dropout layer's random masking introduces variability that won't be completely controlled by the global seed, resulting in slightly different outputs even with the same input. This stems from the internal handling of the dropout operation within TF2.  Such discrepancies would manifest more significantly in larger, more complex models with numerous stochastic elements.


**Example 3:  Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.random.set_seed(123)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

x = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]])

model.fit(x, y, epochs=2)
print(model.get_weights())

# Resetting the seed
tf.random.set_seed(123)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

model.fit(x, y, epochs=2)
print(model.get_weights())
```

Here, the stochastic nature of SGD, even with the global seed set, produces variations in the trained weights across runs.  This stems from the algorithm’s inherent randomness in updating weights based on randomly selected subsets of data (mini-batches) and potential internal variations in the implementation of SGD within different TensorFlow versions. The resulting weights will not be precisely identical despite identical seeds.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of random number generation in TensorFlow, consult the official TensorFlow documentation.  Further study of the mathematical underpinnings of PRNG algorithms and their implementation in computational libraries would be beneficial. Exploration of the source code of TensorFlow (albeit challenging) will provide valuable insights into the internal workings of the RNG mechanisms.  Finally, reviewing relevant research papers on the reproducibility of deep learning experiments would offer broader context and further practical insights.
