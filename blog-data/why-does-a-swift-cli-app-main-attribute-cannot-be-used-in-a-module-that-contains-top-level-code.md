Alright, let's unpack this. It’s a subtle but crucial point in Swift development, and something I bumped into myself early on while building a custom build tool. The issue isn't about the *ability* to write code at the top level of a file in a Swift module. Instead, it's about how the swift compiler and linker handle the entry point for executable targets, specifically when you're dealing with modules. So, why does a Swift CLI app's ‘main’ attribute refuse to coexist with top-level code in the same module? It boils down to ambiguity during the linking phase.

Essentially, a Swift executable needs a single, clearly defined starting point. This is usually the `main` function. The `@main` attribute is a directive that tells the compiler: "Hey, this type’s method or static method should be treated as the entry point." When you place this attribute *and* write top-level code within the *same* module, you're essentially giving the linker two potential places to start execution. The compiler doesn’t quite know which path it should take, whether to start with the code marked by @main, or just start executing top-level code immediately.

Let’s think about this from the linker’s perspective, which is crucial to understanding what is going on. Linkers, in simple terms, resolve symbols (like function names or variables) across different object files to create an executable. When you add top-level code to a module, the Swift compiler generates initialization code for this top-level portion (think global variable initialization and the like). The linker ends up with code that could execute *before* a main method would be called through @main. This creates a conflict. It is a violation of the single entry point principle that is fundamental to executable construction in most operating systems.

To clear it up, consider a small scenario. Let's say we're building a command-line interface for processing configuration files. My initial structure, which resulted in the very error you're likely seeing, had the core logic inside a module that I also intended to use directly as an executable. The ‘main.swift’ file contained something resembling this (and this will not compile):

```swift
// Incorrect: main.swift within a module with top-level code and @main

@main
struct CommandLineInterface {
    static func main() {
        print("Starting configuration processing...")
        // Actual parsing code would go here
    }
}

let defaultConfig = ["setting1": "value1", "setting2": "value2"]
print("Initial setup complete.")
```

In this snippet, we have `@main` specifying `CommandLineInterface` as the entry point, but we also have top-level code that initializes `defaultConfig` and prints "Initial setup complete." The compiler won't allow this arrangement; you get an error message that will suggest removing the top level code in favour of the `main` function, or the @main, if you insist on using top level code.

The fix isn’t complicated, but it does require structuring our code properly. The approach here is straightforward: separate the module which will contain the reusable functionality (which may have top level code) from the actual executable.

Here’s what my actual code looked like *after* fixing the module structure. First, the reusable configuration handling part, which resides in its own module (let's call it 'ConfigManager'). It has its own independent ‘ConfigManager.swift’, which may contain top-level code:

```swift
// ConfigManager.swift (Module File)

public struct ConfigReader {
    public static func readConfig(from path: String) -> [String:String] {
      // Pretend this loads a config from a file
        print("Reading config from: \(path)")
       return ["setting1":"valueFromConfig1", "setting2":"valueFromConfig2"]
    }
}
let libraryDefaultConfig = ["librarySetting":"defaultLibraryValue"]
print("Config library default config set.")
```

Notice the top-level code in 'ConfigManager.swift'. This is perfectly acceptable, as this module *does not* mark its entry point with @main. It is simply a library that the executable will use.

Now, let's set up the `main.swift` file for the actual executable that will utilize the ‘ConfigManager’ module. This new executable will define its starting point with `@main` and use the functionality from the module.

```swift
// main.swift (Executable File)

import Foundation
import ConfigManager // assuming we have a product module called 'ConfigManager'

@main
struct CommandLineInterface {
    static func main() {
        print("Starting CLI application...")
        let config = ConfigReader.readConfig(from: "config.json")
        print("Config loaded: \(config)")
        print("Application finished.")
    }
}
```

In this version, the `CommandLineInterface` handles the application entry point. And since ‘ConfigManager’ is used as a module, it can contain its top-level code. This way, the code is properly modularized and avoids the ambiguity. When the executable is built, the linker knows exactly where to start execution: `CommandLineInterface.main()`.

The key here is to realize that your main executable needs a *single* well-defined entry point. Putting top-level code in the same module alongside the entry-point designation of `@main` conflicts with that objective. Top-level code will simply cause an error, or be executed in some way in conflict with the intended program flow if used in conjunction with @main.

To dig deeper into module design and linking, I'd suggest checking out *“Linkers and Loaders”* by John R. Levine for a comprehensive understanding of how the linking process works. For a more Swift-specific view of module organization and its impact on executable creation, consider the *“Swift Programming Language”* book by Apple, particularly sections related to modules and access control, as well as the documentation about the `@main` attribute. Additionally, exploring the *Swift Evolution* proposals (specifically those related to module structure and program entry points) provides valuable insight into the design decisions made by the language authors. These resources would likely expand your understanding of this concept beyond what I've covered here and will give you context for how this and other compiler limitations were decided upon.
