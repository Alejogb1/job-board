Okay, let's tackle this. I’ve seen this exact issue crop up more times than I care to remember, usually accompanied by a bewildered "why isn't this just working?" And it's almost never a straightforward "bug" in the Microsoft Graph SDK itself. It’s typically a misunderstanding of how the underlying services operate, particularly with file handling. So, no, the sdk isn't broken in the general sense; it's more about the specific way you're trying to interact with file content.

The primary reason you’re likely having trouble opening docx files with the Microsoft Graph SDK isn't a matter of the SDK not being able to *access* the file. It's more about how the sdk returns the data and how you're then trying to interpret that data to display as a docx file. Essentially, the sdk, when fetching file content, doesn't automatically serve up a file stream that your operating system recognizes as a docx. Instead, it retrieves the file as a raw byte stream which you, the developer, need to process correctly.

Let's get more specific. When you make a request using the Graph SDK to retrieve a file’s content (typically using the `get()/content` method for drives and items endpoints), what you get back in the response is the file's binary data. It doesn't matter if it's a docx, a pdf, an image, or a text file. What the SDK provides is the raw, uninterpreted, byte representation of that file. The sdk handles authentication and request management, not file format interpretation.

Your local application or browser needs this byte stream to be in a specific format, like a base64 encoded string or a direct binary stream, depending on your use case and the operating system it’s running on. More importantly, you need to provide it with the proper mime-type to understand that it is in fact a docx file. Without this, the browser or other client applications won't know how to treat the returned data and thus, cannot open it as a docx document. This lack of interpretation from the response is what causes the "can't open" error.

In my previous work at a company that implemented a document management system relying heavily on OneDrive and SharePoint integration, I often saw developers overlooking this detail. Here’s a few points to remember that often lead to those “can't open” docx issues when you are using the graph SDK:

1.  **Incorrect Content Type Handling:** The application or browser needs to understand that the data you received is, in fact, a docx file, not just a random blob of bytes.
2.  **Direct Byte Stream Handling:** Directly piping the byte stream received from the graph api into a browser or local operating system without the correct processing (like converting it to a base64 encoded data url and supplying the mime type) will result in it not rendering properly, as the system needs to interpret it as a docx file.
3.  **File Metadata:** The SDK does provide metadata about the file, including its mime-type. Make sure to use this information to assist your client application in handling the file content.

Here's a demonstration, in python, of three ways that you could retrieve and handle a file using the graph sdk:

```python
import asyncio
from msgraph.core import GraphClient
import base64
import os

#This is a very basic example and is not production ready, using async, and showing three ways to retrieve a file and store/display it

async def get_file_content_base64(graph_client, drive_id, item_id):
  """Retrieves file content and encodes it as base64 string for direct use with a data url."""
  try:
    response = await graph_client.drives.by_drive_id(drive_id).items.by_item_id(item_id).content.get()
    if response:
      file_content = await response.read()
      base64_encoded = base64.b64encode(file_content).decode('utf-8')
      return base64_encoded
    else:
      print("Failed to retrieve file.")
      return None
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error retrieving file content: {e}")
    return None

async def save_file_to_disk(graph_client, drive_id, item_id, file_path):
    """Retrieves file content and saves it to disk."""
    try:
        response = await graph_client.drives.by_drive_id(drive_id).items.by_item_id(item_id).content.get()
        if response:
            with open(file_path, "wb") as file:
                async for chunk in response.iter_bytes():
                    file.write(chunk)
            print(f"File saved to {file_path}")
            return True
        else:
             print("Failed to retrieve file.")
             return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error saving file: {e}")
        return False

async def get_file_metadata(graph_client, drive_id, item_id):
    """Retrieves file metadata including mime-type."""
    try:
        item = await graph_client.drives.by_drive_id(drive_id).items.by_item_id(item_id).get()
        if item:
            mime_type = item.file.mime_type if item.file else "unknown"
            return mime_type
        else:
            print(f"Failed to retrieve metadata for item {item_id}")
            return None
    except Exception as e:
         print(f"Error retrieving file metadata: {e}")
         return None



async def main():
    # replace this with your actual client id, tenant id and secret/cert
    client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
    tenant_id = "YOUR_TENANT_ID"
    client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
    drive_id = "YOUR_DRIVE_ID"
    item_id = "YOUR_ITEM_ID"  # This is your document's item id
    file_name = "downloaded_document.docx"

    auth_provider = SimpleClientCredentialAuthProvider(tenant_id=tenant_id, client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret)
    graph_client = GraphClient(credential=auth_provider)

    # 1. Using base64 to display in a browser (or other client applications that support it)
    base64_data = await get_file_content_base64(graph_client, drive_id, item_id)
    if base64_data:
      mime_type = await get_file_metadata(graph_client, drive_id, item_id)
      if mime_type:
        print("Base64 encoded data URL:")
        print(f"data:{mime_type};base64,{base64_data}")

    # 2. Save the content directly to file system
    saved = await save_file_to_disk(graph_client, drive_id, item_id, file_name)
    if saved:
      print(f"Saved {file_name} successfully")

    #3. Get the mime type.
    file_mime = await get_file_metadata(graph_client, drive_id, item_id)
    if file_mime:
      print(f"the mime type is: {file_mime}")


if __name__ == '__main__':
   asyncio.run(main())

```

In the first snippet, we retrieve the binary content and encode it into a base64 string and display it in a data URL format, perfect for displaying in a browser. This format will tell the browser that the data represents a docx file because we can incorporate the mime-type from the get_file_metadata example. In the second example, we simply retrieve the byte stream and save it to a file on disk, which is appropriate for downloading files. The third example shows how to get the mime type of the document to determine how you can handle the raw data appropriately.

These examples illustrate how, using graph, it's crucial to consider the type of data that is coming back and how you need to handle it in order to achieve the desired results.

To delve deeper into this, I recommend looking into the Microsoft Graph documentation directly; start with the DriveItem resource documentation. The Microsoft Graph REST API reference documents, specifically related to drive items and content, are very helpful. For a broader understanding of HTTP and data formats, consider reading “HTTP: The Definitive Guide” by David Gourley and Brian Totty; It offers an excellent overview of how web services like Microsoft Graph work. Finally, for a broader understanding of the Graph SDK itself, the official SDK samples and the github repo for your specific language implementation are very useful.

Essentially, the issue isn't that the Microsoft Graph SDK can't retrieve docx files, it’s that it provides the raw data and you must understand that you are responsible for processing and interpretation according to the needs of your client application. The SDK does its job perfectly well; you just need to understand its output and use it appropriately.
