Okay, let's tackle this. It's a surprisingly common task, and while seemingly straightforward, there are nuances to consider, especially when you’re dealing with dynamic forms or interactions. I've seen this exact scenario crop up several times in projects, and I've refined my approach over the years to accommodate various edge cases.

The core issue revolves around manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) elements that represent text fields within a Rails application using jQuery. We're aiming to programmatically set the value of these fields using JavaScript, which jQuery simplifies immensely. However, we need to ensure this is done correctly within the Rails environment, where fields often have specific IDs or naming conventions that need to be accounted for. I’ll step through the typical methods, explain their implications, and show you some code samples.

First, let's understand the fundamental jQuery methods at play. The most common approach is to use `.val()`. This method is specifically designed for form elements and is the preferred way to set or retrieve their values, compared to methods like `.attr('value',...)` which might not consistently update the element's state, especially with regards to user interactions and browser caching.

So, a basic implementation might look like this:

```javascript
// Example 1: Setting a text field with a static ID
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#user_name').val('John Doe');
});
```

Here, `$('#user_name')` uses jQuery’s selector engine to find the HTML element with the ID `user_name`. This assumes you have a text field in your Rails view generated with something similar to `text_field(:user, :name)`. The `.val('John Doe')` part then sets the value of this field to “John Doe”. The `$(document).ready()` ensures that the script executes only after the entire document is loaded, preventing issues with elements not existing when the script is called. This is an important consideration, particularly if your script is located in the `<head>` section of your page.

This works well enough for straightforward cases, but in practice, your text fields may be part of more complex forms, possibly within nested objects or arrays. Rails form helpers tend to create somewhat more complex IDs and names, such as those involving model names and their attributes. For instance, you may be dealing with an input like `user[address_attributes][street]` which generates an ID like `user_address_attributes_street`. Navigating these can be more challenging but remains manageable. We can leverage the power of jQuery selectors to target them effectively, by using the more robust attribute selector.

Consider this slightly more involved scenario, which I faced a while back when dealing with nested attributes in a form:

```javascript
// Example 2: Setting a text field within nested attributes
$(document).ready(function() {
    $('[id="user_address_attributes_street"]').val('123 Main St');
});
```

Here, instead of using the ID selector `#`, I am using an attribute selector `[id="user_address_attributes_street"]` This makes the selection more explicit and less prone to confusion with other elements that might share prefixes in their IDs. This explicit approach is often more robust in large projects with complex naming conventions.

There is another potential scenario, though. Sometimes you're working with dynamically generated forms, or you need to apply this to multiple fields at once, perhaps because of an event. Let’s say you want to apply the same value to all text input fields within a specific section. You could also use jQuery's context selector functionality, in conjunction with the wildcard selector for attribute beginning:

```javascript
// Example 3: Setting multiple text fields based on context
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#form-container').find('input[type="text"]').each(function() {
      $(this).val('Default Value');
    });
});
```
This one is slightly more sophisticated. Here, `$('#form-container')` finds the container element by its ID. The `.find('input[type="text"]')` searches for all text input fields within this container, then each identified element executes function passed to the `each` loop where the current element is represented by `$(this)`. Finally `.val('Default Value')` sets the value as we've seen. This approach allows setting multiple fields simultaneously without targeting them individually by IDs, which is extremely useful for forms generated dynamically or when the values to set depend on other data sources.

It is important to note that while `val()` is preferred, if for some specific reason, the underlying javascript property is required, you can achieve this through `this.value` within the `.each` function or directly on a selected element. This however, is not considered best practice and generally `val()` suffices for most cases.

Now, for further learning, I would suggest referring to these resources:

1. **"Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke:** This book dives deep into JavaScript fundamentals, which are absolutely necessary for mastering jQuery. Understanding how JavaScript actually works behind the scenes will greatly enhance your ability to debug and use jQuery effectively. It specifically covers the underlying mechanism of DOM manipulation.

2. **The official jQuery documentation:** It's comprehensive, detailed, and provides numerous examples and explanations of each method and its proper use. This should be your go-to reference for any jQuery-related questions or clarifications. Look specifically at the section on selectors and the `.val()` method.

3. **"JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" by David Flanagan:** This book is a thorough reference covering all aspects of JavaScript. Although not specific to jQuery, it provides a robust grounding in JavaScript principles, which will help you understand the underlying concepts jQuery abstracts.

In conclusion, setting text field values with jQuery in Rails is achieved primarily through using the `.val()` method in combination with well-crafted selectors. Remember to select elements based on their IDs, but don't hesitate to use attribute selectors or context selectors for more complex scenarios. Use `$(document).ready()` to ensure your scripts run after the document is fully loaded, and take the time to look into those resources I shared – a solid understanding of JS and DOM is what takes you from copying snippets to confidently manipulating web pages. I hope this helps.
