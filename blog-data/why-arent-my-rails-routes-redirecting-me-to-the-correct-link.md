Alright,  It's a scenario I’ve definitely encountered more than a few times over the years, and it's frustrating when routes aren't behaving as expected in a Rails application. Redirects, seemingly straightforward, can get tangled pretty quickly if you're not meticulous about a few key areas. I’m going to break down the common culprits and throw in some example code to illustrate the points. It's usually not a Rails core bug, more often than not, it's a configuration quirk or a subtle misunderstanding of how routing works under the hood.

The first place I usually check when routes are misbehaving is the routing definition itself. Rails uses the `config/routes.rb` file to map incoming requests to specific controller actions. If a route isn't correctly defined or is unintentionally overlapping with another route, redirects might lead to the wrong location. Sometimes, a minor typo or misplaced constraint can throw the entire system off.

For instance, I once inherited a project where a redirect to a user profile page was inexplicably sending folks to the homepage. After a good amount of head-scratching, it turned out that the route definition was too broad and was being matched before the more specific profile route.

Here's a simplified example illustrating what that might look like:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb (incorrectly ordered)

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'users/:id', to: 'home#index' # This is incorrect, should be last
  get 'users/profile', to: 'users#profile'
  root 'home#index'
end
```

In this incorrect setup, when someone tried to navigate to `/users/profile`, the `:id` parameter was capturing `profile` as if it were a user id, causing the request to erroneously route to the home page. In this situation, since `/users/:id` would match the string `/users/profile` because the colon implies a variable, it would incorrectly match first. This is where the order of routes matters immensely. The solution, is of course, is to make sure the more precise routes are declared first.

Here's the corrected version:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb (correctly ordered)
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'users/profile', to: 'users#profile'
  get 'users/:id', to: 'users#show' # Correct implementation
  root 'home#index'
end

```

Now, the request for `/users/profile` correctly directs the user to the profile page. The most specific route is processed first and matches first, avoiding any ambiguity.

Moving on from routing definition errors, another very frequent reason for redirect issues lies in the redirect statements within the controllers themselves. The `redirect_to` method in Rails is pretty flexible, allowing you to specify a path, a named route, or even an object; however, it's crucial to ensure that these directives align with the defined routes. If you're using a named route like, say `user_path`, but you've made a typo in the parameters, the generated URL might point somewhere unexpected.

I had a recent experience where I spent a good hour debugging a redirection loop that occurred after a form submission. The form was supposed to redirect to the 'show' action after successful creation, and instead was inexplicably redirecting back to the form itself. After carefully inspecting the params and comparing them to the route parameters, I found a subtle error:

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb (incorrect redirect)
def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    if @user.save
        redirect_to user_path # Incorrect, missing parameter
    else
        render :new
    end
end
```

The `user_path` helper, without any parameters, was producing a URL that was not correctly directing to the `show` action for a specific user because it expects a user ID to generate a complete path. This results in the system not being able to resolve an actual page, therefore it simply renders the form again.

The solution was to pass in the user object we just created to correctly format the route:

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb (correct redirect)
def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    if @user.save
       redirect_to user_path(@user) # Correct, including the user ID
    else
        render :new
    end
end
```

This illustrates the need to understand the specifics of Rails route helpers and the parameters they require. It's a good practice to check your route definitions and verify that the generated paths are behaving as expected. The Rails console command `rails routes` can be very valuable in visualizing all defined routes and their respective patterns, allowing to see the parameters each helper requires.

Finally, another common culprit behind redirect woes involves the use of filters or middleware. Rails applications can employ before or after action filters that alter the flow of the request. If one of these filters performs a redirection, it can certainly interfere with the expected redirection logic in the controller itself. A common scenario is a security filter that redirects unauthorized users to a login page, which can sometimes mask issues in the main redirection logic of the application if not implemented correctly. Also, certain middleware might intercept requests and perform redirects before they even reach the controller.

I remember a particularly interesting case where a third-party authentication library introduced a redirect that was completely overriding all other redirects. It took some time examining the middleware stack and its order in the application’s initialization to locate it. This led me to a situation where the intended redirects from controllers were ignored.

While I can’t provide that exact code example due to its proprietary nature, imagine this theoretical scenario:

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
  before_action :check_authentication

  def check_authentication
    unless current_user # Assuming 'current_user' is implemented elsewhere
      redirect_to login_path, notice: 'You must be logged in.'
    end
  end
```

The problem would arise if a controller action, intended to redirect to a different location, was also being invoked by an unauthorized user. The `check_authentication` method would redirect them to `login_path` first, never allowing the subsequent redirect within the controller to run. This would manifest as unexpected redirection patterns, often leading to the login page, instead of the intended final page.

To mitigate this sort of issue, proper ordering and understanding of filters are needed, and it sometimes involves using the `skip_before_action` method when applicable. Additionally, being aware of the middleware stack through the `Rails.application.middleware` command can help understand potential interferences.

In summary, when your Rails routes are redirecting you to the incorrect link, consider these key areas: meticulously examine your `config/routes.rb` for any overlapping or incorrectly ordered route definitions, carefully scrutinize your `redirect_to` calls within your controllers to make sure the parameters are correctly set, and pay close attention to any filters or middleware that might be interfering with the redirection process. For deeper insights into these, I'd recommend checking the official Rails documentation for a comprehensive overview of routing and controller logic. Also, consulting resources like 'Agile Web Development with Rails' by Sam Ruby et al. can further enhance your understanding of these areas with detailed explanations and practical scenarios. Mastering these aspects will drastically reduce those perplexing redirect puzzles you might find yourself facing.
