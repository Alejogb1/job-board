Let's tackle this one. I remember a particularly nasty sequence-to-sequence translation project a few years back where this very detail became the linchpin of whether our models converged or not. The initial assumption, naturally, was that resetting the recurrent neural network states—specifically lstm and gru—after each batch would be the optimal approach. After all, each batch is a new set of inputs, isn't it? However, that's where we ran into significant instability and poor learning. Let me explain why resetting states per epoch, rather than per batch, is often the more appropriate methodology in tensorflow and similar frameworks, and why this choice directly impacts model performance.

The core issue revolves around how recurrent neural networks, particularly lstm and gru, process information. These models maintain an internal memory, or 'state', that allows them to retain information from previous time steps. This state is crucial for handling sequential data where context is paramount. Resetting this state means the model effectively forgets everything about the sequence it just processed, including the learned dependencies.

When you process sequential data, be it a sentence or a time-series, information flows across time steps within a batch. Now, imagine resetting the hidden and cell states after every single batch. Each batch, being processed in isolation from its predecessors, essentially treats the sequence as completely new, losing all inter-batch context. This means that the model can't learn dependencies or patterns that span across multiple batches, which is detrimental for tasks where long-range dependencies are crucial. It’s like reading a book one paragraph at a time and forgetting everything from the previous paragraph before starting a new one—you'd struggle to understand the overall narrative.

Resetting states at the end of an epoch, on the other hand, allows the model to maintain a "memory" of the entire dataset over a complete pass, a critical point. An epoch represents one full iteration over all the training data, and while the specific order may vary in each epoch (due to shuffling), the model processes every sequence fully. This allows long-range dependencies to be discovered and internalized, leading to better generalization and overall model performance. The state, which encapsulates the accumulated knowledge and understanding of the input sequences, is then reset at the beginning of the next epoch to start fresh without carrying over bias from the previous learning iteration.

Let’s illustrate this with code. Imagine we have time series data that can be reasonably represented with an lstm. We’ll start with a simple example showcasing how to handle states properly in tensorflow without explicitly resetting.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample time series data - shape is (num_samples, timesteps, features)
num_samples = 100
timesteps = 20
features = 1
input_data = np.random.rand(num_samples, timesteps, features).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.rand(num_samples, 1).astype(np.float32) #dummy labels


# Model definition
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32, return_sequences=False), #stateful=False by default
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Data preparation
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((input_data, labels)).batch(32)

# Training loop
epochs = 5
for epoch in range(epochs):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}")
    for batch_data, batch_labels in dataset:
       model.train_on_batch(batch_data, batch_labels)
```

In this first example, we utilize tensorflow's default, *stateful=False*, behavior for the lstm layer. Note how the model doesn't require explicit state resetting at all. This implementation implicitly handles the state by resetting it at the start of each *epoch*, as the batches are processed sequentially within the epoch. This provides a functional baseline. The key is in how the data is iterated - the dataset is iterated once fully, before restarting the whole loop, and the model is expected to retain state between batches inside of the loop.

Now, let's explore how you might *incorrectly* try to force a reset at batch level and how it goes wrong.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample time series data - shape is (num_samples, timesteps, features)
num_samples = 100
timesteps = 20
features = 1
input_data = np.random.rand(num_samples, timesteps, features).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.rand(num_samples, 1).astype(np.float32) #dummy labels

# Model definition
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32, return_sequences=False, stateful=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Data preparation
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((input_data, labels)).batch(32)

# Training loop with explicit state reset per batch (wrong!)
epochs = 5
for epoch in range(epochs):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}")
    for batch_data, batch_labels in dataset:
        model.reset_states() # the mistake is here, resetting the state each batch
        model.train_on_batch(batch_data, batch_labels)
```
Here, the crucial change is the inclusion of `stateful=True` in the lstm layer and subsequent manual `model.reset_states()` call in the training loop *before* processing each batch. This attempts to force a state reset for each batch rather than the proper behavior of resetting between epochs. This approach will generally degrade performance because you are throwing away all temporal context learned during a single epoch.

Finally, let's look at an example that provides a closer approximation to the proper method, using the `stateful` option to retain state across batches within one epoch and to reset the state at the beginning of each epoch:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample time series data - shape is (num_samples, timesteps, features)
num_samples = 100
timesteps = 20
features = 1
input_data = np.random.rand(num_samples, timesteps, features).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.rand(num_samples, 1).astype(np.float32) #dummy labels

# Model definition
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32, return_sequences=False, stateful=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Data preparation
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((input_data, labels)).batch(32)

# Training loop with state reset only per epoch (correct usage)
epochs = 5
for epoch in range(epochs):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}")
    model.reset_states() # Correctly reset at the start of the epoch
    for batch_data, batch_labels in dataset:
        model.train_on_batch(batch_data, batch_labels)
```
Here, the `stateful=True` parameter maintains the state across batches within the epoch. We then explicitly `model.reset_states()` at the *start* of *each epoch*. This method is generally the more appropriate approach for tasks that need long-range dependencies as the model remembers the past through the whole epoch.

For further reading, I'd strongly recommend exploring the following:

1.  **"Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet**: This book provides a practical and intuitive explanation of recurrent neural networks, including lstm and gru, within the context of tensorflow's keras API. It covers the statefulness of lstm layers with great clarity.
2.  **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron**: This resource goes deeper into the practical aspects of sequence modeling with RNNs and will provide useful examples.
3.  **"Understanding LSTM Networks" by Christopher Olah**: Though not a book, this blog post provides a fantastic visualization and explanation of lstm internals. While it might not specifically address state resets in tensorflow, it offers a fundamental understanding of how lstms work. Understanding the theory helps make correct implementation choices.
4.  **Tensorflow documentation on recurrent layers:** Specifically, look at the documentation for tf.keras.layers.lstm and tf.keras.layers.gru and carefully review the sections on `stateful` parameter behavior.

In summary, resetting lstm and gru states per *epoch* rather than per *batch* is usually the correct strategy in tensorflow and other deep learning frameworks. The fundamental reason is the necessity to retain inter-batch context and learn longer-range temporal dependencies in sequential data. Resetting after each batch can significantly hinder learning, whereas resetting at the beginning of each epoch allows for effective learning and improved performance across epochs. The devil, as they say, often lies in the details, and understanding the state management of recurrent layers is fundamental for training robust and performant sequence models.
