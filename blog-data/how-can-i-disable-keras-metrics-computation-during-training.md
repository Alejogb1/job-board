Alright, let's tackle this. Disabling metric computation during keras training isn't always the first thing that comes to mind, but it's a surprisingly useful technique, especially when you're chasing performance gains or dealing with very large datasets. I remember a project years back where we were training a ridiculously large image recognition model – the default metrics calculation was adding a substantial overhead, slowing our epochs significantly. Finding a way to sidestep that proved crucial for getting the project delivered on time.

The core issue is that Keras, by default, computes and reports metrics *for each batch* during training. This is great for real-time monitoring and debugging but comes at a cost. The calculation of these metrics, especially for complex ones like f1-score or AUC, requires additional operations beyond just the forward and backward passes of the model. If you’re confident in your model architecture and training setup, and particularly if you're aiming for raw speed, disabling these metrics can offer a noticeable performance boost. Now, how do we actually do this?

Keras doesn't have a simple 'disable metrics' switch at the top level. Instead, you have to approach it with a little more granularity, primarily by controlling what you pass to the `model.compile()` method. Specifically, the `metrics` argument within `compile()` is where we’ll be focusing our attention. If you pass an empty list or `None` to this argument, keras will not compute any metrics during training. Instead, it will only track the training loss, which is always computed as part of the optimization process. Let’s look at some examples to understand this better:

**Example 1: Training Without Metrics**

Here’s a basic snippet of how to create a model and train it *without* any metrics calculated during training:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model WITHOUT any metrics
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Generate some dummy data
import numpy as np
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluation AFTER training is still possible
loss = model.evaluate(X_train, y_train, verbose=0)
print(f"Final Loss: {loss}")
```

In this snippet, notice the `model.compile()` line: there’s no `metrics` argument specified. By omitting it, keras defaults to calculating only the loss. As you can see, the model still trains, but you don't get the usual per-batch metrics output during the training progress. Importantly, the `model.evaluate()` method can still be used *after* training to assess the model performance with specified metrics.

**Example 2: Selective Metric Computation**

Now, suppose you want some metrics, but not all. Or perhaps, you only want metrics on a validation set and not the training set. In this scenario, the `metrics` argument accepts a list of metric names or metric objects. Here's an illustration:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras import metrics

# Define the same model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])


# Compile the model WITH only accuracy as metric
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=[metrics.Accuracy()]) # Specifically specify metrics

# Generate dummy data (same as before)
import numpy as np
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

X_val = np.random.rand(200, 10)
y_val = np.random.randint(0, 2, 200)

# Train the model with validation data and specified metrics on validation
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, 
          validation_data=(X_val,y_val),
          validation_metrics=[metrics.Accuracy()])

# Note: Metrics will not be computed during the training process on train data itself.
# Instead only validation loss and validation metrics are computed.
```

In this example, we pass a list containing `metrics.Accuracy()`. Now, keras will compute accuracy during training, as well as validation accuracy because we provided `validation_metrics`. Note that if you provide validation data in your call to `model.fit()` but don't specify the `validation_metrics`, the model uses `metrics` from `model.compile()` to calculate the validation metric by default. In this snippet, metrics are calculated on validation, but we have explicitly specified no metric during training.

**Example 3: Custom Metric Computation Control**

Sometimes, you may need even more fine-grained control over metrics computation. This is often the case if you want to implement some special aggregation logic or if you only need the raw tensors for further analysis. In this case, you can use a custom training loop. Although it increases complexity, it gives you maximum control over how you want metrics to be calculated. Here's a condensed look at that process:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Define the loss function
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# Generate data (same as before)
import numpy as np
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

# Custom training loop
epochs = 10
batch_size = 32
for epoch in range(epochs):
  for batch in range(len(X_train)//batch_size):
      start = batch * batch_size
      end = start + batch_size
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          y_pred = model(X_train[start:end])
          loss = loss_fn(y_train[start:end], y_pred)

      gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

      # Metric calculation is now entirely manual and can be skipped
      # at this point for better speed, or only computed on subsets
      # or specific intervals.
  print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")


# Evaluation after training
loss = model.evaluate(X_train, y_train, verbose=0)
print(f"Final Loss: {loss}")
```

Here, we've taken total control of the training process, bypassing Keras's built-in metric tracking completely during training. Note that the evaluation process is still using Keras's `model.evaluate()` method which does not compute any metrics unless specified during compilation. This method is now just used to provide an evaluation of the final loss. In this custom loop example, if we need metrics, we'd have to explicitly calculate them ourselves, allowing complete freedom in when and how they are computed.

**Further Reading & Considerations**

For a deeper understanding of Keras internals and custom training loops, I'd recommend diving into the TensorFlow official documentation, specifically the sections on "Custom Training Loops" and "Metrics." The book "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet is also invaluable for grasping the underlying mechanisms of Keras. And for a general understanding of performance optimization, consider research papers on efficient deep learning model training.

In summary, controlling metric computation during training is a key part of optimizing your workflow in Keras. Using these methods, you can effectively reduce overhead and speed up your training runs, and gain a deeper understanding of how Keras functions. It is always critical to understand the trade-offs and pick the method that suits your particular needs.
