Let's dive straight in, shall we? Having spent more years than I care to count optimizing similarity search on various platforms, the combination of c++ faiss with gpus and fastertransformer is certainly a topic that hits close to home. I remember a project a few years back where we were tasked with real-time retrieval of near-duplicate images. The sheer volume of data made cpu-based indexing a non-starter, and that's where the journey of hybridizing faiss and gpus, eventually leading to incorporating aspects of FasterTransformer, became indispensable.

The core challenge here is that faiss itself is primarily designed for cpu execution, and while it offers gpu support, getting the most out of it, especially with the throughput enhancements that FasterTransformer provides, necessitates a careful approach. Essentially, we're looking at offloading the computationally intensive parts of faiss indexing and search to the gpu, and potentially utilizing FasterTransformer's optimizations in that process, especially if your workflows involve the transformer model embedding generation.

First things first, let's clarify that a direct 'compilation' of faiss with FasterTransformer is not quite how it works. FasterTransformer focuses on optimizing the inference stage of transformer models on gpus, whereas faiss is about indexing and searching through high-dimensional vector data. Therefore, the goal isnâ€™t to merge the codebases, but rather to intelligently integrate them. The overall strategy typically involves:

1.  **Generating Embeddings on the GPU:** This step is where FasterTransformer comes into play. You would use FasterTransformer to generate embeddings from your input data (images, text, etc.) using a transformer model. Since FasterTransformer is optimized for gpus, this step can be significantly faster than doing it on the cpu.
2.  **Creating a Faiss Index:** Once you have your embeddings, you'll use the faiss library to create an index. In this case, it's crucial to use faiss's gpu implementation if we are going for speed. This is not an implicit process; you have to specifically create gpu-based index.
3. **Performing Similarity Search on the GPU:** Finally, during the search stage, faiss's gpu functions will handle the heavy lifting of the nearest neighbor search on the embeddings.

Let me show you this with some simplified code snippets illustrating the general idea:

**Snippet 1: Generating Embeddings with FasterTransformer**

This example is highly simplified, as setting up a full FasterTransformer pipeline will depend on your specific model and data. This merely serves to illustrate the *concept* of how you might acquire embeddings ready for faiss from your transformer model.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Hypothetical FasterTransformer interface (replace with your actual setup)
class FasterTransformerModel {
public:
    FasterTransformerModel(/*model params*/) {}
    std::vector<std::vector<float>> generateEmbeddings(const std::vector<std::string>& inputs) {
        // This would call into the FasterTransformer API to produce embeddings on GPU
        // Placeholder for now: returning dummy embeddings
        std::vector<std::vector<float>> embeddings;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < inputs.size(); ++i) {
          embeddings.push_back({(float)i, (float)i*2, (float)i*3});
        }
        return embeddings;
    }
};


int main() {
    // Initialise FasterTransformer model
    FasterTransformerModel model(/* model specific configuration */);
    
    // Sample input strings
    std::vector<std::string> inputs = {"input1", "input2", "input3"};

    // Generate embeddings on GPU
    std::vector<std::vector<float>> embeddings = model.generateEmbeddings(inputs);

    // Output to see
    for(const auto& emb : embeddings)
    {
        std::cout << "Embedding: ";
        for (float v : emb) {
            std::cout << v << " ";
        }
         std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
*Disclaimer: This is a stub showing the idea of using a library to generate embeddings, and it will not run without actual FasterTransformer implementation.*

**Snippet 2: Creating a Faiss GPU Index**

This snippet assumes we have the embeddings from the previous step. We'll create a simple flat index for demonstration:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <faiss/IndexFlat.h>
#include <faiss/gpu/GpuIndexFlat.h>
#include <faiss/gpu/StandardGpuResources.h>

int main() {
    int d = 3; // Dimension of the embeddings
    int nb = 3; // Number of embeddings
    
    // Mock embeddings from fastertransformer example
    std::vector<std::vector<float>> embeddings = {
      {0,0,0}, {1,2,3}, {2,4,6}
      };
    float *xb = new float[nb*d];
    for(int i =0; i < nb; ++i){
        for(int j = 0; j < d; ++j){
           xb[i * d + j] = embeddings[i][j];
        }
    }

    faiss::gpu::StandardGpuResources res;
    faiss::gpu::GpuIndexFlatL2 index(res, d);

    index.add(nb, xb);
    std::cout << "faiss gpu index created, total elements: " << index.ntotal() << std::endl;
    
    delete[] xb;

    return 0;
}
```
This example is explicitly using `faiss::gpu::GpuIndexFlatL2`, thereby leveraging the GPU. Remember, this assumes you have a gpu build of faiss installed with CUDA drivers available.

**Snippet 3: Performing a Search on the GPU**

Continuing from the previous example, we'll perform a search with a dummy query vector:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <faiss/IndexFlat.h>
#include <faiss/gpu/GpuIndexFlat.h>
#include <faiss/gpu/StandardGpuResources.h>

int main() {
     int d = 3; // Dimension of the embeddings
    int nb = 3; // Number of embeddings
    
    // Mock embeddings from fastertransformer example
    std::vector<std::vector<float>> embeddings = {
      {0,0,0}, {1,2,3}, {2,4,6}
      };
    float *xb = new float[nb*d];
    for(int i =0; i < nb; ++i){
        for(int j = 0; j < d; ++j){
           xb[i * d + j] = embeddings[i][j];
        }
    }

    faiss::gpu::StandardGpuResources res;
    faiss::gpu::GpuIndexFlatL2 index(res, d);
    
    index.add(nb, xb);

    int k = 1; // Number of nearest neighbors to search for
    std::vector<float> query = {1.2, 2.1, 3.4}; // Dummy query
    float *xq = query.data();

    std::vector<faiss::Index::idx_t> I(k);
    std::vector<float> D(k);

    index.search(1, xq, k, D.data(), I.data());

    std::cout << "Search results: " << std::endl;

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Nearest neighbor index: " << I[i] << ", Distance: " << D[i] << std::endl;
    }

    delete[] xb;


    return 0;
}
```

In practice, you will need to adapt these snippets to your specific case, which may involve different faiss index types and more complex handling of your input data. For a more in-depth understanding, I strongly recommend studying the faiss documentation, specifically the section on GPU usage and the various `GpuIndex` classes. Also, reading the FasterTransformer documentation regarding integration with other workflows would be beneficial for optimizing the embedding generation side.

From a practical standpoint, make sure your system is correctly configured for gpu-based operations: that entails having the correct CUDA drivers installed, along with the appropriate version of faiss and a gpu capable of running computations. It might be tempting to overlook these elements, but they form the very foundation of this endeavor.

For advanced concepts, look into papers such as "Billion-scale similarity search with GPUs" by Johnson et al., which provides insights into large-scale indexing on GPUs with faiss. Also, the research coming from nvidia focusing on FasterTransformer gives details on the optimizations and the various approaches for efficient inference of transformer models on gpus, it is worth exploring the material available online. Finally, reading through the faiss library's source code and examples will provide invaluable clarity in implementation.

In summary, integrating c++ faiss with FasterTransformer for gpu processing is not a single step process; it is a blend of generating embeddings with an optimised library and offloading the index and the search phase on GPU. It is a strategic approach, where you harness the strengths of each tool to produce an efficient and scalable similarity search pipeline. I hope this insight helps you navigate the process more effectively.
