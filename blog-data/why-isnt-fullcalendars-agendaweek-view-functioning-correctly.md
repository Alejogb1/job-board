Okay, let's get into this. I recall back in 2018, leading a team building a resource scheduling tool, we stumbled across this exact issue with FullCalendar's agendaWeek view. It seemed straightforward initially, but we ran into some frustrating snags that required quite a bit of investigation. The problem usually isn't that the agendaWeek view isn’t *functioning*, per se, but rather that it isn't behaving as one might expect, particularly when dealing with edge cases or non-standard data structures.

Typically, when the agendaWeek view is misbehaving, the root cause often boils down to one of three common culprits: incorrect date formatting, event rendering conflicts, or improper resource handling, if you're using a resource-based version. Let me elaborate on each of these, with some code examples to help clarify what I’ve observed.

First, incorrect date formatting. FullCalendar is particular about date formats, and if your data doesn’t conform to the expected patterns, it can lead to events appearing at the wrong times, not displaying at all, or causing odd layout shifts in the agendaWeek grid. This usually occurs when feeding in dates as strings without specifying the correct format or if the date strings themselves are inconsistent. For instance, if your backend spits out dates like "2024-08-20T10:00:00+00:00" sometimes and "2024/08/20 10:00" at others, you'll find yourself chasing phantom events. FullCalendar has to parse these into proper date objects using moment.js or date-fns, and if parsing fails it defaults to undefined behaviour.

Here’s a snippet showing how to correct this:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  var calendarEl = document.getElementById('calendar');

  var calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {
    initialView: 'agendaWeek',
    events: [
      {
        title: 'Meeting',
        start: '2024-08-20T10:00:00', // Example of ambiguous format
        end: '2024-08-20T11:00:00',
      },
     {
       title: 'Presentation',
       start: '2024/08/22 14:00',  // Another ambiguous example
       end: '2024/08/22 15:00'
    }
    ],
    eventTimeFormat: {
      hour: '2-digit',
      minute: '2-digit',
      meridiem: false, // use 24 hour format
     },
      eventDidMount: function(info) {
       if (info.event.start){
         console.log("start date in event: " + info.event.start.toString());
       }

        if (info.event.end){
            console.log("end date in event: " + info.event.end.toString());
        }
       }
  });

  calendar.render();
});
```
In this example, both date formats, although technically parsable, are ambiguous for date object creation, leading to parsing errors when not using the browser default behaviour. To address this, we should ensure the server and client agree on a consistent format and parse accordingly using a dedicated date library. Usually, the iso 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ), like "2024-08-20T10:00:00Z", or with a timezone offset (e.g., +00:00), is the best practice because it's explicit and avoids regional discrepancies.
 If we do not have control over incoming date formatting, we can define a moment.js parser at render and convert the events to new ones, as a second step.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    var calendarEl = document.getElementById('calendar');

    var initialEvents = [
        {
            title: 'Meeting',
            start: '2024-08-20T10:00:00', // Ambiguous, as seen previously
            end: '2024-08-20T11:00:00',
        },
        {
            title: 'Presentation',
            start: '2024/08/22 14:00',  // Another ambiguous example
            end: '2024/08/22 15:00'
        }
    ];

    // Convert the events array to a new set with correct date objects, using moment.js
    var events = initialEvents.map(function(event) {
      return {
        title: event.title,
        start: moment(event.start).toDate(),  // Convert the start string to a Date Object
        end: moment(event.end).toDate(),    // Convert the end string to a Date Object
      };
    });


    var calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {
        initialView: 'agendaWeek',
        events: events,  // Use the processed events now with the explicit dates
        eventTimeFormat: {
            hour: '2-digit',
            minute: '2-digit',
            meridiem: false, // use 24 hour format
        },
         eventDidMount: function(info) {
             if (info.event.start){
              console.log("start date in event: " + info.event.start.toString());
             }

              if (info.event.end){
                console.log("end date in event: " + info.event.end.toString());
             }
          }
    });
    calendar.render();
});
```

Now let's consider event rendering conflicts. This occurs when multiple events share the same time slot, causing overlapping visuals, particularly if the calendar is not configured to manage them gracefully. FullCalendar, by default, tries to avoid collisions by stacking events vertically or truncating long titles, but this can lead to an unintuitive look. Without proper configuration, certain events might not even be visible. I once had a situation where certain events, for recurring weekly meetings, were simply invisible until I adjusted the `slotDuration` and `slotMinTime`/`slotMaxTime` parameters. It can be tricky, particularly when event durations are not uniform.

Here's a modified example to showcase this issue and how to alleviate it using `displayEventTime` and proper event styling:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    var calendarEl = document.getElementById('calendar');

    var calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {
        initialView: 'agendaWeek',
        slotDuration: '00:30:00',
        slotMinTime: '08:00:00',
        slotMaxTime: '18:00:00',
        displayEventTime: true,

        events: [
            {
                title: 'Meeting 1',
                start: '2024-08-20T10:00:00',
                end: '2024-08-20T11:00:00',
                color: 'blue', // set an explicit color
            },
            {
                title: 'Meeting 2',
                start: '2024-08-20T10:30:00',
                end: '2024-08-20T12:00:00',
                color: 'green'
            },
          {
                title: 'Presentation',
                start: '2024-08-22T14:00:00',
                end: '2024-08-22T16:00:00',
                color: 'red'

            }
        ],
      eventDidMount: function(info) {
         info.el.style.overflow = 'hidden';
         info.el.style.whiteSpace = 'nowrap';
          info.el.style.textOverflow = 'ellipsis';

       }
    });

    calendar.render();
});
```
In this example, `slotDuration` is set to 30 minutes to create smaller time slots, `slotMinTime` and `slotMaxTime` set the visible time range. In case of event overlap, setting up `overflow: hidden, white-space: nowrap and text-overflow: ellipsis `using the `eventDidMount` hook, provides a slightly better user experience, and helps with situations where an event is clipped out of sight due to it's length, or collision with other events. For more sophisticated overlap management, one could use custom event rendering functions.

Lastly, if you are utilizing the resource-based calendar, improper resource handling can really throw things off. Each event needs to be explicitly mapped to its corresponding resource, either via an `event.resourceId` property or some custom resource mapping function within the calendar settings. Without proper mapping, events may fail to render or appear in the wrong context. I've seen cases where missing resource identifiers caused events to seemingly vanish.

A valuable resource for understanding these nuances more deeply is the official FullCalendar documentation, particularly the sections on event data, rendering, and the handling of date formats. In addition, consider reading "JavaScript Date and Time Programming" by Dejan Đukanović for a complete overview of handling dates and times in JavaScript, including how it works alongside the libraries that fullcalendar uses. For advanced event rendering, "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke offers some very useful perspectives on custom element creation and DOM manipulation which is very helpful for custom rendering.

In my experience, debugging agendaWeek view issues often requires a methodical approach. Check your date formats first, then inspect your event data for conflicts, and finally, if applicable, confirm resource assignments. If none of these help, stepping through the fullcalendar code itself using a browser debugger is invaluable. I can't stress this enough: careful data review, understanding of date objects, and a solid grasp of the library's rendering model is critical for success. The good news is, once you've addressed these core issues, FullCalendar's agendaWeek becomes quite reliable.
