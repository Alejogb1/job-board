Let’s tackle this. It's a situation I’ve bumped into a few times myself, specifically back in the day when we were scaling our e-commerce platform. Dealing with interrupt handling, especially when interacting with external services like MongoDB, introduces some lovely complexity, particularly when both Rails (with its middleware stack) and Minitest (during tests) are also in the game of trapping signals. It can become a bit of a battleground, and direct use of the Ruby Mongo driver’s methods within a signal handler can easily lead to unpredictable behavior and resource contention. So, how do we sidestep this? Well, the goal is to maintain a degree of transactional integrity without jeopardizing the stability of the system upon receiving a signal.

First, it’s crucial to understand what's actually happening. When a signal is received (e.g., sigterm during a graceful shutdown), the ruby interpreter halts normal program execution and immediately jumps into the specified handler. If that handler involves the Mongo driver, and specifically if that driver is potentially in the middle of its own operation, you get a race condition and unpredictable results as threads might get interrupted mid-operation. Rails' middleware and Minitest's hooks both have their own signal traps. The critical mistake here is to attempt to do blocking database operations in the signal handler. It's not about the driver, per se; it's about *any* I/O operation that isn't idempotent.

The solution revolves around decoupling the signal handling from the database operations. My primary strategy, and one I’ve successfully used, is to use a queue (a thread-safe one, of course) or an external system to handle the persistence tasks asynchronously. Instead of directly interacting with MongoDB in the signal handler, we enqueue our data into the queue. Then, another process or thread, running outside the main interrupt context, processes these queued requests at its own pace. Let's look at some code.

**Example 1: Using a thread-safe queue with a worker thread**

```ruby
require 'thread'
require 'mongo'

class SignalHandler
  def initialize(mongo_client)
    @mongo_client = mongo_client
    @queue = Queue.new
    @shutdown = false
    start_worker_thread
    setup_signal_traps
  end

  def enqueue_data(data)
    @queue.push(data)
  end

  private

  def start_worker_thread
      @worker_thread = Thread.new do
        until @shutdown && @queue.empty?
          begin
            data = @queue.pop(true) # non-blocking pop, wait if empty
            persist_data(data)
          rescue ThreadError
            # Queue is empty, retry on next iteration.
          end
          sleep 0.1 # small pause to not burn resources
        end
      end
  end

  def persist_data(data)
    begin
      collection = @mongo_client[:my_database][:my_collection]
      collection.insert_one(data)
      puts "Data persisted: #{data}"
    rescue Mongo::Error => e
      puts "Error persisting data: #{e.message}"
      # handle error here appropriately - logging, retry, or discard
    end
  end

  def setup_signal_traps
     Signal.trap('TERM') do
        puts "TERM signal received."
        initiate_shutdown
      end
     Signal.trap('INT') do
        puts "INT signal received."
        initiate_shutdown
     end
  end

  def initiate_shutdown
    @shutdown = true
    @worker_thread.join # wait for worker thread to finish
    puts "Shutdown complete"
    exit 0
  end
end

# Example Usage:
client = Mongo::Client.new(['127.0.0.1:27017'], database: 'mydb')
handler = SignalHandler.new(client)

# Simulate some data enqueues
handler.enqueue_data({ data: 'value 1' })
handler.enqueue_data({ data: 'value 2' })
sleep 2 # lets the worker process the jobs

# To test the shutdown just send SIGTERM or SIGINT to the process
# in your terminal.
```

In this setup, data is pushed into the `Queue` in the main thread (presumably called from application logic). The `worker_thread` pulls data from the queue and persists it to MongoDB. The `initiate_shutdown` method then gracefully waits for the worker thread to finish. This avoids direct database interaction in signal handlers.

**Example 2: Using a job processing system (e.g., Sidekiq or Resque)**

While the queue works well for simpler scenarios, systems like Sidekiq or Resque offer much more robust job processing capabilities. This is especially beneficial when you have retries, complex dependencies, and greater throughput needs. The pattern however, remains identical - enqueue, don’t execute in the handler.

```ruby
require 'sidekiq'
require 'mongo'

# Configure Sidekiq (this setup is very basic, for demonstration only)
Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
    config.redis = { :url => 'redis://localhost:6379/0' }
end

class PersistDataWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(data)
    client = Mongo::Client.new(['127.0.0.1:27017'], database: 'mydb')
    collection = client[:my_database][:my_collection]
    collection.insert_one(data)
    puts "Data persisted by Sidekiq: #{data}"
  rescue Mongo::Error => e
    puts "Error persisting data using Sidekiq: #{e.message}"
    # proper error handling/retry logic here
  end
end


class SignalHandlerWithSidekiq
  def initialize
    setup_signal_traps
  end

  def enqueue_data(data)
    PersistDataWorker.perform_async(data)
  end

    private

  def setup_signal_traps
    Signal.trap('TERM') do
        puts "TERM signal received, enqueuing jobs for processing."
        initiate_shutdown
    end

    Signal.trap('INT') do
        puts "INT signal received, enqueuing jobs for processing."
        initiate_shutdown
    end
  end

  def initiate_shutdown
    # note there is no waiting for jobs to finish here, it depends on Sidekiq's
    # internal shutdown logic.
    puts "Shutdown initiated. Sidekiq will handle pending jobs."
    exit 0
  end
end

# Example usage:
handler = SignalHandlerWithSidekiq.new

# Simulate some data enqueues
handler.enqueue_data({ data: 'value 1' })
handler.enqueue_data({ data: 'value 2' })
sleep 2

# send SIGTERM to the process
```

Here, the `SignalHandlerWithSidekiq` enqueues the persistence to the sidekiq queue. The separate sidekiq worker picks the jobs up and saves it to MongoDB. This completely decouples signal handling from db operations.

**Example 3: Using an external service or API**

In situations where you don’t have local queues or prefer a completely separate service, using an external API is also viable. The signal handler would then just send data to that API, and the persistence logic would exist within that API/service.

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'
require 'json'

class SignalHandlerWithApi
    def initialize(api_endpoint)
        @api_endpoint = api_endpoint
        setup_signal_traps
    end

    def enqueue_data(data)
      uri = URI(@api_endpoint)
      http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
      request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.path, 'Content-Type' => 'application/json')
      request.body = data.to_json
      response = http.request(request)

      if response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)
        puts "Data sent to API: #{data}"
      else
        puts "API request failed, status: #{response.code}, body: #{response.body}"
      end

    rescue => e
        puts "Failed to send data to api: #{e}"
    end

    private

    def setup_signal_traps
         Signal.trap('TERM') do
           puts "TERM signal received, enqueuing data via API."
           initiate_shutdown
          end
         Signal.trap('INT') do
            puts "INT signal received, enqueuing data via API."
            initiate_shutdown
         end
    end


    def initiate_shutdown
        puts "Shutdown complete. External service will process."
        exit 0
    end
end

# Example Usage:
api_url = 'http://localhost:3000/persist'
handler = SignalHandlerWithApi.new(api_url)

handler.enqueue_data({ data: 'value 1' })
handler.enqueue_data({ data: 'value 2' })

sleep 2

# Send SIGTERM or SIGINT
```

In this example, we make a simple HTTP Post call to a separate API endpoint that would handle the actual data persistence. This API could, itself, use a queue, a different database or any other persistence strategy that fits your needs. The crucial aspect is that the signal handler is not directly writing to MongoDB.

It’s worth noting that there are nuances, and no one-size-fits-all solution. Depending on your specific constraints, you might even opt for a combination of these strategies. For example, you could use a queue locally and have a worker process that batches requests before sending them to the external API.

For further reading, I'd suggest looking into concurrency patterns using threads in ruby (refer to the ruby documentation on `Thread` and `Queue` classes). For background jobs, check out "Sidekiq in Practice" by Mike Perham for in-depth strategies. For a more theoretical treatment, the book “Operating System Concepts” by Silberschatz et al. provides a good overview of interrupt handling and race conditions. These should put you on the path toward robust and reliable signal handling with your data persistence needs, without having the Mongo driver directly in a signal trap. Finally, always consider testing all these cases to ensure your solution behaves as intended.
