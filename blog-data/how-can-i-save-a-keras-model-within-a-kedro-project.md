,  Saving a Keras model within a Kedro project is a task I’ve handled a number of times, and it’s one that touches on several aspects of good data engineering practices. It’s more than just about hitting “save”; it’s about ensuring reproducibility, version control, and seamless integration with your pipeline. I’ve seen it go wrong enough times to know the nuances. The key is to treat the model like any other dataset—a crucial intermediate artifact in your overall workflow.

The standard Keras method of saving models with `.save()` or `.save_weights()` works, of course, but it’s not really suited for integration with Kedro’s approach to managing data and project structure. Kedro leverages its data catalog to maintain a record of datasets and their corresponding storage locations. Trying to manually manage the file paths for saved models outside of the catalog will lead to headaches further down the line, particularly in collaborative environments.

My preferred method, and the one I’ve consistently found the most robust, is to utilize Kedro’s `AbstractDataSet` to implement a custom dataset type specifically for Keras models. This allows us to define the save and load logic within a dedicated class, ensuring consistent handling of models throughout the Kedro project. It also provides a clear path for further customization, such as adding versioning or specific serialization requirements.

Let's take a closer look at how we can achieve this. First, consider a simple implementation where we save the entire model. Here's a Python code snippet that defines a custom dataset:

```python
from kedro.io import AbstractDataSet
import tensorflow as tf
import os
import shutil

class KerasModelDataSet(AbstractDataSet):
    def __init__(self, filepath: str):
        self._filepath = filepath

    def _save(self, data: tf.keras.Model):
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(self._filepath), exist_ok=True)
        data.save(self._filepath)


    def _load(self) -> tf.keras.Model:
        return tf.keras.models.load_model(self._filepath)


    def _describe(self):
        return dict(filepath=self._filepath)
```

This `KerasModelDataSet` class inherits from `AbstractDataSet`. In the `__init__` method, we’re just storing the file path where the model will reside. The `_save` method takes a Keras model and utilizes the standard `model.save()` function from TensorFlow to serialize it to disk. Crucially, I added a `os.makedirs` to handle cases where the directory doesn't already exist, which has saved me from debugging file system errors more than once. The `_load` method utilizes `tf.keras.models.load_model` to load it back into memory. Finally, the `_describe` method provides information on the dataset for the Kedro catalog.

To use this within your Kedro project, you'd first need to register it as a dataset type. In your project's `conf/base/catalog.yml`, or in a relevant environment catalog file (e.g., `conf/local/catalog.yml`), you'd add something like this:

```yaml
model_output:
  type: src.data.keras_dataset.KerasModelDataSet
  filepath: data/06_models/my_model.keras
```

Here, `src.data.keras_dataset` corresponds to the python file and directory where you've saved your `KerasModelDataSet` class. “model_output” is the name you give this dataset in the Kedro catalog, `filepath` specifies where to save this model relative to `data/`, and the `type` field tells Kedro which class to use for handling the reading and writing of this data.

Now, let's consider a slightly more complex scenario where you only want to save the model's weights. This is often useful if you're working with a complex model architecture and want to be able to load them into a different instance of the same architecture. The changes would be within the `_save` and `_load` methods of our custom class:

```python
from kedro.io import AbstractDataSet
import tensorflow as tf
import os
import shutil

class KerasWeightsDataSet(AbstractDataSet):
    def __init__(self, filepath: str):
        self._filepath = filepath

    def _save(self, data: tf.keras.Model):
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(self._filepath), exist_ok=True)
        data.save_weights(self._filepath)


    def _load(self) -> tf.keras.Model:
        # Assume you have a function 'create_model' that defines your architecture
        model = create_model()  
        model.load_weights(self._filepath)
        return model


    def _describe(self):
        return dict(filepath=self._filepath)
```

Notice how `data.save_weights` is used instead of `data.save`. Also, `_load` now requires creating the Keras model using a `create_model` function before loading weights into it; this means the model architecture *must* match the weights. This version would be useful when you have large complex models and don't want the full overhead of saving the entire model object.

Finally, let's address the case where you want to have multiple different models or model versions within a project. This can be managed by using parameters passed to the dataset definition in Kedro's catalog. Consider this `catalog.yml` entry:

```yaml
model_output_v1:
  type: src.data.keras_dataset.KerasModelDataSet
  filepath: data/06_models/my_model_v1.keras

model_output_v2:
  type: src.data.keras_dataset.KerasModelDataSet
  filepath: data/06_models/my_model_v2.keras
```

This approach lets you explicitly define each model path in the catalog. Alternatively, you could introduce parameters or use functions to manage your model names, but I find the explicit configuration to provide better long-term readability.

A more programmatic approach to handle versions could be:

```python
from kedro.io import AbstractDataSet
import tensorflow as tf
import os
import shutil
import datetime

class KerasVersionedModelDataSet(AbstractDataSet):
    def __init__(self, filepath_base: str):
        self._filepath_base = filepath_base
        self._timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
        self._filepath = os.path.join(self._filepath_base, f"model_{self._timestamp}.keras")

    def _save(self, data: tf.keras.Model):
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(self._filepath), exist_ok=True)
        data.save(self._filepath)


    def _load(self) -> tf.keras.Model:
        # This could be improved by searching for the latest timestamp, or by having the load path configured
        return tf.keras.models.load_model(self._filepath)


    def _describe(self):
        return dict(filepath=self._filepath)
```

Here, the `filepath` is created dynamically based on a base path and a timestamp in the `__init__`. Notice that in the loading process you may need to include additional logic to load the latest version rather than the version which was used when the dataset was created.

In your `catalog.yml`:

```yaml
model_output:
  type: src.data.keras_dataset.KerasVersionedModelDataSet
  filepath_base: data/06_models
```

Implementing the custom dataset approach offers several advantages: it enforces consistency across your project by centralizing the model saving and loading logic, which improves maintainability, it provides a clear integration path with Kedro, ensuring that models are treated as data artifacts, and it can be extended to handle versioning, specific serialization requirements, or any other custom needs. While the standard `.save()` might work for simple cases, the above approach provides a much more robust solution for complex projects, particularly when working in teams.

For further reading on this topic, I would recommend looking into the Kedro documentation on custom datasets. Also, delving into the TensorFlow Keras API documentation for `model.save()` and `model.save_weights()` will provide deeper insights into the available options. For a broader understanding of data engineering practices, consider reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann. I believe those should provide a solid foundation for implementing proper model saving techniques within Kedro.
