Alright, let’s unpack why a pre-trained model might stubbornly refuse to generate embeddings, a frustration I’ve encountered more times than I’d like to remember, especially when dealing with complex model architectures. It isn't necessarily that the model *can't* do it, but often that it's not set up correctly *to* do it, or that you're attempting something the model wasn't originally intended for.

In my past life, during a project involving semantic search on legal documents, we faced this exact situation. We'd meticulously pre-trained a custom transformer-based model on a massive corpus of text using a masked language modeling objective. The pre-training phase went smoothly, validating the model's learning capabilities. Yet, when we switched gears to fine-tuning for embedding generation, we kept hitting roadblocks. The core issue wasn't model corruption or a catastrophic programming flaw, but rather a misunderstanding of the intended use and the necessary adjustments.

At its heart, a pre-trained model is essentially a function that takes an input (often text or sequences of tokens) and produces an output. This output isn't necessarily an embedding; it’s typically a distribution over the vocabulary (during pre-training for tasks like masked language modeling) or a classification decision. The key is how you choose to *interpret* and *use* the internal state of the model to generate your embedding vector.

The model architecture, training objective, and even the libraries you're using can all influence this. For instance, if your pre-trained model was optimized for next-token prediction or classification, the final layer's activations, typically involving softmax or sigmoid operations, might not directly translate into meaningful vector representations. These outputs are structured for a probability distribution over a vocabulary space, not for encoding semantic information as you'd desire with an embedding.

The first potential culprit, and probably the most frequent one, involves how you're retrieving the output. We had a situation early on where we were trying to extract the final logits (output of the last linear layer before activation functions) directly as the embeddings. This approach yielded vectors that were highly specific to the token context rather than the overall meaning. What we needed, instead, was to extract the output from the penultimate hidden layer, often referred to as the ‘pooler output’ in transformer architectures. This is the layer that captures a more distilled, contextually rich representation of the input, making it suitable for embeddings.

Here's a simplified illustration using a hypothetical transformer model in python, focusing on the crucial layer selection:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# Assuming you've trained a model and saved it at 'my_pretrained_model'

model_name = "my_pretrained_model"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)


def generate_embedding(text, model, tokenizer):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)
    with torch.no_grad():
      outputs = model(**inputs, output_hidden_states=True)
    # Incorrect attempt: Use final logit vectors as embeddings
    # embeddings_logits = outputs.logits # WRONG - specific to token distribution

    # The right way: use the pooler layer (or the last hidden state after pooling)
    embeddings = outputs.pooler_output
    return embeddings


text = "This is a sample sentence."
embeddings = generate_embedding(text, model, tokenizer)
print(embeddings.shape)
```

In this example, `outputs.pooler_output` captures the pooled representation, which is ideal for general-purpose sentence embeddings. If your model lacks a pooler layer or if you want token level embeddings, then using the last hidden state might be appropriate. Another common pitfall stems from whether or not the model is in 'eval' mode, which deactivates dropout and other regularization techniques. Failing to do this would lead to stochastic variations within the produced vectors and would not consistently produce the kind of semantic representation you need.

Here's an extension showing how to access the last hidden state:

```python
def generate_token_embeddings(text, model, tokenizer):
  inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)
  with torch.no_grad():
      outputs = model(**inputs, output_hidden_states=True)

  # Accessing last hidden states, useful for token-level embeddings
  embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state

  return embeddings


text = "This is a sample sentence."
token_embeddings = generate_token_embeddings(text, model, tokenizer)
print(token_embeddings.shape)
```

Another critical aspect to consider involves the model’s architecture directly. Some models are specifically designed with an architecture that inherently lends itself to producing useful contextualized representations, such as those using attention mechanisms. However, some less sophisticated architectures don't provide that kind of meaningful latent representation; for example, a simple bag-of-words model won’t easily produce such embeddings.

Finally, the way you tokenize your input is crucial. Ensure that the tokenizer used during the embedding generation is *identical* to the one used during the pre-training phase. Tokenization mismatches can severely degrade the quality of the embeddings. Different tokenizers will segment words into different tokens which will lead to completely different vectors being generated, and will invalidate the knowledge the model has accumulated during its training.

Here's a final example showcasing what happens when you incorrectly configure a tokenizer. This is a contrived case, but it highlights the problem:

```python
from transformers import RobertaTokenizer

# Pretend `my_pretrained_model` used RobertaTokenizer during training.
correct_tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained("roberta-base")

# Imagine mistakenly loading a different tokenizer.
incorrect_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")


def generate_embeddings_incorrectly(text, model, tokenizer):
  inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)
  with torch.no_grad():
      outputs = model(**inputs, output_hidden_states=True)
  embeddings = outputs.pooler_output
  return embeddings

text = "This is a sample sentence."
embeddings_correct = generate_embedding(text, model, correct_tokenizer)
embeddings_incorrect = generate_embeddings_incorrectly(text, model, incorrect_tokenizer)

print("Shape with correct tokenizer:", embeddings_correct.shape)
print("Shape with incorrect tokenizer:", embeddings_incorrect.shape)
```

As you can observe, while the model appears to work, the underlying embedding vector is completely different, meaning its semantic significance would be lost. The shape might be the same if the model architectures are compatible, however, the quality of the representation will be compromised.

In short, generating embeddings from pre-trained models isn't just about passing text through the model; it requires a thoughtful understanding of how the model processes information and choosing the appropriate layers and configurations for embedding generation. It requires ensuring that the tokenizers match and that you select the correct layer for extracting meaningful vector representations.

For a deeper dive, I'd recommend exploring the original transformer paper, "Attention is All You Need," by Vaswani et al., and looking through the Hugging Face documentation on transformers library to understand the intricacies of model outputs and available options. Another very valuable resource is "Natural Language Processing with Transformers" by Lewis Tunstall et al., which provides a detailed view of many transformer models and their internal structures, along with the best practices for utilizing them effectively.
