Alright, let's talk asynchronous task orchestration, because frankly, I’ve seen enough systems fall over due to mishandled async operations to fill a small server farm. The core of the issue, as you’ve asked, revolves around controlling execution order and dependencies when tasks within a function don't run sequentially. It's a critical problem, and honestly, getting it wrong can lead to anything from subtle data inconsistencies to full-blown application crashes. In my earlier days, I once dealt with a financial platform that completely miscalculated daily trading figures due to improperly sequenced async database updates – a learning experience I certainly wouldn’t repeat. The key takeaway from that debacle? Understanding the nuances of how asynchronous operations are managed.

At its heart, asynchronous programming, especially within a single function, moves us away from the predictable, synchronous world where one line of code finishes before the next begins. This creates a challenge – how do we ensure that task 'b' only runs after task 'a' completes, especially when ‘a’ could take an indeterminate amount of time? We're no longer in the linear flow of execution; we’re managing a web of concurrently executing processes. So, here’s how we typically tackle it.

The predominant methods involve promises (or futures), async/await syntax, and task queues. These aren't mutually exclusive, by the way; often, we use them in conjunction. Let’s start with promises. A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. Think of it as a placeholder for a value that isn't yet available. When an asynchronous function (say a network request) starts, it returns a promise. This promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. We use `.then()` to schedule code that runs when the promise fulfills (i.e., the operation is successful) and `.catch()` to handle failures. The chainability of `.then()` allows us to create a sequence of asynchronous tasks.

Here's a basic javascript example to illustrate:

```javascript
function fetchData(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = { message: "Data fetched from " + url };
      resolve(data);
    }, 1000);
  });
}

fetchData("api/data1")
  .then((result1) => {
    console.log("First fetch:", result1.message);
    return fetchData("api/data2");
  })
  .then((result2) => {
    console.log("Second fetch:", result2.message);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
  });
```

In this code, we’re using `.then()` to ensure that the second fetch only happens after the first one successfully completes. If either fails, the `.catch()` block will handle the error. The advantage here is clear dependency management – `fetchData("api/data2")` is inherently dependent on the successful completion of `fetchData("api/data1")`. This is how we guarantee order when the function itself has no inherent synchronous flow.

Now, while promises are powerful, their nested `.then()` chains can sometimes become difficult to manage, leading to what's often called "promise hell". Here’s where `async/await` comes into play, and this is the approach that I personally prefer for most situations because it greatly improves readability. This is just syntactic sugar built on top of promises but makes your asynchronous code look and feel synchronous.

Here’s the same example rewritten with `async/await`:

```javascript
async function fetchDataAsync() {
  try {
    const result1 = await fetchData("api/data1");
    console.log("First fetch:", result1.message);
    const result2 = await fetchData("api/data2");
    console.log("Second fetch:", result2.message);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
  }
}

fetchDataAsync();
```

Notice how the `await` keyword makes the code look much more straightforward? It pauses the execution of the `fetchDataAsync` function until the promise returned by `fetchData()` resolves or rejects, effectively turning the asynchronous operation into something that behaves synchronously within the scope of the `async` function. The dependency management remains the same; the second fetch only happens after the first, but the code is significantly more readable and easier to reason about. Error handling becomes cleaner too, with a single `try/catch` block handling potential errors across all the async operations. This makes it significantly easier to reason about and maintain complex asynchronous workflows.

Finally, we need to talk about task queues. While promises and `async/await` are fantastic for managing dependencies within a function, sometimes, you need to manage concurrent tasks that don't directly depend on each other, or you want to limit the number of concurrent operations to not overwhelm system resources. This is where task queues shine. A task queue is a data structure that holds jobs and executes them in a controlled manner, often using a pool of worker threads. These are especially helpful when you have multiple asynchronous operations that can run in parallel (without dependency), but you need to throttle them for performance or resource considerations.

Here's a very simplified Python example using `asyncio` library, demonstrating the core principle:

```python
import asyncio
import random

async def process_item(item_id):
    delay = random.randint(1, 3)
    print(f"Processing item {item_id}, delay {delay} seconds")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Item {item_id} processed")
    return f"result_{item_id}"

async def main():
    item_ids = range(1, 6)
    tasks = [process_item(item_id) for item_id in item_ids]

    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print("All tasks completed.")
    print(f"Results: {results}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this python example, instead of waiting sequentially, we’re creating a collection of tasks and using `asyncio.gather` to execute them concurrently. `asyncio.gather` awaits all given awaitables, thus ensuring the main() doesn't finish before all the task are done. The tasks themselves are not directly dependent upon each other. If you needed sequential behaviour, you would have to call individual tasks after each other with the `await` keyword like in the javascript examples above.

The critical element here is that `asyncio.gather` manages the concurrent execution of the tasks. While this is a simple illustrative example, real-world task queues would have options to limit the concurrent operations (e.g. max number of active threads), providing fine-grained control over how resources are used.

For deeper insight into these concepts, I'd highly recommend looking into “Concurrency in Go” by Katherine Cox-Buday for a strong understanding of concurrency primitives, even if you're not working with Go. Also, “Effective Java” by Joshua Bloch has solid sections on concurrency, though from a Java perspective, the principles remain universally applicable to asynchronous programming in any language. Further, for a more formal understanding of asynchronous programming concepts, the original papers on futures and promises would be worth reviewing, but those can be a quite a bit more theoretical than what we typically encounter in daily development.

In summary, managing asynchronous task execution order and dependencies boils down to a combination of promise chaining, utilizing `async/await`, and task queues. The specific method you choose depends on the complexity of your requirements, but understanding these techniques is fundamental for building robust and scalable applications, and, trust me on this, you'll be very glad you invested the time to truly learn how to handle async well.
