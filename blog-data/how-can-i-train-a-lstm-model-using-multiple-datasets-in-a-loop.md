 Handling iterative training of an lstm (long short-term memory) model across several datasets is a common scenario, and it requires a bit more than a simple `for` loop, though a loop is definitely involved. Over my years working on time-series predictions and sequential data modeling, I've seen various approaches, and I'll share what I've found to be the most effective and practical. The key is to ensure that each dataset contributes to the learning process without causing catastrophic forgetting or overfitting on any single dataset.

The fundamental challenge is that each dataset likely has its own specific characteristics: different distributions, varying temporal lengths, and unique underlying patterns. If we naively iterate through each dataset sequentially and train the model, the model might primarily adapt to the most recent dataset and lose what it had learned from previous ones – a scenario known as catastrophic forgetting. To combat this, you need a structured approach that considers these potential pitfalls.

First, let’s outline a robust strategy which I’ve found to be successful. It involves these crucial steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Standardization:** Before anything else, each dataset requires thorough preprocessing. This includes handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing features, and potentially segmenting the time series into appropriate sequences for the lstm input. It’s important to treat each dataset individually at this stage to avoid leaking information between them. However, the standardization must be consistently applied if you intend the data from all the datasets to share similar feature spaces.

2. **Initial Training and Warm-up:** It's prudent to start with a dataset that is representative of the overall distribution or a dataset that is considered the ‘primary’ dataset if one exists. Training the model for several epochs on this dataset allows it to learn the initial features and establish a baseline.

3. **Iterative Training with Controlled Learning Rates:** After the initial warm-up, you can iterate through the remaining datasets. However, you shouldn’t simply train for the same number of epochs on each dataset. Instead, reduce the learning rate as the loop progresses or implement a learning rate schedule. This prevents the model from completely shifting its parameters with each new dataset and helps retain knowledge acquired from previous ones. Techniques such as cyclical learning rates or learning rate annealing can be beneficial.

4. **Model Monitoring and Validation:** Monitor the model’s performance on each dataset individually. This means having separate validation sets for each. If you notice the model’s performance dropping on previously seen datasets, it’s a clear indicator that catastrophic forgetting is occurring and you should fine-tune the learning schedule and consider implementing regularization techniques.

5. **Model Saving and Checkpoints:** Save the model periodically during the training process. This is crucial for reproducing your results and allowing you to revert to previously effective models. It's also helpful in case of unexpected training interruptions.

Now, let’s look at this strategy in code. I'll use simplified examples using keras/tensorflow for lstm models. Keep in mind that you might use different libraries depending on your needs.

**Code Example 1: Basic Iterative Training**

This example demonstrates the core idea of looping through datasets with a dynamically adjusted learning rate.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_lstm_model(input_shape, lstm_units, output_units):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.LSTM(lstm_units, input_shape=input_shape, return_sequences=False),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_units)
    ])
    return model

# Assume datasets is a list of tuples: [(X1, y1), (X2, y2), ...]
def train_iteratively(datasets, initial_learning_rate=0.001, epochs_per_dataset=5, decay_rate=0.8):
    input_shape = datasets[0][0].shape[1:] # Infer shape from first dataset
    output_units = datasets[0][1].shape[1]  # Infer output shape from first dataset
    lstm_units = 64 # Define lstm units
    model = create_lstm_model(input_shape, lstm_units, output_units)

    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=initial_learning_rate)
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse') # mse loss as an example

    for dataset_index, (X, y) in enumerate(datasets):
        print(f"Training on dataset {dataset_index+1}")
        model.fit(X, y, epochs=epochs_per_dataset, verbose=1)
        current_lr = tf.keras.backend.get_value(optimizer.learning_rate)
        tf.keras.backend.set_value(optimizer.learning_rate, current_lr * decay_rate)
        print(f"Learning rate adjusted to: {current_lr * decay_rate}")

    return model

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Creating some dummy data
    datasets = []
    for _ in range(3): # 3 datasets
       X = np.random.rand(100, 10, 5) # 100 sequences, 10 time steps, 5 features
       y = np.random.rand(100, 2) # Output two values per time series
       datasets.append((X, y))

    trained_model = train_iteratively(datasets)
```

**Code Example 2: Using Callbacks for Monitoring and Checkpointing**

This example shows the integration of keras callbacks to save the best performing models and to monitor validation loss.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_lstm_model(input_shape, lstm_units, output_units):
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(lstm_units, input_shape=input_shape, return_sequences=False),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_units)
  ])
  return model

def train_iteratively_with_callbacks(datasets, initial_learning_rate=0.001, epochs_per_dataset=5, decay_rate=0.8):
    input_shape = datasets[0][0].shape[1:]
    output_units = datasets[0][1].shape[1]
    lstm_units = 64
    model = create_lstm_model(input_shape, lstm_units, output_units)
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=initial_learning_rate)
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

    for dataset_index, (X_train, y_train) in enumerate(datasets):
      X_val = np.random.rand(30, X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2]) # Validation set is random for demonstration
      y_val = np.random.rand(30, y_train.shape[1])
      print(f"Training on dataset {dataset_index+1}")
      callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath=f'model_dataset_{dataset_index+1}.h5',
        monitor='val_loss',
        save_best_only=True,
        verbose=1
    )
      model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=epochs_per_dataset, validation_data=(X_val,y_val), callbacks=[callback], verbose=1)
      current_lr = tf.keras.backend.get_value(optimizer.learning_rate)
      tf.keras.backend.set_value(optimizer.learning_rate, current_lr * decay_rate)
      print(f"Learning rate adjusted to: {current_lr * decay_rate}")
    return model

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Creating some dummy data
    datasets = []
    for _ in range(3): # 3 datasets
        X = np.random.rand(100, 10, 5) # 100 sequences, 10 time steps, 5 features
        y = np.random.rand(100, 2) # Output two values per time series
        datasets.append((X, y))

    trained_model = train_iteratively_with_callbacks(datasets)
```

**Code Example 3: Handling Different Time Series Lengths**

Here, we pad shorter sequences to the maximum length of the dataset in each loop. This method will work even with unequal time series length in different datasets.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_lstm_model(input_shape, lstm_units, output_units):
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(lstm_units, input_shape=input_shape, return_sequences=False),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_units)
  ])
  return model

def pad_sequences(X):
    max_len = max(seq.shape[0] for seq in X)
    padded_X = np.array([np.pad(seq, ((0,max_len - seq.shape[0]),(0,0)), 'constant') for seq in X])
    return padded_X

def train_iteratively_with_padding(datasets, initial_learning_rate=0.001, epochs_per_dataset=5, decay_rate=0.8):
    input_shape = (None, datasets[0][0][0].shape[1])  # Infer feature size, length is handled with padding
    output_units = datasets[0][1].shape[1]
    lstm_units = 64
    model = create_lstm_model(input_shape, lstm_units, output_units)

    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=initial_learning_rate)
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

    for dataset_index, (X_train_list, y_train) in enumerate(datasets):
      X_train = pad_sequences(X_train_list) # Now all X are with the same length
      X_val_list = [np.random.rand(np.random.randint(5,15), X_train_list[0].shape[1]) for _ in range(30)] # Validation is also padded
      X_val = pad_sequences(X_val_list)
      y_val = np.random.rand(30, y_train.shape[1])
      print(f"Training on dataset {dataset_index+1}")
      callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath=f'model_dataset_{dataset_index+1}.h5',
        monitor='val_loss',
        save_best_only=True,
        verbose=1
    )
      model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=epochs_per_dataset, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), callbacks=[callback], verbose=1)
      current_lr = tf.keras.backend.get_value(optimizer.learning_rate)
      tf.keras.backend.set_value(optimizer.learning_rate, current_lr * decay_rate)
      print(f"Learning rate adjusted to: {current_lr * decay_rate}")

    return model

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Creating some dummy data with different sequence lengths
    datasets = []
    for _ in range(3):  # 3 datasets
        X_list = [np.random.rand(np.random.randint(5,15), 5) for _ in range(100)] # 100 sequences with variable lengths, 5 features
        y = np.random.rand(100, 2)  # Output two values per time series
        datasets.append((X_list, y))

    trained_model = train_iteratively_with_padding(datasets)
```

To go deeper into this, I’d recommend checking out the chapter on recurrent neural networks in *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville (2016), as it provides a rigorous theoretical background. Specifically, look at material regarding learning rate schedules and their effects on gradient descent. Another excellent resource is *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron (2019), which offers a very practical view on implementing deep learning techniques in keras.

In conclusion, training an lstm using multiple datasets in a loop isn't simply about iterating through the datasets. It requires a structured process, considering the inherent differences between the datasets and the potential for catastrophic forgetting. By carefully managing the learning rate, employing validation, and implementing model checkpoints, you can effectively learn from multiple sources and build robust models that generalize well.
