, let’s tackle this. It’s a problem I've seen crop up more often than I’d like, and usually, it boils down to a handful of core issues when you're dealing with mouse-driven graphics. I remember back in the early days, when I was trying to implement a rudimentary CAD program, similar symptoms kept popping up; a blank canvas despite all the intended interactions with the mouse. The initial frustration eventually led to understanding the typical culprits.

Let's examine the scenario of a mouse drawing application that's not showing anything on the canvas. There are several things that can go wrong here, but typically, the problem originates in the interaction between the event handling, the drawing pipeline, and the canvas setup itself. In essence, you have data moving from a mouse event (coordinates, clicks, etc.), that data needs to trigger some change in the display state, and finally the display must be updated. Let’s consider what breaks along that path.

Firstly, event handling: are you even capturing mouse events correctly? If your application isn't listening for mouse events, or the listeners are incorrectly attached, no drawing will ever be initiated. You need to make sure your code is correctly configured to detect things like `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` (or their equivalent in your language/framework). Further, verify that these events are attached to the correct element; if you're capturing mouse events on a `div` that’s *over* your canvas, then you’ll need to ensure the events are captured on the canvas element itself.

Secondly, the drawing context: even if you *are* correctly listening to events, if your drawing context is not initialized, or the settings for drawing are invalid, your strokes won't render. You need access to the drawing API (often through an object from `CanvasRenderingContext2D` in web-based contexts, or equivalent in other libraries or platforms), and you need to ensure you're using that context correctly. Things such as setting colours, line styles and clearing the canvas are all operations that must be handled explicitly.

Thirdly, and possibly most confusing: your application needs to correctly translate the mouse coordinates received from the event handler to coordinates used by the drawing API, and the state must be correctly managed. If, for example, you get mouse coordinates *relative to the window* while your drawing function uses a different coordinate system, then your strokes will likely be drawn ‘off canvas’ and thus appear not to be drawn. Furthermore, if your code simply draws *once* at the initial click, but doesn’t redraw on `mousemove` then there will also be no visible trace of the mouse movement. Proper storage and utilization of the drawing state (e.g. a list of points, or an image buffer representing the current state) are key.

Let's illustrate these points with some code snippets. These are simplified for clarity but they will demonstrate where issues often arise. For simplicity I'll use a browser-based approach for the examples:

**Example 1: Incorrect Event Handling**

This example shows a canvas that *appears* to do nothing:

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<script>
  const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

  function drawPoint(event) {
    ctx.fillRect(event.clientX, event.clientY, 5, 5);
  }

  document.addEventListener('click', drawPoint);
</script>
```

In this case, the event listener is attached to the *document*, rather than the canvas itself. This means the `drawPoint` function is only called if you click anywhere on the *page* not specifically over the canvas. In this case, it *might* draw a small square, but that will most likely occur outside the bounds of the canvas. Correcting this is as simple as changing the event listener:

```javascript
  canvas.addEventListener('click', drawPoint);
```

**Example 2: Incomplete Drawing Pipeline**

This example illustrates the importance of handling multiple events (`mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`) and also the importance of storing drawing state:

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<script>
  const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  let isDrawing = false;
  let lastX = 0;
  let lastY = 0;

  function handleMouseDown(event){
      isDrawing = true;
      lastX = event.offsetX;
      lastY = event.offsetY;
  }

  function handleMouseMove(event){
      if(!isDrawing) return;

      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.moveTo(lastX, lastY);
      ctx.lineTo(event.offsetX, event.offsetY);
      ctx.stroke();
      lastX = event.offsetX;
      lastY = event.offsetY;
  }

  function handleMouseUp(){
      isDrawing = false;
  }


  canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', handleMouseDown);
  canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
  canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', handleMouseUp);
</script>
```

Here, we now correctly handle the three core events. We also maintain state in the variables `isDrawing`, `lastX`, and `lastY` which is essential to achieve continuous lines. Without storing `lastX` and `lastY`, only single points would be drawn at every `mousemove` event; there would be no lines between them. Further note that I am using `event.offsetX` and `event.offsetY`, this provides the mouse coordinates relative to the canvas rather than the page.

**Example 3: Incorrect Coordinate Mapping**

This example focuses on transforming or mapping coordinates. If you're working with a scaling or offset, you have to make sure you account for this in your transformations. Here we will use a simple scaling function:

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<script>
  const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  let isDrawing = false;
  let lastX = 0;
  let lastY = 0;

  function mapCoordinates(x,y){
    // a simple scale function; scaled coordinates are 1/2 of the original.
    return {
        scaledX : x / 2.0,
        scaledY : y / 2.0
    };
  }

  function handleMouseDown(event){
      isDrawing = true;
      const scaled = mapCoordinates(event.offsetX, event.offsetY);
      lastX = scaled.scaledX;
      lastY = scaled.scaledY;
  }

  function handleMouseMove(event){
      if(!isDrawing) return;

      const scaled = mapCoordinates(event.offsetX, event.offsetY);
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.moveTo(lastX, lastY);
      ctx.lineTo(scaled.scaledX, scaled.scaledY);
      ctx.stroke();
      lastX = scaled.scaledX;
      lastY = scaled.scaledY;
  }

  function handleMouseUp(){
      isDrawing = false;
  }


  canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', handleMouseDown);
  canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
  canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', handleMouseUp);
</script>
```

In this case, I’ve introduced a simple scale transformation. If I were to draw in this canvas, the line would appear as if I was drawing on half the area of the canvas, and this is due to the scaling transformation. The `mapCoordinates` function can be arbitrarily complex but the principle remains the same; you need to account for the coordinate spaces your application uses.

Debugging issues like these is often a process of elimination. I typically start with the event listeners (are the events even firing?), then move on to the context (is the drawing code being executed?), and then finally focus on data transformation (are the correct values being passed to the context?).

For deeper learning on graphics programming, I would recommend the book "Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice" by Foley, van Dam, Feiner, and Hughes; it’s a thorough treatment of the underlying concepts. For specifics on canvas APIs, the documentation on the MDN Web Docs for HTML Canvas is an invaluable resource, regardless of the language/framework you’re working with, since the concepts usually translate. Furthermore, for specific algorithms relating to lines, bezier curves, etc. I would also highly recommend "Real-Time Rendering" by Tomas Akenine-Möller, Eric Haines, and Naty Hoffman.

The key takeaways are to meticulously check the flow of data from mouse event to screen update. If a drawing application isn't displaying anything, it's almost always an issue somewhere along that data pipeline. By focusing on event capture, context setup, and coordinate mapping, you can diagnose and solve most of the issues. Remember to debug step by step, and you'll be drawing on the canvas in no time.
