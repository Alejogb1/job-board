,  I've been elbow-deep in object detection pipelines for years, and wrestling with YOLO output formatting is something I've definitely spent some quality time with. The 'output names' you're likely referring to are the layer names that give you the predictions. Understanding them is key, and the 'best models' part is equally crucial, but let’s break it down systematically.

First, let’s address the issue of parsing those output layer names. YOLOv3, as you probably know, employs a multi-scale prediction approach. This leads to a set of output layers, each responsible for detecting objects at a different scale. The names of these layers are usually structured to indicate their specific scale and often include information about the anchor boxes used. A common naming convention often follows something like this: 'yolo_layer_0', 'yolo_layer_1', and 'yolo_layer_2'. Or perhaps you might see something a bit more detailed, like 'conv2d_81/BiasAdd:0', 'conv2d_93/BiasAdd:0', 'conv2d_105/BiasAdd:0'. The specific naming format can vary depending on the framework used to define and train the model (e.g., darknet, tensorflow, pytorch).

In practical terms, you don't usually split these layer names themselves in the same way you would split a string; the information you're interested in is usually contained within the metadata. You need to extract the output tensor from the model associated with these names. The specific method for that depends heavily on the framework you are working with.

Let's illustrate this with some code examples. I'll provide snippets in a framework-agnostic way where possible, but will use examples in TensorFlow and PyTorch as they're commonly used.

**Example 1: TensorFlow (Keras) Model**

Let's say you have a Keras model, loaded like so:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming you've loaded a trained YOLOv3 model and its weights
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path/to/your/yolov3_model.h5')

# To see the output names from this model
for layer in model.layers:
   print(f"Layer name: {layer.name}, Output Shape: {layer.output_shape}")


output_layers = [
    layer.output for layer in model.layers
    if 'yolo' in layer.name.lower() or 'conv2d' in layer.name.lower() and layer.output_shape[1] is not None
    and layer.output_shape[1] > 2
    and 'BiasAdd' in layer.name
    ]


# Now you have the output tensors you need
print(f"Number of YOLO output layers found: {len(output_layers)}")
```

This snippet iterates through the layers and identifies output layers based on keyword inclusion of the type (e.g., 'yolo', 'conv2d' and 'BiasAdd', for instance) and checks if the output shape is applicable. This filtering process is essential to get the correct layers. The actual names are used for identification. The tensors themselves, from the `model.layers` property, provide the output data when you perform an inference. The key thing here is we're identifying output layers, we're not performing string manipulation on layer names.

**Example 2: PyTorch Model**

Here's how to approach the same goal with PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assuming you have your YOLOv3 model loaded
class YOLOv3Model(nn.Module): #replace with your real model definition or model loading logic
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        #Dummy layers
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.yolo_layer_0 = nn.Conv2d(32, 18, kernel_size=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32,64,kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.yolo_layer_1 = nn.Conv2d(64, 18, kernel_size=1)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(64,128, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.yolo_layer_2 = nn.Conv2d(128,18, kernel_size=1)

    def forward(self,x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        yolo0 = self.yolo_layer_0(x)
        x = torch.relu(self.conv2(x))
        yolo1 = self.yolo_layer_1(x)
        x = torch.relu(self.conv3(x))
        yolo2 = self.yolo_layer_2(x)
        return yolo0, yolo1, yolo2

model = YOLOv3Model() #replace this with your loaded model, or your model definition

output_layers = []
for name, module in model.named_modules():
    if 'yolo' in name.lower():
        if isinstance(module, torch.nn.Conv2d):
           output_layers.append(module)

print(f"Number of YOLO output layers found: {len(output_layers)}")
```

In PyTorch, you often iterate through the named modules of your model. The key is to use the `named_modules()` method which allows you to inspect all child modules and get their names. From there, it’s the same logic to check for the 'yolo' keyword, and ensure the module is of the correct type. Again, we’re using the names to locate relevant modules, we are not doing direct string manipulation.

**Example 3: Inference and Output Tensor Usage (TensorFlow)**

This final example shows how you use those identified layers for an actual inference. This code builds upon Example 1.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path/to/your/yolov3_model.h5') # Assumes you have a model

output_layers = [
    layer.output for layer in model.layers
    if 'yolo' in layer.name.lower() or 'conv2d' in layer.name.lower() and layer.output_shape[1] is not None
    and layer.output_shape[1] > 2
    and 'BiasAdd' in layer.name
    ]


# Dummy input for inference
dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 416, 416, 3).astype(np.float32)

# Perform inference
outputs = model(dummy_input)
#outputs will contain all intermediate layer results.
#we'll only grab the specified layers:

yolo_outputs = []
for output in outputs:
    if output in output_layers:
      yolo_outputs.append(output)



print(f"Shape of first output tensor: {yolo_outputs[0].shape}") # This will show you the shape of the first output
print(f"Number of YOLO outputs: {len(yolo_outputs)}")

#yolo_outputs now contain the relevant output tensors. You'll likely need
#to process these further to extract bounding boxes, classes, etc...
```

This snippet takes the identified `output_layers` from the previous TensorFlow example, performs inference on dummy data, and then filters that inference result using the identified layers to create a `yolo_outputs` variable containing just the output tensors relevant to YOLO prediction. This shows how you can work with the actual prediction data.

Now, addressing the second part of your question, “getting the best models”. The "best" model depends highly on the specific task at hand. It is a multi-faceted optimization process, and there are no single perfect parameters or model architectures for every situation. I have found success in the following general practices:

1.  **Pre-trained Weights:** Start with models that are pre-trained on large datasets like COCO or ImageNet. These weights act as a great starting point and drastically reduce the training time required to achieve high accuracy. Frameworks like TensorFlow Hub or PyTorch Hub usually provide these.

2.  **Data Quality and Quantity:** You absolutely need a dataset that is both representative of your target domain and large enough for training. Data augmentation techniques can help but you shouldn't rely on them if you don't have enough data to begin with.

3.  **Model Selection:** YOLOv3 is a great starting point but there are newer versions of YOLO (v4, v5, v7, v8) and other models like EfficientDet, DETR, Faster R-CNN and more. Evaluate the tradeoffs (speed vs accuracy) of each one, depending on your requirements.

4.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Perform a careful hyperparameter search. Parameters like the learning rate, batch size, anchor box sizes, and regularization terms can dramatically impact performance. Techniques such as grid search, random search, or bayesian optimization will greatly aid this process.

5.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluate using appropriate metrics, such as mAP (mean Average Precision) and IoU (Intersection over Union). It is crucial to understand what your evaluation metrics are measuring and if they align with your desired outcome.

6.  **Cross-Validation:** If you are working with limited data, consider employing cross-validation techniques to avoid overfitting. A common practice here is to use a k-fold cross-validation where the dataset is partitioned into k sets to validate that performance across each set.

**Resources:**
For more in-depth understanding of object detection models, I'd recommend reviewing these resources:

*   **"Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet:** This book provides a good introduction to deep learning with a practical focus on Keras and can be beneficial for working with TensorFlow-based models.
*   **"Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications" by Richard Szeliski:** A comprehensive and authoritative text, covering various aspects of computer vision, including object detection techniques.
*   **Research papers:** Search for the original papers of YOLOv3, EfficientDet, and DETR on arXiv for the most up-to-date technical details on model architectures and training procedures. The initial YOLO papers by Joseph Redmon are a great place to start.

By extracting the correct layers from your model and ensuring you follow the outlined best practices, you will be able to use the most effective model for your needs. Let me know if you have other questions.
