Alright, let's unpack this. The perceived slowness of OpenCV when handling deep learning models on video is a recurring issue, and it's rarely a single culprit. Over the years, I’ve encountered this exact problem on several projects, ranging from basic object detection in surveillance footage to more intricate pose estimation for motion analysis. I’ll share some insights based on what I’ve seen, along with some practical solutions.

Fundamentally, the delay often stems from a combination of bottlenecks across multiple layers of the processing pipeline, rather than OpenCV itself being inherently slow. It’s the way we use it – or more precisely, the way we *don't* use it optimally – that frequently leads to performance issues.

First off, let’s address the biggest performance hog: frame-by-frame processing. Most deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (cnns), are computationally intensive. Each frame needs to be preprocessed (resizing, normalization, etc.), fed through the network, and then the output post-processed (drawing bounding boxes, etc.). Doing this serially, frame by frame, using a single CPU thread, is going to drag things to a crawl. I distinctly remember one early project where we were trying to do real-time object detection on 30fps video using just a standard desktop processor – it was abysmal. Frame rates dropped below 10fps, and the system felt unresponsive.

The core of the problem here is not just the raw computation demand; it's the wasted potential of parallelization. Modern CPUs have multiple cores, and GPUs, especially those equipped with cuda or opencl, are explicitly designed for massively parallel computations. Failing to leverage these resources is a significant performance leak.

Let's illustrate this point with a naive implementation using python and OpenCV, one that exemplifies the problem:

```python
import cv2
import time
import numpy as np

# Replace with your actual model and config paths
net = cv2.dnn.readNet('frozen_inference_graph.pb', 'config.pbtxt')

cap = cv2.VideoCapture('video.mp4')

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    start_time = time.time()

    blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 1/255.0, (300, 300), swapRB=True, crop=False)
    net.setInput(blob)
    detections = net.forward()

    # Simplified post-processing (you'd have more logic here)
    for i in range(detections.shape[2]):
        confidence = detections[0, 0, i, 2]
        if confidence > 0.5:
             # Basic drawing of bounding box
             box = detections[0, 0, i, 3:7] * np.array([frame.shape[1], frame.shape[0], frame.shape[1], frame.shape[0]])
             (x1, y1, x2, y2) = box.astype("int")
             cv2.rectangle(frame, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

    end_time = time.time()
    fps = 1 / (end_time - start_time)
    print(f"fps: {fps:.2f}", end='\r')

    cv2.imshow('Frame', frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This snippet reads a video file, processes each frame, and performs a basic object detection. If you were to try this with a pre-trained model, you'd see the frame rate is pretty sluggish. Notice how everything is happening within that single `while` loop, in a completely linear fashion. There's little to no scope for any parallelism at the code level. This is a classic example of serial processing, and it’s precisely what needs to be avoided for efficient video processing.

Another critical factor often overlooked is the target hardware. If you're expecting good performance from a powerful neural network running solely on a low-end integrated gpu, you're likely to be disappointed. This is where things like cuda and opencl really come into play. Leveraging GPU acceleration, where applicable, can provide an order of magnitude improvement over a cpu-only approach. It’s also necessary to consider the model itself. Some models are inherently more computationally demanding, and their suitability for real-time processing will depend heavily on the specific hardware configuration and its inherent capabilities.

Now, let’s illustrate how we can move away from serial processing using `multiprocessing` in Python, a technique that worked wonders in several performance-critical situations for me. Here’s a revised version of the code:

```python
import cv2
import time
import numpy as np
import multiprocessing as mp
import queue

def process_frame(frame_queue, result_queue, model_path, config_path):
  net = cv2.dnn.readNet(model_path, config_path)

  while True:
      frame = frame_queue.get()
      if frame is None:
         break
      
      blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 1/255.0, (300, 300), swapRB=True, crop=False)
      net.setInput(blob)
      detections = net.forward()
      result_queue.put((frame, detections))


if __name__ == '__main__':
  model_path = 'frozen_inference_graph.pb'
  config_path = 'config.pbtxt'
  
  frame_queue = mp.Queue()
  result_queue = mp.Queue()

  cap = cv2.VideoCapture('video.mp4')

  num_processes = mp.cpu_count()  # Adjust based on your hardware
  processes = []
  for _ in range(num_processes):
     p = mp.Process(target=process_frame, args=(frame_queue, result_queue, model_path, config_path))
     processes.append(p)
     p.start()

  start_time = time.time()

  while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
       break
    frame_queue.put(frame)

    try:
      frame, detections = result_queue.get(block=False)
      for i in range(detections.shape[2]):
        confidence = detections[0, 0, i, 2]
        if confidence > 0.5:
          box = detections[0, 0, i, 3:7] * np.array([frame.shape[1], frame.shape[0], frame.shape[1], frame.shape[0]])
          (x1, y1, x2, y2) = box.astype("int")
          cv2.rectangle(frame, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

      end_time = time.time()
      fps = 1 / (end_time - start_time)
      print(f"fps: {fps:.2f}", end='\r')
      cv2.imshow('Frame', frame)
      if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
          break

      start_time = time.time() #reset after display loop
    except queue.Empty:
       pass
  
  for _ in processes:
      frame_queue.put(None)

  for p in processes:
      p.join()
  
  cap.release()
  cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

In this modified version, we've offloaded the actual frame processing to multiple child processes. The main process reads frames and pushes them into a queue. The child processes consume frames from the queue, run the deep learning model, and place results into another queue. The main process then retrieves the results and displays the video. This effectively parallelizes the processing pipeline and will demonstrate a substantial improvement in frame rate. It's not perfect – there’s some overhead involved with context switching and queue operations – but it’s a significant step up from serial processing.

Finally, let's delve briefly into the details of GPU acceleration. OpenCV allows you to target different backends, such as CUDA, or OpenCL. When a GPU is available and properly configured, processing on the gpu can be a major speed up. You can tell opencv to utilize these backends in this way.

```python
import cv2
import time
import numpy as np

# Replace with your actual model and config paths
net = cv2.dnn.readNet('frozen_inference_graph.pb', 'config.pbtxt')
net.setPreferableBackend(cv2.dnn.DNN_BACKEND_CUDA)
net.setPreferableTarget(cv2.dnn.DNN_TARGET_CUDA) # or DNN_TARGET_CUDA_FP16

cap = cv2.VideoCapture('video.mp4')

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    start_time = time.time()

    blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 1/255.0, (300, 300), swapRB=True, crop=False)
    net.setInput(blob)
    detections = net.forward()

    # Simplified post-processing (you'd have more logic here)
    for i in range(detections.shape[2]):
        confidence = detections[0, 0, i, 2]
        if confidence > 0.5:
             # Basic drawing of bounding box
             box = detections[0, 0, i, 3:7] * np.array([frame.shape[1], frame.shape[0], frame.shape[1], frame.shape[0]])
             (x1, y1, x2, y2) = box.astype("int")
             cv2.rectangle(frame, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

    end_time = time.time()
    fps = 1 / (end_time - start_time)
    print(f"fps: {fps:.2f}", end='\r')

    cv2.imshow('Frame', frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Here, we use `net.setPreferableBackend(cv2.dnn.DNN_BACKEND_CUDA)` and `net.setPreferableTarget(cv2.dnn.DNN_TARGET_CUDA)` to instruct opencv to leverage cuda if available. Ensure you have the necessary cuda drivers and opencv version with cuda support compiled in. This will drastically improve inference performance.

To delve deeper into these topics, I’d highly recommend consulting “Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach” by David B. Kirk and Wen-mei W. Hwu for a solid understanding of GPU programming concepts, as well as "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet for practical advice on model optimization. Additionally, for more advanced aspects of multi-processing, reading "Effective Python: 90 Specific Ways to Write Better Python" by Brett Slatkin can be quite insightful.

In summary, the perceived slowness of OpenCV deep learning video processing is rarely due to OpenCV itself but rather poor utilization of available resources and computational bottlenecks in the pipeline. Effective use of parallelization via multiprocessing and leveraging GPU acceleration, along with a judicious approach to model selection, is paramount for achieving good performance.
