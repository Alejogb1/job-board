Alright, let's tackle this one. I've seen this misconception pop up quite a few times, and it usually stems from a misunderstanding of how block creation and propagation are designed in blockchain systems, specifically within the proof-of-work mechanism used by many. It’s a good question because it challenges the intuitive notion that resources, in this case, block space, must be fully utilized before proceeding.

The short answer is that blocks aren't filled to capacity before being mined because the primary purpose isn’t achieving maximum utilization of the limited space in a block. Instead, it's about maintaining a consistent average time between blocks. This time, defined by the blockchain protocol, is crucial for network stability and security. If the focus was on filling blocks completely before mining new ones, the time between blocks would become unpredictable, fluctuating wildly based on transaction volume. Imagine a world where one block takes seconds and the next could take hours, that kind of instability is extremely problematic and is exactly what the design is meant to prevent.

My experience goes back to my early involvement with a now-defunct blockchain project where we actually attempted something similar to what’s being suggested here – dynamically adjusting block creation times based on transaction volume. It was a terrible idea in practice. The inconsistency threw off almost all reliant downstream systems. Timestamps became unreliable; and, worse, we exposed the network to some very interesting and exploitable time-related vulnerabilities. That was a formative experience that made me appreciate the elegance of the fixed-time approach now prevalent in systems like Bitcoin and its many derivatives.

Let's break down the core reasons. The mining process, particularly in proof-of-work systems, involves a computational puzzle. Miners compete to find a hash that satisfies the difficulty target. This difficulty target is dynamically adjusted to ensure the target average block time is maintained. If we waited for blocks to fill up, the mining difficulty would need to be adjusted on a per-block basis, dependent upon the transaction throughput. This adds unnecessary complexity and would not guarantee a regular block creation time. Instead, the difficulty is adjusted periodically based on the *actual* block generation times, a much more stable and reliable approach.

Consider also how transactions are broadcast across the network. They enter a memory pool (mempool), a staging area for unconfirmed transactions. Miners select transactions from this pool to include in a block they're attempting to mine. If we force-filled blocks, we'd create a situation where, during low transaction volume periods, the network would either stall, or we’d have to create a new block despite having a very minimal number of transactions to process, to maintain our time goals. At other times, the network would fall behind due to backlogs as the mempool becomes flooded and would also delay the processing of other transactions. Fixed block intervals ensure that transaction processing is somewhat predictable.

Let’s look at some simplified examples to illustrate how this plays out in a code-level perspective (these are highly simplified, pseudocode examples, of course):

**Example 1: Simplified Block Mining with Target Time**

```python
import time
import hashlib

class Block:
    def __init__(self, prev_hash, transactions, nonce, timestamp):
        self.prev_hash = prev_hash
        self.transactions = transactions
        self.nonce = nonce
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
        data = str(self.prev_hash) + str(self.transactions) + str(self.nonce) + str(self.timestamp)
        return hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()

def mine_block(prev_block, transactions, difficulty):
    nonce = 0
    while True:
        timestamp = time.time()
        block = Block(prev_block.hash, transactions, nonce, timestamp)
        if block.hash.startswith('0' * difficulty):
            return block
        nonce += 1

# Setup parameters (simplified)
genesis_block = Block("0", [], 0, time.time())
difficulty = 2 # Example difficulty, real systems would adjust based on network hash rate
target_block_time = 10 #seconds

while True:
  start_time = time.time()
  transactions = ["transaction1", "transaction2"] #Simplified transaction example
  #Here we see the block being created regardless of full capacity.
  new_block = mine_block(genesis_block, transactions, difficulty)
  end_time = time.time()
  elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
  print(f"Block created in {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")
  #Simplified block creation time verification
  if elapsed_time > (target_block_time * 2) or elapsed_time < (target_block_time * 0.5):
    print("Adjusting Difficulty, this would normally be a more involved system")
    difficulty += 1
  genesis_block = new_block
  time.sleep(target_block_time) #Simulating constant block creation intervals

```
This example shows that even though we add a limited amount of transactions, the primary function is to ensure that the new block will be created roughly every 10 seconds and if that was not the case, the difficulty adjustment function would begin to do its work and change the parameters to ensure the desired block time.

**Example 2: Transaction Pool (Mempool) Handling**

```python
class Transaction:
    def __init__(self, sender, recipient, amount):
        self.sender = sender
        self.recipient = recipient
        self.amount = amount

class Mempool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.transactions = []

    def add_transaction(self, transaction):
        self.transactions.append(transaction)

    def get_transactions_for_block(self, max_block_size):
      selected_transactions = self.transactions[:max_block_size]
      self.transactions = self.transactions[max_block_size:]
      return selected_transactions
#Simplified mempool, no fees or ordering
mempool = Mempool()
mempool.add_transaction(Transaction("Alice", "Bob", 10))
mempool.add_transaction(Transaction("Bob", "Charlie", 5))
mempool.add_transaction(Transaction("Charlie", "Alice", 2))


max_block_size = 2
transactions_to_mine = mempool.get_transactions_for_block(max_block_size)
print(f"Transactions for new block: {transactions_to_mine}") #Prints only the first two transactions, not all available
print(f"Remaining transactions in the mempool: {mempool.transactions}") # Shows that a transaction is in the mempool.
```
Here, the mempool holds a queue of transactions. Even if there are more transactions available, the miner will still take only a limited number of transactions, controlled by `max_block_size`, when forming a new block. The rest remain for later blocks. This is to illustrate that the block is not dependent on filling every available slot.

**Example 3: Difficulty Adjustment (Simplified)**

```python
import time
import hashlib

class Block:
    def __init__(self, prev_hash, transactions, nonce, timestamp):
        self.prev_hash = prev_hash
        self.transactions = transactions
        self.nonce = nonce
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
        data = str(self.prev_hash) + str(self.transactions) + str(self.nonce) + str(self.timestamp)
        return hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()

def mine_block(prev_block, transactions, difficulty):
    nonce = 0
    while True:
        timestamp = time.time()
        block = Block(prev_block.hash, transactions, nonce, timestamp)
        if block.hash.startswith('0' * difficulty):
            return block
        nonce += 1

# Setup parameters (simplified)
genesis_block = Block("0", [], 0, time.time())
difficulty = 2 # Example difficulty, real systems would adjust based on network hash rate
target_block_time = 10 #seconds
block_times = []

for i in range(10):
  start_time = time.time()
  transactions = ["transaction"+ str(i)] #Simplified transaction example
  new_block = mine_block(genesis_block, transactions, difficulty)
  end_time = time.time()
  elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
  block_times.append(elapsed_time)
  print(f"Block {i+1} created in {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")
  genesis_block = new_block
  average_block_time = sum(block_times) / len(block_times)
  if average_block_time > (target_block_time * 1.1):
      difficulty -=1
      print(f"Adjusting Difficulty Down, new difficulty: {difficulty}")
  elif average_block_time < (target_block_time * 0.9):
        difficulty +=1
        print(f"Adjusting Difficulty Up, new difficulty: {difficulty}")

```

This example demonstrates how block creation time will affect difficulty. If block generation is too fast, the algorithm will reduce the difficulty and vice-versa, ensuring that on average the block creation is done within the expected timeframe.

For a deeper understanding, I’d recommend exploring the original Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto. It's fundamental reading and lays out the reasoning behind this design. Also, “Mastering Bitcoin” by Andreas Antonopoulos is a fantastic resource for understanding these mechanisms in greater detail. Furthermore, research papers on distributed consensus algorithms, such as the Paxos and Raft, will provide invaluable insight into the complexities of creating robust and reliable distributed systems.

In summary, the network mines a new block not when the previous one is full, but when the mining process produces a valid block hash, fulfilling the pre-defined network's target time constraint. This approach prioritizes network stability, predictable transaction processing times, and overall security, rather than optimizing for block size alone. It’s a balance that has proven effective for decentralized systems, albeit with design variations between specific implementations.
