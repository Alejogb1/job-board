Alright,  I've seen this problem crop up more times than I can count, and it’s usually a confluence of seemingly minor details. The frustration is real when your meticulously crafted transfer logic fails, particularly when dealing with ownership and balance changes. From experience, it's rarely a single glaring error but rather a series of interconnected assumptions that often lead to unexpected behavior.

The crux of the problem typically boils down to one or more of the following areas: atomic operations, state management, access control, and event handling, each presenting its own specific challenges. I remember once, way back when I was working on a decentralized exchange, we had a similar issue, and it kept manifesting intermittently. It took us nearly a week of dedicated debugging to untangle it, so believe me, I understand the struggle. I'll try to be as comprehensive as possible here and guide you through the usual suspects.

Firstly, and this is crucial, are you ensuring atomic operations when both ownership and balance changes are occurring? In most environments, especially in smart contracts or concurrent systems, changes to state variables need to happen as an indivisible unit. If, for instance, you’re first updating ownership and then, in a separate operation, changing the balance, there’s a window of opportunity where the system could be in an inconsistent state if a different process interacts with it simultaneously. This is not hypothetical; it can and often does happen, leading to loss of funds or unexpected access violations. Let's consider an example using a simple representation:

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

def transfer(from_account, to_account, amount):
    if from_account.balance < amount:
        raise ValueError("Insufficient balance")

    # Non-atomic implementation (prone to race conditions)
    from_account.balance -= amount
    to_account.balance += amount
```

The snippet above, while seemingly correct, is flawed. In a concurrent environment, if two transfers involving `from_account` occur simultaneously, both might pass the balance check and then decrement the balance leading to a value below what is intended. Instead, we need a mechanism that ensures mutual exclusion. A common solution involves locks or transactional mechanisms, which guarantee that only one operation modifies the state at any given time:

```python
import threading

class Account:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance
        self._lock = threading.Lock()

def transfer_atomic(from_account, to_account, amount):
    with from_account._lock: # Acquire lock on from_account
        if from_account.balance < amount:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient balance")
        from_account.balance -= amount
    with to_account._lock: # Acquire lock on to_account
        to_account.balance += amount
```

In this revised version, we have introduced a lock associated with each account. The `transfer_atomic` method first acquires the lock for the account being debited, performs the balance check and update, and releases the lock. Similarly, it acquires lock on the recipient's account and updates the balance. This approach, while more verbose, ensures that updates to the account balances are performed atomically, preventing the kind of race conditions seen earlier.

Now let’s consider a slightly more involved example, particularly when ownership changes are also included. Often these issues arise when you are using an access control system, for instance a smart contract. Let’s imagine a scenario with a `transferWithOwnershipChange` function which includes a change of owner along with a transfer of balance:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ExampleContract {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        balances[msg.sender] = 100; // Initial balance
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
        _;
    }


    function transferWithOwnershipChange(address _newOwner, address _to, uint256 _amount) public onlyOwner {

        require(balances[owner] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Non-atomic implementation (potential for inconsistent state)
        owner = _newOwner;
        balances[owner] = balances[owner] + _amount;
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _amount;

    }

}
```
While the above *appears* to perform the transfer and ownership change, a careful analysis reveals that the `balances` state has been modified after setting new owner. As the `msg.sender` is still the *old* owner in the `transferWithOwnershipChange` method, the balance deduction will be made against the old owner, and the newly minted owner will receive funds incorrectly.

Here’s the corrected method which uses a temporary variable to maintain a consistent update before assigning the new owner:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ExampleContract {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        balances[msg.sender] = 100; // Initial balance
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
        _;
    }


    function transferWithOwnershipChange(address _newOwner, address _to, uint256 _amount) public onlyOwner {

        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        
        // Atomic implementation ( consistent state modification)
        uint256 senderBalance = balances[msg.sender] - _amount;
        uint256 newOwnerBalance = balances[_newOwner] + _amount;
        balances[msg.sender] = senderBalance;
        balances[_newOwner] = newOwnerBalance;
        owner = _newOwner;

    }
}
```

This final approach takes a step towards correctly performing an atomic state update within a smart contract context, ensuring that the balance change is completed using precalculated values before finalizing the owner change.

Additionally, you need to meticulously verify your access control logic. Ensure the `owner` variable is actually being set correctly and that all subsequent operations are referencing the correct `owner`. Missteps here can be deceptively hard to spot, especially if your code involves nested function calls or uses complex inheritance patterns.

Lastly, always, and I mean always, double-check your event emissions. These provide an auditable log of changes that have occurred. If your events don't accurately reflect the changes made to balances or ownership, it's often a clear sign that something is going wrong behind the scenes. This is especially true when debugging complex systems that involve multiple interactions. The events are an often-overlooked debugging mechanism for distributed ledgers, so make sure that the event you are emitting after the transfer and ownership change is a true representation of that operation.

For deeper understanding, I recommend looking into *“Concurrency: State Models & Java Programs”* by Jeff Magee and Jeff Kramer. This book offers a detailed explanation of concurrency concepts and state management, which is invaluable when designing robust systems. In addition, for the smart contract side of things, *“Mastering Ethereum”* by Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood gives a well-rounded understanding of smart contract design patterns and security best practices. Also, consult the official documentation of the specific programming language or platform you are working with, as they usually provide highly detailed explanations.

In summary, debug your code meticulously, checking for atomicity, state update issues, access control flaws, and discrepancies in emitted events. The problem is rarely as simple as a single error, but rather a combination of these factors. Approaching it with a systematic debugging process, rather than just guessing, will save time and frustration in the long run. Good luck.
