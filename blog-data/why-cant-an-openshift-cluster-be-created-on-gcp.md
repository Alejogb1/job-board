Okay, let’s address this. It's less about a fundamental impossibility and more about nuanced compatibility and implementation details. I've encountered this issue several times over the years, mostly when teams try to approach cloud deployments with preconceived notions rather than adapting to the specifics of each platform. The short answer is that directly creating an OpenShift cluster *on* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in the way one might expect—say, with a one-button click—isn't typically supported or straightforward without specific configurations. However, that doesn't mean it can't be done; it just requires a considered, layered approach that's worth exploring in detail.

The core of the issue lies in how OpenShift is fundamentally architected and how it interfaces with the underlying infrastructure. OpenShift, at its base, relies heavily on Kubernetes, but it's more than just vanilla Kubernetes. It adds numerous layers of components on top for management, security, CI/CD pipelines, and user experience. These enhancements often have specific expectations about the underlying compute, network, and storage infrastructure. GCP, while providing robust services, doesn’t always align perfectly with these expectations 'out-of-the-box'.

For instance, OpenShift’s control plane expects specific control over network address allocation, ingress configurations, and storage provisioning—things that GCP does handle but often in a way that requires configuration to align with OpenShift's needs. The common perception is often, “I’ll just deploy OpenShift on some virtual machines,” and while technically that’s feasible, it immediately presents numerous challenges. You then have to handle cluster bootstrapping, node health, networking overlaps, and external traffic routing, all manually. This path adds substantial complexity and overhead.

There are three primary ways to tackle this, all with varying levels of complexity and support. Firstly, you could install OpenShift on bare-metal instances or virtual machines within Google Compute Engine (GCE). I wouldn’t recommend this unless you possess a very clear reason to take on substantial operational overhead. It entails meticulous planning, significant networking configuration, and continuous monitoring. In one previous project, I saw an attempt to do this, and it resulted in countless hours spent troubleshooting networking issues that stemmed from the subtle differences in how GCP handles IP address assignment and how OpenShift expected them to behave. It's certainly possible, but not practical for most scenarios.

Secondly, and this is the path most choose, you can use the installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) method with OpenShift. The IPI approach can technically be configured to target GCP. It’s important to note that this is not the default deployment path when using the standard Red Hat installer. While this method can help orchestrate the process of setting up the cluster, it still necessitates meticulous parameter configuration to ensure it integrates properly with the nuances of the GCP environment. In particular, one needs to customize the `install-config.yaml` file, specifying networking specifics such as subnets, virtual private clouds (VPCs), and firewall rules that align correctly with GCP’s requirements. Let’s demonstrate this with a snippet that provides an example for configuring the platform parameter for GCP:

```yaml
platform:
  gcp:
    projectID: <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID>
    region: <YOUR_GCP_REGION>
    defaultMachinePlatform:
      osDisk:
        diskType: pd-standard
        diskSizeGB: 128
    credentialsSecretRef:
      name: gcp-credentials
```

In this `install-config.yaml` snippet, you configure essential aspects, such as the project id, region, the machine specifications, and, significantly, the credentials. The `gcp-credentials` secret must contain a service account key configured with appropriate privileges for provisioning resources on GCP. Failure to configure it accurately results in failed deployments. You can find further guidance on configuring the `install-config.yaml` specifically for GCP in the Red Hat OpenShift documentation, specifically in the *Installing on Google Cloud Platform* section.

Thirdly, there is Red Hat OpenShift Service on GCP (ROSA), a managed service jointly developed and operated by Red Hat and Google. This provides a more seamless experience by offloading a large portion of the operational burden, including cluster management, updates, and scaling directly to Red Hat and Google. With ROSA, you do not deploy a cluster *on* GCP as such but rather consume it as a managed service that is integrated tightly with GCP. This approach largely abstracts away much of the underlying complexity.

To show this distinction, imagine you were configuring a local client to interact with the ROSA service:

```bash
rosa create cluster --cluster-name my-rosa-cluster \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --compute-nodes 3 \
    --multi-az false \
    --version latest \
    --machine-cidr 10.0.0.0/16
```

This simple command is all that is needed to trigger a ROSA cluster creation. This process leverages the underlying infrastructure, but you do not interact with those specifics. You are, at this point, working at a much higher level of abstraction. In this model, Google and Red Hat collaborate to ensure the seamless interaction between OpenShift and the Google infrastructure. You are responsible for managing the applications, while most of the infrastructure-related management is handled by the service provider. It’s fundamentally a service offering, not a direct on-prem style deployment.

A crucial point here is network considerations. When attempting a manual deployment on GCE, networking often presents the biggest roadblock. OpenShift expects specific IP address ranges, routing configurations, and DNS resolution. If these don’t align perfectly with GCP’s VPCs, subnets, and firewall rules, you'll find yourself facing deployment and operational headaches. In ROSA or with the correctly configured IPI method, a considerable amount of this complexity is either managed or greatly simplified. I can't stress enough the need to thoroughly understand the interplay between GCP networking and the network configuration requirements of the specific OpenShift deployment approach you select. It’s often the most misunderstood aspect of integrating these two technologies. Let's look at a modified version of the prior configuration example to show the networking consideration in the `install-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
platform:
  gcp:
    projectID: <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID>
    region: <YOUR_GCP_REGION>
    defaultMachinePlatform:
      osDisk:
        diskType: pd-standard
        diskSizeGB: 128
    credentialsSecretRef:
      name: gcp-credentials
    network:
      vpc: <YOUR_GCP_VPC_NAME>
      subnets:
       - <YOUR_GCP_SUBNET_NAME>
```

This extended snippet includes fields for explicitly defining the network configuration. The `vpc` field is used to specify the virtual private cloud and the `subnets` array lists the subnets in which to deploy the OpenShift nodes. If you leave these unset, the installer will attempt to create these by default which might lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

In summary, while creating an OpenShift cluster *directly* on GCP in the way you might on, say, bare metal is not a one-step operation, it's absolutely achievable. You just need to be aware of the subtleties in platform interactions. The route you choose (manual, IPI, or ROSA) will depend on your specific requirements, the level of operational burden you’re willing to assume, and whether you prefer a managed service over a self-managed approach. For those wanting a hands-on learning experience, a deep dive into the official Red Hat documentation is indispensable. Specifically, I would recommend the *OpenShift Documentation Center*, which details the various deployment strategies including both on-premises and cloud configurations. Additionally, the book *Kubernetes in Action* by Marko Luksa can provide foundational knowledge about Kubernetes, and thereby OpenShift as well, which is essential to understanding the underlying systems that support cloud deployments. So, it’s not a question of ‘can’t’ but rather one of carefully choosing the correct approach and thoroughly understanding the operational implications.
