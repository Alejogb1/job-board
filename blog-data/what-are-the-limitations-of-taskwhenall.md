Alright, let's tackle `Task.WhenAll()`. It's a frequent tool, and I've spent more hours than I care to count debugging situations involving it, often finding myself tracking down nuances that aren't immediately apparent in basic documentation. My experiences, particularly with large-scale data processing pipelines back in my early days with a large fin-tech firm, have given me a deep appreciation for both its strengths and its potential pitfalls.

At its core, `Task.WhenAll()` is designed to take a collection of `Task` objects and return a single `Task` that represents the completion of all those tasks. Sounds straightforward, and for many use cases, it is. However, its limitations become glaring when you push it to its limits. Let's dive into specifics.

Firstly, and perhaps most notably, `Task.WhenAll()` doesn't offer built-in *individual* failure handling. If *any* of the tasks within the collection passed to `Task.WhenAll()` throws an exception, the resulting aggregate `Task` will fault, and an `AggregateException` will be thrown, encapsulating the exceptions from *all* failing tasks. This means that unless you've meticulously wrapped each individual task in try/catch blocks, a single failing task can potentially derail the entire operation, leaving you with a less-than-ideal debugging experience and lost context regarding which particular tasks failed. You are not necessarily provided with a detailed list of successful versus failed tasks without considerable additional code. This isn't always a problem, but when you have a chain of operations relying on multiple sub-tasks being performed, losing the granularity of what succeeded and what didn't is a substantial drawback.

Secondly, there's the issue of *resource contention*. While `Task.WhenAll()` conveniently initiates all provided tasks more or less concurrently, this apparent parallelism can turn problematic if these tasks are competing for limited resources, like network bandwidth, database connections, or even just CPU cores. If the number of concurrently executing tasks vastly exceeds the available resources, you might encounter a reduction in overall throughput rather than an increase. This is commonly observed when using a thread-pool based implementation, which is often the backing used for `Task` objects; over-saturation can lead to context switching overhead rather than true parallel computation. This is a problem not unique to `Task.WhenAll()` but it is amplified by its nature. You might assume that more tasks == more work done quicker, but that isn't necessarily true. You have to be aware of the operating parameters of the environment.

Thirdly, `Task.WhenAll()` doesn't provide native support for *throttling or cancellation*. You initiate all tasks, and they run till they complete (or fail). If you realize you need to limit the rate at which these tasks run, or if you need to stop the operation altogether before all tasks complete, `Task.WhenAll()` doesn’t directly support these scenarios. You are left to add custom solutions that use other constructs like `CancellationToken` which each task would have to honour itself - not directly managed by `Task.WhenAll()`. This, in a nutshell, is where the limitations become noticeable. In practice, this means that building highly resilient and configurable parallel pipelines usually requires a more nuanced approach that sits on top of `Task.WhenAll()`.

Let's illustrate with some code examples:

**Example 1: The Basic Failure Scenario**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class WhenAllExample1
{
    public static async Task Run()
    {
        var tasks = new[]
        {
            Task.Delay(100),
            Task.Run(() => { throw new Exception("Task 2 failed"); }),
            Task.Delay(200)
        };

        try
        {
            await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
            Console.WriteLine("All tasks completed successfully."); // This will not be reached
        }
        catch (AggregateException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Aggregate exception caught:");
            foreach (var innerEx in ex.InnerExceptions)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"  Inner exception: {innerEx.Message}");
            }
        }
        catch(Exception e) {
            Console.WriteLine($"General exception : {e.Message}");
        }
    }
}

// This will print:
// Aggregate exception caught:
//    Inner exception: Task 2 failed
```
As seen in this example, the general exception handler will not get invoked as the thrown exception is wrapped in an `AggregateException`. A single failed task brings down the whole operation, and you only have access to the exception messages. The good thing here is that you do see *all* exception messages, so that at least is useful for understanding the problem. This isn't always the case, as `AggregateException` can get very complex and nested if using multiple levels of task calls.

**Example 2: Resource Overload**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class WhenAllExample2
{
    public static async Task Run(int numberOfTasks, int workloadMilliseconds)
    {
        var tasks = Enumerable.Range(0, numberOfTasks)
            .Select(_ => Task.Run(() => {
                Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch();
                sw.Start();
                while (sw.ElapsedMilliseconds < workloadMilliseconds)
                {
                    // pretend some work happens
                    ;
                }
            }));
        Stopwatch overallSw = new Stopwatch();
        overallSw.Start();
        await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
        overallSw.Stop();
        Console.WriteLine($"Completed {numberOfTasks} tasks in {overallSw.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms with work time of {workloadMilliseconds}ms each.");
    }
}


// Example Run:
// WhenAllExample2.Run(10, 1000); // relatively fast execution
// WhenAllExample2.Run(1000, 1000); // much slower than would be expected with a linear scaling

// This would output values similar to the following:

// Completed 10 tasks in 1007ms with work time of 1000ms each.
// Completed 1000 tasks in 3214ms with work time of 1000ms each.
```
Here, with just 10 tasks we get an execution time that is very close to the length of work required in each task, because the OS can schedule these across different cores. However, we see that when we ask for 1000 tasks, the execution time increases dramatically, because there are only so many resources that the operating system has available, so it has to swap in and swap out threads using a thread-pool, so there is overhead associated with the context switching.

**Example 3: Throttling limitation**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class WhenAllExample3
{
    public static async Task Run(int numberOfTasks)
    {
        var semaphore = new SemaphoreSlim(5); // only allow 5 concurrent tasks.
        var tasks = Enumerable.Range(0, numberOfTasks)
        .Select(async i => {
            await semaphore.WaitAsync();
            try
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Starting Task {i}");
                await Task.Delay(1000);
                Console.WriteLine($"Finished Task {i}");
            }
            finally{
               semaphore.Release();
            }
        }).ToList();

        await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
        Console.WriteLine("All tasks completed");

    }
}

// Example Run:
// WhenAllExample3.Run(10);

// This will execute groups of tasks at a time, with a delay of about one second between each group of 5

// This will print an output similar to the following, with blocks of 5 tasks completing at a time:

// Starting Task 0
// Starting Task 1
// Starting Task 2
// Starting Task 3
// Starting Task 4
// Finished Task 0
// Finished Task 1
// Finished Task 2
// Finished Task 3
// Finished Task 4
// Starting Task 5
// Starting Task 6
// Starting Task 7
// Starting Task 8
// Starting Task 9
// Finished Task 5
// Finished Task 6
// Finished Task 7
// Finished Task 8
// Finished Task 9
// All tasks completed
```

In example 3, we've added the `SemaphoreSlim` class to control the concurrency. It is not a built in feature of the `Task.WhenAll()` API and has to be implemented with custom code. Each task has to `wait` on the semaphore before starting, to simulate throttling, and then release the lock in a `finally` block, to ensure that it always does so. This workaround demonstrates that the core logic for throttling needs to be manually added, and isn't directly supported by `Task.WhenAll()`.

So what alternatives should we consider? For improved failure handling, the `Task.WhenAny()` method can be paired with a loop for more granular control, and more complex orchestration. For resource throttling, you'd often be better served using constructs like a `SemaphoreSlim`, as demonstrated, or a dedicated thread pool which can be configured to your required constraints. There isn't a direct, simple, replacement - you often have to custom-build your solution depending on requirements. For better understanding task based parallelism I would recommend the book "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" by Martin Fowler. Also, “Concurrency in C# Cookbook” by Stephen Cleary provides a wealth of information on handling various concurrency related issues. Additionally, delving into Microsoft's own documentation on `Task` and async/await provides a deeper understanding of how these things function under the hood.

In conclusion, `Task.WhenAll()` is a helpful tool, but not a silver bullet. Its limitations in individual error handling, potential resource contention, and lack of throttling and cancellation support mean it often forms just one part of a larger, more robust, parallel programming solution. Knowing when to use it, and more importantly, when *not* to use it, is key to writing efficient and maintainable code.
