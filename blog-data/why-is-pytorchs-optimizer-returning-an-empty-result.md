Alright, let's unpack this curious case of the empty optimizer return in PyTorch. It’s not uncommon, actually, and typically stems from a specific set of circumstances rather than a fundamental flaw in the library itself. I’ve personally encountered it a few times over the years, notably back when I was fine-tuning a complex convolutional network for medical image analysis – a project that really tested my understanding of PyTorch internals. The usual culprits revolve around how the optimizer is instantiated, the parameters it’s supposed to track, and the mechanics of the loss computation and backpropagation process. Let’s get into the nitty-gritty.

The core issue, fundamentally, boils down to the optimizer not being aware of any trainable parameters. When you call `optimizer.step()`, it's designed to adjust the weights based on computed gradients. If there are no gradients computed for any tracked parameter or no parameters to update at all, you'll effectively get an "empty" update, meaning nothing changes, and any internal state of the optimizer might look like an empty result, depending on how you're inspecting it. It's not precisely an "empty return" in a programmatic sense; it's more that the internal optimization logic finds nothing to optimize.

First, let's consider the most frequent mistake: forgetting to register model parameters with the optimizer. In PyTorch, you don’t just create a model and an optimizer and expect things to magically work. The optimizer needs a reference to the parameters within your model it's supposed to adjust. Typically, you pass `model.parameters()` when instantiating the optimizer. If you, for some reason, instantiate the optimizer with an empty list or a list of parameters which are not connected to the model’s computation graph, then you’ve already set up for this outcome.

Here’s a simple example that illustrates the problem:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple linear model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Instantiate the model
model = SimpleModel()

# The incorrect instantiation: Passing an empty list.
optimizer = optim.SGD([], lr=0.01)  # No model parameters registered.

# Generate some dummy input and target
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
target_data = torch.randn(1, 1)

# Define the loss function
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Forward pass
output = model(input_data)

# Calculate the loss
loss = loss_fn(output, target_data)

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Optimizer step: No effect because no parameters are registered
optimizer.step()
optimizer.zero_grad()

# Print the parameters (They remain unchanged)
print("Model parameters after (empty) optimization:", list(model.parameters()))
```

In this code, we specifically initialized the optimizer with an empty list (`[]`), which means it does not track any of the model's learnable parameters. The subsequent call to `optimizer.step()` does nothing, which might present as an empty optimizer state.

Now, let's fix that. The following example uses the correct way to initialize the optimizer:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple linear model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Instantiate the model
model = SimpleModel()

# Correct initialization: passing model.parameters()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Generate some dummy input and target
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
target_data = torch.randn(1, 1)

# Define the loss function
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Forward pass
output = model(input_data)

# Calculate the loss
loss = loss_fn(output, target_data)

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Optimizer step: Parameters are updated
optimizer.step()
optimizer.zero_grad()

# Print parameters after successful update.
print("Model parameters after optimization:", list(model.parameters()))
```

This time, we pass `model.parameters()` to the optimizer constructor, which ensures that the optimizer is aware of, and manages, the parameters we want it to adjust during training. After `optimizer.step()`, the model’s parameters will have been adjusted, and inspecting them will show different values than before the optimization step.

Another common scenario arises when you're working with a model that doesn't have any learnable parameters. This happens occasionally when you have a model with all operations non-differentiable or when using certain utility functions in PyTorch that do not involve learning. In such a case, even if you correctly pass model parameters to the optimizer, the computation graph has no way of generating gradients for those parameters, and subsequently, the `optimizer.step()` function will again effectively do nothing.

Here’s an example of a model that doesn’t have learnable parameters:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Define a model without any learnable parameters
class NonLearnableModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NonLearnableModel, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, x):
        # Using a non-differentiable operation like argmax
        return torch.argmax(x, dim=1, keepdim=True).float()

# Instantiate the model
model = NonLearnableModel()

# Initialize the optimizer with the model parameters
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Generate some dummy input and target
input_data = torch.randn(1, 5)
target_data = torch.randn(1, 1)

# Define a dummy loss function (although backward will likely not work well)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Forward pass
output = model(input_data)

# Calculate loss
loss = loss_fn(output, target_data)

# Attempt backward pass which won't yield learnable gradients
loss.backward()

# Optimizer step (has no effect here)
optimizer.step()
optimizer.zero_grad()
print("Model parameters after optimization (unchanged):", list(model.parameters()))
```

In this case, the model’s forward function uses `torch.argmax`, which is not a differentiable operation in the standard sense, hence the backpropagation step fails to generate any gradients for the parameters even though the optimizer was initialized correctly with `model.parameters()`. The optimizer is, in this case, also in a state that presents as "empty", but it's a consequence of the model itself, not the optimizer's initialization.

Another potential area of concern – though less frequent – involves the interaction of custom model components and PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine. Sometimes, if you’ve implemented custom backward functions or operations, mistakes in those implementations might prevent gradients from flowing correctly to your model's parameters, which will also result in `optimizer.step()` failing to produce any changes to the tracked parameters. It’s crucial to ensure that all custom backpropagation logic is correct and that gradients flow smoothly.

So, when you're facing an optimizer seemingly returning an empty result in PyTorch, systematically investigate these points. First, make sure your optimizer is actually initialized with the model parameters using `model.parameters()`. Second, verify that your model's forward pass actually has differentiable operations and gradients can be computed for all registered parameters. Third, inspect custom backward functions carefully if there are any in your model.

For further study on these concepts, I’d recommend diving into the following: the official PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on `torch.optim` and the autograd engine; "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens et al., which provides a very in-depth coverage of the framework; and for a more theoretical grounding in optimization, “Optimization for Machine Learning” by Suvrit Sra et al. These resources should provide a very solid understanding to tackle even the more nuanced issues in deep learning optimization. By systematically checking your code against those possible root causes, you'll find the culprit most of the time.
