Okay, let's tackle this. I remember a project back in my early days, a sprawling enterprise application where we had a common utilities library with, shall we say, varying degrees of cohesion. We needed to extract a specific set of utility classes, neatly packaged, for use in a separate, smaller service. Bundling the whole thing was overkill, and a maintenance headache waiting to happen. It wasn't immediately obvious how best to accomplish this, but through some experimentation, I arrived at several effective methods for creating a jar file containing only a specific package from a multi-package project, which I'll share with you now.

Fundamentally, the challenge lies in directing the jar packaging process to selectively include only the resources you specify. A default jar build, whether managed by maven, gradle, or ant, will typically include all compiled class files found under your project's source directories. Therefore, we need to override this behavior. Here are three ways I’ve successfully done it, using different build tools.

**Method 1: Using Maven with the `maven-assembly-plugin`**

Maven, for those unfamiliar, leans on the concept of a project object model (pom.xml) to define the structure and build process. Here, the `maven-assembly-plugin` is our key tool. This plugin allows us to define a custom assembly configuration, granting very granular control over the jar's contents.

In my experience, this plugin offers the most flexibility for complex inclusion/exclusion scenarios.

Here's a working example within a `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<project>
    <!-- ... other project details ... -->
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
                <configuration>
                    <descriptors>
                        <descriptor>src/assembly/package-assembly.xml</descriptor>
                    </descriptors>
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                  <execution>
                      <id>create-package-jar</id>
                      <phase>package</phase>
                      <goals>
                        <goal>single</goal>
                      </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

The key part here is the `<descriptor>`. It points to an assembly descriptor file. This file (e.g., `src/assembly/package-assembly.xml`) defines what should be included in our jar. Here’s what that descriptor file would look like to include, for example, the `com.example.utilities` package:

```xml
<assembly xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.3 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/assembly-1.1.3.xsd">
  <id>package-jar</id>
  <formats>
    <format>jar</format>
  </formats>
   <includeBaseDirectory>false</includeBaseDirectory>
  <fileSets>
    <fileSet>
      <directory>${project.build.outputDirectory}</directory>
      <outputDirectory>/</outputDirectory>
      <includes>
        <include>com/example/utilities/**</include>
      </includes>
    </fileSet>
  </fileSets>
</assembly>
```

In this descriptor:

*   `id` identifies the assembly.
*   `formats` specifies the desired output format as a jar.
*   `includeBaseDirectory` specifies to not include base directories which is useful for keeping the directory structure clean.
*   `<fileSets>` define the files to include, in this case, all classes residing under the `com/example/utilities` directory within the project's output directory. The `**` signifies any subdirectories beneath.

To trigger this, you would use the command `mvn package assembly:single -Ddescriptor=src/assembly/package-assembly.xml`. This will generate a jar file containing only classes from the `com.example.utilities` package.

**Method 2: Using Gradle's `Jar` task and Include/Exclude patterns**

Gradle, known for its concise syntax and flexible build capabilities, handles this type of task with the `Jar` task. We can customize it to specify inclusion and exclusion patterns. This is often less verbose than maven’s assembly approach.

Here's an example of a `build.gradle` configuration:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
}

jar {
    archiveFileName = 'utilities-package.jar' //Name the generated jar
    from(sourceSets.main.output.classesDirs) {
        include 'com/example/utilities/**'
    }
}
```

Here, we're customizing the built-in `jar` task. We specify a custom jar name with `archiveFileName` and then tell the task to grab the main output classes. Inside the `from` block, we define an `include` pattern. This pattern specifies to only add compiled class files within the `com.example.utilities` package.

Executing `gradle jar` will generate the custom jar.

**Method 3: Leveraging Apache Ant's `<jar>` task and `<fileset>`**

While not as prevalent in new projects, Ant is a venerable build tool, and understanding its approach can be informative. It tackles the problem using its `jar` task in conjunction with `fileset`s.

Here's what a typical Ant `build.xml` would look like:

```xml
<project name="package-jar" default="package">
  <property name="build.dir" value="build"/>
  <property name="src.dir" value="src/main/java" />
   <property name="output.jar.name" value="utilities-package.jar"/>
  
    <path id="classpath">
      <fileset dir="${build.dir}/classes">
         <include name="**/*.class" />
       </fileset>
     </path>

  <target name="compile" >
      <mkdir dir="${build.dir}/classes" />
        <javac srcdir="${src.dir}" destdir="${build.dir}/classes"  classpathref="classpath"/>
    </target>

  <target name="package" depends="compile">
    <jar destfile="${output.jar.name}">
      <fileset dir="${build.dir}/classes">
        <include name="com/example/utilities/**"/>
      </fileset>
    </jar>
  </target>
</project>

```
Here we first define some properties for build directories and name. We compile to the class directory and then build the jar using the `jar` task. The core idea resides in the `<fileset>` element. We instruct it to look inside the compiled classes directory and to only incorporate files matching the  `com/example/utilities/**` pattern.

You would execute this using `ant package`.

**Resource Recommendations**

For those keen on mastering these build tools and their capabilities, here are some resources I found helpful over the years:

*   **"Maven: The Complete Reference" by Tim O'Brien et al.:** This book is a comprehensive guide to all things Maven. It goes into meticulous detail on the plugin architecture, including the `maven-assembly-plugin`, and will significantly enhance your maven knowledge.
*   **The official Gradle documentation:** The Gradle team maintains excellent documentation that’s regularly updated, offering the most current and in-depth guide to its functionality. Pay particular attention to the sections on the `Jar` task and file patterns.
*   **"Java Build Tools in Practice" by Manuel Carrasco:** Although slightly older, this book provides a practical comparison of various build tools, including Maven, Gradle, and Ant, with a focus on real-world applications, which gave me solid foundations back in the day.
*   **"Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch:** While not a direct resource on build tools, this book is crucial for developing maintainable and modular Java applications, the kind of project where extracting packages is often a very pragmatic action.

**Conclusion**

Creating a jar with a specific package isn't particularly complicated once you grasp the underlying principles of each build tool. The key is to instruct the packaging process to selectively include only the desired resources. The three methods above using Maven, Gradle, and Ant provide diverse strategies for achieving that, each with its strengths and applicable use cases. Remember that understanding your project's needs and selecting the tool that best complements those needs will make your life much easier. Always aim for clarity and maintainability; the less "magic" your builds involve, the better. This has served me well over my long career. I hope you find the same success.
