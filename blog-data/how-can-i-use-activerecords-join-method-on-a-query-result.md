Alright, let's tackle this. I remember wrestling with this particular aspect of ActiveRecord a few years back when building a fairly complex reporting system, and it certainly has its nuances. The core issue you’re facing is that `join` in ActiveRecord is typically used at the *query building* stage, not on a result set that's already been fetched. In other words, you can’t directly call `join` on an array of model instances. Instead, you need to rethink your approach to leverage ActiveRecord’s query construction before data retrieval, or potentially employ some alternative strategies if the data is already in memory.

Fundamentally, the `join` method in ActiveRecord is designed to construct more complex SQL queries that retrieve data from multiple related tables in a single database operation. It's a powerful tool for optimizing database interactions because it reduces the number of round trips between your application and the database server. When you use it on a *query* (a relation object), it adds the necessary SQL `JOIN` clauses. When you try to use it on the result of a query (a collection of model instances), it doesn't work, and that’s a common stumbling block.

Let's explore the typical and intended usage first. We’ll consider a scenario with two models: `User` and `Post`, with a standard one-to-many relationship (a user has many posts). The ideal way is to do the join *during the query* to avoid the N+1 query problem:

```ruby
# Example 1: Joining during the initial query
users_with_posts = User.joins(:posts).where(posts: { published: true }).select('users.*, posts.title as post_title').distinct
# This will fetch users and their associated posts in a single, efficient query.
users_with_posts.each do |user|
  puts "User: #{user.name}, Post Title: #{user.post_title}"
end
```

In this first code snippet, the `joins(:posts)` clause instructs ActiveRecord to add a `JOIN` operation to the SQL query that will be sent to the database. We’re also using `.where` to filter posts based on whether they are published and `select` to explicitly pull in only specific fields, which is good practice for optimization. The `distinct` call avoids duplicate user records if one user has multiple published posts. Crucially, the `join` happens *before* the data is retrieved and turned into model instances. This is where ActiveRecord shines - doing the work in the database where performance is typically better than in the application.

Now, let's tackle situations where you *might* feel compelled to join on an already retrieved result. This typically happens when the original query was simpler and you decide later you need joined data. This is where a bit of restructuring of your code is often necessary. If, for some reason, you have an initial result of `User` models and later you need to access posts, we have several options. For a small result set, the simplest might be to eagerly load the association if the initial query was done without it.

```ruby
# Example 2: Eager loading after an initial fetch (if needed)
users = User.where(active: true) # Initial, simpler query
users_with_posts = User.where(id: users.pluck(:id)).includes(:posts)

users_with_posts.each do |user|
  puts "User: #{user.name}"
  user.posts.each {|post| puts "- #{post.title}"}
end

```

Here, in example 2, we first fetched active users. Then, if we find we need posts, we’ve made a second query using `.where` and `.includes`.  The `.includes(:posts)` method doesn’t modify the existing array. Instead it tells ActiveRecord to load the associated posts in a separate query, but it optimizes by only making the number of additional queries necessary instead of N+1 queries. It fetches posts for all specified user ids in one go. This is an important difference from something like `users.each { |user| user.posts }` which would result in a query per user. Again, note that we are not trying to call `join` on the existing `users` array.

There's also the option of building an alternative query if that better suits the requirements. For instance, we could construct a query from scratch based on some criteria if needed, leveraging the proper `joins` from the outset. Consider the case where you fetch a list of user ids, but then decide you need the associated posts based on their status after.

```ruby
# Example 3: Building a new query with joins based on some pre-existing context.
user_ids = [1,2,3] # Hypothetically, a list of user IDs from somewhere.
users_with_specific_posts = User.joins(:posts).where(id: user_ids, posts: {status: 'published'})

users_with_specific_posts.each do |user|
  puts "User: #{user.name}"
  user.posts.each {|post| puts "- #{post.title}"}
end
```

In this third example, we build a new query from scratch using `.joins` and `.where`. We use `user_ids`, which may be a result from a previous step, to filter the users on the `User` table and the `posts` on the joined table. As you can see, this does not modify the original `user_ids` array. It's a new query being built entirely.

What's crucial here is to recognize that trying to `join` after a result has been returned is an anti-pattern in ActiveRecord. It’s generally more efficient and cleaner to build the correct query initially or utilize techniques like `includes` to prevent the N+1 problem. If you find yourself needing to join an already retrieved result set, it usually means you need to either restructure your query to do the joining before the fetch, or use `includes`, `eager_load`, or similar association loading methods. It also often points towards missing indexing on the database.

For a more in-depth understanding of efficient database interactions with ActiveRecord, I would highly recommend reading "Rails 5: ActiveRecord Query Interface" by Ben Scofield. This book has extensive sections on optimizing database queries using techniques like `joins` and eager loading. The official ActiveRecord documentation provided by the Rails project is also invaluable, particularly the sections concerning associations, queries, and eager loading.

In summary, you can’t directly apply `join` to an ActiveRecord result set. Instead, use `joins` as part of the query building process, or use techniques like `.includes` to load associations after fetching initial results. Remember, it’s almost always more efficient to construct the required data in a single database query than to try and piece it together with multiple queries or operations on a fetched array. Good luck!
