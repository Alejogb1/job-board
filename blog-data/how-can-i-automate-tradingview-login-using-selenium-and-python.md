Okay, let's tackle this. I've certainly been down that road before; back in my quant trading days, automating access to platforms like TradingView was crucial for data acquisition and strategy backtesting. The challenge with automating TradingView login via Selenium and Python isn't particularly complex, but there are a few nuances that can trip up the unwary. The core problem lies in carefully identifying the correct html elements and handling potential dynamic changes in the website's structure.

At its heart, the process involves these steps: first, you'll need to initialize your selenium webdriver, usually a Chrome or Firefox instance, set up your implicit or explicit waits, then locate the input fields for username/email and password. After that, you'll need to send the necessary keys to fill them, click the login button, and ensure the site redirects you to the desired logged-in state. This seems straightforward enough, but reality often introduces hurdles. Let’s dive into what can go awry and how to solve them, then follow up with code examples that showcase these steps.

The initial hurdle is element identification. TradingView, like many modern websites, uses dynamic class names. This means class names used for their input fields or buttons might change periodically, breaking your carefully crafted selenium selectors. Therefore, relying solely on class names isn't very robust. The better option is to use other selectors such as `id` attributes or `xpath` expressions. I lean towards `xpath` due to its flexibility, but always try `id` first when available as it is generally faster and more reliable. Another important issue to remember is the existence of captchas, and sometimes a secondary security check via email or sms. While we can deal with captchas using specific solver apis, or sometimes even train our own OCR if required, this falls outside the scope of the basic automation and I'll assume that in your specific case those won't be an obstacle.

Next, implicit or explicit waits are paramount. You cannot assume the page elements will load instantaneously. Selenium needs a mechanism to wait until elements are present and interactive before attempting to interact with them. Implicit waits apply a wait timeout globally for all find element operations, while explicit waits target specific elements and use condition checks (such as `presence_of_element_located` or `element_to_be_clickable`). I prefer the second, explicit waits, because they are more predictable and less prone to timeout issues.

Let's solidify this with some code examples. This first example is a foundational implementation showing a general idea:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ec
from selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException

def tradingview_login(username, password):
    driver = webdriver.Chrome() # Or any webdriver of your choice
    driver.get("https://www.tradingview.com/accounts/signin/")

    try:
        # Explicit waits for element presence and clickability
        username_field = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            ec.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'username'))
        )
        password_field = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            ec.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'password'))
        )
        login_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            ec.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, '//button[@type="submit"]'))
        )

        username_field.send_keys(username)
        password_field.send_keys(password)
        login_button.click()
        
        # Wait for redirection and check if login was successful
        WebDriverWait(driver, 15).until(
          ec.url_contains('chart') # or another expected url after successful login
        )
        print("Successfully logged in to TradingView")
        return driver

    except TimeoutException:
        print("Timeout occurred while logging in.")
        driver.quit()
        return None

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        driver.quit()
        return None


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # replace with actual credentials
    driver = tradingview_login("your_username_or_email", "your_password")

    if driver:
      # your post-login code goes here
      driver.quit()
```

In the example above, I've used explicit waits and `xpath` and `id` locators. Note how I handle timeout exceptions; this is crucial for robust automation. You may need to adjust the element locators based on what TradingView currently has as its structure. Also, the redirection check (using `ec.url_contains`) after login is key to confirm the login was actually successful before performing other operations.

Now, let's consider a slightly more sophisticated approach. Sometimes, TradingView can detect automated browser instances. To avoid this, we could make the browser instance appear more human-like by using browser extensions or setting specific browser options. While this isn't a guarantee that it will not be detected, it’s an extra layer. Below is an example that sets up chrome options to potentially circumvent that detection.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ec
from selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

def tradingview_login_advanced(username, password):
    chrome_options = Options()
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-extensions")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-infobars")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-popup-blocking")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-notifications")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-gpu")

    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
    driver.get("https://www.tradingview.com/accounts/signin/")

    try:
        username_field = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            ec.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'username'))
        )
        password_field = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            ec.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'password'))
        )
        login_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            ec.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, '//button[@type="submit"]'))
        )
        
        username_field.send_keys(username)
        password_field.send_keys(password)
        login_button.click()
       
        WebDriverWait(driver, 15).until(
            ec.url_contains('chart') # or another expected url after successful login
        )
        print("Successfully logged in to TradingView with advanced options")
        return driver

    except TimeoutException:
        print("Timeout occurred while logging in (advanced).")
        driver.quit()
        return None

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        driver.quit()
        return None


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # replace with actual credentials
    driver = tradingview_login_advanced("your_username_or_email", "your_password")

    if driver:
      # your post-login code goes here
      driver.quit()
```

Finally, a third example illustrating how to handle different login methods (like using Google):

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ec
from selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

def tradingview_login_google(username, password):
  
    chrome_options = Options()
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-extensions")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-infobars")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-popup-blocking")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-notifications")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-gpu")
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options = chrome_options)

    driver.get("https://www.tradingview.com/accounts/signin/")

    try:
        google_login_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            ec.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, '//button[contains(., "Google")]'))
        )
        google_login_button.click()

        # Switch to the Google Login Window (assuming it is a new tab/window)
        WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ec.number_of_windows_to_be(2))
        
        main_window = driver.current_window_handle
        for window_handle in driver.window_handles:
            if window_handle != main_window:
              driver.switch_to.window(window_handle)
              break
            
        google_username_field = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            ec.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'identifierId'))
        )
        google_username_field.send_keys(username)
        
        google_next_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            ec.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, '//span[text()="Next"]'))
        )
        google_next_button.click()

        google_password_field = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            ec.presence_of_element_located((By.NAME, 'Passwd'))
        )

        google_password_field.send_keys(password)
        
        google_signin_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            ec.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, '//span[text()="Next"]'))
        )
        google_signin_button.click()

        # Switch back to the original TradingView tab after google login
        driver.switch_to.window(main_window)

        WebDriverWait(driver, 15).until(
          ec.url_contains('chart') # or another expected url after successful login
        )

        print("Successfully logged in to TradingView using Google")
        return driver


    except TimeoutException:
       print("Timeout occurred while logging in using Google.")
       driver.quit()
       return None

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        driver.quit()
        return None

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # replace with actual credentials
    driver = tradingview_login_google("your_google_email", "your_google_password")

    if driver:
      # your post-login code goes here
      driver.quit()
```

For further learning I highly recommend "Selenium WebDriver: Practical Guide for Test Automation" by David Burns for an in-depth understanding of selenium, and “Python Crash Course” by Eric Matthes, as a good reference for Python basics if needed. The official selenium documentation, of course, is also invaluable. The "fluent Python" book by Luciano Ramalho is a must read for anyone serious about improving their Python programming. Finally, a general resource on website scraping and web architecture such as “Web Scraping with Python” by Richard Lawson is always useful.

In conclusion, automating TradingView login with Selenium and Python involves handling element identification carefully, incorporating robust waits, and being prepared for website updates and potential anti-automation measures. The provided code snippets should serve as a solid starting point. Remember to adjust the selectors and potentially add measures to handle potential website specific problems. Good luck!
