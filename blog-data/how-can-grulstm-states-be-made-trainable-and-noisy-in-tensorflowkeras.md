Okay, let’s tackle this. I've definitely spent my fair share of time tweaking recurrent networks, and the nuances of making GRU/LSTM states trainable and noisy are something I’ve grappled with directly in several projects – particularly when dealing with time-series data that was... shall we say, less than perfectly clean.

The core challenge here stems from the inherent nature of GRU and LSTM units. Their internal states, often called hidden states or cell states, act as a form of memory, capturing information across sequences. By default, in Keras and TensorFlow, these states are typically initialized to zero and are not explicitly treated as trainable parameters. They are updated during backpropagation, but their initial values and ongoing variations are implicitly determined by the recurrent operations, not by direct learning. When we say we want to make them "trainable," we mean we want to introduce parameters that the optimizer can directly adjust. Similarly, "noisy" states imply we want to inject some randomness or disturbance into the state evolution. Let's unpack this with practical examples.

Making GRU/LSTM *initial* states trainable involves introducing a dedicated variable representing the initial state, which gets updated during training. This can be particularly useful when the initial condition of your sequence plays a significant role, or when you want the model to explicitly learn a better starting point instead of blindly starting at zero.

Here’s a snippet using TensorFlow and Keras demonstrating trainable initial states:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def build_trainable_initial_lstm(units, seq_length, input_dim):
    initial_state_h = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((1, units)), trainable=True, name="initial_state_h")
    initial_state_c = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((1, units)), trainable=True, name="initial_state_c")

    input_layer = layers.Input(shape=(seq_length, input_dim))
    lstm_layer = layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
    outputs, final_h, final_c = lstm_layer(input_layer, initial_state=[initial_state_h, initial_state_c])

    model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=outputs)
    return model, initial_state_h, initial_state_c

# Example usage
units = 64
seq_length = 20
input_dim = 10

model, initial_h, initial_c = build_trainable_initial_lstm(units, seq_length, input_dim)

# Compile and train as usual
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

@tf.function
def train_step(inputs, targets):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(targets, predictions)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables + [initial_h, initial_c])
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables + [initial_h, initial_c]))
  return loss

# Create some dummy data for training
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, seq_length, input_dim))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, seq_length, units))

for epoch in range(5):
    for i in range(100):
        loss = train_step(x_train[i:i+1], y_train[i:i+1])
        print(f"epoch: {epoch} -- loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

In this snippet, we explicitly declare `initial_state_h` and `initial_state_c` as `tf.Variable` instances, setting `trainable=True`. Crucially, when calling the `LSTM` layer, we pass these variables as the `initial_state` argument. Note that we need to explicitly include these state variables in the gradient calculation during our training loop. This makes these variables part of the optimization process and allows the model to learn useful initial state values specific to the problem.

Now, regarding noisy states, we can introduce noise in various ways. One technique is to add Gaussian noise to the hidden state at each time step. This helps regularize the network and can improve generalization, similar to dropout, but more explicitly targeting the temporal dynamics. It can also help prevent the network from settling into trivial solutions or becoming over-reliant on specific state patterns.

Here’s how you could introduce Gaussian noise into the hidden state within a custom layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class NoisyLSTMCell(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, noise_stddev=0.1, **kwargs):
        super(NoisyLSTMCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.noise_stddev = noise_stddev
        self.lstm_cell = layers.LSTMCell(self.units)

    def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
        h_tm1, c_tm1 = states
        output, (h_t, c_t) = self.lstm_cell(inputs, states)

        if training:
          noise = tf.random.normal(tf.shape(h_t), stddev=self.noise_stddev)
          h_t = h_t + noise
        return output, (h_t, c_t)

    def get_initial_state(self, inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=None):
        return self.lstm_cell.get_initial_state(inputs=inputs, batch_size=batch_size, dtype=dtype)

def build_noisy_lstm(units, seq_length, input_dim, noise_stddev):

    input_layer = layers.Input(shape=(seq_length, input_dim))
    lstm_layer = layers.RNN(NoisyLSTMCell(units, noise_stddev=noise_stddev), return_sequences=True)
    outputs = lstm_layer(input_layer)

    model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=outputs)
    return model

#Example usage

units = 64
seq_length = 20
input_dim = 10
noise_stddev=0.1
model_noisy = build_noisy_lstm(units, seq_length, input_dim, noise_stddev)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()


@tf.function
def train_step_noisy(inputs, targets):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model_noisy(inputs, training=True)
    loss = loss_fn(targets, predictions)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model_noisy.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model_noisy.trainable_variables))
  return loss

# Create some dummy data for training
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, seq_length, input_dim))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, seq_length, units))

for epoch in range(5):
  for i in range(100):
        loss = train_step_noisy(x_train[i:i+1], y_train[i:i+1])
        print(f"epoch: {epoch} -- loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

Here, we wrap the standard `LSTMCell` within a custom `NoisyLSTMCell`. Inside the `call` method, if `training=True`, we inject Gaussian noise sampled from a distribution with a specified standard deviation (`noise_stddev`) to the hidden state before passing it to the next time step. This noise is applied only during training, not during inference, and the scale of that noise is controlled.

Lastly, it's worth noting another method to inject trainable noise, which is to incorporate a learnable noise parameter directly into the state update equations. It gets complex fast to implement correctly. Let me show you the most accessible and general form: creating a layer that outputs a trainable additive noise at each time step which will get added to the output of the lstm/gru.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class TrainableNoiseLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(TrainableNoiseLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.noise_weights = None

    def build(self, input_shape):
      self.noise_weights = self.add_weight(shape=input_shape[-2:], initializer="random_normal", trainable=True)
      super(TrainableNoiseLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        noise = tf.math.multiply(self.noise_weights, tf.random.normal(tf.shape(inputs)))
        return inputs + noise


def build_lstm_with_trainable_noise(units, seq_length, input_dim):
    input_layer = layers.Input(shape=(seq_length, input_dim))
    lstm_layer = layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=True)
    lstm_output = lstm_layer(input_layer)
    noise_layer = TrainableNoiseLayer(units)
    outputs = noise_layer(lstm_output)
    model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=outputs)
    return model

# Example usage
units = 64
seq_length = 20
input_dim = 10

model_trainable_noise = build_lstm_with_trainable_noise(units, seq_length, input_dim)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

@tf.function
def train_step_trainable_noise(inputs, targets):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model_trainable_noise(inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(targets, predictions)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model_trainable_noise.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model_trainable_noise.trainable_variables))
  return loss

# Create some dummy data for training
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, seq_length, input_dim))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, seq_length, units))

for epoch in range(5):
    for i in range(100):
        loss = train_step_trainable_noise(x_train[i:i+1], y_train[i:i+1])
        print(f"epoch: {epoch} -- loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

In this example, we create a `TrainableNoiseLayer`, with its own trainable parameters, `noise_weights`. This layer applies the noise directly to the output of the LSTM, which means that instead of applying the noise internally, in each state, we control it outside. This approach can be more useful in scenarios where you want to fine-tune how much and where noise is applied.

For further in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms of LSTMs and GRUs, and for more sophisticated techniques, I recommend looking at the seminal works by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber on LSTMs, and Cho et al. on GRUs. Additionally, the "Deep Learning" book by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville provides an excellent theoretical foundation for neural networks in general. You can also find a lot of details by exploring the TensorFlow official documentation related to Keras RNN layers and custom layers. These resources can offer you a more comprehensive grasp of these concepts.

These approaches, while seemingly subtle, can have a considerable impact on the performance and robustness of your recurrent models. Each technique offers a different type of control over the state evolution, allowing you to tailor the behavior of your recurrent layers more precisely. Experimentation remains critical, as the optimal approach depends heavily on the specific characteristics of your data and the task you’re solving.
