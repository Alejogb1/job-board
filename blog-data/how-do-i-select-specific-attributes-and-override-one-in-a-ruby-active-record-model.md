Let's approach this not from the usual "how-to," but from a perspective forged through a few scars earned in the trenches. I've seen this issue trip up countless developers, myself included, when initially grappling with the nuances of Active Record. You want to both select specific attributes *and* override one? There are a few ways to accomplish this, and each has its place, depending on the context. It's rarely a one-size-fits-all solution.

The core challenge here boils down to manipulating the data returned by Active Record queries before they reach the application layer. We can’t directly modify the database results using ActiveRecord mechanisms (that's what migrations and schema definitions are for). Instead, we influence *how* the records are populated from the database into Ruby objects. We're not changing the source data, just how we *view* it in our application's memory space.

The most common – and often sufficient – way to accomplish this is through `select` and `map`. Using `select`, we restrict the columns pulled from the database, and `map` allows us to alter the attributes after retrieval. Here's a basic example that highlights this approach:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Assuming the user table has columns: id, first_name, last_name, email, and a derived attribute `full_name` we wish to customize
end

# example 1: selecting specific attributes and overriding derived `full_name` on the fly
users_data = User.select(:id, :first_name, :last_name, :email).map do |user|
  user.instance_eval do
    def full_name
      "#{first_name.upcase} #{last_name.upcase}"
    end
    self
  end
end

users_data.each { |user| puts "#{user.id}: #{user.full_name} - #{user.email}" }
```
In this snippet, we use `User.select(:id, :first_name, :last_name, :email)` to specify only the needed columns from the users table. Then, we iterate through each retrieved record with the `.map` method. Within the `map`, we use `instance_eval` to dynamically define a new `full_name` method on each user object. This newly defined method overrides any existing `full_name` method the `User` class might have, providing the modified representation of the user. Note that if `full_name` already exists in the `User` model, you would overwrite it specifically for this collection of objects, which is localized to this operation.

It's important to understand that this method does not modify the underlying database or the original `User` model. This change happens solely within the `users_data` array we've created. This is a powerful and safe way to handle custom attribute representation for specific queries.

The `instance_eval` here is a tool I've used quite frequently when I need to inject behavior into existing objects on a per-instance basis. It's not something I use liberally throughout codebases, preferring to define methods explicitly, but it shines when dealing with dynamic attribute modifications like this. However, be cautious, overusing `instance_eval` can lead to harder-to-debug code.

Now, you might encounter situations where you don’t want to rely on `instance_eval` or `map`, or you're dealing with a more complex logic. Imagine you're developing a financial application where a user's balance needs to be presented differently in certain contexts – perhaps with a currency symbol, or a different number of decimal places based on the context, or maybe you need to present a calculation based on other attributes that you don't want to include in the selection statement for performance reasons. Here, you might consider a view model pattern or decorator approach, creating a dedicated class specifically responsible for this presentation logic. Here’s how it could play out:

```ruby
# example 2: using a decorator pattern

class UserDecorator
  attr_reader :user

  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def formatted_balance
    "$%.2f" % (user.balance || 0) # assume user has a balance attribute
  end

  def display_name
     "#{user.first_name} #{user.last_name} - #{user.email}"
  end

  # other decorated properties/methods
end


users = User.select(:id, :first_name, :last_name, :email, :balance)
decorated_users = users.map { |user| UserDecorator.new(user) }

decorated_users.each { |decorated_user| puts "#{decorated_user.display_name} : #{decorated_user.formatted_balance}" }
```

Here, `UserDecorator` takes a `User` object as an argument and provides modified methods like `formatted_balance` and `display_name`. This allows us to keep concerns separated. The decorator is responsible for the presentation layer, whereas the `User` model remains concerned solely with database persistence and data representation as dictated by its schema. This is a more robust solution for more complex transformations. It offers enhanced testability and maintainability. The code becomes more organized, and it's easier to understand where the transformation logic resides, especially when things get more complex.

In some very specific cases where the desired override might depend on some external factor at runtime, you might consider using a method in your model that takes an argument indicating the desired transformation. Let’s illustrate that:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
   # assuming the user table has columns: id, first_name, last_name, email and some status column
  def display_name(format = :full)
     case format
     when :full
        "#{first_name} #{last_name} - #{email}"
     when :abbreviated
        "#{first_name.first}. #{last_name.first}."
     when :admin
        "#{first_name} #{last_name} (ADMIN)"
     else
        "Default: #{first_name} #{last_name}."
     end
   end
end

# example 3: Dynamic override within the User model based on runtime arguments
  user = User.select(:id, :first_name, :last_name, :email).first

  puts user.display_name # default full format
  puts user.display_name(:abbreviated) # abbreviated format
  puts user.display_name(:admin) # admin formatted, assuming some logic defines whether user is admin
  puts user.display_name(:unknown) # fallback to default.
```

This example adds flexibility, where `display_name` can be customized during method invocation. This method allows you to perform conditional overrides of data directly inside of your model, albeit at the cost of adding responsibilities to it. As with all choices, consider the trade-offs: Is it more convenient to apply logic at the model level, or is it more beneficial to keep your models more streamlined?

For further exploration and a more in-depth understanding of these patterns, I strongly recommend "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" by Martin Fowler for its comprehensive overview of patterns like decorators and how they apply in real-world situations. Also, "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler is invaluable for understanding how to improve code organization and structure, which is important to decide when it's appropriate to use the various solutions we have reviewed. Finally, "Effective Ruby: 48 Specific Ways to Write Better Ruby" by Peter J. Jones provides insights into writing cleaner and more efficient Ruby code, which will enhance your ability to utilize Ruby's features effectively for solving this kind of challenge. These books are timeless, and while technology moves fast, the foundational concepts described within are critical for building solid, maintainable, and effective software. Remember, the choice isn't about finding the single "best" way, but the *most appropriate* way for your context.
