Okay, let’s unpack this. Having dealt with data persistence for a while, I’ve encountered the need to store blobs as files more times than I can comfortably count. The straightforward answer is yes, it's entirely feasible, and quite common. But the 'how' involves several considerations around efficiency, access patterns, and system constraints. Let's explore that in a bit more detail.

Fundamentally, a blob, or binary large object, is just a sequence of bytes. When we think about files on a file system, they're also sequences of bytes – typically associated with metadata such as a filename, size, and access permissions. The magic, if you can call it that, lies in how we translate the abstract idea of a blob into a concrete file on disk. It's not some arcane process, though. It’s rather a matter of mapping the blob’s byte sequence directly to a file's contents.

One of the earliest implementations I recall was handling medical imaging files within a proprietary system. These images, often stored as DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) blobs, needed a filesystem representation for easier accessibility by other software tools. The process involved reading the DICOM blob from the database, setting up a unique filename, and then simply writing the bytes to disk, creating a corresponding file.

The key considerations here revolve around file naming conventions, storage location, and error handling. For file naming, it’s important to generate something unique and potentially descriptive. A timestamp coupled with a hash of the blob's content often works well, ensuring each file is uniquely named. The storage location depends on the application's requirements, and error handling – dealing with disk space issues or write permissions – is crucial for robustness.

Let's consider a practical example. We can use python for this illustration, given its ease of handling byte streams. Here's a snippet showing a basic blob-to-file operation:

```python
import os
import hashlib
import datetime

def store_blob_as_file(blob_data, storage_directory):
    """Stores a blob of data as a file.

    Args:
        blob_data (bytes): The blob data.
        storage_directory (str): The directory where the file will be stored.

    Returns:
        str: The full path to the created file or None if an error occurs.
    """
    if not os.path.exists(storage_directory):
        os.makedirs(storage_directory)

    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().isoformat().replace(":", "_").replace(".", "_")
    hash_value = hashlib.sha256(blob_data).hexdigest()
    filename = f"{timestamp}_{hash_value}.dat"
    filepath = os.path.join(storage_directory, filename)

    try:
        with open(filepath, "wb") as f:
            f.write(blob_data)
        return filepath
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error storing blob: {e}")
        return None


# Example usage:
blob_content = b"This is some sample blob content."
file_location = store_blob_as_file(blob_content, "blob_storage")

if file_location:
    print(f"Blob stored as file: {file_location}")

```

This snippet shows how to generate a unique filename, create a storage directory if it doesn't exist, and write the blob content to a file. It also includes a rudimentary form of error handling. Note the usage of the `wb` mode for opening the file in binary writing mode.

Another critical aspect we should consider is the case where the blob is not immediately available in memory. This situation is common when dealing with large files or streamed data. In those cases, we can use techniques involving buffered writes to avoid memory exhaustion. Instead of reading the entire blob into memory, we process it in chunks. Here's a simplified example that demonstrates this:

```python
import os

def store_large_blob_as_file(blob_generator, storage_directory, filename):
    """Stores a large blob (generator) as a file using chunking.

    Args:
        blob_generator (iterator): An iterator/generator yielding chunks of byte data.
        storage_directory (str): The directory to store the file.
        filename (str): The filename for the stored blob.

    Returns:
        str: The path of the stored file or None on error.
    """
    if not os.path.exists(storage_directory):
        os.makedirs(storage_directory)

    filepath = os.path.join(storage_directory, filename)
    try:
      with open(filepath, "wb") as file:
        for chunk in blob_generator:
            file.write(chunk)
      return filepath
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error storing large blob: {e}")
        return None

def create_blob_generator():
  #Simulate a large blob (can be a file reader or network stream)
    for i in range(10):
        yield f"Chunk {i} of data\n".encode('utf-8')


# Example usage:
large_blob_gen = create_blob_generator()
stored_location = store_large_blob_as_file(large_blob_gen, "large_blob_storage", "large_blob.txt")

if stored_location:
    print(f"Large blob stored at: {stored_location}")
```

Here, the `blob_generator` simulates a data source that produces chunks of data. The `store_large_blob_as_file` function iterates through these chunks and writes them to the file, thus avoiding the need to load the entire blob into memory. This is essential when dealing with exceptionally large data.

Furthermore, we must also consider file systems implications. Certain file systems might not be well suited for storing a very large number of small files, because that can affect inode usage and directory listing performance. If the application needs to store millions of blobs, using more structured storage methods, such as object storage or a database with blob capabilities might be better alternatives.

Finally, let’s look at an example showing how to read back the file. Once stored, accessing the file contents should be simple. The principle is just to open the file in binary read mode (`rb`) and read the contents into a blob variable. Here’s a straightforward illustration:

```python
import os

def retrieve_blob_from_file(filepath):
    """Retrieves a blob from a file.

    Args:
      filepath (str): Path to the file.
    Returns:
        bytes: The blob data from the file, or None if an error occurs.
    """
    try:
      if not os.path.exists(filepath):
          return None

      with open(filepath, "rb") as f:
          blob_data = f.read()
      return blob_data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving blob: {e}")
        return None


# Example usage (using the location from first example):
if file_location:
    retrieved_blob = retrieve_blob_from_file(file_location)
    if retrieved_blob:
        print(f"Retrieved blob: {retrieved_blob.decode('utf-8')}")

```

This final snippet shows the opposite side of the coin: it demonstrates reading the contents of the file back into memory as a byte sequence.

For further reading and a deeper understanding of file system interaction and storage methods, I'd suggest exploring the "Operating System Concepts" book by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne, for in-depth information on file management. For a broader perspective on data storage, "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann provides a comprehensive view of databases, blob storage solutions, and different storage trade-offs. Also, the research literature on file system performance and scalability, usually available through ACM or IEEE digital libraries, could be helpful in understanding the nuances of storage.

In short, storing blobs as files is a practical solution for many applications. However, careful consideration of file naming, storage organization, performance implications, and appropriate handling for large data sets is critical to ensure robustness and efficiency. It's often a matter of choosing the correct level of abstraction for the problem at hand.
