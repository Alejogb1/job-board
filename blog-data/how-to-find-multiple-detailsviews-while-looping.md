Alright, let's talk about iterating through a collection and dealing with multiple `DetailsView` controls within each item. I've bumped into this thorny issue more than a few times over the years, particularly when dealing with dynamically generated web forms or complex data displays. It's deceptively simple at first glance, but the devil, as always, is in the details – pun intended, I suppose.

The core challenge revolves around the fact that you're typically not just looking for *a* `DetailsView`, you're trying to locate *specific instances* of these controls within a larger, perhaps nested, structure, while simultaneously looping through something that contains them. Without careful handling, you might end up targeting the wrong control or encountering null references, and frustration is the only thing that'll iterate reliably.

The usual culprit is wanting to update values inside these dynamically generated `DetailsViews` based on the current item in a loop. Perhaps you have a list of orders, and for each order you display a `DetailsView` summarizing its items and need to prepopulate certain fields when the page loads. You need to be able to correlate the current data item with the correct `DetailsView` control instance.

The most straightforward method, and the one I often find myself leaning on, is to leverage the container’s `NamingContainer`. Controls within a container are accessible through its `FindControl` method. Crucially, this method searches relative to the container's scope. So, if you're looping through a `Repeater` or a `ListView`, and each item within that repeater or list view has its own `DetailsView`, `FindControl` will allow you to specifically access the `DetailsView` within the current item of the loop. You're essentially asking: "within *this* particular container in the loop, please find the `DetailsView`."

Let's walk through a few practical examples to solidify this. Assume we're using c# and asp.net webforms for these examples.

**Example 1: Looping Through a Repeater**

Imagine a `Repeater` control bound to a list of orders, and each order has its own `DetailsView`. The `DetailsView` displays order details. Here's the basic structure within the repeater's item template (simplified for clarity):

```html
<asp:Repeater ID="orderRepeater" runat="server">
    <ItemTemplate>
        <asp:DetailsView ID="orderDetailsView" runat="server" DataKeyNames="OrderID" AutoGenerateRows="false" >
        <Fields>
            <asp:BoundField DataField="OrderID" HeaderText="Order ID" />
            <asp:BoundField DataField="OrderDate" HeaderText="Order Date" />
             <asp:BoundField DataField="CustomerName" HeaderText="Customer Name" />
        </Fields>
        </asp:DetailsView>
    </ItemTemplate>
</asp:Repeater>
```

Now, in your code-behind, here’s how you would access each `DetailsView`:

```csharp
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (!IsPostBack)
    {
        // Assume 'orders' is your data source (e.g., a List<Order>)
        List<Order> orders = GetOrders();
        orderRepeater.DataSource = orders;
        orderRepeater.DataBind();
        PopulateDetailsViews();
    }
}

private void PopulateDetailsViews()
{
    foreach (RepeaterItem item in orderRepeater.Items)
    {
        if (item.ItemType == ListItemType.Item || item.ItemType == ListItemType.AlternatingItem)
        {
            DetailsView detailsView = item.FindControl("orderDetailsView") as DetailsView;

            if (detailsView != null)
            {
               // Access the current order object through data binding to customize it further.
               Order currentOrder = item.DataItem as Order;
                
               if(currentOrder != null)
               {
                //Example: set specific values, perhaps to highlight them based on certain logic.
                 detailsView.Rows[2].Cells[1].Text = $"<strong>{currentOrder.CustomerName}</strong>";
               }
               // or you can interact with databind and other logic as needed.

            }
         }
     }
}

//This is a mock function to simulate retrieving data.
private List<Order> GetOrders() {
  List<Order> orders = new List<Order>();
        orders.Add(new Order { OrderID = 1, OrderDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-2), CustomerName ="John Doe" });
        orders.Add(new Order { OrderID = 2, OrderDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1), CustomerName ="Jane Smith"});
        orders.Add(new Order { OrderID = 3, OrderDate = DateTime.Now, CustomerName ="Peter Jones"});

        return orders;
}
public class Order {
     public int OrderID { get; set; }
    public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
}
```

Here, I’m iterating through each `RepeaterItem`. Inside each item, `item.FindControl("orderDetailsView")` specifically finds the `DetailsView` control belonging to *that particular* item. The `as DetailsView` performs the cast, and it’s always good practice to check for null after casting. I'm also showing an example of how to access the current underlying order object to perform more dynamic logic within the loop if desired.

**Example 2: Nested Data Structures**

Sometimes your data might be hierarchical. Let’s say you have a `ListView` of customers and *within* each customer item, you have a `DetailsView` displaying customer details and then a nested repeater showing the customer's orders. Here’s a similar scenario where you have multiple `DetailsView` to find but at different levels within the control hierarchy.

```html
<asp:ListView ID="customerListView" runat="server">
    <ItemTemplate>
        <asp:DetailsView ID="customerDetailsView" runat="server" DataKeyNames="CustomerID" AutoGenerateRows="false" >
          <Fields>
              <asp:BoundField DataField="CustomerID" HeaderText="Customer ID" />
              <asp:BoundField DataField="CustomerName" HeaderText="Customer Name" />
           </Fields>
        </asp:DetailsView>
        
        <asp:Repeater ID="orderRepeater" runat="server">
            <ItemTemplate>
                 <asp:DetailsView ID="orderDetailsView" runat="server" DataKeyNames="OrderID" AutoGenerateRows="false" >
                      <Fields>
                        <asp:BoundField DataField="OrderID" HeaderText="Order ID" />
                        <asp:BoundField DataField="OrderDate" HeaderText="Order Date" />
                      </Fields>
                </asp:DetailsView>
            </ItemTemplate>
        </asp:Repeater>
    </ItemTemplate>
</asp:ListView>
```

And here's the code to process both `DetailsView` controls:

```csharp
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (!IsPostBack)
    {
        //Assume a method that retrieves customers with order information.
       List<Customer> customers = GetCustomersWithOrders();
        customerListView.DataSource = customers;
        customerListView.DataBind();
        ProcessCustomerDetailsViews();
    }
}

private void ProcessCustomerDetailsViews() {
     foreach (ListViewDataItem customerItem in customerListView.Items)
    {
        if (customerItem.ItemType == ListItemType.Item || customerItem.ItemType == ListItemType.AlternatingItem)
        {

            DetailsView customerDetailsView = customerItem.FindControl("customerDetailsView") as DetailsView;
             if (customerDetailsView != null) {
                 // process the customer details view
                Customer currentCustomer = customerItem.DataItem as Customer;

                if(currentCustomer != null) {
                      customerDetailsView.Rows[1].Cells[1].Text = $"<span style='font-weight: bold;'>{currentCustomer.CustomerName}</span>";
                }

            }

            Repeater orderRepeater = customerItem.FindControl("orderRepeater") as Repeater;

            if (orderRepeater != null) {
               orderRepeater.DataSource = ((Customer)customerItem.DataItem).Orders;
               orderRepeater.DataBind();
                foreach(RepeaterItem orderItem in orderRepeater.Items) {
                     if(orderItem.ItemType == ListItemType.Item || orderItem.ItemType == ListItemType.AlternatingItem) {
                           DetailsView orderDetailsView = orderItem.FindControl("orderDetailsView") as DetailsView;
                        if(orderDetailsView != null) {
                           // process the order details view
                              Order currentOrder = orderItem.DataItem as Order;
                                if(currentOrder != null) {
                                   orderDetailsView.Rows[1].Cells[1].Text = currentOrder.OrderDate.ToShortDateString();
                                }

                        }

                     }
                }


            }
          }
     }

}

// Mock Data method - includes both customers and orders.
private List<Customer> GetCustomersWithOrders()
{
    List<Customer> customers = new List<Customer>();

    //Customer 1 and Orders
    var customer1 = new Customer { CustomerID = 101, CustomerName = "Alice Johnson" };
    customer1.Orders.Add(new Order { OrderID = 1, OrderDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-5)});
    customer1.Orders.Add(new Order { OrderID = 2, OrderDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-3)});
    customers.Add(customer1);
    
   //Customer 2 and Orders
   var customer2 = new Customer { CustomerID = 102, CustomerName = "Bob Williams"};
   customer2.Orders.Add(new Order{ OrderID = 3, OrderDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1)});
   customers.Add(customer2);

    return customers;
}

public class Customer {
      public int CustomerID { get; set; }
     public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public List<Order> Orders { get; set; } = new List<Order>();
}
```

Again, the trick is to use the correct naming container. We first find the customer `DetailsView`, then the repeater and then finally we access the order's detail views from within the repeater's item templates. Each call to `FindControl` operates within the specific scope of the container it’s called from.

**Example 3: Using a GridView**

The same principle applies if you're using a `GridView`. The key here is to iterate through the rows, just as you would with a `Repeater`.

```html
 <asp:GridView ID="productGridView" runat="server" AutoGenerateColumns="false" DataKeyNames="ProductID">
        <Columns>
            <asp:BoundField DataField="ProductID" HeaderText="Product ID" />
            <asp:BoundField DataField="ProductName" HeaderText="Product Name" />
             <asp:TemplateField HeaderText="Details">
               <ItemTemplate>
                  <asp:DetailsView ID="productDetailsView" runat="server" DataKeyNames="ProductID" AutoGenerateRows="false" >
                        <Fields>
                            <asp:BoundField DataField="ProductID" HeaderText="ID" />
                            <asp:BoundField DataField="Description" HeaderText="Description"/>
                        </Fields>
                 </asp:DetailsView>
               </ItemTemplate>
            </asp:TemplateField>
        </Columns>
    </asp:GridView>
```

And the code-behind:

```csharp
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (!IsPostBack)
    {
      List<Product> products = GetProducts();
       productGridView.DataSource = products;
      productGridView.DataBind();
       ProcessGridViewDetailsViews();
    }
}

private void ProcessGridViewDetailsViews() {
    foreach (GridViewRow row in productGridView.Rows) {
        if (row.RowType == DataControlRowType.DataRow) {
              DetailsView detailsView = row.FindControl("productDetailsView") as DetailsView;
           if(detailsView != null) {
              Product currentProduct = row.DataItem as Product;
                if (currentProduct != null) {
                 detailsView.Rows[1].Cells[1].Text = $"<span style='font-style: italic;'>{currentProduct.Description}</span>";
                }

           }
        }
    }
}

//Mock function to get product data.
private List<Product> GetProducts() {
    List<Product> products = new List<Product>();
        products.Add(new Product{ ProductID=1, ProductName="Laptop", Description="A high performance laptop for professional use."});
        products.Add(new Product { ProductID=2, ProductName="Desktop", Description="A desktop PC for general purpose and business use."});
        products.Add(new Product { ProductID =3, ProductName="Tablet", Description = "A portable tablet for daily use."});

    return products;
}

public class Product {
    public int ProductID { get; set; }
     public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
}
```

Notice the common pattern: find the control within the appropriate container using the `FindControl` method, cast, check for null, and then proceed.

For further learning, I'd strongly recommend delving into the following resources:

*   **Microsoft's official ASP.NET documentation:** Start with the sections on `Repeater`, `ListView`, `GridView` and `DetailsView` controls. Understanding the control lifecycle is crucial when working with dynamic controls.
*   **"Programming Microsoft ASP.NET" by Dino Esposito:** A comprehensive and practical resource for ASP.NET, offering deep insights into the webforms control model and lifecycle. This is a great book to enhance understanding of how the controls and data binding work together.
*   **"ASP.NET 4.5 Unleashed" by Stephen Walther:** Provides an in-depth look into all aspects of the framework, including working with various data binding controls and dealing with complex scenarios.
*   **Articles and blog posts by Scott Hanselman:** Scott often publishes insightful articles and blog posts about practical ASP.NET development, which can provide a more real-world perspective on these topics.

In summary, the trick to finding multiple `DetailsView` controls within a loop lies in leveraging the `NamingContainer` and the `FindControl` method, while always ensuring to perform null checks after casting. By understanding this principle, you can dynamically access and manipulate these controls efficiently and reliably, even in complex nested scenarios. This is how I've generally handled these situations over my career and it has consistently been the most robust and easy to understand approach.
