Alright,  It's not uncommon to find ourselves in situations where the standard `UserManager` feels like overkill, especially when dealing with claim updates that might not directly tie into traditional user management. I've certainly encountered scenarios in legacy systems or more specialized setups where direct manipulation of claims was the more efficient path. Moving away from `UserManager` in .NET 6 isn’t inherently difficult, but it does require a good understanding of the underlying security principles and how claims are structured.

The primary reason you might bypass the `UserManager` for claim updates is performance and flexibility. Imagine a system dealing with non-user-specific claims, like permissions tied to resources rather than individuals, or dealing with claims within a microservice architecture where local user management isn't required. Trying to shoehorn these scenarios into the `UserManager`’s framework can be cumbersome. In such situations, direct manipulation via the `ClaimsPrincipal` and its associated `ClaimsIdentity` becomes the logical choice.

The key here is recognizing that claims are fundamentally stored as collections within the `ClaimsIdentity`, and these identities are attached to the `ClaimsPrincipal`, the object representing the authenticated user in your application. To update claims, you'll need to access these objects and work directly with their respective properties and methods. However, you also have to consider how to persist these changes, as claims, unlike user information, are often not automatically persisted across sessions. This is where implementing your own mechanism to manage the claim persistence comes in.

Let's dive into some practical examples.

First, consider a scenario where I needed to adjust an "access level" claim based on certain internal processing. Instead of using `UserManager` I decided to manipulate the user's claims directly during a specific request processing cycle. Here's how we achieve that, assuming we already have a `ClaimsPrincipal` instance representing the authenticated user, for example, using `HttpContext.User`:

```csharp
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Linq;

public static class ClaimExtensions
{
    public static void UpdateAccessLevelClaim(this ClaimsPrincipal principal, string newAccessLevel)
    {
        var identity = principal.Identity as ClaimsIdentity;
        if (identity == null)
        {
            // Handle case where the principal doesn't have a ClaimsIdentity.
            return;
        }

        var existingClaim = identity.FindFirst(c => c.Type == "access_level");

        if (existingClaim != null)
        {
            identity.RemoveClaim(existingClaim);
        }

        identity.AddClaim(new Claim("access_level", newAccessLevel));
    }
}

// Example usage within an action:
[Authorize]
public IActionResult MyAction()
{
    // ... some logic determines the new access level ...
    string newAccessLevel = "advanced";

    HttpContext.User.UpdateAccessLevelClaim(newAccessLevel);

    // ... continue processing ...
    return Ok("Access level updated.");
}

```

In this snippet, we extend the `ClaimsPrincipal` to create a convenient method for modifying the `access_level` claim. We first identify the claim if it exists, remove it and add a new claim. This effectively updates the existing `access_level` claim. However, these changes are only local to the current request, not persisted. You will need to implement a way to store updated claim information in a durable store if you require them to persist over requests.

Second, let's consider another real-world case where I needed to add new claims based on the outcome of a business logic operation. These claims, which represented specific feature access, were ephemeral and only needed to exist during a user session. Here's an example of how I handled such a case:

```csharp
using System.Security.Claims;

public static class ClaimExtensions
{
    public static void AddFeatureClaims(this ClaimsPrincipal principal, string[] featureAccess)
    {
       var identity = principal.Identity as ClaimsIdentity;
       if (identity == null)
       {
           return;
       }

       foreach (var feature in featureAccess)
       {
            identity.AddClaim(new Claim("feature_access", feature));
       }

    }
}
// Example usage within an action after an operation:

[Authorize]
public IActionResult MyOperation()
{
  // ... business logic ...
  string[] featuresGranted = {"report_access", "export_data"};

  HttpContext.User.AddFeatureClaims(featuresGranted);

  // ... continue processing ...
   return Ok("Features updated.");
}
```

Here, we extend ClaimsPrincipal to easily add new claims to signify access to specific features. The key concept is we append to the list of claims, rather than updating existing values, creating claims for each feature that can be leveraged for authorization.

Lastly, let’s consider a case where you might fetch updated claim data from a database or external service. This approach is useful for long-lasting changes to the user's permissions. Here's how you could integrate such a process into your claim update mechanism:

```csharp
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public interface IClaimService
{
    Task<IEnumerable<Claim>> GetUpdatedClaimsForUser(string userId);
}

public class DefaultClaimService : IClaimService
{
    // Dummy method - Implement your actual fetching logic.
    public async Task<IEnumerable<Claim>> GetUpdatedClaimsForUser(string userId)
    {
      // Simulate fetching claims from a datastore
      await Task.Delay(100);
        return new List<Claim>() {
                new Claim("access_level", "admin"),
                new Claim("feature_access", "all_features")
        };
    }

}

public static class ClaimExtensions
{
    public static async Task UpdateClaimsFromService(this ClaimsPrincipal principal, IClaimService claimService, string userId)
    {
       var identity = principal.Identity as ClaimsIdentity;
       if(identity == null) return;

        var updatedClaims = await claimService.GetUpdatedClaimsForUser(userId);

        identity.RemoveClaims(identity.Claims.ToArray()); // Clear all claims

        identity.AddClaims(updatedClaims); // Add new claims
    }
}

// Example usage within an action (or a service):

[Authorize]
public async Task<IActionResult> MyClaimUpdateAction(IClaimService claimService)
{
    var userId = HttpContext.User.FindFirstValue(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier); // or however you uniquely identify the user.
    if(userId == null) return Unauthorized();

   await HttpContext.User.UpdateClaimsFromService(claimService, userId);

   return Ok("Claims updated from service.");
}
```

In this example, a `IClaimService` is utilized to abstract fetching claims from any datastore. The extension method then pulls the updated claims and completely replaces the claims on the user's identity. This approach keeps the code very flexible, allowing different implementations of claim data storage and retrieval.

Important notes: It’s crucial to be mindful of security best practices when directly manipulating claims. Ensure proper validation and authorization checks are performed before updating any user claims. Additionally, consider the implications of changes on different parts of your application, especially if claims are heavily used for authorization or user-specific behavior. When implementing a custom claim persistence mechanism, remember to adhere to secure storage guidelines, particularly if claims contain sensitive information. You should also carefully evaluate whether you can avoid storing the claims data explicitly. If you require these claims over multiple requests, it may be a better approach to use stateless tokens based on your business needs.

To deepen your understanding further, I'd recommend looking at "Programming Microsoft ASP.NET Core" by Dino Esposito and Andrea Saltarello, which offers a very detailed look at the internals of the ASP.NET Core authorization and identity systems. The documentation from Microsoft on "Claims-based authorization in ASP.NET Core" is also invaluable in further understanding how claims work and how to manage them outside of the standard user manager paradigm.

In summary, while the `UserManager` provides a convenient way to manage user claims, directly working with `ClaimsPrincipal` and `ClaimsIdentity` offers a flexible approach for managing claims in .NET 6. Remember to handle security implications with care and consider the implications of direct manipulation before implementing such solutions.
