Alright, let's unpack this `undefined method 'will_save_change_to_address'` error. This isn't an uncommon sight, particularly within the rails ecosystem, and usually indicates a misunderstanding of how Active Record change tracking functions work, especially when dealing with associated models. From what I've seen throughout my years building applications, this error typically surfaces when you're attempting to use change tracking methods, such as `will_save_change_to_`, on an attribute or an association that either doesn't exist or isn't set up to properly track changes. Let me elaborate, as the devil is often in the details, as they say.

In a typical rails application, when you define an attribute on your model, active record automatically hooks up a set of change-tracking methods. These are things like `attribute_changed?`, `attribute_was`, and, importantly for our context, `will_save_change_to_attribute`. However, when you're dealing with associations, like a `belongs_to` or `has_one`, it's crucial to recognize that these methods operate on the specific model's attributes, not on the association itself.

The problem often arises when you have a model, say `User`, that `has_one :address`, and you attempt to call `user.will_save_change_to_address` directly. The error, `undefined method 'will_save_change_to_address'`, makes perfect sense here. `address` isn't an attribute of the user model, but rather an associated object. The user model doesn't track changes *to the association itself*, but to the attributes within the associated `Address` model.

Consider this situation from a prior project: we were working on a system where users could update their contact information, including their address. We had a similar model structure: a `User` with a `has_one :address`. We initially made the mistake of trying to detect if the user's *address* was about to be updated using a callback in the user model like this:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :address, dependent: :destroy

  before_update :log_address_changes

  private

  def log_address_changes
    if will_save_change_to_address?
      puts "Address is about to be updated!"
    end
  end
end

class Address < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

This is where the exact error you're seeing would have occurred. The correct approach is to inspect the attributes *within* the address model itself. So, the `before_update` callback on the `User` model wouldn't be appropriate for detecting changes in the `Address`. Instead, a callback on the `Address` model would be the right approach.

Here’s a corrected snippet demonstrating a working implementation:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :address, dependent: :destroy
end

class Address < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  before_update :log_address_changes

  private

  def log_address_changes
    if will_save_change_to_street? || will_save_change_to_city? || will_save_change_to_postal_code?
      puts "An address attribute is about to be updated!"
      #Access previous values using  street_was, city_was and postal_code_was
      puts "Previous Street: #{street_was}" if street_changed?
      puts "Previous City: #{city_was}" if city_changed?
      puts "Previous Postal Code: #{postal_code_was}" if postal_code_changed?
    end
  end
end
```

In this second example, we've shifted the `before_update` callback to the `Address` model and are now checking for changes to specific attributes (`street`, `city`, `postal_code` - or whichever address attributes your model has). We’re using the `will_save_change_to_*` methods which work on attributes *defined* within the `Address` model. Additionally, I included an example of accessing the old values before update.

Now, the question arises, how can you detect if an association *itself* has changed—for example, if a user's address is being completely replaced with a new address record. You can detect these association changes by checking if the `address_id` is changing on `User`. Since `address_id` *is* an attribute of the `User`, we can use change-tracking on the User object:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :address, dependent: :destroy
  before_update :log_associated_address_change

  private
  def log_associated_address_change
    if will_save_change_to_address_id?
        puts "Address association is about to change"
        puts "Previous Address ID: #{address_id_was}" if address_id_changed?
    end
  end
end

class Address < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

In this third example, we check to see if the address association is going to change and report the previous `address_id`. This will trigger when a new address record is saved and assigned to the `User` or if the association to a record was removed, thus setting the `address_id` to `nil`.

The key takeaway here is: change tracking methods (`will_save_change_to_*`, `*_changed?`, `*_was`) operate on *model attributes*, not on model associations directly. For detecting changes within an associated model, you’ll need to check the attributes within that model. For changes in the association itself, examine the foreign key on the parent model (e.g., `address_id` on `User`).

To delve deeper into these concepts, I highly recommend these resources:

*   **"Agile Web Development with Rails 7"** by Sam Ruby, David Bryant Copeland, and Dave Thomas. This comprehensive guide provides an in-depth exploration of Active Record and its various features, including change tracking. Specifically, Chapter 5 on Active Record will prove beneficial.
*   **The Rails API Documentation** is the ultimate source of truth. Review the section on Active Record callbacks and change tracking for detailed insight into all methods and nuances involved. You can access this directly via the official Rails website.
*   **"Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture"** by Martin Fowler. Although not solely focused on Rails, this book provides a solid foundation in domain modeling and data management, which is vital for understanding the underlying principles of change tracking in the context of an application. The patterns related to Object-Relational Mapping will greatly help understand the relationship between objects and database records.

By understanding the distinction between attributes and associations and by using the correct approach to detect and track changes, you'll avoid this frustrating `undefined method` error and write more maintainable and robust Rails code. This issue, as I’ve outlined, typically boils down to incorrect expectation about where the change-tracking mechanics occur within the model hierarchy. Remember, inspect the right attributes, on the right models.
