Let's tackle this searchkick conundrum you're facing. It’s a common pitfall, and I recall having spent an afternoon myself debugging something similar while working on a large e-commerce platform. The behavior you're seeing, searchkick returning only distinct values on the ‘id’ field, is likely due to how searchkick (and by extension, elasticsearch) aggregates and returns results by default. It's not a bug per se, but a manifestation of its default behavior when dealing with indexed documents that have multiple matches for the search query and the same identifier in one of the search fields.

Specifically, the core issue boils down to how aggregations, especially those implicitly used when you expect a standard list of results, work within elasticsearch. When you perform a search, searchkick (and elasticsearch under the hood) typically doesn't return just any matching document; instead, it aggregates results based on document scores, relevance, and other internal mechanisms. When you have multiple documents that match and share the same ‘id’ but perhaps have other differing field values, the default behavior leans toward returning only one distinct ‘id’ from this group.

Think of it this way: imagine your data is like a big library, and each book is a document. Each book has an ‘id’ (like an ISBN) and other fields like title, author, and publication year. When you search for "programming books," you might get multiple books with the same author or even a few editions with the same ‘id’. What you expect is a list of all matching *books*. However, what's happening with your Searchkick setup is akin to a search result that only gives you a *unique listing of the ID*, maybe grouped by a different field, rather than returning all relevant books. That’s likely because your search results may include an implicit aggregation over a field.

The problem often stems from an implicit use of an aggregation feature of elasticsearch without you explicitly intending it. Now let's explore some reasons and code snippets to illustrate this further.

Firstly, if you are not explicitly requesting aggregations but still see only distinct ids, it is probable that some of your configurations unintentionally trigger aggregation behind the scene. One common scenario involves configurations aimed at boosting relevance through custom analyzers or field mappings. Such settings can sometimes unintentionally enable the search engine's aggregation functionality, especially if the index mappings aren't properly specified. For example:

```ruby
# Example 1: Incorrect mapping leading to aggregation
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  searchkick index_name: 'products_v1',
             settings: {
               analysis: {
                 analyzer: {
                   custom_analyzer: {
                     tokenizer: 'standard',
                     filter: ['lowercase']
                   }
                 }
               },
               mappings: {
                 properties: {
                   id: { type: 'keyword' }, # Keyword can sometimes cause this
                   name: { type: 'text', analyzer: 'custom_analyzer' },
                   description: { type: 'text', analyzer: 'custom_analyzer' },
                 }
               }
end

Product.search("programming", fields: [:name, :description]) # this might return only distinct product ids
```

In this first example, I'm using the keyword field type for ID, a field designed for exact matches. This, in itself, does not *cause* aggregation. However, when a query with text matches multiple documents with the same ID, and elasticsearch evaluates relevance for all fields, if it's not explicit how to retrieve documents it will, internally, behave as if you requested aggregation on ‘id’. Specifically in an indexing and searching environment, the implicit grouping/aggregation over the 'id' becomes apparent. The solution here is generally to use proper field mappings and potentially make the id field not searchable if necessary.

Secondly, another common cause is the incorrect use of search kick’s `distinct` option. While seemingly straightforward, using it inadvertently can lead to the very issue you are encountering. Here is an example:

```ruby
# Example 2: Incorrect usage of the "distinct" option

class User < ApplicationRecord
  searchkick index_name: 'users_v1'
end

User.search("smith", distinct: true, fields: [:name, :email]) # this will return only distinct users by id, but not all matching records
```

Here, I've explicitly used the `distinct: true` option without specifying which field should be distinct. In this case, searchkick defaults to distinct on the document's `id`, leading to the problem. The solution is to avoid using `distinct: true` if you want all matching documents or specify the target field for distinction, which is seldom the id. Also, it's vital to understand that ‘distinct’ within searchkick is not equivalent to SQL’s `DISTINCT` clause, which returns unique row combinations; it's an aggregation over a specified field.

Finally, while less common but worth mentioning, sometimes the cause could be related to how you are building your results. For example, if you are using aggregations, and then combining them with results, it might lead to what seems like missing or duplicated results. Suppose you were to implement some form of custom result handling:

```ruby
# Example 3: Incorrect custom results processing after aggregation

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  searchkick index_name: 'posts_v1'
end

results = Post.search("interesting content", body: {
     aggs: {
       authors: {
         terms: { field: :author }
       }
     }
   })

#Incorrect: Trying to extract post from aggregation data
puts results.aggregations.authors.buckets.map { |bucket| Post.find(bucket.key)}

#This code is attempting to find posts based on the aggregation keys but is not returning the search results for the matching posts themselves. This is a common mistake.
```

The code shows an improper attempt to retrieve post data from an author aggregation. This does not return individual posts matching the query, it is only using the ‘author’ aggregation to fetch posts. This isn’t a direct cause of the unique id issue, but highlights an area where a misunderstanding of elasticsearch’s aggregation and search behavior can lead to unexpected results that can include missing or seemingly duplicated data.

To address your issue, consider the following:

1.  **Review your field mappings:** Ensure that your `id` field is mapped correctly, often as `keyword` if you're not doing text-based searches on that field, but not if you intend to treat it as a searchable value. If you need to search against this field, `text` with appropriate analysis setup may be what you want. Also make sure your text based fields, such as `name` or `description` are also correctly mapped and have an appropriate analyzer set to ensure all potential matches are retrieved.

2.  **Avoid implicit aggregations:** Be careful about unintentional configurations in your `settings` that might trigger aggregations and double-check that you aren’t requesting any aggregations within the `search` call.

3. **Check usage of distinct option**: If you do not intend to return only distinct document based on the id, remove any `distinct: true` option from search queries or explicitly set it to the field that should be distinct.

4.  **Understand elasticsearch aggregation behavior:** Spend some time understanding how elasticsearch's aggregations work. The documentation is invaluable and it will help understand the underpinnings of searchkick.

For further study, I recommend diving into the following:

*   **"Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide" by Clinton Gormley and Zachary Tong**: This book provides a comprehensive understanding of elasticsearch internals, including how indexing, analysis, and aggregations work. It’s crucial for a deep dive into this topic.
*   **The official Elasticsearch documentation**: Elastic's website provides the most up-to-date and detailed explanations of all functionalities, including mappings, analysis, and aggregations. Focusing on the sections covering these areas will be particularly beneficial.
*  **Searchkick's documentation:** The official Searchkick documentation has detailed explanations on all of it’s features and configuration options. Take time to read the docs to learn what each option does.

In my experience, this issue almost always boils down to a subtle misunderstanding of how elasticsearch handles search results, particularly regarding implicit aggregation. By meticulously checking your mappings, analyzing your queries, and understanding the underlying mechanisms, you should be able to rectify this and obtain the expected behavior.
