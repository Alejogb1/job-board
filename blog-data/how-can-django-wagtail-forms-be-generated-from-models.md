Okay, let's tackle this. I've certainly seen my share of model-driven form generation challenges, and Wagtail, while fantastic, adds a particular nuance to the process. There isn't a single magic bullet, but rather a combination of techniques that, when applied thoughtfully, can significantly streamline your workflow. I recall a particularly thorny project a few years back, involving a complex data entry system for a research institution; trying to manually keep forms in sync with evolving data models was a real time sink.

The fundamental challenge we’re addressing here is the impedance mismatch between your database schema (defined by Django models) and the data input required for user interaction (handled by forms). Instead of manually writing forms that duplicate model structures, we aim for a more automated, maintainable approach.

Firstly, it’s critical to understand that Wagtail's page models, while inheriting from Django models, are not directly usable in Django’s regular form framework. They possess additional fields and logic specific to page structure. This means relying solely on Django’s `ModelForm` class won't completely solve our problem with Wagtail page models, but it’s where we begin for typical content models or when generating forms that aren't directly tied to pages.

The primary route is to leverage Django's built-in `ModelForm` for your content-based models (if not extending `Page` in Wagtail). If your `Page` model has fields for content, and they are model fields, this can be part of the form creation. Here is how it would look in a simplistic case:

```python
# models.py

from django.db import models

class BlogPost(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    content = models.TextField()
    publication_date = models.DateField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

```python
# forms.py

from django import forms
from .models import BlogPost

class BlogPostForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = BlogPost
        fields = ['title', 'content', 'publication_date']
```

This code uses `ModelForm` and the `Meta` class, indicating the model to which it's connected along with the specific fields that the form should include. This is incredibly convenient for simple cases where you just need to allow users to edit the fields directly within the database. This is excellent when data entry isn't part of a page.

Now, let's consider the scenario where you intend to integrate this within a Wagtail page, potentially involving fields alongside Wagtail's `StreamField`. In this case, a direct `ModelForm` may not suffice; you’ll likely need some custom form logic or integration. Wagtail's `ModelAdmin` can help in the admin interface, but for frontend user-facing forms, a slightly modified approach is required. I encountered a situation where we had to collect user feedback associated with specific page content, so we had a form tied to a page but wasn't directly editing that page's content.

Here, we will work through how that might be approached. Let's add a content model that's not a page itself, and then create a form to be associated with the page.

```python
# models.py (within a Wagtail app)

from django.db import models
from wagtail.models import Page
from wagtail.fields import StreamField
from wagtail import blocks

class ContentFeedback(models.Model):
    page = models.ForeignKey('myapp.MyPage', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='feedbacks')
    commenter_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    comment = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Feedback from {self.commenter_name} on {self.page.title}"

class MyPage(Page):
    body = StreamField([
        ('heading', blocks.CharBlock(form_classname="title")),
        ('paragraph', blocks.TextBlock()),
    ], use_json_field=True)
```

```python
# forms.py (within the same app)

from django import forms
from .models import ContentFeedback

class ContentFeedbackForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = ContentFeedback
        fields = ['commenter_name', 'comment']
```
Now we can pass this form to the template to render and create functionality to process the form submission. Note that it is necessary to pass the current page to the `save` or similar logic.

The key takeaway is that directly generating Wagtail page forms from models has limitations, since the model contains page-specific logic and data beyond simply what's required for an input form. We instead often create separate models to manage things like feedback or other data inputs. If, instead, you are using `StreamField` or similar within a wagtail page, that needs to be handled in a way different than typical Django form fields, and will need custom widget definitions or similar.

Finally, consider using django-crispy-forms to assist with the layout and rendering of your forms. It simplifies the process of making forms visually appealing and responsive, without writing excessive HTML. While it doesn't change the fundamental process of generating the form itself, it significantly improves presentation, which can be very helpful for complex forms.

```python
# forms.py (with crispy forms)

from django import forms
from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper
from crispy_forms.layout import Layout, Submit
from .models import BlogPost

class BlogPostFormCrispy(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.helper = FormHelper()
        self.helper.layout = Layout(
            'title',
            'content',
            'publication_date',
            Submit('submit', 'Save', css_class='btn btn-primary')
        )
    class Meta:
        model = BlogPost
        fields = ['title', 'content', 'publication_date']
```

This example demonstrates how `FormHelper` and `Layout` help make forms clean and structured. It is very helpful if you are creating complex forms.

For further exploration, I’d strongly recommend a thorough reading of the official Django documentation, particularly the sections on forms and model forms. Also, the Wagtail documentation on page models, `StreamFields`, and model admin integration is incredibly helpful. “Two Scoops of Django” by Daniel Roy Greenfeld and Audrey Roy Greenfeld provides an insightful perspective on practical Django usage, and "Django 4 By Example" by Antonio Melé goes deeply into real-world use cases. If you plan to do anything with complex fields inside wagtail, pay special attention to the Wagtail documentation around `StreamField` and custom block types.

In summary, while automatic form generation from Wagtail page models isn’t entirely straightforward, by strategically combining Django's `ModelForm` where appropriate and crafting custom form handling as necessary for data that's not directly on the page, you can build maintainable and robust forms within your Wagtail-powered applications. Remember, that while Wagtail is built on Django, Wagtail page models have specific uses and expectations, so a direct transfer from a model to form paradigm isn't always the best approach. The key is to understand the distinction and adapt accordingly, focusing on practicality over strict automation.
