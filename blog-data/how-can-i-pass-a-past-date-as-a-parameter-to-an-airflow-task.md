Let's unpack this, shall we? Passing past dates into Airflow tasks is a frequent requirement, and it’s understandable you’re looking for clarity on how best to approach it. The short answer is, you can do it quite easily leveraging Airflow’s template engine and built-in macros, but the *how* is dependent on the specific use case and desired degree of dynamicism. I've certainly encountered my fair share of headaches around this in various data pipelines I've constructed, so let me share what I've learned.

First, it’s crucial to understand that Airflow inherently works with a concept of “logical date.” This represents the intended execution time of a task, not the wall clock time when it actually runs. When dealing with past dates, you're usually working with the logical date, which Airflow provides via the `ds` macro. However, sometimes, you need to pass an even *earlier* date, and that’s where things get more involved.

Let's say you have a daily pipeline, and a particular task needs to process data from, say, three days before the current logical date. You could directly manipulate the `ds` macro combined with relative date modifications.

Here’s the first example, showcasing how to calculate a date three days before the task's logical date and pass that to a Python callable:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def process_past_date(date_to_process, **kwargs):
    print(f"Processing date: {date_to_process}")
    # Here you'd perform your data processing logic

with DAG(
    dag_id='past_date_example_1',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    process_data_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='process_data',
        python_callable=process_past_date,
        op_kwargs={'date_to_process': '{{ (execution_date - macros.timedelta(days=3)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d") }}'},
    )

```

In this example, `execution_date` gives you the logical date. We use `macros.timedelta(days=3)` to subtract three days from that, and then we format the resulting datetime object to a date string in `YYYY-MM-DD` format using `strftime`. This string is then passed to `process_past_date`. If the dag runs on, say, 2023-10-30, the date passed will be 2023-10-27. This is a very common pattern, and probably the most straight forward approach.

Now, let's move to another scenario. What if you needed to pass a range of past dates to a task, not just one? Perhaps you are re-processing historical data or performing batch updates. The `execution_date` is still at your disposal, but you'll need to dynamically generate a list of dates from it.

Here’s how you can use a loop combined with `execution_date` and `macros.timedelta`:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pendulum

def process_date_range(start_date, end_date, **kwargs):
    current_date = pendulum.parse(start_date)
    end = pendulum.parse(end_date)

    while current_date <= end:
        print(f"Processing date: {current_date.to_date_string()}")
        # perform data processing here
        current_date = current_date.add(days=1)


with DAG(
    dag_id='past_date_example_2',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    process_range_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='process_range',
        python_callable=process_date_range,
        op_kwargs={
            'start_date': '{{ (execution_date - macros.timedelta(days=7)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d") }}',
            'end_date': '{{ (execution_date - macros.timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d") }}',
        },
    )
```

Here, we're creating a task to process data from a period of seven days up to a single day prior to the execution date. The core idea is to calculate two dates relative to the `execution_date`, `start_date` and `end_date`, and then loop through the range using `pendulum`, which gives a convenient way to work with dates. This approach allows for dynamic generation of a date list without hardcoding dates.

There are also scenarios where you need to base the past date not just on the execution date but on some other information available at runtime. I remember a situation where our system was ingesting data coming from third party services. These services provided incremental data updates based on a “last updated” timestamp, and the next API call should use that timestamp to pull next set of updated data. Instead of the default Airflow `execution_date`, you would need to persist this timestamp (e.g. in Airflow XCOM) and use that as your base date.

Finally, let’s show an example of passing the date, not as a string, but as a Python datetime object. This can be useful when you are working with datetime objects in your callable. This time, instead of using a predefined timedelta from execution date, let’s assume it’s a value coming from an XCOM:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.operators.python import ShortCircuitOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pendulum

def set_xcom_date(**kwargs):
    # Simulating retrieving a date
    xcom_date = datetime(2023, 10, 10)
    kwargs['ti'].xcom_push(key='xcom_date', value=xcom_date)
    return True

def process_date_from_xcom(date_to_process, **kwargs):
    print(f"Processing date: {date_to_process}")
    # perform data processing logic

with DAG(
    dag_id='past_date_example_3',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    set_date_xcom = ShortCircuitOperator(
        task_id='set_date_xcom',
        python_callable=set_xcom_date,
    )

    process_xcom_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='process_date_from_xcom',
        python_callable=process_date_from_xcom,
        op_kwargs={'date_to_process': '{{ ti.xcom_pull(task_ids="set_date_xcom", key="xcom_date") }}'},
    )

    set_date_xcom >> process_xcom_task

```

Here, we’re pushing a date to XCOM in the task `set_date_xcom` and we pull it in the `process_date_from_xcom` task. Note, we do not need to parse or format the date from XCOM again, as it will be automatically de-serialized to a datetime object on the receiving end. This avoids unnecessary formatting and can be useful, particularly when you have multiple tasks exchanging datetime objects.

For those keen to dive deeper into the underlying mechanics, I’d recommend the official Airflow documentation, specifically the sections on Macros and Jinja templating. For a broader understanding of workflow orchestration, consider reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann, which offers valuable insights into the design principles of these types of systems. The book “Data Pipelines Pocket Reference” by James Densmore, also offers a very practical view on designing and building data pipelines, which, of course, are an important part of many Airflow workflows.

In closing, passing past dates in Airflow tasks is quite straightforward once you understand the interplay between the execution date and the Jinja templating engine. The examples above provide a good start, and you can expand on them based on the exact complexity of your use case. Remember to always test your logic and templating before deploying any workflow to production. Good luck!
