Okay, let's tackle this. I've been in the trenches with data science and machine learning for quite some time, and the process of preparing datasets, specifically splitting them into features and targets, is foundational. It’s one of those steps that, while seemingly simple, can have a dramatic impact on model performance and requires a solid understanding. You absolutely cannot effectively train a network without it.

My experience comes from several projects, from working on predictive maintenance systems in industrial settings to personalized recommendation engines for e-commerce. Each time, data wrangling and this split have been crucial. Let me walk you through it.

The core idea here is that a neural network learns a mapping from inputs (features) to outputs (targets). The features, also known as independent variables, are the data points your model uses to make predictions. Think of them as the characteristics you're feeding the network to analyze. The targets, or dependent variables, represent what you are trying to predict or classify. They are the desired output, the ground truth, for each example.

The method for splitting this data depends quite a bit on how your dataset is structured. Usually, you'll find data in one of a few common formats: csv, json, or databases. For our purposes here, let’s imagine we have the data loaded in Python, primarily using libraries such as pandas or numpy, the tools I generally lean on in this phase. I’ll use those in the examples that follow.

A common mistake I've seen, especially with newer folks, is treating all the columns the same. It’s essential to correctly identify which columns represent the features and which represent the targets *before* you even begin any coding. This is often decided by the problem you're trying to solve. It is where a lot of headaches get started if not handled thoughtfully.

Let's take a look at three different scenarios.

**Scenario 1: Data is in a tabular format (e.g., a pandas DataFrame), with one target column.**

This is a fairly common situation. Say we have a dataset predicting house prices, where the price is the target, and features might be square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace with your actual data loading)
data = {'sq_ft': [1200, 1500, 1800, 2000],
        'bedrooms': [2, 3, 3, 4],
        'location_score': [0.7, 0.8, 0.6, 0.9],
        'price': [250000, 300000, 350000, 400000]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Defining features and target
feature_columns = ['sq_ft', 'bedrooms', 'location_score']
target_column = 'price'

features = df[feature_columns].values # .values transforms the df into a numpy array
targets = df[target_column].values

print("Features (first 2 rows):\n", features[:2])
print("Targets (first 2 values):\n", targets[:2])
```
Here, `feature_columns` holds the names of the columns we'll use as features, and `target_column` is the column that contains our target variable. We then select those columns using the pandas dataframe's indexing to create numpy arrays that are suitable for input into neural network models in libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. The usage of `.values` to extract the numpy array from pandas is critical for numerical computations later in the modeling pipeline.

**Scenario 2: Data in a tabular format with multiple target columns**

Sometimes, you need to predict several targets simultaneously. This is common when dealing with tasks like multi-label classification or predicting multiple properties.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


data = {'feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4],
        'feature2': [5, 6, 7, 8],
        'target1': [0, 1, 0, 1],
        'target2': [1, 0, 1, 0]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

feature_columns = ['feature1', 'feature2']
target_columns = ['target1', 'target2']

features = df[feature_columns].values
targets = df[target_columns].values

print("Features (first 2 rows):\n", features[:2])
print("Targets (first 2 rows):\n", targets[:2])
```

The key difference is that now `target_columns` is a *list* of column names, and the extraction works similarly to the previous case. The resulting `targets` will be a numpy array where each *row* represents multiple targets for a single sample.

**Scenario 3: Data from a time series, where historical data are the features and a future value is the target.**

Time-series data presents a bit of a different challenge. Here, we might take the values from the previous n-time-steps as our features to predict a future time step as our target.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample time series data
time_series_data = np.array([10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26])

def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
    features = []
    targets = []
    for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
        features.append(data[i : i + seq_length])
        targets.append(data[i + seq_length])
    return np.array(features), np.array(targets)

seq_length = 3
features, targets = create_sequences(time_series_data, seq_length)

print("Features (first 2 sequences):\n", features[:2])
print("Targets (first 2 values):\n", targets[:2])
```

In this example, the function `create_sequences` is critical. It steps through the data and creates fixed-length input sequences (`features`) of three time steps (defined by `seq_length`) and predicts the single future value (`targets`). This illustrates a common "windowing" approach in time series data preparation.

**A Few More Pointers:**

It's important to note that after the split, you'll likely need to preprocess the data. Scaling and normalization are often performed on features to ensure that they are all within a similar range, which aids in the learning process of many neural networks. Techniques like standardization (mean 0, variance 1) or min-max scaling are common. You will also typically one-hot encode categorical features before feeding them into the neural network to avoid introducing ordinality where there is none. This is critical and is something I've had to adjust in many of my prior projects as it was originally overlooked.

Regarding resources, I strongly recommend reviewing some core textbooks and papers. For a thorough grounding in the theory and practical application, look to "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. It's a fairly dense but essential book. For a more hands-on approach, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Géron is also excellent and has great coverage of these fundamental tasks like feature selection, data cleaning, and target separation. Additionally, for time series analysis and forecasting, reading Hyndman and Athanasopoulos’ "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" can be of significant help, as well as specific papers on time series forecasting techniques, often found by searching databases like IEEE Xplore or ACM Digital Library. These are some resources that have never let me down.

In summary, preparing your data by carefully splitting your dataset into appropriate features and targets is non-negotiable when working with neural networks. It’s not just about writing the code; it's about understanding your data, the problem you're trying to solve, and how this structure impacts your model's capacity to learn. Getting this crucial initial step correct can prevent a great many headaches later in the development cycle. I’ve been at this a long time, and I can promise that attention to these details pays dividends.
