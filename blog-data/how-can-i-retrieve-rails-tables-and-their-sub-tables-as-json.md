Alright, let’s tackle this. I've been down this road more times than I care to count, particularly in scenarios where API responses need to be both comprehensive and efficient. Getting Rails tables, particularly with their associated sub-tables, into a nicely structured JSON format requires a considered approach. It’s less about a single magic command, and more about understanding the nuances of Active Record relationships and how best to serialize them.

My approach typically revolves around a few key techniques: leveraging eager loading, utilizing serializers, and sometimes incorporating custom logic for specific edge cases. Let's break down each of these.

First, let’s talk about eager loading. In the past, I've seen developers fall into the trap of the n+1 query problem. This happens when you fetch a parent record, and then, for each parent, you trigger a separate database query to fetch its children. This can quickly grind your app to a halt, especially as the number of parent records increases. To avoid this, `includes` is your friend. Using `includes`, you can pre-load the associated tables when you first query for the parent records.

For instance, consider a situation where you have a `User` model that `has_many :posts` and a `Post` model that `belongs_to :user`. Here’s how you would fetch all the users and their respective posts, avoiding the dreaded n+1 problem:

```ruby
  users = User.includes(:posts).all

  # Now, serialize to json.
  users_json = users.map do |user|
    {
      id: user.id,
      name: user.name,
      email: user.email,
      posts: user.posts.map do |post|
        {
          id: post.id,
          title: post.title,
          content: post.content
        }
      end
    }
  end

  puts JSON.pretty_generate(users_json)
```

In this code snippet, the `User.includes(:posts)` loads all users and their posts in two queries (one for users, one for posts), rather than one query per user. The second part then transforms the data into the JSON structure you need. This approach provides direct control over what data goes into your JSON response, which can be incredibly useful. However, it can become quite verbose for complex data structures with many relationships. This is where serializers come into the picture.

Serializers offer a cleaner and more maintainable way to manage the transformation of your Active Record objects into JSON. They encapsulate the logic for what fields to include and how to format them. In Rails, you might choose to use a gem like `active_model_serializers`, or if you are on a more recent version, the built in `as_json` method alongside custom methods can do the trick. For example, let's modify the previous example:

```ruby
  class UserSerializer
    def initialize(user)
      @user = user
    end

    def as_json(*)
      {
        id: @user.id,
        name: @user.name,
        email: @user.email,
        posts: @user.posts.map {|post| PostSerializer.new(post).as_json }
      }
    end
  end

  class PostSerializer
      def initialize(post)
        @post = post
      end

    def as_json(*)
        {
          id: @post.id,
          title: @post.title,
          content: @post.content
        }
      end
  end

  users = User.includes(:posts).all
  users_json = users.map { |user| UserSerializer.new(user).as_json }

  puts JSON.pretty_generate(users_json)

```

Here, we've created `UserSerializer` and `PostSerializer` classes to handle the JSON formatting. This significantly cleans up the controller code. It also makes your code easier to test and maintain, since the transformation logic is neatly separated. For large-scale applications, I’ve found that using dedicated serializers significantly reduces complexity. Serializers have the added advantage that you can have various versions (e.g. a summary view vs. detailed view).

There are also occasions where more customized processing becomes necessary. For example, let's say, as a further example, a `Post` has many `Comments` and we only want a count of the comments along with the post. You can't use simple includes for this since we only need the count and not the full data. This kind of aggregation requires additional logic within the serializer:

```ruby
class PostSerializer
    def initialize(post)
      @post = post
    end

    def as_json(*)
      {
        id: @post.id,
        title: @post.title,
        content: @post.content,
        comment_count: @post.comments.count
      }
    end
  end

    class UserSerializer
    def initialize(user)
      @user = user
    end

    def as_json(*)
      {
        id: @user.id,
        name: @user.name,
        email: @user.email,
        posts: @user.posts.map {|post| PostSerializer.new(post).as_json }
      }
    end
  end


  users = User.includes(:posts).all
  users_json = users.map { |user| UserSerializer.new(user).as_json }

  puts JSON.pretty_generate(users_json)

```

In this scenario, we added `comment_count`, which queries the associated `comments` table and counts the records for each post. If you needed to add logic for custom attributes, aggregations or filtering, you would do so within the serializer.

As for recommendations, "Eloquent Ruby" by Russ Olsen is a good resource for understanding the core Ruby concepts, which are essential for building effective Rails applications. For deeper dives into Active Record and database performance, I highly recommend checking out the official Rails documentation. You should also familiarize yourself with the source code of the `active_model_serializers` gem (or similar) to understand how serialization is implemented under the hood, which is especially useful if you want to create something like my examples above. "SQL and Relational Theory" by C.J. Date is invaluable for deepening your grasp of database concepts. Finally, don't underestimate the value of reading and re-reading the official Rails API documentation for Active Record; it contains a wealth of information and is often the best place to find the answer.

In summary, obtaining Rails tables and their sub-tables as JSON isn't about a single approach. Instead, it's about combining techniques like eager loading, using serializers, and incorporating custom logic when required. This way, you ensure that your API delivers the data it needs in a robust, efficient and easy-to-maintain manner. Start with eager loading for performance, move to serializers for cleaner code, and don't be afraid to introduce custom logic for the more intricate scenarios.
