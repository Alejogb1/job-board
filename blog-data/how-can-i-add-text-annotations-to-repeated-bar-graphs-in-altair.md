Alright, let's tackle this. I've actually spent a fair bit of time wrestling with text annotations in Altair, especially when you're dealing with repeated bar graphs. It's a common scenario when you’re trying to show nuanced comparisons across different categories, and sometimes just a visual bar isn't enough; you need labels, values, or markers to really drive your point home.

The core challenge here, as I see it, isn't just adding text, but doing it in a way that scales gracefully with multiple subplots generated by `altair.repeat`. The naive approach—just adding a text layer for each bar in each subplot manually—quickly becomes unwieldy and difficult to maintain. What we need is a way to leverage Altair's data binding and transformation capabilities to automate the process of annotation.

My experience goes back to a project where we were visualizing sales data across multiple regions and product categories. We had bar graphs showing sales revenue for each product category within each region, and initially, the team wanted absolute values displayed on top of the bars. Manually plotting these labels was time-consuming and prone to errors; plus, if the data changed, it was a nightmare to update. That’s where a deeper dive into Altair’s layered charts became essential.

The fundamental idea is that you should construct your annotation layer as a separate chart that is then layered on top of your main bar chart. The trick lies in encoding the text labels from your data and aligning them properly within each repeated bar graph. Let's break down a few practical examples with code, illustrating different approaches you can take depending on the type of annotation needed.

**Example 1: Simple Value Labels on Top of Bars**

This is probably the most frequent use case. Here, we'll add the numerical value of each bar directly on top of it.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'],
    'region': ['Region 1', 'Region 1', 'Region 1', 'Region 2', 'Region 2', 'Region 2'],
    'value': [10, 15, 8, 12, 18, 6]
})

base = alt.Chart(data).encode(
    alt.X('category:N'),
    alt.Y('value:Q')
).properties(
    width=200,
    height=150
)

bars = base.mark_bar()

text = base.mark_text(
    align='center',
    dy=-5  # move text slightly above the bar
).encode(
    text='value:Q'
)

chart = (bars + text).facet(
    facet=alt.Facet('region:N', columns=2)
)

chart
```

In this snippet, we define a base chart that encodes the x and y axes. Then, `bars` creates the basic bar chart. The magic happens in `text`: we use `mark_text` to specify text labels, encoded with the `value` field from our data, which are to be aligned at the center of the bars and moved vertically upwards a bit. We then facet the combined bar and text charts by region. This gives us neatly labelled bar graphs repeated for each region. Note the use of `dy=-5`; this fine-tunes the vertical positioning. You can adjust that to what suits your layout.

**Example 2: Custom Text Based on Data Transformation**

Sometimes, you might not want to display the raw value. Maybe you need to show a percentage change, an average, or a truncated version of a longer string. In these situations, you'll need to transform the data before you can encode it into the text layer.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'],
    'region': ['Region 1', 'Region 1', 'Region 1', 'Region 2', 'Region 2', 'Region 2'],
    'value': [10, 15, 8, 12, 18, 6]
})

data['value_text'] = data['value'].apply(lambda x: f"{x} units")

base = alt.Chart(data).encode(
    alt.X('category:N'),
    alt.Y('value:Q')
).properties(
    width=200,
    height=150
)

bars = base.mark_bar()

text = base.mark_text(
    align='center',
    dy=-5
).encode(
    text='value_text:N'
)

chart = (bars + text).facet(
    facet=alt.Facet('region:N', columns=2)
)

chart
```

In this example, before we even touch Altair, we add a new column 'value_text' to our DataFrame using a lambda function. This function formats our raw value by adding " units" at the end.  In our chart, we then encode the `text` channel with the new 'value_text' column. This demonstrates how to use calculated values from data processing to drive custom labels.

**Example 3: Highlighting Maximums with Separate Text Annotations**

In some scenarios, you might want to not just display labels but also add specific annotations. Say you want to emphasize the largest value in each subchart by annotating it directly with special formatting. This requires a slightly more sophisticated approach.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'],
    'region': ['Region 1', 'Region 1', 'Region 1', 'Region 2', 'Region 2', 'Region 2'],
    'value': [10, 15, 8, 12, 18, 6]
})

base = alt.Chart(data).encode(
    alt.X('category:N'),
    alt.Y('value:Q')
).properties(
    width=200,
    height=150
)

bars = base.mark_bar()

max_values = data.groupby('region')['value'].transform(lambda x: x == x.max())
max_values_df = data[max_values].reset_index(drop=True)

text_highlight = alt.Chart(max_values_df).encode(
    alt.X('category:N'),
    alt.Y('value:Q'),
    text=alt.Text('value:Q', format='.0f'),
).mark_text(
    align='center',
    dy=-20,
    color='red',
    fontWeight='bold'
)


chart = (bars + text_highlight).facet(
    facet=alt.Facet('region:N', columns=2)
)


chart
```

Here, the process is slightly different. First we find, for each region, which value is the maximum and store the data related to these maximums into a new dataframe. Then, we construct a `text_highlight` chart that is encoded using the maximum values' dataframe and set the text color, font weight and vertical alignment to highlight the maximums. Finally we add it to the bar chart. This approach isolates maximums to be handled separately by the annotation layer, allowing for custom formatting.

These examples should give you a solid foundation for annotating repeated bar graphs in Altair. Remember, the key is to leverage Altair's layering and encoding capabilities to make the process automated and easy to maintain. It’s less about writing explicit instructions for each chart and more about setting up the data pipeline and encoding correctly.

For a more comprehensive understanding, I recommend exploring "Visualization Analysis and Design" by Tamara Munzner, which provides an excellent theoretical foundation for effective data visualization. Also, “Interactive Data Visualization for the Web” by Scott Murray, although focusing on D3.js, offers insights into advanced visualization techniques that can be applied to Altair. Finally, the official Altair documentation itself is invaluable; focusing especially on layered charts, data transformations, and the `repeat` function will boost your skills with this library. Good luck.
