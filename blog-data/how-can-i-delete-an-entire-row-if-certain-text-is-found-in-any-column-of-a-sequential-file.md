Alright, let's tackle this. I’ve encountered this situation numerous times, particularly when dealing with legacy systems that spit out text-based sequential files. Cleaning these files is often a necessary first step before any meaningful processing can happen. The core challenge here, as you've outlined, is efficiently identifying and removing rows based on the presence of specific text within *any* column of a given row. It's more involved than a simple line-by-line grep, because we're dealing with structured but not strictly formatted data. I recall a particularly frustrating incident years ago where I inherited a system that produced comma-separated value files, but the number of columns and the data within each column varied wildly. It was a mess, and this problem became very real very quickly.

The solution isn’t overly complex once you break it down. The basic approach is to read each row, split it into columns, check each column for the target text, and, if found, skip writing that row to the output. I find it effective to think of this process as a filter: you pass each row through, and only those that don't contain the unwanted text survive the process. The critical component is the text searching logic, which needs to be flexible enough to handle partial matches if required or deal with varying casing. Let’s explore some code examples to illustrate how I typically handle this, and then we can dive into some performance considerations.

**Python Example (Using `csv` module for structured data):**

This first example assumes your sequential file is formatted as a standard comma-separated value file, which is often the case. Python's built-in `csv` module is perfect for parsing these efficiently.

```python
import csv

def delete_rows_with_text_csv(input_file, output_file, target_text):
    with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as infile, \
            open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as outfile:
        reader = csv.reader(infile)
        writer = csv.writer(outfile)
        for row in reader:
            if not any(target_text in column for column in row):
                writer.writerow(row)

#Example usage:
input_csv = "input.csv"
output_csv = "output.csv"
text_to_find = "error"
delete_rows_with_text_csv(input_csv, output_csv, text_to_find)

```

In this example, we utilize the `csv.reader` to handle the parsing of comma-separated values. The core logic resides within the `any` function inside the loop. For each row, it iterates through every column, and the function returns `True` if the `target_text` is found in *any* of the columns (using a simple `in` operator for substring matching). If `any` returns `False` (meaning the `target_text` was not found in any column), then the `not` negates that to `True`, and that row is written to the output file using `csv.writer`.

**Python Example (Basic text file handling with any delimiter):**

Now, let's consider the scenario where your file might not be strictly a csv and has different delimiters, or even no clear delimiters. Here's a python approach using raw text manipulation:

```python
def delete_rows_with_text_plain(input_file, output_file, target_text, delimiter=None):
    with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as infile, \
            open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as outfile:
        for line in infile:
            if delimiter:
                columns = line.strip().split(delimiter)
                if not any(target_text in column for column in columns):
                     outfile.write(line)
            else:
                if target_text not in line:
                    outfile.write(line)

#Example usage
input_txt = "input.txt"
output_txt = "output.txt"
text_to_find_2 = "warning"
custom_delimiter = "|"
delete_rows_with_text_plain(input_txt, output_txt, text_to_find_2, custom_delimiter) #using a delimiter

delete_rows_with_text_plain(input_txt, output_txt, "invalid")  #without a delimiter

```

This version is more flexible, allowing for an optional delimiter argument. If a delimiter is provided, it splits the line into columns. If not, it treats the entire line as a single "column." This version also incorporates stripping whitespace (`line.strip()`) to prevent whitespace-only fields from interfering with matching. Both examples use utf-8 encoding for broader character support, a common issue when dealing with legacy systems.

**Bash Example (Using `awk` for text processing):**

Finally, for quick tasks or in environments where Python isn't readily available, `awk` in bash is a powerful tool. It performs this operation elegantly:

```bash
awk -v target="error" '
  {
    found=0;
    for(i=1; i<=NF; i++){
      if($i ~ target){
        found=1;
        break;
      }
    }
    if(!found){
      print $0;
    }
  }' input.txt > output.txt
```

Here, `awk` iterates through fields (columns) of each line (`$i` represents each column), checking if they match the target text (using the `~` operator for regex). If a match is found, the `found` flag is set to 1, and the inner loop breaks. Only rows where `found` remains 0 are printed to the output.  You can use `-F` option before `-v` to specify a custom delimiter. For example `awk -F"," -v target="error"` for comma separated files.

**Performance and Refinements**

Now, some important practical considerations. If your input files are extremely large, performance can become an issue. The Python examples, while readable, might not be optimal for very large files. In those instances, tools like `pandas` or even dedicated text processing libraries (like the `re` module if you need complex regular expression matching in Python) can offer faster and potentially more memory-efficient alternatives by leveraging vectorization.

* **Chunking:** For large files, consider processing the input in chunks instead of reading the entire file into memory. This would alleviate pressure on RAM.
* **Indexing:** If the files have some inherent structure, consider if you can index the data to avoid doing full scans for every query, although that's quite specific to other types of files than the sequential one described.
* **Regex:** If the text you are looking for can vary wildly (like different variations of an error message), using python's `re` module can help.
* **Parallel processing:** Using tools such as `dask` in python, one could process the files using multiple cores.

For further learning, I recommend:

*   **"Python Cookbook" by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones:** A deep dive into python, especially string handling and data processing, which can improve the performance of these scripts.
*   **"Effective awk Programming" by Arnold Robbins:** Provides a complete reference on awk that can greatly enhance your shell scripting skills.
*   **"Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho:** For anyone who want's to become better in python it contains a wealth of knowledge and efficient coding techniques.

In conclusion, while deleting rows based on text in columns can seem straightforward at first glance, it's essential to handle it with a flexible and efficient approach. The techniques and code examples I've provided here should provide a solid foundation for that. Remember to adapt the approach to your specific data format and performance requirements. It's all in the details, as they say.
