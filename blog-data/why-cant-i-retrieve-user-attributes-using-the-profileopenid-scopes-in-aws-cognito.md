, let's talk about why retrieving user attributes with just the `profile` or `openid` scopes in AWS Cognito often falls flat. I've seen this trip up a good number of folks, and it's usually not a matter of misconfigured settings, but rather a misunderstanding of how these scopes are intended to function within the context of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, which Cognito leverages.

First, let’s clarify something crucial: `profile` and `openid` scopes are not *directly* tied to the specific user attributes you define in your Cognito user pool, such as email, phone number, or custom fields. Instead, they primarily provide a standardized set of *claims* about the user’s identity within a token. The `openid` scope primarily signifies that you're requesting an OpenID Connect flow, which results in an `id_token`. This token includes basic identification claims such as the user's `sub` (subject identifier, which is a unique user id), `iss` (issuer), and `aud` (audience). The `profile` scope, while it might seem intuitively connected to user data, is specified in OpenID Connect to return a handful of *standard* user information claims that are widely accepted, like `name`, `given_name`, `family_name`, `picture`, etc.

Now, the key point here is that Cognito's implementation of these scopes adheres to these standardized specifications. So, you'll notice that you're not getting your custom attributes simply because these standard scopes don't include them. Cognito *can* include other information in the id token, but that is not driven simply by the presence of these scopes alone. It requires the explicit mapping of user attributes to id token claims.

In one particularly memorable project, I recall spending quite some time troubleshooting an application where the developers were under the impression that simply including the `profile` scope would give them access to the user's address and preferred language. They were baffled when they kept receiving an id token missing those details. It's a common mistake, and it underscores how easily assumptions can lead to dead ends.

So, how do you get the user attributes you actually need? You've got a few primary approaches, none of which rely on thinking of `profile` or `openid` as “attribute grabbers.”

**Option 1: Mapping User Pool Attributes to ID Token Claims**

This method directly addresses the problem. Within Cognito's user pool settings, you can configure a *mapping* between specific user attributes (including custom attributes) to standard or custom claims in the ID token. For example, you could map your custom "user_type" attribute to a claim named `custom:user_type`. This allows you to include this information in the token returned by Cognito when a user authenticates, in addition to those already supplied by `openid` and `profile`.

Here's how it roughly looks in code when you decode the ID token:

```python
import jwt
import json
# Assuming id_token is your retrieved id_token from Cognito
id_token = "your_id_token_here"
key =  # Your public key information can be obtained from cognito metadata endpoint
decoded_token = jwt.decode(id_token, key, algorithms=['RS256'], options={"verify_signature": False})

print(json.dumps(decoded_token, indent=4))

# Sample output:
# {
#    "sub": "uuid-user-identifier",
#    "aud": "your-client-id",
#    "iss": "https://cognito-idp.your-region.amazonaws.com/your-user-pool-id",
#    "custom:user_type": "admin",
#    "email": "test@example.com",
#    "name": "Test User"
#    ...
# }

```

Notice that the `custom:user_type` is included in the token, illustrating how you can map those fields to the id token claims via Cognito configurations. *Remember to handle the verification of signatures! In production the `verify_signature: False` should be removed, and a key material used.*
**Option 2: Using the Cognito User Pool API directly**

If you're aiming for the most comprehensive and up-to-date user profile, you might opt to fetch the user attributes directly from the Cognito API. This is particularly useful if you need to access information that's not suited for inclusion in tokens (e.g., large or complex datasets) or if you must guarantee you're seeing the latest profile, including updates since the user last authenticated. This approach requires using the AWS SDK and having the appropriate IAM permissions.

This code demonstrates the call to Cognito user pool.

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('cognito-idp', region_name='your-region')
user_pool_id = 'your-user-pool-id'
username = 'user-name-or-email' # User identification

try:
    response = client.admin_get_user(UserPoolId=user_pool_id, Username=username)
    attributes = response['UserAttributes']
    print(attributes)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Sample output (shortened):
#[
#    {'Name': 'sub', 'Value': 'uuid-user-identifier'},
#    {'Name': 'custom:user_type', 'Value': 'admin'},
#    {'Name': 'email_verified', 'Value': 'true'},
#    {'Name': 'email', 'Value': 'test@example.com'},
#    ...
# ]
```

Here, the user's attributes are directly retrieved from the user pool as configured in cognito.
**Option 3: Combining token claims and API calls**

A third, highly effective approach is to combine both the mapped claims in the token with calls to the Cognito API. This method can provide both performance and flexibility, depending on the scenario. You might use claims in the `id_token` to optimize the application flow by including the most commonly used attributes in the token. If more or updated information is necessary, then you would call the Cognito API.

```python
import jwt
import boto3
import json
# Assuming id_token is your retrieved id_token from Cognito
id_token = "your_id_token_here"
key =  # Your public key information can be obtained from cognito metadata endpoint
decoded_token = jwt.decode(id_token, key, algorithms=['RS256'], options={"verify_signature": False})


print("Claims from id_token:", json.dumps(decoded_token, indent=4))
# Sample output:
#  "Claims from id_token": {
#     "sub": "uuid-user-identifier",
#     "aud": "your-client-id",
#     "iss": "https://cognito-idp.your-region.amazonaws.com/your-user-pool-id",
#     "custom:user_type": "admin",
#      ...
#  }


client = boto3.client('cognito-idp', region_name='your-region')
user_pool_id = 'your-user-pool-id'
username = decoded_token.get("sub") # Obtain the user id from the token

try:
    response = client.admin_get_user(UserPoolId=user_pool_id, Username=username)
    attributes = response['UserAttributes']
    print("Attributes fetched via API", attributes)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
# Sample output (shortened):
# "Attributes fetched via API":
#[
#    {'Name': 'sub', 'Value': 'uuid-user-identifier'},
#    {'Name': 'custom:user_type', 'Value': 'admin'},
#    {'Name': 'email_verified', 'Value': 'true'},
#    {'Name': 'email', 'Value': 'test@example.com'},
#    ...
# ]

```

Here we are extracting the `sub` from the token and then requesting more attributes by utilizing the Cognito API.

In conclusion, expecting user attributes to be automatically included through `profile` or `openid` scopes in Cognito without specific mapping or direct API interaction is a misunderstanding of how those scopes are implemented. You need to choose the correct tool for the job. For further reading and understanding, the official Oauth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications are invaluable: RFC 6749 for OAuth 2.0 and the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification. Additionally, delving into the AWS Cognito documentation on user pool settings and APIs will significantly improve your handling of user attributes, avoiding the pitfalls of incorrectly assuming the `profile` or `openid` scope will magically grant access to your custom user data. And if you are working with applications utilizing tokens, familiarize yourself with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and their structure.
