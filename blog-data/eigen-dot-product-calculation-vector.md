 so you're asking about calculating the dot product involving eigenvectors right I've been there man more times than I care to remember trust me this isn’t some theoretical math problem it's bread and butter when you’re dealing with stuff like dimensionality reduction principal component analysis even some image processing routines where you're trying to find the dominant features yeah I’ve seen it all

Let’s break it down from a practical perspective the core of this question hinges on a fundamental misunderstanding or maybe just a slip up in how we're using these things. Eigenvectors by their definition are vectors that when a linear transformation is applied to them they only change by a scalar factor that's the eigenvalue. They don't rotate or shear they only scale. Now when we start talking about dot products well that’s a measure of how similar two vectors are or more accurately how much they project onto each other

So what's the catch here the gotcha usually happens when you are working with a matrix that has been derived from data that’s not already orthonormal when the eigenvectors are not orthonormal and then you do the dot product this can lead to some unexpected results the eigenvectors themselves even though they are each unique for each eigenvalue are not necessarily orthogonal to one another unless the matrix we are dealing with is a special type for example symmetric or hermitian in that case you are in luck otherwise you might have to make them orthonormal yourself but that is a separate question here we will focus on calculating the dot product.

The dot product is straightforward if you have two vectors *a* and *b* they are represented as two sequences of numbers lets say like this: *a* = [a1 a2 a3…an] and *b* = [b1 b2 b3…bn] it’s the sum of the multiplication of each element of vector *a* with the corresponding element of vector *b* so *a* dot *b* = a1*b1 + a2*b2 + a3*b3 … + an*bn this gives a single number a scalar that's the essence of it

Now lets talk code I am gonna give you three ways to do this with python and numpy cause its kind of the industry standard for that thing.

**Snippet 1: Simple numpy dot product**

```python
import numpy as np

# Define your eigenvectors as numpy arrays
eigenvector1 = np.array([0.8, 0.6])
eigenvector2 = np.array([-0.6, 0.8])

# Calculate the dot product
dot_product = np.dot(eigenvector1, eigenvector2)

print(f"Dot product: {dot_product}")  # This will be close to zero for orthogonal vectors
```

This is your basic example using np.dot(). Most of the time this is what you need but I've seen this cause some confusion for people not knowing what's going on under the hood. It uses the numpy implementation which is often optimized for speed. Here I assumed the eigenvectors are two dimensional vectors. You could do the same if it was more dimensional like 3D or 1000D for example it will just do what it’s supposed to do.

**Snippet 2: Manual dot product using a loop (for educational purposes only)**

```python
import numpy as np

def manual_dot_product(vec1, vec2):
    if len(vec1) != len(vec2):
        raise ValueError("Vectors must be of the same length")
    dot_product = 0
    for i in range(len(vec1)):
        dot_product += vec1[i] * vec2[i]
    return dot_product

eigenvector1 = np.array([0.707, 0.707])
eigenvector2 = np.array([-0.707, 0.707])

dot_product = manual_dot_product(eigenvector1, eigenvector2)
print(f"Dot product manual: {dot_product}")
```

This one shows you the math logic at the core of what np.dot() is doing its useful to understand and to explain to someone why it’s not just some random magic happening in the code it can also help to understand what’s happening under the hood when debugging a strange result so this is why i put it here. I would generally avoid using this for real applications though because numpy has way more optimized implementations available already.

**Snippet 3: Handling non orthogonal eigenvectors**

```python
import numpy as np

# Let's assume these are not orthonormal, this is the more real example.
eigenvector1 = np.array([1.0, 1.5])
eigenvector2 = np.array([2.0, 0.5])

# Calculate the dot product
dot_product = np.dot(eigenvector1, eigenvector2)

print(f"Dot product: {dot_product}") # Will not be zero
```

Here’s the case that always messes people up If your eigenvectors came from a random matrix and they are not orthonormal then the dot product is not necessarily zero. It may not have any particular meaning unless the eigenvectors represent something specific that you know beforehand.

Now a little bit of my experience with this: I was working on a project where we were trying to do some funky anomaly detection stuff on sensor data. we had this data matrix that was like 100 sensors with 5000 samples each and we were using eigenvalue decomposition to try and find if there was some weird stuff happening in the data the eigenstuff we got was not orthogonal due to noise and some other quirks in the sensors. I was expecting the dot products to be zero (because I had this nice idea from my linear algebra course) but they were not and that’s when I realized that the dot product only tells the relationship between two vectors it does not tell if they are from a special type of matrix unless you check it explicitly before calculating the dot product and then try to use the math assumptions that come from it. The data wasn't orthogonal and needed to be whitened before applying the eigen decomposition to get a true interpretation. So my assumption that the eigenvectors were automatically orthonormal was totally incorrect. I had to normalize the data first then things worked out as expected eventually. I learned a good lesson that day it’s like "never trust a vector without checking its orthogonality."

Also I did this mistake once in a machine learning project when I was using a support vector machine and I forgot to normalize the data before performing PCA and I got a huge mess because everything was scaled differently between features it was almost like a trainwreck but it made me learn that stuff very well because I spent like a week debugging it.

So here are the resources that I think are good for this kind of stuff not really online links but rather some books or more in-depth materials:

For a deep understanding of the math behind all of this I would recommend Gilbert Strang's "Linear Algebra and Its Applications" It’s a classic it explains everything in great detail and you can get the logic from there. There's also "Numerical Recipes" it’s a bit more practical and focuses more on implementing these algorithms but you need to be careful because it’s an old book written in fortran and c, but it has so many insights into the problems that you should have it in your library. Lastly “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning” by Christopher Bishop is another great source if you are trying to put this in the context of data analysis and stuff like that.

And that's it I think that covers most of it from my perspective. It's all about understanding the vector math that you are actually using and not just copy and pasting code from somewhere. Keep the vectors orthogonal unless you really know what you are doing and you'll be fine.
