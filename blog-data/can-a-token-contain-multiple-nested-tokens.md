Alright, let's tackle this. It's a question that sparks a few memories, actually. I once worked on a rather intricate authentication system, and the idea of nested tokens popped up during a design discussion. The team was trying to optimize access control across various microservices, and we spent a good bit of time evaluating if tokens-within-tokens could simplify things. The short answer, technically, is yes, it’s absolutely possible for a token to contain multiple, nested tokens. The longer, more nuanced answer, however, involves considerations of security, complexity, and practicality. Let’s unpack this a bit.

Fundamentally, a token is just a string of data adhering to a specific format, commonly encoded in json web tokens (jwt), but also possible in other forms such as opaque tokens or even custom-built token formats. The critical part is its interpretation, not the token’s raw content itself. When we talk about a 'nested' token, we're really discussing embedding one data structure that *itself* represents another token within a main token's payload. The nesting mechanism isn't inherent to the token structure itself; rather, it’s the way the data is arranged inside the token. In jwt, for instance, this usually manifests within the claims section of the payload.

Let's examine how we could technically do this using a jwt:

```python
import jwt
import time

# Define secret key and other parameters
SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key"  # Use a strong, random key in production
ALGORITHM = "HS256"

# Function to create a JWT token
def create_token(payload):
  encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
  return encoded_jwt

# Create an inner token
inner_token_payload = {
    "user_id": 123,
    "permissions": ["read_data"],
    "iat": time.time(),
    "exp": time.time() + 600 # Expires in 10 minutes
}
inner_token = create_token(inner_token_payload)


# Create an outer token that contains the inner token
outer_token_payload = {
    "auth_method": "external_auth",
    "inner_token": inner_token,
    "user_id": 456, # This user id is different than the inner token
    "iat": time.time(),
    "exp": time.time() + 3600 # Expires in 1 hour
}
outer_token = create_token(outer_token_payload)


print("Inner Token:", inner_token)
print("\nOuter Token:", outer_token)

# Function to verify and decode a token
def decode_token(token):
    try:
        decoded_payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        return decoded_payload
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        print("Error: Token has expired.")
        return None
    except jwt.InvalidSignatureError:
        print("Error: Token has invalid signature.")
        return None
    except jwt.exceptions.DecodeError:
        print("Error: Could not decode token.")
        return None

# Verify and decode the outer token
decoded_outer = decode_token(outer_token)
if decoded_outer:
    print("\nDecoded Outer Token:", decoded_outer)
    if "inner_token" in decoded_outer:
      decoded_inner = decode_token(decoded_outer['inner_token'])
      if decoded_inner:
         print("\nDecoded Inner Token:", decoded_inner)
      else:
          print("\nCould not decode nested inner token.")

```

In the example above, the outer token has a claim called `inner_token`, which itself holds a jwt token. The critical point here is that the `create_token` and `decode_token` functions handle the tokens independently. We’ve shown nested token creation and verification as an exercise. It would be possible to have multiple nested tokens, each validated independently.

However, while technically achievable, this pattern raises significant concerns. Each layer of token nesting introduces additional complexity in validation, error handling, and overall security management. It's essential to have a robust mechanism to track the validity of each nested token. For instance, if your outer token is valid for an hour but the inner one expires in 10 minutes, the system needs to understand and handle this correctly.

Now, let’s consider a more intricate scenario where the nesting implies differing levels of authorization using the same approach but with different use cases. Say, an organization employs one authentication layer for their internal network using `internal_auth` (outer token) and a separate application access token via an `application_auth` token (inner token).

```python
import jwt
import time

# Secret key and algorithm, ensure this is properly secured
SECRET_KEY_INTERNAL = "internal-network-secret"
SECRET_KEY_APPLICATION = "app-secret-key"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"

def create_token(payload, secret):
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(payload, secret, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt

def decode_token(token, secret):
    try:
        decoded_payload = jwt.decode(token, secret, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        return decoded_payload
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        print("Error: Token has expired.")
        return None
    except jwt.InvalidSignatureError:
        print("Error: Token has invalid signature.")
        return None
    except jwt.exceptions.DecodeError:
        print("Error: Could not decode token.")
        return None


# Create an application-specific token (inner)
app_token_payload = {
    "app_id": "my-application",
    "app_permissions": ["access_api"],
    "iat": time.time(),
    "exp": time.time() + 600
}
app_token = create_token(app_token_payload, SECRET_KEY_APPLICATION)


# Create an internal network token (outer) embedding the app token
internal_token_payload = {
    "user_id": "emp123",
    "network_role": "developer",
    "application_auth": app_token,
    "iat": time.time(),
    "exp": time.time() + 3600
}

internal_token = create_token(internal_token_payload, SECRET_KEY_INTERNAL)

print("Internal Token:", internal_token)
print("\nApplication Token:", app_token)


#Verify and decode tokens
decoded_internal = decode_token(internal_token, SECRET_KEY_INTERNAL)
if decoded_internal:
    print("\nDecoded Internal Token:", decoded_internal)
    if "application_auth" in decoded_internal:
      decoded_app = decode_token(decoded_internal['application_auth'], SECRET_KEY_APPLICATION)
      if decoded_app:
         print("\nDecoded Application Token:", decoded_app)
      else:
          print("\nCould not decode nested application token.")
```

In this example, the internal network token is created using one secret key and the inner application access token uses a completely different one. Thus, the security boundary for each token is clearly isolated. This can create a more fine-grained access control mechanism where certain access rights require validation of both the network token and the embedded application token, which requires a careful review of the implementation.

There are also performance overhead considerations. Decoding and verifying several nested tokens adds processing time, which might impact user experience. Furthermore, the increased size of the resulting token, due to the embedded strings, affects both network bandwidth and storage. One could mitigate the storage issue if nested tokens are opaque (for example, database ids referencing pre-created tokens instead of fully formed tokens) but this changes the nature of our nested token setup.

Here's one final example, showing how you might embed different kinds of tokens. Imagine we have a permission token, which is an opaque token, and that we embed that into a jwt.

```python
import jwt
import time
import uuid

# Secret key and algorithm
SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"


# Mock function for opaque token retrieval (imagine an actual database lookup here)
def generate_permission_token():
    # Generate a new id, representing a database id or some other identifier.
    return str(uuid.uuid4())

# Mock function to 'validate' the opaque token (imagine database lookup)
def validate_permission_token(token):
    # This should do a lookup
    # Example: check if the permission token is in a database of active tokens.
    # For this simple example we always return True
    return True



# Function to create a JWT token
def create_token(payload):
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt

# Create an opaque permission token
permission_token = generate_permission_token()

# Create a jwt, embedding the opaque token
outer_token_payload = {
    "user_id": "user789",
    "permissions_token": permission_token,  # Embedding the permission token
    "iat": time.time(),
    "exp": time.time() + 3600
}
outer_token = create_token(outer_token_payload)


print("Outer Token:", outer_token)
print("\nPermission Token:", permission_token)

# Function to verify and decode a token
def decode_token(token):
    try:
        decoded_payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        return decoded_payload
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        print("Error: Token has expired.")
        return None
    except jwt.InvalidSignatureError:
        print("Error: Token has invalid signature.")
        return None
    except jwt.exceptions.DecodeError:
        print("Error: Could not decode token.")
        return None

# Verify and decode the outer token
decoded_outer = decode_token(outer_token)

if decoded_outer:
  print("\nDecoded Outer Token:", decoded_outer)
  if "permissions_token" in decoded_outer:
    is_valid = validate_permission_token(decoded_outer['permissions_token'])
    if is_valid:
      print("\nPermission Token Validated")
    else:
      print("\nPermission token could not be validated")


```

In this final example, we have embedded an opaque token into the jwt. The validation flow is different here: instead of decoding, we must invoke an external service (in this case, simulated by the `validate_permission_token` function) to validate the opaque token.

In conclusion, while nesting tokens is technically feasible, it is crucial to weigh the added complexity against the benefits. Before adopting such an approach, carefully evaluate the security implications, performance costs, and overall maintainability. For a more in-depth study on token security and related patterns, I'd recommend “OAuth 2 in Action” by Justin Richer and Antonio Sanso and the various NIST publications related to cryptographic standards for token-based authentication systems such as *NIST Special Publication 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines*. These resources will provide a more complete overview for developing more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. It’s often the simpler solution that wins out, and for many cases, keeping things straightforward with well-defined tokens and authentication flows is a more appropriate approach.
