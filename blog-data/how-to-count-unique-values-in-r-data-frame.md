Okay so you're hitting the classic unique value count problem in R data frames yeah I've been there trust me its a rite of passage for any data wrangler who deals with R I mean its not like its rocket science but sometimes it feels like it right like when you first start wrestling with it haha

So I remember this one project back at my old gig it was all about analyzing website traffic data and we had these massive data frames full of user interactions think sessions page visits actions and all that good stuff and yeah we needed to get a grip on unique user counts for different pages for timeframes for categories you name it And we were using R because at that time we had some proprietary libraries that worked better there and moving to python was a pita We also had limited computational power so our R code had to be efficient so memory had to be considered we had no cloud infrastructure so everything was running on our old server

I'm telling you first attempts were clunky as hell like looping through each column checking for duplicates manually like I was going all old school manual labor data analysis that was not very nice at all and man talk about slow and resource heavy that stuff was a nightmare so then we had to learn from our mistakes and go more efficient

Now lets say you have your data frame something like

```R
df <- data.frame(
  Category = c("A", "B", "A", "C", "B", "A"),
  Value = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4),
  Location = c("US", "UK", "US", "CA", "UK", "US")
)
```

Okay so we want to count how many unique entries we have in columns right? The most straightforward way would be using the `unique()` function combined with the `length()` function. Its the go-to solution for many problems when dealing with unique values and counting them

Here's a basic snippet you can use

```R
count_unique <- function(data, column_name) {
  length(unique(data[[column_name]]))
}

# Example Usage
unique_category <- count_unique(df, "Category")
unique_value <- count_unique(df, "Value")
unique_location <- count_unique(df,"Location")


print(paste("Unique Category count:", unique_category))
print(paste("Unique Value count:", unique_value))
print(paste("Unique Location count:", unique_location))
```

This `count_unique` function takes your data frame and a column name and calculates the number of unique elements in that column. Simple easy no brainer stuff I know I am just showing you the basics here so you have it covered

Now let's say you want to count unique combinations across multiple columns. For example how many unique category-value combinations we have? For this we need to concatenate columns somehow and then do the unique count over the created column.
Again, I did this manually at first using paste but it's tedious and there is always a better way

Here is the code that should be better

```R
count_unique_combinations <- function(data, columns){
  if(length(columns) > 1){
    combined <- apply(data[,columns], 1, paste, collapse = "_")
    return(length(unique(combined)))
  } else {
    return(length(unique(data[[columns]])))
  }

}

# Example usage
unique_cat_value_combinations <- count_unique_combinations(df, c("Category", "Value"))
unique_cat_location_combinations <- count_unique_combinations(df, c("Category", "Location"))


print(paste("Unique Category Value combinations:", unique_cat_value_combinations))
print(paste("Unique Category Location combinations:", unique_cat_location_combinations))

```

What does this code do you ask? It takes two arguments, the dataframe and a vector of the column names of which you want to count unique combination or if you only provide one name it will simply count the unique values in it. It will concatenate column values using underscore as separator this is an important detail if you have data that contains this symbol you should use a less common separator

Now let's move onto a more refined approach using the `dplyr` package which if you are not familiar with you should because it's like a bread and butter tool for data manipulation in R I'm serious get it and learn it

This will feel much more expressive and its also way more efficient if your dataframes are large

```R
library(dplyr)

count_unique_dplyr <- function(data, columns){
  data %>%
    distinct(across(all_of(columns))) %>%
    nrow()
}

# Example usage with dplyr
unique_cat_value_combinations_dplyr <- count_unique_dplyr(df, c("Category", "Value"))
unique_location_dplyr <- count_unique_dplyr(df, "Location")

print(paste("Unique Category Value combinations using dplyr:", unique_cat_value_combinations_dplyr))
print(paste("Unique Location using dplyr:", unique_location_dplyr))

```

This function also takes a dataframe and a vector of column names. It then uses `distinct` which will reduce the data frame to the unique combinations of the chosen columns. Finally it just returns the number of rows using `nrow()`. Now this method is generally faster especially when you have big data frames because `dplyr` works under the hood with optimized C++ code for those operations. We also found this way more readable and easier to maintain in our team it made everyone happier even the backend guys who usually did not have to deal with R. And believe me it's better to have happy co-workers than to have to explain your crappy code on a friday afternoon.

Okay a bit of advice here you should consider which method is better for your case because sometimes you don't need to import the whole dplyr package and a simple length of unique will do. If your dataset is small a function will suffice, if its huge and you are dealing with large number of combinations then dplyr is your friend. It also depends what your data looks like but that's another subject for another day.

Okay now some resources if you want to get deeper into the weeds

For core R concepts and data manipulation I would strongly recommend "The R Book" by Michael J. Crawley it's like an R bible it covers almost everything you need to know for R fundamentals.

If you want to learn more about `dplyr` then I suggest "R for Data Science" by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. This book provides a comprehensive guide to using the `tidyverse` which includes `dplyr`.

And if you want to understand efficiency considerations in R then you should take a look at "Advanced R" also by Hadley Wickham. This one is less focused on general data manipulation but goes into the details of optimization and efficiency which can be quite important for large data sets.

These are not specific to unique counting problems but provide foundational knowledge that will help you with basically everything in R. So these books were very helpful for me during my previous jobs and are still helpful today I would say for any R user that wants to use the tool professionally. You should dig into it at some point.

So that's pretty much it I guess you should be good now to count your unique values in R data frames like a pro.
