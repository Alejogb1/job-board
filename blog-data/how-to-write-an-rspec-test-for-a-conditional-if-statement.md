Let's tackle this head-on, because I’ve certainly had my share of debugging conditional logic gone awry, especially in complex applications. Testing `if` statements properly in RSpec is fundamental to building robust, maintainable Ruby code. The trick isn't just about asserting that the code *runs*, but about validating that the different *paths* created by the conditions behave as intended. Over the years, I've found a few common pitfalls and best practices that I'd like to share, focusing on clarity and completeness.

Essentially, when we test a method containing an `if` statement, we need to ensure that we cover each branch of that conditional. In simple cases, it might seem obvious, but when dealing with nested conditions or complex boolean logic, meticulous testing becomes crucial. Ignoring any one path leads to hidden bugs and unpredictable behavior later on. Our goal is to achieve thorough code coverage and also make the tests themselves clearly communicate the expected behavior. I’ve had situations where subtle variations in input yielded drastically different, unexpected output, simply because tests didn’t explore all the possibilities. That's a lesson I don’t plan to repeat.

The first key aspect is identifying all possible conditions. Let's say we have this method:

```ruby
def process_order(order_total, is_premium_customer)
  if is_premium_customer && order_total > 100
    return "discount applied"
  elsif order_total > 50
    return "standard shipping"
  else
    return "regular processing"
  end
end
```

We've got three paths here: a premium customer with a large order, any customer with a mid-range order, and all other orders. Each of these conditions has to be specifically tested, and it’s not enough to test *one* of the `true` cases; we have to test *each* path. This isn’t just about hitting lines of code; it’s about verifying the logic behind each condition and its resulting behavior.

Here's how we’d approach writing those tests in RSpec:

```ruby
require 'rspec'

describe "Order processing" do
  let(:processor) { Class.new { def process_order(total, premium); if premium && total > 100 then "discount applied" elsif total > 50 then "standard shipping" else "regular processing" end end }.new }

  it "applies a discount for premium customers with orders over 100" do
    expect(processor.process_order(150, true)).to eq("discount applied")
  end

  it "applies standard shipping for orders over 50" do
     expect(processor.process_order(75, false)).to eq("standard shipping")
  end

  it "applies regular processing for orders 50 or less" do
     expect(processor.process_order(30, false)).to eq("regular processing")
  end
  it "applies regular processing for premium customer with orders 50 or less" do
    expect(processor.process_order(30, true)).to eq("regular processing")
  end
   it "applies standard shipping for premium customer orders over 50 and less than 100" do
    expect(processor.process_order(75, true)).to eq("standard shipping")
  end
end
```

Notice that we've covered not only each branch but also different scenarios within the boolean conditions. Specifically, we consider the edge case of a premium customer with an order less than 100, and a premium customer with a qualifying order for standard shipping but does not get a discount. This kind of comprehensive testing can be verbose, but it's crucial to preventing regressions later on.

The second key practice I adhere to is avoiding duplication within test scenarios themselves. If you find yourself repeating setup logic across multiple tests, consider using `let` or `before` blocks to refactor and make them more readable and maintainable. This can significantly reduce clutter and also reduce the chance of introducing errors into the testing suite itself. I remember a project where the test suite became so complex and repetitively configured that changes in the business logic broke the tests not because of errors in the production code, but because the tests were riddled with hardcoded assumptions. That taught me the value of well-structured, reusable test patterns.

Now let's consider a slightly more complex conditional using a method call to decide on a path:

```ruby
class User
  attr_reader :user_type

  def initialize(user_type)
    @user_type = user_type
  end

  def is_admin?
    @user_type == 'admin'
  end
end

def perform_action(user)
    if user.is_admin?
        return "admin action performed"
    else
        return "standard action performed"
    end
end
```

In this situation, we’re testing that an indirect condition based on the `user` object influences the execution path. Here's an RSpec test demonstrating that:

```ruby
require 'rspec'

describe 'User action handler' do

  let(:user_admin) { User.new('admin') }
  let(:user_standard) { User.new('standard') }
  let(:action_handler) { Class.new { def perform_action(user); if user.is_admin? then "admin action performed" else "standard action performed" end end }.new }

  it 'performs admin action when user is admin' do
    expect(action_handler.perform_action(user_admin)).to eq("admin action performed")
  end

  it 'performs standard action when user is not admin' do
     expect(action_handler.perform_action(user_standard)).to eq("standard action performed")
  end
end
```

Here, we test two distinct cases based on the `is_admin?` method. It’s key to recognize that although the `if` statement isn’t operating directly on a simple boolean variable, it's still crucial to test each possible outcome resulting from that method call. We're ensuring that both the `true` and `false` branches are adequately handled.

Lastly, let's address an example of nested conditionals. This tends to be the point where even meticulous developers can make mistakes or introduce edge case errors. Consider this method, which incorporates two levels of if statements.

```ruby
def determine_delivery_options(order_total, has_discount_coupon, is_weekend)
   if is_weekend
      if has_discount_coupon
         return "weekend discount delivery"
      else
         return "weekend regular delivery"
      end
   elsif order_total > 100
     return "free delivery"
   else
      return "standard delivery"
   end
end
```

Now the tests need to be even more specific to cover all possibilities:

```ruby
require 'rspec'

describe "Delivery Option Calculator" do
  let(:calculator) { Class.new { def determine_delivery_options(total, coupon, weekend); if weekend then if coupon then "weekend discount delivery" else "weekend regular delivery" end elsif total > 100 then "free delivery" else "standard delivery" end end }.new }
  it "offers weekend discount delivery if coupon is present and weekend" do
    expect(calculator.determine_delivery_options(50, true, true)).to eq("weekend discount delivery")
  end

  it "offers weekend regular delivery if coupon is absent but weekend" do
     expect(calculator.determine_delivery_options(50, false, true)).to eq("weekend regular delivery")
  end

  it "offers free delivery if order total is over 100 and not a weekend" do
    expect(calculator.determine_delivery_options(150, false, false)).to eq("free delivery")
  end
   it "offers standard delivery if order total is not over 100 and not a weekend" do
    expect(calculator.determine_delivery_options(50, false, false)).to eq("standard delivery")
  end
end
```

In this last example, we have four distinct execution paths to cover. This illustrates how testing becomes more complex and vital when dealing with nested conditional statements, but the logic remains the same: ensure each branch and each execution path is explicitly tested with proper inputs to obtain the expected output.

I would recommend "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler as a fundamental resource for understanding how to write cleaner, more testable code. "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" by Michael Feathers also provides practical advice on testing and refactoring code that might not have been designed with testability in mind, which can often be the reality in existing codebases. These resources, coupled with consistent application of these testing principles, will significantly improve the robustness and reliability of your code. And that's why I've found that spending time writing comprehensive tests not only catches bugs early but ultimately saves a significant amount of time and headache down the road.
