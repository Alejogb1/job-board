Alright, let's tackle this. I've bumped into this exact scenario more than once over the years, usually involving complex, multi-engine Rails applications. The short answer is: yes, RSpec within a Rails engine *can* access support system helpers defined in another engine, but it's not always straightforward and requires a clear understanding of Rails' load paths and how it handles testing environments. It's not automatically wired in, and there are nuances that can trip you up, particularly when dealing with helper methods intended for view rendering and their availability during testing.

The core issue revolves around how Rails loads and isolates the different parts of your application – main app and engines. Typically, each engine's test suite runs in a somewhat isolated context. The helper methods you're defining in one engine's `app/helpers` directory aren't magically made available in the RSpec context of *another* engine. They need to be explicitly included and made accessible. I've seen a lot of confusion stemming from this, especially with developers transitioning from monolithic Rails applications where everything was implicitly visible.

So, let's consider a concrete case. Imagine we have two engines: `Authentication` and `UserProfile`. The `Authentication` engine has a helper, `AuthenticationHelper`, with a method `current_user_name` defined within. The `UserProfile` engine's specs need to utilize this helper when testing certain user profile views rendered by the engine. Let me walk you through the process and show what can trip you up.

First, if we naively attempt to use `current_user_name` within a `UserProfile` engine spec, it will fail. The simplest way of making those helpers accessible in your test environment is by explicitly including them in your spec files. Here’s what the basic approach looks like:

```ruby
# spec/rails_helper.rb (in UserProfile engine)
require 'rails_helper'
require 'authentication/engine'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include Authentication::Engine.helpers
  # other RSpec configs here
end
```
This snippet uses `include Authentication::Engine.helpers`. This line looks into the `Authentication` engine and essentially pulls the helpers into the `UserProfile` test environment. Now `current_user_name` should be available in our specs, or so you’d think.

However, this approach only includes the module containing the helper, it does not necessarily add it to the view scope. If you're expecting to use these helpers directly in, for example, view specs, you'll find that you still get an error. This happens because view specs operate within a rendering context that needs access to those helpers through a different mechanism. Here's where we need to get a little more involved. We have to extend the test class with the helpers explicitly.

Here's a snippet that addresses this more explicitly within a view spec:

```ruby
# spec/views/user_profile/show_spec.rb (in UserProfile engine)
require 'rails_helper'
require 'authentication/engine'

RSpec.describe 'user_profile/show', type: :view do
  before do
      extend Authentication::Engine.helpers
      assign(:user, User.new(name: 'Test User'))
  end

  it 'displays the current user' do
      render
      expect(rendered).to include current_user_name
  end
end
```
The key part here is `extend Authentication::Engine.helpers` within the `before` block. By using `extend`, the view spec is given direct access to the methods defined in the `AuthenticationHelper`, specifically now being available to our `rendered` output.

However, there's another potential pitfall. What if, the helper in the `Authentication` engine also relies on methods available in that engine's application controller? It's not uncommon for a helper to need access to things like `current_user` which may be set as a method in the parent controller of the engine. To correctly access methods defined in the `Authentication` engine's controllers (or base controllers), we might need to perform a few more steps. The ideal solution is to include the engine's controller's helpers as well. This can be done within `rails_helper` or individually per spec file. Here’s an example on how to include the helpers from controller using `helper`.

```ruby
# spec/rails_helper.rb (in UserProfile engine)
require 'rails_helper'
require 'authentication/engine'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include Authentication::Engine.helpers
  config.include Authentication::Engine.routes.url_helpers
  config.include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers
  config.include ActionView::Helpers

  # Example: including controller helper for a spec, note, requires a valid request object
  config.before(:each, type: :view) do
    # You may want to mock out the controller when necessary
    @request = ActionDispatch::TestRequest.create()
    config.include Authentication::Engine.controllers::ApplicationController.helpers
    
  end
  # other RSpec configs here
end
```
This modified `rails_helper.rb` includes several things needed when working with engines and helpers within test contexts. You will notice that it includes url helpers for both the engine and the application. This way we have access to url helpers for test request objects.

The key here is that you explicitly include the engine's controller's helpers within `config.before`. You would often need to create a valid request object first before attempting to include the helpers. Keep in mind that this example is somewhat basic, and you might need to mock certain methods or objects (like `@current_user`) used by the helper to make it work properly within the test context, depending on the actual complexity of your setup.

The above examples illustrate a few common approaches when dealing with helpers across different Rails engines in a test context. These are not the only approaches but are generally the most common. There is no single solution because it depends on the level of isolation needed between the engines and how they are designed to interact.

For further reading and understanding, I'd recommend looking into the following resources:

*   **“The Rails 6 Way” by Obie Fernandez**: This book provides detailed information on the internals of Rails, including its engines and loading mechanisms. It's essential for going beyond the surface and grasping the architecture of a complex Rails application.
*   **The official Rails Guides**: Specifically, the sections on "Engines" and "Testing Rails Applications". These are always a great place to start, and have improved over the years.
*   **"Crafting Rails Applications" by José Valim**: While slightly older, this book offers a wealth of knowledge regarding the design and architecture of Rails applications and its engines. It explains how Rails internals work, which would certainly aid in fully grasping the nuances of helper method access during tests.

Remember, the key here is to understand the scope within which tests are executed, and the flow of how Rails loads different pieces of your application. Explicit inclusion of helper modules is crucial for these scenarios. It can feel a bit tedious at times, especially with a lot of dependencies between engines, but consistent application of these techniques will avoid unexpected test failures and make for a smoother development experience.
