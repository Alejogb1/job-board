Alright, let's dissect this Django `FileField` and custom storage quandary, shall we? It's a situation I’ve encountered more times than I care to recall, usually late on a Friday. You've meticulously crafted your custom storage backend, believing you've decoupled from Google Cloud Storage (GCS), only to find the files stubbornly persisting there. I’ve even seen cases where it partially works, leading to even more confusion. This often boils down to a few common culprits, and we can walk through them systematically.

The core issue usually revolves around how Django's settings, the model definitions, and custom storage classes interact. My experience suggests the problem isn't typically with GCS itself, or necessarily with how your custom storage *should* work, but rather with how Django interprets your setup. We need to ensure everything is talking the same language, if you will. Let's consider the usual suspects, starting with the most likely.

**1. The `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` Setting and Context:**

Django uses the `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` setting in your `settings.py` file to determine which storage backend to use *by default*. If this is still pointing to `django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage` (the default) or any other storage backend referencing GCS (directly or indirectly, even via another custom backend), your `FileField` might be inadvertently using that instead of your intended custom storage, especially when no storage argument is passed to it. To illustrate, imagine you have this in your `settings.py`:

```python
# settings.py
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage'

# You intend your custom storage to be 'myproject.custom_storage.MyCustomStorage'
```

And then, in your `models.py` you define your `FileField` like this:

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    my_file = models.FileField(upload_to='my_files')  # No storage argument
```

Despite having a perfectly valid custom storage class elsewhere, `my_file` will default to Google Cloud Storage. Why? Because `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` dictates the global default and we haven't provided a specific storage for that field.

**Solution:** Be explicit. You have two choices: Either modify `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` to point to your custom storage *if you want it to be the system-wide default*, or provide a `storage` argument *directly* to the `FileField` if you want to have it on a per-field or per-model basis.

Here's how to correct the above, explicitly:

```python
# models.py

from django.db import models
from myproject.custom_storage import MyCustomStorage

class MyModel(models.Model):
    my_file = models.FileField(upload_to='my_files', storage=MyCustomStorage())
```

By including `storage=MyCustomStorage()`, we are explicitly telling Django to use our custom backend when working with this field, regardless of what `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` is set to. This is the safer and more flexible approach for custom storage needs, in my opinion.

**2. Incomplete Custom Storage Class Implementation:**

Sometimes the issue lies within your custom storage class itself. It might appear complete but might lack some critical methods. The Django storage interface defines a set of essential methods that your class should implement, such as `_open`, `_save`, `delete`, `exists`, `listdir`, `size`, `url`, `get_accessed_time`, `get_created_time`, `get_modified_time`. If these are not implemented or incorrectly implemented in your custom storage, Django might fall back to the default, or cause other unexpected errors that seem related.

For example, if you're not overriding the `_save` method in your custom storage, it might be using the base class version, which could unintentionally involve GCS, depending on which storage it inherits. A basic custom storage class may look like this:

```python
# myproject/custom_storage.py
from django.core.files.storage import Storage
import os

class MyCustomStorage(Storage):

    def __init__(self, location='/tmp/'):
        self.location = location

    def _open(self, name, mode='rb'):
        return open(os.path.join(self.location, name), mode)

    def _save(self, name, content):
        full_path = os.path.join(self.location, name)
        with open(full_path, 'wb') as destination:
            for chunk in content.chunks():
                destination.write(chunk)
        return name

    def delete(self, name):
        os.remove(os.path.join(self.location, name))

    def exists(self, name):
        return os.path.exists(os.path.join(self.location, name))

    def listdir(self, path):
        return os.listdir(os.path.join(self.location, path))

    def size(self, name):
        return os.path.getsize(os.path.join(self.location, name))

    def url(self, name):
       return f"http://my-local-server/media/{name}" # adjust as needed for URL generation

    def get_accessed_time(self, name):
        return os.path.getatime(os.path.join(self.location, name))

    def get_created_time(self, name):
        return os.path.getctime(os.path.join(self.location, name))

    def get_modified_time(self, name):
         return os.path.getmtime(os.path.join(self.location, name))

```

Notice the explicit file saving and file handling, as well as the use of local filesystem operations (e.g., `os.path.join`). This ensures we're avoiding any accidental cloud storage operations, provided the `location` is local. If any essential method like `_save`, or `url` aren't there, you would experience unexpected storage behaviors.

**Solution:** Verify all required methods are implemented. Refer to the official Django documentation and consider checking out the source code of `django.core.files.storage.Storage`, and subclasses like `FileSystemStorage` to see how they implement these methods. Pay close attention to the `_save`, `_open`, `exists`, `delete` and `url` methods for correctness, as that's where most of the storage logic resides.

**3. Incorrect Initialization or Configuration of Custom Storage:**

This problem is subtler. It can happen if, inside your custom storage `__init__` method or other related methods you're accidentally instantiating a GCS connection or performing some operation that invokes GCS. You may not realize that some of your custom class logic is still using GCS related settings or default storage mechanisms even while attempting custom storage, possibly through inheritance. It’s easily overlooked and a classic "gotcha".

Imagine you have this structure:

```python
# myproject/custom_storage.py

from django.core.files.storage import Storage
from storages.backends.gcloud import GoogleCloudStorage

class MyCustomStorage(Storage):

    def __init__(self, location='/tmp/'):
      self.location = location
      self.gcs_storage = GoogleCloudStorage() # Uh Oh, here's the problem!

     # ... other methods (using self.gcs_storage)

```

Even if your storage class intends to use the local file system, instantiating a `GoogleCloudStorage` class in the `__init__` and then using it in other methods will create GCS dependencies when that class is instantiated.

**Solution:** Review your custom class carefully. Ensure you’re only doing what you intend to do within your methods and that you're not inadvertently using GCS specific calls or resources. Remove any GCS instantiation from the custom class and instead focus solely on the specific file or object location where you intend to store the file.

For reference and further technical depth, I suggest exploring the following:
* The *Django documentation on file storage* is, of course, indispensable. Pay special attention to the parts about custom storage backends, storage classes and the interface they define.
* *'Two Scoops of Django 3' by Audrey Roy Greenfeld and Daniel Roy Greenfeld* gives excellent insights on practical Django development, with good discussions on storage patterns.
* The *source code for `django.core.files.storage.Storage`*, and `FileSystemStorage` itself, within Django’s codebase. This provides direct access to understand how these basic classes operate, which will help you write effective custom storage classes.

Remember, debugging storage problems often requires stepping through your code and watching precisely how files are handled by both Django and your custom storage class. In my experience, these three issues are the primary causes for this specific problem. Double-check your settings, verify your custom storage implementation thoroughly, and you should be able to fix your file storage issues. Good luck!
