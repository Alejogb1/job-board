Let’s tackle this one; I've seen this specific scenario play out more times than I care to recall, and it always boils down to subtle differences in the execution environment between manual and scheduled runs. It’s rarely a problem with the core notebook logic itself; rather, it's almost always an environmental mismatch that trips up the scheduled job.

From my experience, dealing with distributed systems and cloud platforms like Google Cloud's Vertex AI, I've learned that seemingly identical contexts can hide significant discrepancies. When you execute a notebook manually, you're generally doing so within an interactive session. This often means you’re operating within a pre-existing, cached environment. In contrast, scheduled executions typically spin up a fresh instance, often without the same pre-configured state, meaning we're dealing with a cold start every time. That's the crux of the issue.

The first, and most frequent, culprit is **dependency management**. A notebook may rely on specific versions of python libraries or even custom code modules that are installed or present in your interactive session, but not explicitly defined or present within the scheduled environment. Think of it as needing certain tools laid out in your personal workspace that aren't automatically included in the toolbox for a new team member.

To illustrate, let’s consider a simple case where your notebook uses a specific version of the `pandas` library, and perhaps a utility function from a custom module. Here's how this issue might manifest, and how I'd typically address it:

```python
# notebook_code.ipynb (excerpt)
import pandas as pd
from my_utils import my_data_function

def main():
    df = pd.DataFrame({'a':[1,2,3], 'b':[4,5,6]})
    processed_df = my_data_function(df)
    print(processed_df.head())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

If `my_utils.py` and the specific `pandas` version are not explicitly defined in the scheduled environment’s requirements, the scheduled notebook will fail with either a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `my_utils` or a `ValueError` if the pandas version doesn’t behave as expected.

Here's how you’d resolve it; you must specify all the necessary dependencies within your notebook's configuration.

```python
# requirements.txt

pandas==1.5.0  # or whatever version your code needs
```
And ensure `my_utils.py` is either located within the same working directory or packaged and installed as a custom library. Vertex AI scheduled notebooks can take advantage of requirements.txt, alongside other dependency management tools like pip. You'd typically configure this within the notebook's schedule settings.

The second prevalent issue involves **authentication and authorization**. When you execute a notebook manually, you're typically authenticated using your own user credentials. Scheduled notebooks, however, run under a service account or a managed identity. This means that the permissions assigned to this service account directly influence the notebook's ability to access Google Cloud services or other external resources.

Consider a scenario where your notebook needs to access a Cloud Storage bucket. If the service account associated with your scheduled notebook does not have sufficient permissions to read or write to this bucket, your notebook will fail.

```python
# notebook_code.ipynb (excerpt)
from google.cloud import storage

def download_data():
    client = storage.Client()
    bucket = client.get_bucket('my-data-bucket')
    blob = bucket.blob('my_data.csv')
    blob.download_to_filename('/tmp/my_data.csv')
    print("Data downloaded successfully")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  download_data()
```

If the service account lacks `storage.objectViewer` or `storage.objectAdmin` permissions on 'my-data-bucket', this code will fail. To rectify this, you'll need to navigate to the IAM & Admin section of your Google Cloud project and grant the appropriate permissions to the service account you're using for the scheduled notebook execution. A common error is to assume the manual login provides implicit permission; this is not the case. Explicit grants on the service account are essential.

The third, often-overlooked factor is **environment variables and configuration**. Your interactive environment might have environment variables, configuration files, or other settings defined that your notebook depends on, but these variables aren't automatically available in a scheduled run. Things like API keys, specific paths, or configurations are likely different or absent entirely. This leads to the notebook behaving unexpectedly.

Let’s say your notebook relies on an environment variable specifying an output directory:

```python
# notebook_code.ipynb (excerpt)
import os

def save_results(data):
    output_dir = os.environ.get('OUTPUT_DIR')
    if not output_dir:
        raise ValueError("Environment variable OUTPUT_DIR not set.")
    filename = os.path.join(output_dir, 'output.txt')
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(data))
    print(f"Results saved to: {filename}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = {"processed": [10, 20, 30]}
    save_results(data)
```

If the `OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable isn’t explicitly defined when the scheduled notebook runs, the notebook will fail with a `ValueError`. There are two approaches to remedy this: either pass the variable to the scheduled job in the schedule configurations, or write logic in your notebook to define a default path or read from a dedicated configuration file. For sensitive information, I prefer Google Cloud Secret Manager for storing keys and other secrets, referencing them via the API, instead of relying on hard-coded variables.

To truly troubleshoot these issues, I would recommend employing detailed logging within your notebook. Capture relevant information at various stages of execution, including: dependency version information, status of network calls, resource allocations, and environment variables. Also remember to review the logs of the scheduled jobs in Vertex AI's execution logs for detailed error reports.

Beyond these immediate fixes, I often consult specific resources. For detailed information on dependency management and packaging in Python, look at the documentation from PyPA (Python Packaging Authority). Specifically, I recommend referring to "The Hitchhiker's Guide to Packaging," a thorough resource for creating and managing Python projects. For authentication and authorization specifics within Google Cloud, the official Google Cloud documentation for IAM and service accounts is indispensable. In particular, the "Understanding service accounts" and "Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources" sections are particularly useful. Finally, for configuring environments, I would always refer to the specific documentation for Vertex AI Scheduled Notebooks, found on the Google Cloud website. You will find detailed insights on passing environment variables and other job-specific settings there.

In summary, the common disconnect between manual and scheduled notebook execution stems from environmental discrepancies, mostly around dependencies, access controls, and configurations. Thoroughly debugging these areas, along with careful configuration, is the key to making those scheduled jobs run reliably. This is always a learning experience, so careful planning is essential.
