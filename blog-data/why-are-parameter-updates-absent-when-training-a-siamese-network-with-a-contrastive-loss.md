Let's tackle this one. It's a common head-scratcher for those diving into the world of Siamese networks, particularly with contrastive loss. I remember a project back in 2017 involving image similarity for a medical imaging application; we ran into the very issue of parameters not updating as expected, and it took a bit of debugging to get to the root cause. Essentially, the issue isn't that updates are *absent* in a strict sense; they are, instead, likely failing to propagate effectively due to several reasons related to how the contrastive loss and backpropagation interact within a Siamese architecture.

The core of a Siamese network consists of two (or more) identical subnetworks sharing parameters, each taking a separate input. These outputs are then compared using a distance metric, which, in turn, informs the contrastive loss. This loss function aims to minimize the distance between embeddings of similar inputs (positive pairs) and maximize the distance between embeddings of dissimilar inputs (negative pairs).

Now, let’s break down why the parameters may appear not to update. One key factor is the selection of the contrastive loss itself. While it aims to achieve separation, it's dependent on a margin hyperparameter. This margin defines the minimum desired distance between embeddings of dissimilar pairs. If the initial embeddings are already quite far apart, or if this margin is improperly set or not reached, the gradient signal pushing negative pairs further apart becomes negligible. Consequently, the weight updates can become very small, leading to what *appears* to be a lack of updates. This is because the loss function isn't "pushing" the model enough, particularly in cases where the negative pairs are already well separated in the initial embedding space, sometimes randomly.

Another crucial area to examine is the implementation of backpropagation. Due to the shared nature of the networks in a siamese architecture, care must be taken to properly handle gradient accumulation and updates across the two networks. An error during this phase, such as incorrect gradient calculation or accumulation, or issues with how the network's computational graph was established, can lead to either no updates or unstable, non-convergent updates. For example, using the same set of variables without properly creating new graph operations for the second branch will definitely break backpropagation in these contexts, even though it would work in a more conventional single network setting.

Furthermore, the specific implementation of the contrastive loss also impacts the flow of gradients. Different versions, such as the hinge-based contrastive loss, or versions with exponential terms, behave differently and can lead to stagnation if the margin and other parameters are not correctly calibrated with the dataset characteristics and network complexity.

To make this more concrete, I’ll provide examples. Note that the core network structure here is simplified to focus on the issues and isn’t necessarily the most robust implementation:

**Example 1: A Basic Contrastive Loss Implementation Issue (Python and PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class EmbeddingNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embedding_size=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, embedding_size) #simplified representation

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

class ContrastiveLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, margin=1.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.margin = margin

    def forward(self, output1, output2, label):
        distance = (output1 - output2).pow(2).sum(1).sqrt()
        loss = (label) * distance.pow(2) + \
               (1 - label) * torch.clamp(self.margin - distance, min=0.0).pow(2)
        return loss.mean()

#Simplified usage
embedding_size = 2
net = EmbeddingNetwork(embedding_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = ContrastiveLoss(margin=1.0)

#Simulated data
input1 = torch.randn(100, 10)
input2 = torch.randn(100, 10)
labels = torch.randint(0,2,(100,)).float() #0 for dissimilar, 1 for similar

epochs = 200
for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output1 = net(input1)
    output2 = net(input2)
    loss = criterion(output1, output2, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

In this first case, the loss and the parameter updates may *appear* normal. However, a subtly off margin, such as a value of 0.01 instead of 1, can cause the network to converge to very small embeddings, where all inputs are mapped near the origin, rather than being separated as it was designed. If you were using this and only tracking loss without looking at specific outputs, you'd miss this critical point.

**Example 2: Improper Shared Parameter Handling (Python and PyTorch)**

This highlights a common error where the shared parameters are not handled correctly during forward propagation, creating a situation where backpropagation fails to effectively update parameters. This can be a difficult issue to spot if you are not familiar with how computational graphs are constructed.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class EmbeddingNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embedding_size=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, embedding_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

class ContrastiveLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, margin=1.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.margin = margin

    def forward(self, output1, output2, label):
        distance = (output1 - output2).pow(2).sum(1).sqrt()
        loss = (label) * distance.pow(2) + \
               (1 - label) * torch.clamp(self.margin - distance, min=0.0).pow(2)
        return loss.mean()


#Simplified usage, with the shared network implemented manually
embedding_size = 2
net = EmbeddingNetwork(embedding_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = ContrastiveLoss(margin=1.0)

#Simulated data
input1 = torch.randn(100, 10)
input2 = torch.randn(100, 10)
labels = torch.randint(0,2,(100,)).float()

epochs = 200

for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output1 = net.forward(input1)
    # The following is a common error: re-using the same forward object without creating
    # new graph operation for backward pass, as a result, gradients might not work as
    # expected.
    output2 = net.forward(input2)
    loss = criterion(output1, output2, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

In this case, the forward pass reuses the same operations graph. PyTorch does not know they are different branches. This implementation won't result in the weights updating correctly.

**Example 3: A Correct Example with Separate Forward Calls (Python and PyTorch)**

This example fixes the above issue, showing the intended way of handling the networks:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class EmbeddingNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embedding_size=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, embedding_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)


class ContrastiveLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, margin=1.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.margin = margin

    def forward(self, output1, output2, label):
        distance = (output1 - output2).pow(2).sum(1).sqrt()
        loss = (label) * distance.pow(2) + \
               (1 - label) * torch.clamp(self.margin - distance, min=0.0).pow(2)
        return loss.mean()


#Correct usage, with the shared network implemented manually
embedding_size = 2
net = EmbeddingNetwork(embedding_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = ContrastiveLoss(margin=1.0)

#Simulated data
input1 = torch.randn(100, 10)
input2 = torch.randn(100, 10)
labels = torch.randint(0,2,(100,)).float()

epochs = 200

for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output1 = net(input1)
    output2 = net(input2) # Correct: separate forward calls
    loss = criterion(output1, output2, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Notice the key difference in Example 3: each branch of the network performs a new call to the `forward()` method. This approach ensures the creation of the proper computational graph for backpropagation.

To delve deeper, I'd strongly recommend checking out “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville for the theoretical underpinnings of backpropagation, gradients, and loss functions. For a more hands-on approach focusing on siamese networks specifically, papers on distance metric learning and triplet loss often provide very insightful discussions and can fill in gaps. Furthermore, the original contrastive loss paper (typically attributed to Hadsell et al., circa 2006, which you can find easily via a search) is a foundational resource. Finally, be sure to explore various deep learning framework documentation, including PyTorch's excellent material, which can also clarify how shared parameters are to be managed in such complex topologies.

In summary, “missing” parameter updates aren't typically because the network has somehow disabled them. Instead, it usually boils down to issues with the initial conditions, the loss function configuration, proper gradient calculation, or correct implementation of backpropagation in a context of shared weights. By methodically debugging and understanding these dynamics, it's often possible to get a siamese network to train effectively.
