Okay, let's tackle this. It's a fairly common head-scratcher, and I’ve definitely seen my share of these exact scenarios back when I was managing infrastructure for a platform that heavily utilized google app engine. The core of the issue lies in a misunderstanding of how google app engine's custom domain configuration interacts with ssl certificate provisioning and, of course, the vital role dns plays. It's not always immediately obvious because everything *seems* configured correctly on the gcp side, but the problem often lives in the space between those settings and the actual dns records.

The crux of it is that obtaining an ssl certificate for your custom domain on gae usually involves two key steps: adding the domain to your app engine project, and then letting google's systems automatically handle the certificate acquisition and renewal. This process relies heavily on the fact that google needs to verify that *you* own the domain, and this verification occurs through correctly configured dns records. If these records aren’t correct or don't propagate correctly, google simply cannot confirm your ownership, and subsequently, it cannot provision an ssl certificate. You’ll then find yourself in a situation where everything appears to work fine with the default appspot domain, but your custom domain displays an insecure connection due to the missing certificate.

The first, and perhaps most prevalent, reason for missing dns records is simply incorrect dns configuration at your domain registrar. Let’s imagine a scenario where we’re trying to map `www.mycustomdomain.com` to our app engine application. Typically, this will involve a combination of `a` and/or `aaaa` records (for ipv4 and ipv6 respectively) that point to google’s load balancers. Now, these load balancers are not fixed ip addresses; they can change. Google uses a system where you typically get a `cname` record that points to google's own internal domain (like `ghs.googlehosted.com`), and then it uses its internal routing to direct traffic to your application. If you manually put in your own ip addresses directly into the dns config, especially if you copy them from an old tutorial, you are likely to break things quite spectacularly. You'll notice the custom domain working, but failing when it comes to the ssl certificate because google needs the correct delegation to its domain for the automated certificate issuance to function correctly. Let's look at a snippet demonstrating what your dns configuration *shouldn't* look like, followed by what it *should* look like in terms of what google gives you to enter.

```
# Incorrect: Manually added IP addresses
; A Record for www.mycustomdomain.com
www.mycustomdomain.com.  IN A 203.0.113.123
www.mycustomdomain.com.  IN AAAA 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

# The correct way involves using a CNAME record as provided by Google:
; CNAME Record for www.mycustomdomain.com
www.mycustomdomain.com.  IN CNAME ghs.googlehosted.com.

; Example of an A record for the bare domain (mycustomdomain.com), which redirects to www.mycustomdomain.com (optional)
mycustomdomain.com. IN A 172.217.160.238
mycustomdomain.com. IN AAAA 2607:f8b0:4009:812::200e
```

In this case, the incorrect configuration will still make the domain accessible for http requests, but ssl won't be available as the certificate validation will fail. It's critical to use the `cname` provided by gcp.

The second common culprit is propagation delay. Even if you've entered the correct records, it can take some time for dns changes to propagate across the global network. This propagation time can vary depending on your registrar and the ttl (time-to-live) settings for your dns records. If you're testing this immediately after making the change, you might assume that your dns setup is faulty, when actually it's just waiting for the change to propagate to all dns servers globally. There are online tools that allow you to check the propagation status of your dns settings, which can be very useful for diagnosing this particular type of problem. This process could be anything from a few minutes to several hours.

Let's say you've checked that the correct records have been propagated, using one of these online tools, and you are still facing the ssl issue. In this case, the problem might stem from the fact that you are using a non-standard dns setup, such as using a dns provider that does not correctly support the `cname` flattening or might have an inconsistent implementation. Another possibility that I encountered in the past was that a particularly complicated network configuration was interfering with google's verification process. If you're using dns security extensions (dnssec), for example, make sure everything is correctly configured, or it may interfere with google's certificate process, sometimes by adding records to your dns that you are not directly aware of. If these are malformed in some way, it can also lead to the verification failure. This is less common but definitely a possibility. For instance, let’s take an example where you’re working with multiple subdomains and one or two are not following a specific convention that google requires.

```
# Example of a subdomain that will work properly
sub1.mycustomdomain.com. IN CNAME ghs.googlehosted.com.

# Incorrect example where the cname record is for the root domain, rather than ghs.googlehosted.com
sub2.mycustomdomain.com. IN CNAME mycustomdomain.com.
```

The above would cause the verification and thus certificate issuance for the subdomain sub2 to fail. This emphasizes the need to follow google’s instructions for each domain and subdomain you are trying to map.

Finally, there is a possibility that the problem is on google's side, although it's less common. In these cases, a deeper look into google's service status page might help identify an ongoing issue. Checking the error logs associated with your app engine project can also provide some clues. Generally, if the issue is widespread, gcp will acknowledge that there is a problem. While this might sound frustrating, it’s part of the complexity of cloud-based infrastructure management. So, if you have checked everything on your end, a good starting point is to check the logs, the status page, and try to get some insight if other people are reporting the issue as well.

Let’s solidify this with a final example of a command you might run to verify your records, using the `dig` command in a terminal. This command will show you what the dns records are for your specified domain, allowing you to confirm if they have propagated correctly.

```bash
dig www.mycustomdomain.com cname

; <<>> DiG 9.18.19 <<>> www.mycustomdomain.com cname
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 20155
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;www.mycustomdomain.com.		IN	CNAME

;; WHEN: Sat Dec 16 14:54:28 PST 2023
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 84
```

This specific command will return the cname record, if it is present, for the specified domain. Notice that in this example we are getting a positive response and the `cname` record is correctly pointed to `ghs.googlehosted.com.` if, for example, we were to put the incorrect record in, you might see the output indicate that `www.mycustomdomain.com` is directly pointing to an ip address instead, for example, or it might indicate that no records were found.

In summary, the absence of ssl certificates for your custom domains on gae can typically be attributed to incorrect dns configurations, propagation delays, or potentially issues with more complex setups such as dnssec. Verifying the correct records provided by google’s interface and ensuring their correct propagation are the primary steps in resolving this. As for resources, I'd recommend taking a look at the "dns and bind" book by paul albitz, and also "tcp/ip illustrated vol 1" by w. richard stevens for a deeper understanding of the underlying network protocols. These classics are still incredibly relevant today, and will provide more insights than a general tutorial ever could. Google's own documentation is also excellent but these books offer a fundamental understanding. Checking online tools for dns propagation status and google's service status pages will also be helpful. Remember, patience and methodical troubleshooting are key in situations like these.
