Alright, let's tackle this. I've bumped into this scenario a fair few times, especially when dealing with datasets that have a lot of redundant or outlying information. It’s a common preprocessing step, and there are a couple of robust approaches that typically work well. The key is to understand the nuances of the data and choose the method that best suits your performance requirements and data characteristics.

The core challenge here is that we’re not simply filtering based on a static condition, but rather based on the *minimum value within a column*, and then removing the *entire row(s)* that contain that minimum. This means a straightforward filter won't cut it. You need to first identify the minimum and then use that information to select the rows you *want* to keep.

Let's illustrate with a few different approaches using python’s pandas, because that's what most people use for data manipulation tasks like this, and it's generally very efficient.

First, suppose you have a dataframe and you want to remove all rows where 'value' is equal to the minimum 'value' found in the column. One efficient way is by using `idxmin()` followed by boolean indexing:

```python
import pandas as pd

def remove_min_rows_method1(df, column_name):
    """
    Removes rows with the minimum value in a specified column using idxmin and boolean indexing.
    """
    min_index = df[column_name].idxmin()
    df_filtered = df.drop(min_index)
    return df_filtered

# Example usage:
data = {'id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'value': [10, 5, 10, 15, 5]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Original DataFrame:\n", df)
filtered_df = remove_min_rows_method1(df, 'value')
print("\nFiltered DataFrame (method 1):\n", filtered_df)
```

In this snippet, `idxmin()` gives us the *index* of the first occurrence of the minimum value. Then `df.drop(min_index)` does the removal based on the index. This is performant, particularly on larger DataFrames, because we avoid iterating over the entire DataFrame multiple times. The `idxmin()` function leverages internal optimized implementations within pandas. However, a potential gotcha here is that it only drops the first row it finds with the minimum value. If multiple rows share the same minimum, it will leave the rest.

Second, if we want to remove *all* rows with minimum value, we can utilize a more explicit boolean mask:

```python
def remove_min_rows_method2(df, column_name):
    """
    Removes all rows with the minimum value in a specified column using a boolean mask.
    """
    min_value = df[column_name].min()
    df_filtered = df[df[column_name] != min_value]
    return df_filtered

# Example usage (same DataFrame as before):
print("\nOriginal DataFrame:\n", df)
filtered_df = remove_min_rows_method2(df, 'value')
print("\nFiltered DataFrame (method 2):\n", filtered_df)
```

This approach first determines the minimum value with `.min()` and then creates a boolean mask where `True` indicates rows where the value is *not* equal to the minimum. Then this mask is used to select only these rows that are not the minimum. This approach is very readable and handles multiple instances of the minimum.

Third, if you needed to be very careful about edge cases or if the data requires some pre-processing or more complex handling, you can also employ a slightly more functional approach using `apply` and a lambda function in combination with filtering, but be mindful, this approach is often slower on larger datasets than the other two examples:

```python
def remove_min_rows_method3(df, column_name):
    """
    Removes all rows with the minimum value in a specified column using a lambda and boolean mask after a filtering step.
    """
    min_value = df[column_name].min()
    df_filtered = df[~df.apply(lambda row: row[column_name] == min_value, axis=1)]
    return df_filtered


# Example usage (same DataFrame as before):
print("\nOriginal DataFrame:\n", df)
filtered_df = remove_min_rows_method3(df, 'value')
print("\nFiltered DataFrame (method 3):\n", filtered_df)
```

Here, the lambda function applies to each row, returning true if the value of the row in the given column equals the minimum found, then the `~` operator will negate the result and filter out those rows. While this approach is flexible and can incorporate more complex conditional logic in the lambda, it's usually slower because pandas has to iterate row-by-row and can be less efficient on large dataframes. Use this cautiously if performance is a major concern.

When choosing between these techniques, consider the following: Method 1 (using `idxmin()`) is the fastest when you only want to remove the first occurrence of the minimum value. Method 2 (using `.min()` and boolean mask) is robust and efficient for removing all occurrences of minimum values and remains performant on a wide variety of data sizes. Method 3 (using `apply`) offers the most flexibility in terms of handling more complex cases, but tends to be slower, so use it sparingly.

For more in-depth information on data manipulation and performance optimization using pandas, you can consult the pandas documentation, of course. Also, the "Python for Data Analysis" book by Wes McKinney (the creator of pandas) is a fantastic resource that provides both a theoretical understanding and practical guidance on these topics. For further exploration in algorithmic efficiency and handling of large datasets, “Introduction to Algorithms” by Cormen et al. provides a solid foundation for understanding the theoretical underpinnings.

In my experience, most of the time, method 2 is the most pragmatic. It’s efficient, readable, and handles common use cases quite effectively. However, understanding all three approaches gives you the flexibility to handle unique requirements that you may encounter when working with data manipulation. Remember to always validate your results, especially after preprocessing steps like these. The key is to profile the performance of these operations on your specific datasets, to choose the most suitable method for your needs.
