Okay, let's tackle text wrapping in Ruby/Rails, a task I’ve encountered more times than I care to count over the years. It might seem straightforward at first glance, but the devil, as they say, is in the details. In one particularly memorable project, we had user-generated content flowing into a mobile app, and handling those variable text lengths was critical for a clean ui. We couldn't rely on simple character truncation – we needed intelligent word wrapping. So, here’s how I’ve approached it, with a focus on practicality and clarity.

The core problem, of course, is taking a string, and making sure that no line exceeds a specified length *in terms of characters*, without splitting words. We want to break the text down at suitable spaces, while respecting the target width. This is more complex than simply cutting strings at an arbitrary character limit. Here's the breakdown of methods I’ve found helpful:

**Understanding the Core Logic**

Fundamentally, you’re iterating over the words of the input text. You’re maintaining a track of the current line's length. When the addition of the next word would cause the current line to exceed the maximum length, you push the current line to the output array or string, and start a new line with the offending word. This is fundamentally an iterative process, not a regex problem (though regex might assist in some aspects of cleaning). I prefer to approach this iteratively because it allows for greater control over the break process, making it easier to incorporate edge-case handling.

**Method 1: Simple Iterative Word Wrapping**

This is the most direct approach and generally works well. We'll use an accumulator string and build lines, which are then added to the overall result. This is a very common implementation that balances simplicity with efficacy.

```ruby
def word_wrap_simple(text, max_width)
    words = text.split(" ")
    lines = []
    current_line = ""

    words.each do |word|
      if (current_line.length + word.length + 1) <= max_width
         current_line += (current_line.empty? ? word : " " + word)
      else
        lines << current_line
        current_line = word
      end
    end
   lines << current_line unless current_line.empty?
    lines
end

# Example
text = "This is a long sentence that needs to be wrapped intelligently so that it fits within a certain width constraint."
wrapped_text = word_wrap_simple(text, 20)
wrapped_text.each { |line| puts line }
```

This method splits the input string into words using space delimiters. It then iterates over these words. If adding the next word will cause the line to exceed `max_width`, it appends the current line to the `lines` array and starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, the word is added to the current line. Note the simple check `current_line.empty? ? word : " " + word` that avoids a leading space on the first word of a line.

**Method 2: Using `each_line` and Combining it with Iteration**

This method takes advantage of built-in functionalities of ruby. It’s beneficial when dealing with texts which might contain newline characters already, allowing us to be respectful of existing formatting.

```ruby
def word_wrap_with_newline(text, max_width)
  lines = []
  text.each_line do |line|
    words = line.split(" ")
    current_line = ""
      words.each do |word|
        if (current_line.length + word.length + 1) <= max_width
            current_line += (current_line.empty? ? word : " " + word)
        else
            lines << current_line
            current_line = word
        end
    end
    lines << current_line unless current_line.empty?
  end
  lines
end

# Example
text_with_newlines = "This is a sentence.\nAnd another, a bit longer than the last one, but not very long."
wrapped_text_with_newlines = word_wrap_with_newline(text_with_newlines, 20)
wrapped_text_with_newlines.each { |line| puts line }
```

Here, the approach extends Method 1 by incorporating `each_line` to handle texts containing explicit newlines. Each line is then processed by splitting into words and using the line-building loop as in our previous example. The benefit is that it maintains the separation of logical lines from the input text and applies the wrapping to each of these lines.

**Method 3: Handling Hyphenated Words (An Enhancement)**

Sometimes, we might encounter hyphenated words, and we'd prefer not to split these apart. This adds a bit more complexity. This might not be necessary for all use cases, but it is crucial when dealing with formatted technical documents.

```ruby
def word_wrap_with_hyphens(text, max_width)
    lines = []
    current_line = ""

    text.split(/(\s+|-)/).each do |word_or_separator| # splits by both whitespace and hyphens
        if word_or_separator =~ /\s+/ # if its space, then act like basic word wrap
            if (current_line.length + word_or_separator.length ) <= max_width # check available space
                current_line += word_or_separator
            else
                lines << current_line
                current_line = ""
            end
        elsif (current_line.length + word_or_separator.length ) <= max_width # is it a hyphen or word? Can it fit?
            current_line += word_or_separator
        else
          lines << current_line
           current_line = word_or_separator
        end

    end
    lines << current_line unless current_line.empty?
    lines
end


# Example
hyphenated_text = "This is a very-long-word and then some regular words to show the functionality."
wrapped_hyphenated_text = word_wrap_with_hyphens(hyphenated_text, 20)
wrapped_hyphenated_text.each { |line| puts line }
```

In this method, the string is split using a regex `(/(\s+|-)/)` that splits by spaces and hyphens. This ensures that words with hyphens are treated as single units. The logic also includes checks to ensure the separator (space or hyphen) will also fit on the line before adding.

**Resource Recommendation**

For a deeper dive into string manipulation and algorithms, I recommend looking at "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen et al. While it doesn't directly address text wrapping, it lays the theoretical groundwork for algorithm analysis and design, helping understand why these implementations work effectively. Additionally, understanding fundamental data structures, as covered in "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++" (or any language of your preference) by Mark Allen Weiss, will improve comprehension of how iterative processes are developed. On the ruby-specific side, "Programming Ruby 3.2" by David Thomas et al. offers in-depth discussion on core features like string handling and enumerators, which are essential in crafting robust solutions to these tasks.

**Conclusion**

These three methods illustrate a solid range of techniques for wrapping text in ruby/rails. The simple approach works great for many common use cases. The addition of handling newlines offers greater versatility. Finally, the hyphen handling demonstrates that it's often necessary to adapt solutions based on specific constraints and edge cases. The important thing is to understand the logic and build your solution methodically. My experience has shown that starting simple and expanding to edge-case logic, is almost always a more maintainable path, even if it involves a little more upfront development.
