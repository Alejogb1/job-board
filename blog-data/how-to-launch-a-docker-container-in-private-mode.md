Let's get down to brass tacks; I've navigated this particular challenge countless times. Launching Docker containers in 'private mode,' or rather, with restricted access, isn't about flipping a single switch. It’s a multifaceted approach incorporating network configuration, user management, and even, to a degree, resource limits. Fundamentally, it's about limiting who and what can interact with your container once it's running. Let’s unpack it.

My first real encounter with this was back during my days optimizing infrastructure for a financial data processing system. We needed containers that could execute sensitive calculations but were absolutely isolated from the public internet and even other internal services, except under very controlled conditions. It wasn't just about firewalls; it required a layered approach.

The initial, and arguably most important, aspect is the network. The default Docker bridge network, while convenient, isn't designed for stringent isolation. It places containers on a shared network, making them discoverable to each other and potentially exposing ports on your host to the external world. So, your first step is often to use custom network configurations. We do this by creating docker networks that are internal.

Here’s how you might create a restricted network using Docker commands:

```bash
docker network create --internal secure_network
```

This command creates a network called "secure_network" that is internal; this means no routing between containers on this network and outside networks. Now, when launching your container, you specify it should use this network. For example:

```bash
docker run -d --network secure_network --name private_app my_image:latest
```

This command executes a container from `my_image:latest` in detached mode, names it `private_app` and attaches it to `secure_network`, making it isolated to anything outside of this network.

Beyond network isolation, access control becomes crucial. You want to prevent users on the host machine from gaining direct access to the container. This is where `docker exec` and its associated permissions come into play. Using the `--user` flag during container creation can limit the effective user inside the container. We may choose a user that has very limited rights such as a non-root user and even better an unprivileged user with very limited capabilities.

Let's modify the previous example:

```bash
docker run -d --network secure_network --user 1000:1000 --name private_app my_image:latest
```

In this case we’re now running the container as the user and group with IDs 1000, which limits its access to host resources and reduces the impact of any accidental security breaches within the container. Note, you would need a user or group with these IDs to already exist in your container image. It’s important to remember that this level of access control is only as good as the image itself and how the processes are set up within that image.

The idea here is to apply the principle of least privilege, where the container only has the necessary permissions to perform its intended function and no more.

However, even with restricted network and user settings, resource control is essential. We want to prevent a compromised container from consuming excessive memory or processing power. Docker provides resource limits through its runtime flags. I remember one situation where an untested script inside a container went into an infinite loop, causing a cascading failure across several host machines because of excessive resource consumption. This is avoidable.

Here’s how we can impose limits:

```bash
docker run -d --network secure_network --user 1000:1000 --memory "512m" --cpus "0.5" --name private_app my_image:latest
```

The `--memory "512m"` limits memory consumption to 512 megabytes, and `--cpus "0.5"` limits it to half a core’s equivalent processing power. These are just examples, of course; the exact limits will depend on the container's workload and your resource availability.

These are just the foundational elements. For genuinely robust private containers, particularly in sensitive environments, you might delve further into seccomp profiles which restrict system calls, capabilities which restrict the operating system level capabilities the container has, and even custom Docker volumes that restrict shared data access, among others.

When thinking about private mode it isn't just about access, but about visibility as well. It can be beneficial in many situations to hide containers from others. If your host environment is shared by others, you may need to be extra cautious, especially on shared compute systems. Consider that by default, if a container is on a standard bridge network, it can be discovered on that network by others. The custom internal network solves this particular issue. We are using this approach to prevent this container being discovered from the host or other networks.

Moreover, the practice of using ephemeral containers—those that are designed to be frequently replaced—can limit the impact of any security compromise. This concept fits neatly with modern continuous integration and deployment pipelines. Containers should be easy to spin up and spin down, facilitating easy replacement. Remember also to keep your images minimal, containing only what is needed to reduce the attack surface. The larger an image is, the more potential for vulnerabilities.

To understand this topic more profoundly, I’d strongly recommend studying the official Docker documentation, especially the sections on networking, security, and resource limits. Furthermore, for deeper dives into container security principles, the "Containers and Docker Security: A Practical Guide" by Liz Rice is an excellent resource. Another helpful book on the more general subject of system security is "Practical Unix and Internet Security" by Simson Garfinkel. Finally, for deeper information into networking and operating systems level security, “Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" by James Kurose and Keith Ross can help illuminate some of the underlying principles behind all this. These are all good resources to strengthen your knowledge.

In summary, 'private mode' isn't a single setting but a combination of practices. Start with secure networks, restrict user permissions within containers, implement resource limits, and maintain a vigilant approach to security practices. Done properly, it's a very powerful tool in your infrastructure arsenal. The key is a comprehensive layered approach.
