Alright, let’s unpack this common frustration. I’ve spent more than a few late nights troubleshooting 'no run dates were found' errors while working with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in various systems, from simpler batch processing pipelines to more complex data orchestration platforms. It's rarely a fundamental flaw in the DAG itself, but rather an issue with how the scheduler is interpreting the temporal constraints for task execution. The crux of the problem usually lies in either incorrect or missing definitions for when your DAG should actually run, and it’s crucial to understand these scheduling mechanisms to avoid this pitfall.

Essentially, the "no run dates were found" error signals that the scheduler—whether it’s Airflow, Prefect, or something custom—can’t determine when it should initiate a DAG run. DAGs, at their core, represent a sequence of operations or tasks with defined dependencies. However, they don’t inherently know when to activate themselves; that’s our responsibility to specify. Typically, this involves setting up a *schedule*, which tells the scheduler on which dates and times, or under what conditions, the DAG should trigger an execution. If that’s not properly configured, you’re left with a DAG that’s perfectly structured but utterly inactive.

The error itself can stem from multiple sources, broadly categorized as:
1. **Missing or Incorrect Schedule Definitions:** No `schedule_interval` or similar parameter has been provided, or the definition is faulty in some way. For instance, an invalid cron expression or a datetime that’s passed already.
2. **Misunderstanding Schedule Logic:** Some schedulers support advanced scheduling features like catchup or backfill. Not handling these settings correctly can prevent runs from being registered.
3. **External Dependencies Affecting the Trigger:** A DAG may be intended to run based on the arrival of a specific file or message. If that condition is not met or is incorrectly configured, no run dates will be generated.

Let’s consider three scenarios with code examples using Python, focusing on concepts applicable across various DAG execution frameworks.

**Example 1: The Basic Scheduled DAG**

Here, we'll look at the simplest case – a DAG with a cron-based schedule using Python and a hypothetical scheduler interface that mirrors something like Apache Airflow or Prefect.

```python
from datetime import datetime

class DummyScheduler:  # Simplified mock scheduler
    def __init__(self):
        self.runs = {}  # Keep track of scheduled runs

    def schedule_dag(self, dag_id, schedule_interval, tasks, start_date):
        self.runs[dag_id] = {
            'schedule': schedule_interval,
            'tasks': tasks,
            'start_date': start_date
        }

    def get_run_dates(self, dag_id, now):
        if dag_id not in self.runs:
            return []

        schedule = self.runs[dag_id]['schedule']
        start = self.runs[dag_id]['start_date']

        if isinstance(schedule, str): # Assume cron string
             # Note:  A proper parsing of a cron string is missing for simplification, 
            #        but it would be in a production environment using dedicated libraries.
            #        This would calculate run dates based on now and the provided cron.
            if now.day == 1: # Simulating a run at the first day of the month
                return [now]
            else:
                return []

        elif schedule is not None: # handle some fixed interval if applicable
            # Placeholder for handling fixed schedule intervals.
            # Typically a more complex logic would apply to determine run dates
            return []

        return [] # If schedule is None or empty


    def run_dag(self, dag_id, run_date):
       if dag_id in self.runs:
          print(f"Executing DAG: {dag_id} on {run_date}")
          for task in self.runs[dag_id]['tasks']:
            print(f"Executing task: {task}")
       else:
         print("DAG not found.")




# Mock usage:
scheduler = DummyScheduler()

# Define a basic DAG that just prints a message
def print_task(task_name):
    print(f"Running task: {task_name}")
    return True # success

tasks_1 = [lambda: print_task("task_one"),
            lambda: print_task("task_two") ]

# Schedule a DAG
dag_id_1 = "my_scheduled_dag"
scheduler.schedule_dag(dag_id_1, schedule_interval="0 0 1 * *", # monthly at 00:00 on the 1st day
                    tasks=tasks_1, start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1))

# Get potential run dates
run_dates = scheduler.get_run_dates(dag_id_1, datetime(2024, 3, 1))

if run_dates:
  for run_date in run_dates:
     scheduler.run_dag(dag_id_1,run_date)
else:
  print(f"No run dates were found for: {dag_id_1}")

run_dates = scheduler.get_run_dates(dag_id_1, datetime(2024, 3, 15))

if run_dates:
  for run_date in run_dates:
     scheduler.run_dag(dag_id_1,run_date)
else:
  print(f"No run dates were found for: {dag_id_1}")
```

In this example, the `schedule_interval` is set using a cron string for a monthly schedule. If no `schedule_interval` is set, or if the current time doesn't meet the condition in the basic cron logic implemented in `get_run_dates`, the error would occur. This illustrates how an explicit schedule is essential.

**Example 2: Dealing with Start Dates and Catchup**

Another frequent mistake is ignoring or misunderstanding the role of the DAG’s `start_date`. Consider the following adjustment to the previous scenario:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class DummyScheduler:  # Simplified mock scheduler
    def __init__(self):
        self.runs = {}  # Keep track of scheduled runs

    def schedule_dag(self, dag_id, schedule_interval, tasks, start_date, catchup=True):
        self.runs[dag_id] = {
            'schedule': schedule_interval,
            'tasks': tasks,
            'start_date': start_date,
            'catchup': catchup
        }

    def get_run_dates(self, dag_id, now):
        if dag_id not in self.runs:
            return []

        schedule = self.runs[dag_id]['schedule']
        start = self.runs[dag_id]['start_date']
        catchup = self.runs[dag_id]['catchup']
        run_dates=[]

        if isinstance(schedule, str): # Assume cron string

            current_date = start
            while current_date < now:
                if current_date.day == 1: # simulating schedule being at the 1st of the month
                    run_dates.append(current_date)

                current_date += timedelta(days=1)

            if catchup:
                return run_dates
            else: # handle the no catch up case, only latest date if available
                if len(run_dates)>0:
                   return [run_dates[-1]]
                else:
                   return []
        elif schedule is not None:
            # Placeholder for handling fixed schedule intervals.
             return []

        return []



    def run_dag(self, dag_id, run_date):
       if dag_id in self.runs:
          print(f"Executing DAG: {dag_id} on {run_date}")
          for task in self.runs[dag_id]['tasks']:
            print(f"Executing task: {task}")
       else:
         print("DAG not found.")


# Mock usage:
scheduler = DummyScheduler()
tasks_2 = [lambda: print_task("task_a"),
           lambda: print_task("task_b") ]
# Schedule a DAG
dag_id_2 = "my_scheduled_dag_2"
scheduler.schedule_dag(dag_id_2, schedule_interval="0 0 1 * *",
                     tasks=tasks_2, start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), catchup=True)
# Check for run dates as of 2024-03-15
run_dates = scheduler.get_run_dates(dag_id_2, datetime(2024, 3, 15))

if run_dates:
  for run_date in run_dates:
     scheduler.run_dag(dag_id_2,run_date)
else:
  print(f"No run dates were found for: {dag_id_2}")

# Check again with catchup disabled to show the difference
scheduler.schedule_dag(dag_id_2, schedule_interval="0 0 1 * *",
                     tasks=tasks_2, start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), catchup=False)

run_dates = scheduler.get_run_dates(dag_id_2, datetime(2024, 3, 15))

if run_dates:
  for run_date in run_dates:
     scheduler.run_dag(dag_id_2,run_date)
else:
  print(f"No run dates were found for: {dag_id_2}")

```

With `catchup=True`, the scheduler will generate all the missed run dates between the `start_date` and the current time. Setting `catchup=False` will cause the scheduler to consider only the *most recent* schedule point, if applicable, which may result in skipping runs if the schedule point is too old or not available. Missing this nuance can lead to the ‘no run dates’ error if you’re expecting past runs to be triggered.

**Example 3: External Trigger Considerations**

Finally, let's quickly touch upon the scenario where the trigger is external. While the code itself might be different, the logical error is similar.

```python
# Simplified example simulating external trigger

class ExternalTrigger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.available_files = []
    def check_file(self, filename):
       return filename in self.available_files

trigger = ExternalTrigger()

trigger.available_files = ['data_file.txt']

def process_data_dag():
    if trigger.check_file('data_file.txt'):
        print("File data_file.txt available, proceeding to process it.")
    else:
        print("File data_file.txt not available, not executing")


process_data_dag()

# Now simulate that the file is not available

trigger.available_files = []
process_data_dag()
```

In this case, the execution of the DAG depends on a check for the existence of a file. If `data_file.txt` isn’t available, or the availability check is configured incorrectly in our scheduler, the DAG will not have a trigger and will not produce any runs, again resulting in the dreaded error.

To deepen your understanding, I'd suggest diving into the official documentation for your chosen DAG execution framework, be it Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, or any other system. For scheduling concepts in general, the "Operating System Concepts" book by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne contains solid foundational material about task scheduling. Also, specifically for cron expressions, there are several reliable online resources that offer in-depth explanations and tools. Finally, pay close attention to how specific schedulers deal with backfill and catchup as nuances will apply depending on the technology you chose.

In summary, the "no run dates were found" error is typically not a failure of the DAG's logic itself but rather a reflection of improperly configured schedule dependencies. Understanding these dependencies and setting them correctly is fundamental to the smooth operation of your data pipelines and other DAG-based systems. By ensuring your schedule, start dates, catchup logic, and external triggers are appropriately handled, you can successfully eliminate this often frustrating issue.
