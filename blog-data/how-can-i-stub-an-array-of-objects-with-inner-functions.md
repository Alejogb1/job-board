Okay, let's tackle this. Been there, done that, more times than I care to remember. Stubbing arrays of objects, particularly those with internal functions, can definitely throw a wrench into your unit testing efforts if not handled correctly. It's less about the stubbing itself and more about understanding *what* you're trying to achieve with the stub and *how* those inner functions behave within the context of your code. I’ve seen projects where complex data structures get intertwined with business logic and mocking these structures effectively becomes a crucial step to testing components in isolation. So, let's break this down practically.

First, the core idea is to replace the actual array of objects with a controlled substitute, giving us the ability to predict its behavior without needing the real dependencies. Crucially, when those internal functions are called during testing, we want to make sure we control their outcomes. We're not trying to reproduce the complete complexity of the application; instead, we’re establishing clear interaction points for the tested unit.

We have several approaches to achieving this, and which you choose often depends on your context and tooling. I find that direct substitution, combined with mock objects when needed, hits the sweet spot for most use cases. I’m not a fan of excessive frameworks; a little manual work with clear intentions is usually cleaner and easier to maintain. Think carefully about what you’re trying to verify and keep it targeted. Over-engineering your stubbing logic leads to maintenance headaches down the line.

Here's how I've approached this in the past, with a few examples to help solidify the concepts.

**Example 1: Direct Substitution with Static Return Values**

Imagine you have a function that processes an array of user objects. Each user has a `calculateScore()` method that, in a real application, may involve some database lookups and logic:

```javascript
function processUsers(users) {
  return users.map(user => {
      return {
          name: user.name,
          score: user.calculateScore()
      }
  });
}
```

To test `processUsers`, we want to control the score calculation. Here's how we could directly substitute a controlled array:

```javascript
// Stubbed array of users
const stubbedUsers = [
  {
    name: 'Alice',
    calculateScore: () => 100,
  },
  {
    name: 'Bob',
    calculateScore: () => 50,
  }
];

// Testing processUsers with the stubbed array
const processedData = processUsers(stubbedUsers);

// Assertions (using a generic assertion framework as an example)
console.assert(processedData[0].score === 100, "Score for Alice incorrect");
console.assert(processedData[1].score === 50, "Score for Bob incorrect");
```

Here, instead of relying on the actual `calculateScore` functions, which might be complex, we have directly defined simplified functions that return predictable values. This approach keeps testing focused and avoids unnecessary dependencies.

**Example 2: Using Mocks for Complex Function Behavior**

Sometimes, you need more dynamic behavior in your stub. Suppose our user object also has a `updateStatus()` function. We might want to ensure that this function is *called* under specific conditions during our test, without actually modifying anything. Here, we could use a basic mock object with call tracking:

```javascript
function performUserAction(user) {
    if (user.needsUpdate) {
        user.updateStatus();
    }
}

function createMockUser(initialStatus, updateCallCount = 0) {
    let status = initialStatus;
    let callCount = updateCallCount;

    return {
      status,
        needsUpdate: true,
        updateStatus: () => {
           status = 'updated';
            callCount++;
        },
        getCallCount: () => callCount
    }
}

const mockUser1 = createMockUser('initial');

performUserAction(mockUser1);

// Assertions
console.assert(mockUser1.status === 'updated', "User 1 status was not updated.");
console.assert(mockUser1.getCallCount() === 1, "User 1 status update was not called");
```

In this example, `createMockUser` acts as our controlled environment for the `updateStatus` function. It provides a way to verify that the function was invoked with correct state changes. Note that this is a simplified version of mocking, often frameworks provide more comprehensive implementations for this.

**Example 3: Combining Stubs and Spies**

If you're working with more complex logic, and need to both substitute return values and track how functions are being called, you might combine direct substitutions with "spies." While a complete explanation of spies falls beyond the scope of this response, in essence a 'spy' is a simple mock object that wraps an existing function and allows you to track calls, parameters, and more without changing the function itself. For the purposes of this example, I'll include a basic hand-rolled spy.

Imagine our user objects have a `getDetails` function that relies on an external api call which we wish to stub:

```javascript
function getUserDetails(user){
  return user.getDetails()
}

// Simplified spy helper
function createSpy(originalFunction) {
    const callHistory = [];
  
    const spy = (...args) => {
      callHistory.push({ args });
      return originalFunction(...args);
    };
  
    spy.getCallHistory = () => callHistory;
    return spy;
}

const apiResponse = {name: "john", age: 30};

// mock object creation
const mockUser = {
    getDetails: () => apiResponse
}

const spy = createSpy(mockUser.getDetails);

mockUser.getDetails = spy;


const result = getUserDetails(mockUser)

// Assertions
console.assert(result === apiResponse, "Incorrect api response returned")
console.assert(spy.getCallHistory().length === 1, "Incorrect number of api calls made")
console.assert(spy.getCallHistory()[0].args.length === 0, "Incorrect arguments passed to api method")
```

In this case, `createSpy` acts to wrap the `getDetails` function, enabling us to verify calls without needing an external framework. It also demonstrates how to combine substitutions with a basic spy to check the function is called as expected.

These three examples illustrate different aspects of stubbing object arrays with internal functions. The key takeaway is that we’re replacing or adapting behavior for the purposes of testing only.

For further learning, I would strongly suggest delving into Martin Fowler’s “Mocks Aren’t Stubs”, which brilliantly explains the difference between these concepts. Also, “Working Effectively with Legacy Code” by Michael Feathers goes into the detail of how to create tests for hard-to-test systems, and how to deal with legacy systems. Lastly, “xUnit Test Patterns” by Gerard Meszaros offers patterns for all kinds of testing, and it covers stubs, mocks, fakes, and spies very thoroughly. These resources should provide more detailed explanations and techniques.

Remember, the goal isn't to create perfect replicas, but rather to craft precise, predictable replacements that isolate your code components effectively. Thinking about *why* you are stubbing, instead of just *how*, will make your tests more useful and easier to understand.
