Okay, let's tackle this. I remember a particularly frustrating project back in my mobile development days, a client demanded a fluid, dynamic table view that, during some specific edge cases, would inexplicably stack cells on top of each other horizontally. The visual effect was, shall we say, less than ideal. Dealing with horizontal overlap in `UITableViewCell` instances within a swift application isn't a straightforward issue of simply setting frames. It’s often a combination of layout miscalculations, incorrect sizing parameters, and a lack of clear understanding of how auto layout and table view delegates interact. Let's explore the core problems and solutions I've found to be the most effective.

The primary culprit is often an ill-defined `UITableView` layout, particularly when it comes to handling variable cell sizes. You might think that setting `estimatedRowHeight` and `rowHeight` will solve everything, but that’s not always the case, especially if you’re working with constraints within your cell’s content view. The table view expects to determine cell heights reliably, and if something throws that calculation off, overlapping is an inevitable consequence. We need to understand the fundamental roles at play here. `UITableView` delegates like `heightForRowAt` and the implicit size calculations using `autoLayout` are responsible for how the table view's layout is handled. Misusing or misconfiguring either can cause the visual anomalies you're encountering.

Firstly, let's talk about the standard delegate methods, namely, `heightForRowAt`. If you implement this method, you’re telling the table view, “I’m handling this, don’t even try”. Any inconsistencies between the height you return here and the actual height required by your cell’s content view will cause problems, often leading to cells visually overlapping in your view. Here's a basic example of how to set a fixed height, which generally will *not* cause overlapping but won't solve our variable size problem either:

```swift
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, heightForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> CGFloat {
        return 100 // Fixed height
    }
```

This approach is simple enough, but what happens when cells need different heights based on content or other dynamic factors? This is where using `UITableView.automaticDimension` becomes essential. To leverage auto layout and dynamic cell heights, you must remove the implementation of `heightForRowAt` altogether, or, set the height to `UITableView.automaticDimension`. Also, and this is *crucial*, you must set `estimatedRowHeight` to *some* reasonable value. Without a good estimate, the table view can miscalculate its content size and produce inconsistent scrolling behavior and, you guessed it, overlapping cells.

Here's an example of a setup that allows for dynamic cell heights based on the auto layout constraints within the cell’s content view:

```swift
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 80 // Good starting estimate
        tableView.rowHeight = UITableView.automaticDimension
        tableView.register(CustomTableViewCell.self, forCellReuseIdentifier: "customCell")
    }
```

In the above example, we're not providing a specific height for cells. Instead, by using `automaticDimension`, we tell the table view that the cell's own layout constraints will determine its height. Now, the layout engine, if done correctly within your cell, should not cause horizontal overlap. The cell’s content view will dictate its dimensions via constraints. If you’re seeing overlapping after this setup, the issue lies within your cell’s constraints not being able to properly determine the height, or even *width*. If the cell's content view doesn’t know its width because of constraints or if the width calculation is dependent on an unknown height, you will see strange behavior. Horizontal overlap might be a *symptom* of incorrectly calculated heights causing downstream cascading failures.

However, even with `automaticDimension` and well-defined cell constraints, issues may arise. When implementing `UITableViewCell`’s, it is tempting to rely on frame-based positioning. While this seems straightforward, it makes the cell’s position *and* size highly fragile and prone to errors, especially during dynamic sizing and table view reloads. I’ve found that exclusively using autolayout constraints for the view hierarchy *within* your cells is absolutely necessary for reliable sizing. If you mix frame-based and constraint-based layouts inside the cells, you will frequently see overlapping. This is very important.

So, consider this. Let's say your cell has a label whose height should adjust based on the content. If you set its height manually or incorrectly use frames, you will see the overlap. Instead, you should always ensure that the constraints from the label to the cell’s `contentView` are correctly defined, thus defining both width and height.

Here's a simplified example of a custom cell with auto layout:

```swift
    class CustomTableViewCell: UITableViewCell {

        let contentLabel: UILabel = {
            let label = UILabel()
            label.numberOfLines = 0 // Allows multi-line text
            label.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
            return label
        }()

        override init(style: UITableViewCell.CellStyle, reuseIdentifier: String?) {
            super.init(style: style, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
            setupViews()
        }

        required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
            fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
        }

        private func setupViews() {
            contentView.addSubview(contentLabel)
            NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
                contentLabel.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: contentView.topAnchor, constant: 8),
                contentLabel.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: contentView.leadingAnchor, constant: 8),
                contentLabel.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: contentView.trailingAnchor, constant: -8),
                contentLabel.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: contentView.bottomAnchor, constant: -8)
            ])
        }

        func configure(with text: String) {
            contentLabel.text = text
        }
    }
```

In this `CustomTableViewCell`, we’re using `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false` and then explicitly setting the constraints. This way, the label’s height will grow as needed based on the text, and the cell’s height is automatically calculated based on the constraints within the cell. Critically, this includes ensuring that every element’s position and size is determined *by* constraints, thus preventing horizontal overlaps.

To solidify the concept, consider reviewing Apple's documentation on auto layout. Specifically, the "Working with Auto Layout" guide provides detailed information on best practices. I would also recommend looking into "iOS Auto Layout Demystified" by Erica Sadun; it's a very thorough resource that has saved me countless hours debugging layout issues.

In summary, to resolve horizontal overlapping, avoid manually setting cell heights or using frames where possible. Always, always leverage auto layout. Ensure that your `estimatedRowHeight` is set to a reasonable value. Let your `UITableViewCell`s calculate their own height via constraints, and don't use frame-based sizing inside your cell’s `contentView`. Once you've done this and ensured consistent constraint-based layout within your cells, the overlapping issues you are experiencing should significantly diminish. Trust me, I've been there, and these steps have proven to be the most effective in resolving such problems.
