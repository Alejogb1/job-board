alright, so you're looking to pull data from separate tables and combine them based on a join, in ruby, i get it. i've definitely been there, many times, and it's a classic scenario when working with relational databases. it's surprisingly easy to get tangled up if you're not careful, especially when you start dealing with complex joins or when the data structures are not crystal clear.

i recall one project back in the early 2010's when i was working with a really old legacy system. they had a bizarre structure for storing user information and their order history split across like five tables, all related by different id schemes – it was a mess. and the worst part? it was all in plain sql with no orms whatsoever. getting that data to come back to the user's view was a big challenge and my task. i initially tried to do it all in one gigantic sql query, and it ended up looking like spaghetti code. i spent hours tracing down why it was returning random null values or duplicate entries. it was a lesson in data modeling, and a very painful one. since then i've done my research and have learned to use ruby's features with more elegance.

so, let's get down to it. in ruby, the typical approach would use an orm like active record, especially if you're using rails. but it is not mandatory. if not using rails or an orm, you can use raw sql with a gem like `pg` (for postgresql) or `sqlite3`. assuming you're somewhat familiar with relational databases, and sql, i'll show some code examples using both these approaches.

first, i will give an example using active record. let’s assume you have two models: `user` and `order`. a user can have many orders. your models would look like this:

```ruby
class user < applicationrecord
  has_many :orders
end

class order < applicationrecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

now, let's say you want to get all users along with their orders. using active record's eager loading feature, you can achieve this very efficiently:

```ruby
users = user.includes(:orders).all

users.each do |user|
  puts "user: #{user.name}"
  user.orders.each do |order|
    puts "  order: #{order.order_number}"
  end
end
```

this code does a two queries one to fetch all the users and another to fetch all related orders in one batch using ids from the first query, this avoids the n+1 query problem, which can be a killer when handling large datasets. the includes method is key here, it tells active record to fetch the associated data in a way that is optimized, doing two queries is faster than doing a query for every single user when requesting their orders. if you don't use it, you would get one sql query for every single user record and a second for their corresponding orders resulting in a really slow performance.

sometimes you need to add more conditions, or get specific data based on the join relation itself. for example, you may need users and their recent orders for each, lets say, within the last month. this can be achieved using `joins`.

```ruby
recent_orders_time = 1.month.ago
users_with_recent_orders = user.joins(:orders).where("orders.created_at >= ?", recent_orders_time)
users_with_recent_orders.each do |user|
  puts "user: #{user.name}"
  user.orders.each do |order|
    puts "  order: #{order.order_number}" if order.created_at >= recent_orders_time
  end
end

```

this example uses an explicit `join` clause and then uses `where` to filter those orders based on a created\_at date. notice the join condition is implicitly managed by active record because of the associations that have been set up in models previously. the sql query generated by this code will contain the necessary joins on `users` and `orders` tables, the important thing is that you are not explicitly doing sql yourself you are just using active record methods in ruby.

now, lets talk about a raw sql. you may end up in a scenario without active record, you will need to use a gem like `pg` or `sqlite3` to interact with a database. for example purposes lets pretend we are using postgresql. the following example assumes that you already have a database connection established and a gem `pg` installed and configured. you would need to write the sql yourself in this case.

```ruby
require 'pg'

begin
  conn = pg::connect(host: 'localhost', user: 'your_user', password: 'your_password', dbname: 'your_database')

  sql = "select users.name as user_name, orders.order_number as order_number
        from users
        inner join orders on users.id = orders.user_id;"
  result = conn.exec(sql)
  result.each do |row|
    puts "user: #{row['user_name']}, order: #{row['order_number']}"
  end
rescue pg::error => e
    puts "error when connecting or executing query: #{e}"
ensure
  conn&.close
end

```

this example constructs a plain sql query with `inner join` that is then executed using `conn.exec` method, the result is an array of rows that can be iterated using `.each` and retrieving the data based on the alias names defined. handling errors and closing connections are also important.

working with raw sql can be powerful, but it comes with increased responsibility and complexity for the developer. it will work though, you will get your result from several tables if the `join` is correct. in any case, it's important to understand that ruby itself isn't doing the joins. ruby is basically just setting up the sql queries that is then going to be sent to the database server and the database will do the joins, retrieve the data and return the result in a way ruby understands. ruby is a client here. it is not responsible for any calculations.

there are many more advanced ways of handling joins, for instance you can use `left outer joins` or `right outer joins` which are necessary for specific cases where you need to retrieve data even if there isn't a correspondence of ids from the tables, however this is beyond the scope of this answer.

if you are really curious about databases and how they do sql queries under the hood, i'd recommend reading "database internals: a deep dive into how distributed data systems work" by alex petrov. it's a book that will give you a thorough understanding of what happens when you hit `send` on a sql query. or you could just, you know, ask me again - i'll probably have some anecdotes about my failures with sql. actually i made a joke here i think.

in conclusion, combining data from distinct tables into a `join` relation in ruby involves using orm or directly writing sql depending on your situation. the `active record` orm simplifies the process with its model associations and methods, while raw sql with libraries like `pg` offer more control but requires careful handling of connections and query execution. the specific approach depends on your project's requirements and what best suits your coding style, the important thing is that you understand the `join` concept and how to use it in ruby with different tools. always consider potential problems like the n+1 problem, that can become a bottleneck if not handled with care and the right tools.
