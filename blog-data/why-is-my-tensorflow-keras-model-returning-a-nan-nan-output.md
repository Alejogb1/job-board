,  Seeing a `[nan nan]` output from your tensorflow keras model is a frustrating experience, and I've certainly been there. It's often not a single, obvious cause, but rather a constellation of issues that can lead to the dreaded 'not a number' result. My experience has shown me that pinpointing the exact culprit requires a methodical approach, a bit like debugging a complex system rather than trying to guess the answer. Let me walk you through the common reasons and how to address them, drawing from my past projects that suffered similar fates.

The root of `nan` outputs invariably lies in numerical instability. That's a fancy way of saying the calculations are going off the rails and producing values that the computer can't represent meaningfully. It's not just about 'bad' data or model architecture, although those certainly play their part.

First, let's talk about **exploding gradients**. This one is often the first suspect. During backpropagation, gradients are calculated and used to update model weights. If these gradients become exceptionally large, the weights can update dramatically, pushing the model into unstable regions where loss calculations can return `nan`. This is particularly frequent in deep networks or recurrent neural networks. I remember a project where I was building an LSTM for time-series forecasting, and the gradients were literally blowing up, resulting in constant `nan` outputs.

Here’s a simple example to illustrate this using a deliberately unstable layer in a small keras model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create some dummy data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 2)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1000, activation='relu'), # intentionally large weights here.
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2) # no activation at the end to exaggerate the issue
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

# this will often return nans if you have very large weights
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

test_input = np.random.rand(1, 10)
print(model.predict(test_input))

```

In that code example, the second dense layer has a large number of neurons (1000). If the weights initialize poorly, especially with a standard random initializer, the subsequent calculations can result in extremely large values which leads to an explosion when gradients are backpropagated. To address this type of problem, **gradient clipping** is an important technique. It sets an upper bound on the magnitude of gradients during optimization. This prevents them from becoming excessively large. You can achieve this with the optimizer settings:

```python
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001, clipnorm=1.0) # Gradient clipping here
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
print(model.predict(test_input))
```

Another important cause of `nan`s are related to the choice of loss functions and their behavior with extreme inputs. For example, if you use categorical cross-entropy (or its sparse variant) with probabilities very close to zero or one, this can lead to logarithmic calculations blowing up because `log(0)` returns negative infinity and then subsequent calculations can propagate that to `nan`. This frequently occurs with softmax outputs.

Consider this illustration with dummy probabilities:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulating an extremely small probability
probs = np.array([[1e-10, 1.0 - 1e-10]])  # Very close to 0 and 1

# Use categorical cross entropy
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
labels = np.array([[0, 1]])

loss = loss_fn(labels, probs).numpy()
print(loss)

```

You might see a very large number here instead of `nan`, but this is the type of result that, if propagated through the backpropagation, can lead to nan outputs later on. In practice this shows up when your model is very confident in its predictions. To counter this, often a very small constant is added to the probabilities, ensuring the logarithm is of a value greater than 0. This is usually handled internally by frameworks, but if you implement the loss function yourself, you must keep this in mind.

Additionally, problems with **division by zero** can cause problems. This can happen within custom layer implementations, or even within the standard built-in layers if, say, your batch normalization layer's standard deviation calculation is nearly zero. Input data problems can also cause this, such as zero-valued denominators in a normalization process.

Furthermore, data issues can exacerbate problems with numerical instability. If your training data contains very large values, extremely small values, or even NaNs (which is very common), this can propagate during the training process. It’s crucial to inspect your data, normalize it appropriately (mean-variance normalization or other appropriate methods), or even perform some data cleaning or pre-processing steps. I once spent a very frustrating day debugging a nan issue that turned out to be due to a very small percentage of corrupted data entries with extremely large values that were wrecking the model's training process.

**Regarding resources for these issues:** For a deep dive into numerical stability and related techniques, I highly recommend the “Deep Learning” book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. It has thorough sections on optimization, regularization, and best practices. Furthermore, for practical tips when building models in keras, the tensorflow documentation itself is invaluable, especially for examining the documentation of the loss and optimizer functions. Papers on gradient clipping and other numerical stability techniques are plentiful on arxiv, and often include a mathematical treatment of the problems involved.

In summary, encountering a `[nan nan]` output is often the result of either unstable gradients, numerical instability in loss function, division by zero problems, or even data quality issues. Each problem requires a focused approach to isolate it, either through gradient clipping, inspecting custom loss functions carefully, scrutinizing data, or cleaning the input data, in addition to techniques like learning rate adjustments. It's a process of detective work more than anything else.
