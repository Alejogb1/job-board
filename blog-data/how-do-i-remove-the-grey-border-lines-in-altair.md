Let's tackle this one. The persistent grey border lines in Altair – I've seen them trip up quite a few folks, and I've spent some time myself on the troubleshooting end of that specific issue. They're an artifact of the default settings, and while they serve a purpose in some contexts, they often clash with a desired minimalist aesthetic, especially for web-based visualizations. The core problem, frankly, is that these borders are inherent to the vega-lite specification that Altair uses behind the scenes. They aren’t arbitrary; they are part of the default style applied to chart elements. Therefore, removing them isn’t a matter of finding some hidden "border off" switch; it's about explicitly overriding those default styles.

In essence, we’re targeting the `view` and `mark` encodings within our Altair spec. The `view` encoding dictates things about the overall plotting area, including borders, while marks encode the properties of the visual elements themselves, like points, bars, or lines. The default configurations often include borders, which manifest as those grey lines.

My first encounter with this was back when I was building a dashboard for real-time sensor data. The client wanted a clean, modern look, and those grey borders simply didn't fit. Initial attempts at tweaking chart themes via json configurations proved… less than efficient. It's much better to address this programmatically at the Altair level, which offers far more granular control and maintainability.

So, let's break down the strategies. The first, and often most effective, method is to explicitly set the `stroke` property to `None` (or `null` in json) within the chart's `view` encoding. This tackles the encompassing border around the entire chart canvas. Here’s an example using the altair api:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'y': [5, 3, 6, 7, 2]
})

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_line().encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y:Q'
).configure_view(
    stroke=None
)

chart.show()
```

In the above example, `configure_view(stroke=None)` is the key element. This tells Altair to apply a modification directly to the view, stripping away the stroke, therefore the border line. This will remove the outer grey border that encompasses the plot.

The second approach focuses on the marks. If, beyond removing the outer border, you find that some *elements* within your chart (like bars, points, or even the lines in line chart) still retain a grey stroke, this method addresses it. The `mark_*` functions in Altair also accept a `stroke` property. We can similarly set it to `None` here. Consider this modification of the previous example, using marks:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'y': [5, 3, 6, 7, 2]
})

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_line(stroke=None).encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y:Q'
).configure_view(
    stroke=None
)

chart.show()
```

Here, we’ve added `stroke=None` within `mark_line`. This ensures the line itself does not have a stroke around it, removing any potential grey line artifacts along the line itself. Using both techniques, you’re tackling the problem from two distinct, but complementary angles.

The third and equally important thing to consider is when you are dealing with more complex plots; sometimes the strokes originate from sub-components or layered charts. This approach requires inspecting the elements of each layer and applying the modifications where necessary. Let's consider a layered chart as an example:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'y1': [5, 3, 6, 7, 2],
    'y2': [2, 7, 3, 5, 4]
})

line_1 = alt.Chart(data).mark_line(stroke=None).encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y1:Q'
)

line_2 = alt.Chart(data).mark_line(stroke=None, color='red').encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y2:Q'
)

chart = (line_1 + line_2).configure_view(
    stroke=None
)

chart.show()
```

In this case, two lines are layered on top of each other. By setting `stroke=None` in each `mark_line` call, and then additionally in `configure_view` we remove all strokes from the lines and the chart area itself. The key takeaway here is that, depending on your specific chart type and complexity, you may need to apply these stroke removals across various components.

Now, regarding further learning, I highly recommend exploring the official Vega-Lite documentation, as Altair's behavior is directly linked to it. Specifically, pay attention to sections on configuration and styling. The "Vega-Lite: A Grammar of Interactive Graphics" paper by Satyanarayan et al. (published in the *Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*) gives a great insight into the underlying design of the library; reading this will help you understand what the stroke property really does, and when to modify it. Similarly, “Interactive Data Visualization: Foundations, Techniques, and Applications” by Ward et al. provides extensive background on general visualization principles. While not specific to Altair, the knowledge can greatly improve your work in visualizations. Finally, for practical implementation in Altair, the official documentation is paramount; specifically, focus on the `configure_view` and `mark_*` API references.

In my experience, consistently applying these methods, understanding the underlying Vega-Lite specification, and carefully considering how styling cascades through your chart layers can successfully remove those pesky grey lines. Remember it's about explicit control. The default is there, but it is not the final say.
