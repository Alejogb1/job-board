Okay, let's tackle this. I've encountered this particular challenge a few times in past projects, particularly when presenting complex data visualizations that require detailed context. Footnotes, as you're likely aware, are crucial for clarity, especially when dealing with layered charts where individual elements might need specific explanations. Altair doesn't directly support footnotes as a native feature, so we need to get a bit creative with text marks and layering strategies. It's not as straightforward as flipping a switch, but it's quite achievable with some understanding of how Altair processes text and layers.

The core idea revolves around using `mark_text` along with carefully calculated positions to place your footnote text below the main chart. Essentially, we’re manually creating the footnote area. This requires a bit of precision, but it also provides a good deal of flexibility in controlling the footnote appearance. The trick is to establish a consistent positioning method that works even when the chart's dimensions might change.

Let’s start with a simple example. Imagine we're showing sales data across different categories and a footnote might explain a specific period or data source. Here’s a basic chart to build on:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],
        'sales': [100, 150, 120, 180]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='sales:Q'
)

footnote_text = 'Data from the fiscal year 2023.'

# Calculating appropriate y-position for the text.
# We want the text to appear slightly below the bars.
y_position = df['sales'].min() - (df['sales'].max() - df['sales'].min())*0.15 #using a fraction of the range to define placement

footnote = alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({'text': [footnote_text], 'y': [y_position]})).mark_text(
    align='left',
    fontSize=10,
    dy = -10 # slightly offset the text from the calculated position
).encode(
    text='text:N',
    y='y:Q'
)


final_chart = (chart + footnote).properties(
        height = 300,
        width = 400
        ).configure_view(strokeWidth=0)

final_chart.display()
```

In this example, I’ve used a data frame with text and the calculated y-position for the footnote. I use `mark_text` to place the footnote below the bar chart using an offset of 15% of the y-axis range below the minimum bar value, which is generally the range of the y-axis. This also uses a negative dy value which provides a tiny offset, pushing the text slightly further down the visual. It is important to note that we are using `configure_view(strokeWidth=0)` to remove the default gray border around the charts. This is particularly important to get a clean look if the charts are embedded in a dashboard.

One of the challenges you might face is that the y-axis range can dynamically change if the data set changes. We could address this by manually specifying the y-axis range, but in many situations, it is best to ensure the footnote is dynamically adjusted with the plot, even if it means a variable offset. We can also introduce additional logic to use a percentage of the plot height or width, and use this as a reference for the position of the footnote if we did not want to place the text below the actual bars.

Now, let’s consider a slightly more complex example, this time involving multiple layers and multiple footnotes. Suppose we have a layered area chart with a line chart over it, and we want a footnote for both the area chart and line chart specifically:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'time': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'area_data': [20, 30, 25, 40, 35],
        'line_data': [15, 25, 20, 30, 28]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

area_chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_area().encode(
    x='time:O',
    y='area_data:Q',
    color=alt.value('skyblue')
)

line_chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_line(color='darkblue').encode(
    x='time:O',
    y='line_data:Q'
)

footnote_area_text = 'Area chart data: collected daily at 12:00 PM.'
footnote_line_text = 'Line chart data: collected daily at 6:00 PM.'


# Calculate y position based on the data range.
y_max = max(df['area_data'].max(), df['line_data'].max())
y_min = min(df['area_data'].min(), df['line_data'].min())


y_offset = (y_max-y_min)*0.1
y_position_area = y_min - y_offset
y_position_line = y_position_area - y_offset

footnote_area = alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({'text': [footnote_area_text], 'y': [y_position_area]})).mark_text(
    align='left',
    fontSize=10,
    dy=-10
).encode(
    text='text:N',
    y='y:Q'
)


footnote_line = alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({'text': [footnote_line_text], 'y': [y_position_line]})).mark_text(
    align='left',
    fontSize=10,
    dy=-10
).encode(
    text='text:N',
    y='y:Q'
)


final_chart = (area_chart + line_chart + footnote_area + footnote_line).properties(
        height = 300,
        width = 400
        ).configure_view(strokeWidth=0)

final_chart.display()

```

Here, we calculate the y-position for both footnotes by considering the range of both data sets and a small additional offset. We are using one offset, and then subtract additional offset from this to define a y value for both footnotes. We then layer these footnotes together with other charts to produce a visualization with multiple footnotes.

Finally, let's look at how to handle variable footnote length, which can be tricky. The following uses `alt.layer` to stack the two charts before adding the text, which allows better control over the positioning of the text.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [10, 20, 15, 25, 20]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_line().encode(x='x:Q', y='y:Q')

# Example with longer text that needs to be handled
footnote_text = "This is a longer footnote that might wrap in some browsers, particularly on smaller screens. We need to make sure that it doesn't overlap the main chart."

# A rough y-position calculation based on the data
y_min = df['y'].min()
y_max = df['y'].max()
y_offset = (y_max-y_min)*0.20
y_position = y_min - y_offset

footnote = alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({'text': [footnote_text], 'y': [y_position]})).mark_text(
    align='left',
    fontSize=10,
    dy=-10
).encode(
    text='text:N',
    y='y:Q'
)

final_chart = alt.layer(chart, footnote).properties(
    height = 300,
    width = 400
).configure_view(strokeWidth=0)


final_chart.display()

```

In this example, we use a longer footnote text. The primary way to address variable length footnotes in altair is to rely on CSS's text wrapping and adjusting the y-offset based on the total chart height as needed. Altair's text marks use the browser's text rendering. By using a combination of the `dy` value, along with a proper calculation of the offset, one can achieve the effect needed to avoid overlap with the main chart.

For more detailed information on how Altair handles layering, I'd recommend reviewing the Altair documentation thoroughly, particularly the sections on layering and text marks, as well as discussions on the underlying Vega-Lite specification, especially the 'mark' configuration. Furthermore, I found "Interactive Data Visualization for the Web" by Scott Murray a valuable resource for understanding how to approach text rendering on the web. For more rigorous discussion on text placement algorithms, exploring relevant sections from papers on computational typography might be beneficial. The key is understanding how browser text rendering works and then to use offsets and calculated coordinates to achieve precise positioning.

In conclusion, while Altair doesn't offer a dedicated footnote feature, you can effectively implement them by using text marks and calculated positioning. It takes a bit of care and attention to detail to make sure it works across different data sets and chart types, but the flexibility and customization offered by this approach makes it worth the effort in the end.
