Okay, let's tackle this. The question of displaying the ephemeral layer size of running containers using `crictl` is a nuanced one, and it’s something I've encountered directly in several production environments. The short answer is: `crictl` itself doesn’t provide a direct command to show the ephemeral layer size for running containers. However, that doesn't mean the information isn't accessible; it just requires some understanding of the underlying container runtime and a bit of resourceful maneuvering.

My past experiences with containerized applications, particularly those handling large datasets, made monitoring storage usage critical. Early on, we ran into issues where ephemeral layers would unexpectedly grow, impacting performance and sometimes causing containers to crash. Understanding and visualizing ephemeral layer sizes became crucial for diagnosing these types of problems.

So, why doesn't `crictl` have a command for this? The core function of `crictl` is to interact with the container runtime interface (cri), which abstracts away the specifics of the underlying container implementation, such as containerd or cri-o. The CRI focuses on high-level management of containers (create, start, stop, etc.) rather than detailed low-level storage specifics. Ephemeral layers, being part of the container's writable filesystem, are primarily managed by the container runtime itself, which makes direct access via the CRI somewhat impractical for this type of detail.

To illustrate, consider how these layers function. When a container image is pulled, it's read-only layers form the base. When you run a container from that image, a new writable layer, the ephemeral layer, is created on top. Any changes made during the container's lifecycle—file creation, modifications, etc.—reside in this layer. Therefore, the ephemeral layer size fluctuates during the container’s operation. This size is not stored as a static attribute accessible via basic container information from `crictl`.

Instead of a single `crictl` command, we need to look deeper using the runtime-specific tools. Often, we can achieve a comparable outcome, even though it might involve more steps.

Here's how we typically extract this information in practice. For the sake of this response, I will assume that we’re predominantly using containerd, as it's quite prevalent:

**Example 1: Using `ctr` with `du` within the container namespace**

The `ctr` command-line tool is a more direct interface to containerd. To get the size of the ephemeral layer, we need to enter the container's mount namespace. First, let's find the container id we need by using `crictl ps`

```bash
crictl ps
```
This gives you an output including something along the lines of:

```
CONTAINER           IMAGE                                   CREATED         STATE     NAME                      ATTEMPT
e23a12b3c4d56  k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.2          ...       Running   k8s://pod-name/container-name         0
```
Then grab the container id, in this case it's `e23a12b3c4d56` and use it in the next commands. First, let's determine the location of the container's mount point.

```bash
sudo ctr containers info e23a12b3c4d56 | grep "mounts"
```

The output of the command will be something like this:

```
    "mounts": [
        {
          "type": "bind",
          "source": "/var/lib/containerd/io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.overlayfs/snapshots/63/fs",
          "options": [
            "rbind",
            "rprivate"
          ]
        },
     ...
```

Now, we will go into the namespace of the container and then execute `du` to obtain the disk usage statistics.

```bash
sudo nsenter -t $(sudo ctr task info e23a12b3c4d56 | grep "pid" | awk '{print $2}') -m du -sh /
```

This command enters the mount namespace of the specific container (using its pid) and then executes `du -sh /`, which reports the disk usage for the root directory of the container's filesystem, effectively representing the ephemeral layer size. The output will be in a format that looks like `123M  /`. This shows that the container's writable layer is currently using 123 MB of storage.

**Example 2: Using `containerd` API via `go`**

For more sophisticated monitoring systems, a programmatic approach using the containerd API is preferable. Here’s a conceptual go snippet demonstrating how to achieve this (note that this requires a functioning go development setup):

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/containerd/containerd"
	"github.com/containerd/containerd/namespaces"
)

func main() {
	// Connect to containerd socket
	client, err := containerd.New("/run/containerd/containerd.sock")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer client.Close()

	ctx := namespaces.WithNamespace(context.Background(), "k8s.io") // Assumes kubernetes namespace
	containerID := os.Args[1]                                        // Container ID as argument

	container, err := client.LoadContainer(ctx, containerID)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

  info, err := container.Info(ctx)
  if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

  snapshotKey := info.SnapshotKey

	mounts, err := client.SnapshotService("overlayfs").Mounts(ctx, snapshotKey)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	if len(mounts) == 0 {
			log.Fatalf("No mounts found for container %s\n", containerID)
	}

  // Print the mount point for future inspection or use
	fmt.Println("Mount point of ephemeral layer:", mounts[0].Source)

	// Now you would need to execute 'du' or another means of determining disk usage, programmatically, leveraging mounts[0].Source

}
```

Compile and run this Go program, passing the container id as an argument:

```bash
go run main.go e23a12b3c4d56
```
This snippet connects to containerd, loads the container metadata, retrieves the snapshot key, and then the actual mount point path of the container's writable layer using the overlayfs snapshotter. Although the go code does not directly provide the size, the mount point can be used for executing a system command such as `du` to obtain the size programmatically as shown in example 1.

**Example 3: Monitoring using Prometheus Node Exporter (with customization)**

While not a direct output, we can augment monitoring tools like Prometheus Node Exporter to track ephemeral layer size. You can configure a collector that runs the commands explained in Example 1, scrapes the output, and publishes metrics. For instance:

Assume you have a custom exporter that executes `du -sh` against ephemeral layers. You would then configure Prometheus to scrape this custom exporter. This approach would allow you to:

1.  Query size over time in prometheus.
2.  Set alerts on the growth of ephemeral layers.
3.  Visualize data in dashboards like Grafana.

To get started with prometheus node exporter with your custom metrics, consider looking into how to develop a custom collector with the prometheus client libraries for go, python or any other programming language of your choice. This process involves setting up a prometheus client, defining the metrics and updating them periodically from the ephemeral layer size calculation script.

In conclusion, while `crictl` does not offer direct access to the ephemeral layer size, the information is available via underlying container runtime tools. We can effectively obtain the sizes and monitor growth through manual methods and even automated systems. The crucial part lies in understanding how container runtimes manage their filesystems. For further reading on this, I recommend reviewing the containerd documentation, focusing on snapshots and layers. Also, consult the documentation for your specific container runtime, as details will differ somewhat between containerd, cri-o, and other runtimes. In addition, the 'Understanding Container Storage' section in “Kubernetes in Action” by Marko Lukša or “Docker Deep Dive” by Nigel Poulton are great resources. They explain how container layers work with practical examples and real-world advice. These books are useful for building a more thorough understanding of how these lower level concepts work. The specific command line interfaces may change, but the overall architecture will remain similar. This makes learning the concepts far more valuable than memorizing individual commands which are subject to change.
