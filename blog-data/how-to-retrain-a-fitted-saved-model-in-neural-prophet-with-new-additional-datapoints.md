alright, so you've got a neural prophet model, trained it, saved it, and now, bam, more data shows up at the door. this happens, i've been there more times than i care to count. it's not as straightforward as just feeding the new stuff in. believe me, i wish it was. you can't just inject data into a frozen model and expect it to automatically learn. the model has already learned the patterns from the initial training set.

let's talk about the situation first, how i usually approach this is not by rewriting everything, is more like, how i go about updating the model with new information. essentially, you have two main paths here. path one, train a new model entirely with all of the data, the initial and the new. path two, find a way to use the existing model, and kinda nudge it in the direction of the new data.

option one is the brute-force approach, you chuck the old model out the window and start fresh. this is actually pretty good sometimes. it makes sure your model is always optimal. you are certain the model is capturing all of the relationships in the data. it's kind of like the nuclear option though because the training is computationally expensive. it's like having to do the whole calculation from the start. not ideal in all situations, especially if the initial dataset was massive.

the second path, retraining with the saved model, is more nuanced, this is also where neural prophet kinda shines cause it has some level of flexibility. this is where most of the effort goes. i will try to explain.

let's see some code examples. first, here's the typical loading-saving scenario for neural prophet, just in case there's a need to see it.

```python
from neuralprophet import neuralprophet

# assume 'df' is your dataframe with initial data
model = neuralprophet()
metrics = model.fit(df, freq="D") #daily data, can be adjusted.
model.save("my_model.pkl")
```

pretty standard right? i've done this hundreds of times. 'my\_model.pkl' is where all the learned weights, biases and configurations of our model are stored. so next up, you get a data update.

now, here's where things get interesting. when you get new data, and you want to incorporate this into your existing model. it's not just about throwing everything at the same training process and seeing what happens. that will make the model forget what it has already learnt and it will train over the new data, if the new data is not correlated with the old data, the model would be useless. you must 'warm-start' your model with the existing weights. we are not training an entirely new model, we are updating our current one.

```python
import pandas as pd
from neuralprophet import neuralprophet

# Load the saved model
model = neuralprophet.load("my_model.pkl")

# Assume new_df is a pandas DataFrame with additional data
new_df = pd.read_csv("new_data.csv")

# Concatenate initial and new data
updated_df = pd.concat([df, new_df], ignore_index=True)

# Retrain using updated data
metrics = model.fit(updated_df, freq="D",  validate_each_epoch = True, early_stopping_patience = 10) #daily data, can be adjusted.
model.save("my_updated_model.pkl")
```

in this piece, we are loading our previous model, concatenating the original dataframe with new dataframe, and re-training the model using the `fit` method. there are parameters you can tune such as `early_stopping_patience`, it helps avoid overtraining on the new data, which will happen. this is important, and it happened to me once, the model performed worse because of overtraining, so i had to adjust that parameter.

note: the model has an internal mechanism to keep the previous weights, it will not initialize randomly again, it will start on its previous configuration and make adjustment only on the added data. in the past, this was not very reliable, but it was a major update in neural prophet, now it works fine.

it is also important to remember you must concatenate the dataframes before fitting the model. you need to tell the model, that we are providing everything together, do not expect the model to keep the past information and infer that the new one is an extension of it.

now there is another approach which iâ€™ve tried. and this is where a bit of fine-tuning comes in handy. it's not about just adding more data and retraining the entire thing again. it's about carefully adjusting the model to incorporate the new information, while preserving the original learning.

the idea is to train a new model, but initialized with the weights of the old one, however, it only uses the new data. this is done by setting the model using the `set_parameters` method, and the training must be done on new data only.

```python
import pandas as pd
from neuralprophet import neuralprophet

# Load the saved model
model_old = neuralprophet.load("my_model.pkl")

# Assume new_df is a pandas DataFrame with additional data
new_df = pd.read_csv("new_data.csv")

# create a new instance
model_new = neuralprophet()

# set parameters from old model, this replaces the initial random weights.
model_new.set_parameters(model_old.parameters)

# now train only on new data
metrics = model_new.fit(new_df, freq="D",  validate_each_epoch = True, early_stopping_patience = 10) #daily data, can be adjusted.
model_new.save("my_fine_tuned_model.pkl")
```

this method can work in some very peculiar scenarios when the new dataset is relatively small and you do not want the model to move much from what it has learned before. this can be useful if the new data represents a short temporal anomaly, for example, and you do not want the model to over fit on it.

i recall one time, the first time i dealt with time series forecasting, i was updating data on an hourly basis, and the model started overfitting very fast. now i know i need to keep a close eye on overtraining, it's a pretty common issue.

now, some words on resources because i am not going to paste links here. if you want to go deep, check papers on transfer learning and continual learning, these are the base of the second approach above. also the original prophet paper by sean taylor and benjamin leth, also a must have. and it never hurts to revise machine learning books, such as the one by gareth james, daniela witten, trevor hastie, and robert tibshirani. but do not worry about it too much, the first two ways i mentioned should cover most use cases.

last, a silly joke, i've been told my code compiles but lacks any kind of personality.

so, that's it. i think you can see, it's not just about the code, it's about understanding the underlying concepts. i hope it helps you, and if not, well, come back with more questions. i've dealt with stranger problems before.
