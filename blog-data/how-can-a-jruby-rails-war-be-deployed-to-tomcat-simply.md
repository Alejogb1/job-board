Alright, let's unpack this. I’ve spent a fair bit of time deploying JRuby on Rails applications to Tomcat, and while “simply” might be a strong word depending on your environment, there are certainly approaches that streamline the process quite a bit. I remember battling with classpath issues and weird gem conflicts back in '09 with a particularly complex legacy system; it forced me to dive deep into the nuances of JRuby deployments on Java application servers. What I’ve landed on, and what I’ve consistently found to be the most reliable path, hinges on using the Warbler gem.

Warbler essentially handles the heavy lifting of packaging your JRuby Rails application into a deployable WAR file. It takes care of mapping your gem dependencies, JRuby runtime, and all the other necessary bits and pieces into a single, self-contained artifact that Tomcat can readily understand. The key here is minimizing manual configuration. The less you do by hand, the less chance for a typo or misconfiguration to throw a wrench into your deployment process.

First, let’s focus on the ‘why’ behind this approach. The default Rails stack is built around a dedicated web server like Puma or Unicorn, which are Ruby-based. Tomcat, on the other hand, is a Java servlet container. JRuby, by virtue of being an implementation of Ruby running on the JVM, allows us to bridge this gap. However, the raw JRuby runtime isn’t quite enough to run a Rails application directly in a servlet container; that's where Warbler plays its part. It acts as the intermediary, packaging everything correctly.

Now, for the practical steps. Assuming you have a standard Rails project already set up, here's what a typical workflow would look like.

**Step 1: Adding Warbler to Your Gemfile**

First, you’ll add the warbler gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'warbler'
```

Then, as you normally would, execute `bundle install` to install the gem and its dependencies.

**Step 2: Configuring Warbler**

Warbler generally works with minimal default configuration, but often it helps to customize it to ensure optimal operation. For example, setting the java version and other options. You create a `config/warble.rb` file where these settings go:

```ruby
Warbler::Config.new do |config|
  config.jar_name = "my_rails_app"
  config.webxml.jruby.min.runtimes = 1
  config.webxml.jruby.max.runtimes = 4
  config.java_libs = FileList["lib/*.jar"]  # Include any project-specific jars
    config.webxml.contextpath = "/my-rails-app" # set context path
  # for JRuby 9.1 and later, you need to tell Warbler where jruby runtime is
  config.jruby_gemset = Pathname.new(Gem.dir).join('gems', 'jruby-complete-9.x.x.x')

  # Example: including a keystore
  # config.includes = FileList["config/keystore.jks"]

end
```

Let’s break that down briefly.

*   `jar_name`: This will be the base name of the resulting WAR file.
*   `webxml.jruby.min.runtimes` and `webxml.jruby.max.runtimes`: These control the number of JRuby instances Tomcat starts to serve your application.
*   `java_libs`: If you have custom Java libraries that your JRuby application needs, you can list them here. I've used this in cases where certain legacy systems needed access to specific Java functionality.
*  `webxml.contextpath`: This setting will define the URL context under which your Rails app will be available within the Tomcat deployment.
*   `jruby_gemset`: With newer versions of JRuby, you need to specify where the complete gemset files live on disk for warbler to build it's JAR. If you find your builds are failing because gems aren't found, this is likely the place to fix it.
*   `includes`: Used when there is additional files to include in the war, like a keystore. This could also be a directory

It's worth noting that the minimum and maximum JRuby runtime settings can significantly affect performance. Start with low numbers during development, and then increase them as needed once you've benchmarked your application under load. This ensures you don’t unnecessarily overload your server resources.

**Step 3: Generating the WAR File**

With the `config/warble.rb` in place, creating the WAR file is straightforward. You'd use the command:

```bash
bundle exec warble
```

This command triggers Warbler to package all the necessary files, including your application code, dependencies, and the JRuby runtime, into a single `my_rails_app.war` file (or whatever you named it).

**Step 4: Deploying to Tomcat**

Finally, to deploy, simply copy this WAR file into the `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps` directory. Tomcat will automatically unpack and deploy your application.

**Example Code Snippets for Deeper Understanding:**

Here's another snippet that shows configuration if you need to specify custom gems

```ruby
Warbler::Config.new do |config|
   config.gems = ["some-gem-that-is-not-in-gemfile", "another-gem"]
   # ... Other configurations ...
end
```
This specifies gems that aren't already specified in your gemfile and will force Warbler to pull them into the deployed WAR. It's useful for gems that are only required at deployment.

Also, the following shows a configuration example if you need to use an external gem repository rather than the default one that is bundled with JRuby:

```ruby
Warbler::Config.new do |config|
  config.gem_repositories = ["https://my-private-gem-repo.com"]
  # ... Other configurations ...
end
```

This enables you to use private gem repositories to store custom gems if the default gem repository does not work.

**Important Considerations and Further Learning:**

While these steps present a reasonably simple deployment process, there are important details to be aware of, mainly around application configurations, database connections, etc., that need to be adjusted for your production environment:

*   **Database Configurations:** Ensure your `database.yml` is correctly set for your production database. This typically involves setting environment variables on the Tomcat server.
*   **Environment Variables:** JRuby/Rails, when running in a servlet container, accesses environment variables differently. Make sure you are setting environment variables through the Tomcat configuration. You can define these at the Tomcat level (e.g., in `setenv.sh` or `setenv.bat`) or via the context.xml configuration.
*   **JRuby Version and Gem Compatibility:** Always use a JRuby version that's compatible with the gems used in your application. Version conflicts are a common source of headaches during deployment. Double-check all gem dependencies.
*   **Servlet Container Configuration:** Tomcat requires configuration of the servlet container itself to ensure the correct port, memory settings, etc.
*   **Context Path**: Always use the `webxml.contextpath` to set a specific path for the app, so that deployment paths are consistent, especially across environments.
*   **Logging:** Tomcat's logging system is separate from the default Rails logging. This typically requires configuration changes to output your rails log through the Java logger.
*   **Production Server Configuration:** The standard Rails server configuration for Puma, Unicorn, etc., is no longer applicable for Tomcat. Use settings specific to JRuby and Java servlet configurations.

For further reading, I'd highly recommend these resources:

1.  **_Programming JRuby_ by Ian Dees, Charles Nutter, and Tom Enebo:** This book provides an in-depth understanding of JRuby, especially its interactions with the JVM and Java libraries. It’s a great guide for anyone serious about JRuby deployments.
2.  **_The Definitive Guide to Apache Tomcat_ by Jason Brittain and Ian F. Darwin:**  A comprehensive guide on Tomcat configuration and administration, which would help with your server-specific configurations.
3.  **The Official JRuby Documentation:** Always a good resource for up-to-date information on JRuby itself, including specific details about its servlet interactions.

In summary, while deploying a JRuby Rails app to Tomcat might seem daunting at first, using Warbler and a disciplined approach to configuration will simplify the process significantly. I've found this workflow effective even for complex projects and using it has significantly decreased my deployment times. By focusing on proper configuration of warbler, database connections, and environment variables, and using recommended resources, you can achieve a reliable and relatively straightforward deployment. Remember, while simple can be a goal, predictable is often the better one for reliable deployments.
