Alright, let's tackle this. Query optimization in ActiveRecord, especially when dealing with repetitive but slightly varying requests, is a topic I've spent a fair amount of time navigating. It’s a common scenario and, frankly, a frequent bottleneck. Over the years, I've seen more than a few performance cliff-dives caused by seemingly innocuous repetitive queries, so I’m glad you've asked.

The core issue typically stems from ActiveRecord, by default, generating and executing a new sql query each time you call a method that retrieves data from the database, even if the conditions are very similar. This isn't usually a problem for singular, distinct queries. But when these similar requests happen in a loop, or in rapid succession, it multiplies database load exponentially. We need to move beyond simply relying on ActiveRecord's default behavior and employ strategies that reduce database trips. Here are some approaches I’ve found effective, and I'll illustrate with examples based on problems I’ve encountered in past projects.

The first and most direct solution, and often the most overlooked, is to reduce redundant queries entirely. This sometimes means restructuring the application logic. For instance, I once worked on an e-commerce platform where, for every product shown on a category page, we would query the database individually to fetch the related image. This led to several hundred almost identical queries per user request. The problem wasn't slow queries themselves but the sheer *number* of them. The solution was to eagerly load all product images using `includes`, like this:

```ruby
# Before optimization: Many database hits
def display_products(category_id)
  @products = Product.where(category_id: category_id)
  @products.each do |product|
    puts product.name
    # This triggers a query for each product
    puts product.image.url
  end
end

# After Optimization: Fewer database hits (usually one additional query)
def display_products_optimized(category_id)
  @products = Product.where(category_id: category_id).includes(:image)
  @products.each do |product|
    puts product.name
    # Image data is already available - no additional query
    puts product.image.url
  end
end
```

By using `includes(:image)`, ActiveRecord preloads all the associated image records with a single additional query, making the subsequent `product.image` calls non-database-intensive. `includes` works best with n+1 query problems and is very common. For further background, I would suggest reviewing “Effective Ruby: 48 Specific Ways to Write Better Ruby” by Peter J. Jones, specifically the sections on ActiveRecord and optimization patterns.

Beyond the n+1 problem, there's often a need to handle repetitive queries that might have varying parameters within a set. We can utilize caching mechanisms like Rails' built-in cache store, but sometimes you need finer control and can benefit from memoization. Imagine a situation where we needed to lookup user permissions based on user id and a specific module name multiple times in a request, where user data could vary. Memoization helps here by storing the result of a function call for a given argument set and returning the cached result on subsequent calls with the same arguments. Here is how you can implement this within your model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord

  def permissions_for_module(module_name)
    @permissions_cache ||= {}
    @permissions_cache[[id, module_name]] ||= fetch_permissions_from_database(module_name)
  end

  private

  def fetch_permissions_from_database(module_name)
    Permission.find_by(user_id: id, module_name: module_name)
  end
end
```

In this scenario, the `@permissions_cache` instance variable is initialized as a hash (if it doesn't exist) in `permissions_for_module`. The key for each entry is the combination of `id` and the `module_name`. When a `user.permissions_for_module('some_module')` is called for the first time, the result is fetched via `fetch_permissions_from_database` and cached in `@permissions_cache`. On subsequent calls with identical arguments, the result is pulled from the cache, thus reducing unnecessary database queries. This approach can be very effective when parameters are not highly volatile, i.e., repeated calls with the same arguments are highly probable. This caching is not persistent like the Rails cache, but it does improve performance within a given request-response cycle.

For more advanced approaches, and specifically how to build more robust caches, explore the "Database System Concepts" by Abraham Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth, and S. Sudarshan. While it’s not specific to Rails, it lays a strong foundation for understanding how database caching mechanisms function, informing better caching strategies.

Finally, sometimes the bottleneck isn’t the number of queries but the complexity of individual queries. When you have a number of conditional queries where the differences are minimal, you might explore techniques like creating a single complex query that covers all needed scenarios, rather than generating and executing a multitude of slightly different queries. For example, consider querying events based on different criteria - for the past week, past month, or past year. The following example will demonstrate a scenario where we use a conditional SQL query to filter the events based on a set of dates passed into a query.

```ruby
class Event < ApplicationRecord
  scope :for_date_range, -> (date_range) {
    case date_range
    when 'past_week'
      where('created_at >= ?', 1.week.ago)
    when 'past_month'
      where('created_at >= ?', 1.month.ago)
    when 'past_year'
       where('created_at >= ?', 1.year.ago)
    else
       all
    end
  }

end

# Usage

Event.for_date_range('past_week')
Event.for_date_range('past_month')
```

While this example demonstrates an easy to read solution for a few options, it can quickly get unruly when more options are added. A more optimized solution may be to instead use a parameterized query:

```ruby
class Event < ApplicationRecord
  scope :for_date_range_optimized, -> (date_range) {
      case date_range
      when 'past_week'
          past_date = 1.week.ago
      when 'past_month'
          past_date = 1.month.ago
      when 'past_year'
          past_date = 1.year.ago
      else
        return all
      end

      where('created_at >= ?', past_date)
  }
end

# Usage
Event.for_date_range_optimized('past_week')
Event.for_date_range_optimized('past_month')
```

While these example queries may be very basic, the general strategy of generating parameterized sql queries is very effective, especially with more complex scenarios. By analyzing the specific needs of your code, and avoiding the pitfalls of many smaller, similar queries, we can reduce the overall database load, and improve response time. "SQL for Smarties: Advanced SQL Programming" by Joe Celko is a very useful resource for designing these types of queries.

In summary, optimizing repetitive queries is a multi-faceted problem. It's about identifying patterns of repetition, choosing the most appropriate strategy (eager loading, caching, memoization, or parameterized queries), and continually measuring the impact of your changes. There isn’t a single magic bullet. You’ll likely need to apply a combination of these techniques, tailored to the specifics of your application. Always profile your code to find the true bottlenecks. Understanding these fundamentals, along with careful code design and analysis will significantly improve your ActiveRecord application performance. I hope this helps.
