,  I've seen this kind of issue pop up more times than I care to count, especially when dealing with data serialized to JSON and back in Ruby. It often boils down to a fundamental mismatch in data types and how Ruby, and indeed, any system handles them post-serialization. It's rarely a bug in ruby's core; it’s usually a subtle misunderstanding of the data's journey.

From my experience, most often when you see values in a json file appearing to be incorrectly compared in ruby, it's because of differences in their representations post-parsing. JSON, fundamentally, is a text-based data interchange format. When you load this JSON data into Ruby using a library like `json`, it attempts to interpret these text representations into ruby objects. But here's the critical point: JSON doesn't enforce strong typing. Everything is either a string, number, boolean, null, array, or object. When Ruby's `json` library parses, it makes the best guess at the Ruby equivalent of the JSON data types. This can lead to values that look identical when printed out, but actually differ in their underlying type. For instance, a number in JSON, like `"123"` can be parsed as a string, even if we expect it as an integer and we’re trying to compare it with an actual integer object `123`.

Let's break it down into common scenarios I've encountered. First, let's look at numbers being parsed as strings. It’s a classic gotcha. Let's assume we've got a json file, `data.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "quantity": 5
}
```

Now let’s try to compare this data, using the ruby's json library:

```ruby
require 'json'

json_string = File.read('data.json')
data = JSON.parse(json_string)

puts data['id'].class  # Output: String
puts data['quantity'].class # Output: Integer

if data['id'] == 123
  puts "id matches an integer"
else
  puts "id does not match an integer"
end

if data['quantity'] == 5
  puts "quantity matches an integer"
else
  puts "quantity does not match an integer"
end
```

As you see, despite "123" seeming like it *should* be an integer, the json library parsed it as a String and the comparison failed. We get `"id does not match an integer"`. The second comparison worked as intended, where it is an actual ruby Integer.

The solution here is to be explicit about type conversion. Use `.to_i`, `.to_f` or other appropriate methods to ensure you're comparing like with like.

```ruby
require 'json'

json_string = File.read('data.json')
data = JSON.parse(json_string)


if data['id'].to_i == 123
    puts "id matches an integer"
else
    puts "id does not match an integer"
end

if data['quantity'] == 5
  puts "quantity matches an integer"
else
  puts "quantity does not match an integer"
end
```

Now, as expected, we will get `"id matches an integer"`. This example is fairly basic, but it illustrates the point clearly.

Another common issue arises when comparing numerical values with floating-point representations. Consider this json:

```json
{
  "price": 12.0,
  "discount": 0.2
}
```
```ruby
require 'json'

json_string = File.read('data.json')
data = JSON.parse(json_string)

puts data['price'].class
puts data['discount'].class

if data['price'] == 12
    puts "price matches an integer"
else
    puts "price does not match an integer"
end

if data['discount'] == 0.2
    puts "discount matches a float"
else
    puts "discount does not match a float"
end
```

In this case, both values will be interpreted as floats, that is the output is `Float` for both. We can directly compare floats, but there can be rounding errors. Even a simple decimal number can have issues when represented as a float, especially when comparing directly to other floats due to the binary representation. Therefore, avoid comparing floating point numbers for equality as direct equality is prone to error, and may not behave as expected. Instead, you may wish to compare if they are within a tolerance, i.e., consider them to be equal if their absolute difference is less than a set tolerance.

Here's a modified version, including a tolerance:
```ruby
require 'json'
json_string = File.read('data.json')
data = JSON.parse(json_string)

tolerance = 0.0001

if (data['price'] - 12).abs < tolerance
  puts "price is approximately 12"
else
   puts "price is not approximately 12"
end


if (data['discount'] - 0.2).abs < tolerance
  puts "discount is approximately 0.2"
else
  puts "discount is not approximately 0.2"
end

```

Finally, let's not forget the problem of dealing with nil and `null`. If we have:

```json
{
 "name": "example",
 "optional_field": null
}
```

```ruby
require 'json'

json_string = File.read('data.json')
data = JSON.parse(json_string)

puts data['optional_field'].class

if data['optional_field'] == nil
    puts "Optional field is nil"
else
  puts "Optional field is not nil"
end
```

Here `null` is correctly represented as `nil`, and the if statement will work as expected. However, you could face situations where you need to explicitly check for a string value as `"null"`. In those instances, a straightforward comparison will fail. The parser understands JSONs fundamental types correctly, which helps with consistency, but it is still something to be aware of.

In conclusion, the key to avoiding these problems lies in carefully considering the data types you're working with. Always ensure you're converting data to the correct type before making comparisons. It might be helpful to use the method `class` when you suspect type mismatches. Always be explicit. Avoid assuming data types.

For further exploration into this topic, I highly recommend examining the following resources:

*   **"Effective Ruby: 45 Specific Ways to Write Better Ruby" by Peter J. Jones:** While not directly about JSON, this book provides fundamental insights into ruby type handling, object equality, and common pitfalls which are relevant to this problem.
*   **The official Ruby documentation on `JSON`:** A detailed understanding of how the json library works and how it parses data will save you a lot of time.
*   **"Understanding JSON Schema" by Kris Zyp:** This resource will not solve your problem directly, but it is extremely important for managing and validating data. By defining schemas upfront you can prevent many issues related to incorrect comparisons.

By systematically addressing type mismatches, implementing tolerance checks for floating-point numbers, and using a schema, you will be in a far better position to ensure your ruby code interacts correctly with JSON data. This is one of those issues that looks tricky but is usually solvable by keeping fundamental concepts in mind.
