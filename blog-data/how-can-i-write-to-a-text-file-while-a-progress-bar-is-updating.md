Let's tackle this interesting concurrency challenge. I've seen this precise scenario pop up countless times, especially in data processing pipelines where you're logging progress while simultaneously writing results to a file. It's not about pure speed, but rather about maintaining a responsive user interface, and preventing UI freezes. This often boils down to understanding and correctly employing asynchronous programming techniques and proper resource management. I remember working on a large data ingestion system a few years back, where we were importing several gigabytes of data from various sources and needed to keep users informed about the progress while also diligently recording each processed batch. The solution we implemented then, and what I'll outline here, centers on separation of concerns and utilizing non-blocking I/O where possible.

The core issue is that writing to a file (especially sequentially) and updating a UI progress bar can both be blocking operations, meaning they can halt the execution of the current thread until they complete. If both are done on the same thread, your progress bar will update erratically, or not at all, while the file write is taking place. The ideal approach involves pushing one, if not both, of those tasks into background threads or asynchronous routines, freeing up the main UI thread to continue its work. This usually translates to something like this: your primary thread would primarily focus on UI updates (including the progress bar), while a secondary background process handles the file writing. A simple shared variable (with appropriate locking, if needed) is often used to communicate the file write progress back to the UI thread.

The simplest starting point, in Python, could use the `threading` module. This creates a new thread for writing to the file and uses a shared queue to transmit progress updates.

```python
import threading
import time
import queue

def write_to_file(filename, data_queue, progress_queue):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            total_items = len(data_queue.queue)  # We know total items at beginning.
            items_processed = 0
            while not data_queue.empty():
                item = data_queue.get()
                f.write(f"{item}\n")
                items_processed += 1
                progress_queue.put((items_processed, total_items))  # Update progress
                time.sleep(0.05) # Simulate some write/process time
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error writing to file: {e}")
    finally:
       progress_queue.put((-1, -1)) # Indicate completion

def update_progress_bar(progress_queue):
    while True:
        progress = progress_queue.get()
        if progress == (-1, -1):
            print("File write completed.")
            break
        processed, total = progress
        percentage = (processed / total) * 100
        print(f"Progress: {percentage:.2f}% ({processed}/{total})")
        time.sleep(0.1) # Simulate the update progress time.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = [f"Data line {i}" for i in range(100)]
    data_queue = queue.Queue()
    for d in data:
      data_queue.put(d)
    progress_queue = queue.Queue()


    file_thread = threading.Thread(target=write_to_file, args=("output.txt", data_queue, progress_queue))
    progress_thread = threading.Thread(target=update_progress_bar, args=(progress_queue,))

    progress_thread.start()
    file_thread.start()

    file_thread.join() #Ensure file thread is completed first.
    progress_thread.join()
    print("All processes finished.")

```

In this first example, the `write_to_file` function takes a `data_queue` to receive the data and a `progress_queue` to send updates. A separate `progress_bar` thread receives updates from the `progress_queue` and updates its output. While it's functional, this method can be improved upon. The thread-based approach, while standard, can introduce complexities with resource contention, race conditions, and debugging shared-memory structures.

A more sophisticated and preferred solution, especially with I/O-bound operations, often involves leveraging asynchronous programming. Python’s `asyncio` library provides a cooperative concurrency model, which is more efficient than threads for such operations. Here is a refined version using asyncio:

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def write_to_file_async(filename, data, progress_callback):
    try:
      with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            total_items = len(data)
            for index, item in enumerate(data):
                f.write(f"{item}\n")
                await asyncio.sleep(0.01) # Simulating I/O block.
                await progress_callback(index + 1, total_items)  # Use callback to update progress.
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error writing to file: {e}")

async def update_progress_bar_async(processed, total):
    percentage = (processed / total) * 100 if total > 0 else 0
    print(f"Progress: {percentage:.2f}% ({processed}/{total})")

async def main():
    data = [f"Async Data line {i}" for i in range(100)]
    await write_to_file_async("async_output.txt", data, update_progress_bar_async)
    print("File write completed asynchronously.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
In this asynchronous example, `write_to_file_async` simulates the file writing process and uses `asyncio.sleep` to simulate the I/O blocking. The `progress_callback` passed into the method allows the method to trigger updates. The asynchronous code does not require multiple threads but rather runs on a single loop. This method is generally more efficient and less prone to the complexities of multithreading.

Now, let’s consider a more pragmatic example where the progress update and file-writing process might interact with a more complicated data structure, say, a large pandas dataframe where you're processing rows and then logging or saving those rows as they're processed. This is a common scenario in data analysis and ETL jobs:

```python
import pandas as pd
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def process_and_log_row(row, file_path, progress_queue):
    try:
        time.sleep(0.005) # simulate row processing.
        with open(file_path, 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{row.to_string()}\n")
        progress_queue.put(1) # Indicate single row processed.
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error writing row: {e}")


def process_dataframe_parallel(df, file_path, progress_queue):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        for index, row in df.iterrows():
            executor.submit(process_and_log_row, row, file_path, progress_queue)

def track_progress(total, progress_queue):
    processed = 0
    while processed < total:
        processed += progress_queue.get()
        percentage = (processed / total) * 100
        print(f"Progress: {percentage:.2f}% ({processed}/{total})")
        time.sleep(0.05)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = {'col1': range(100), 'col2': [f'value {i}' for i in range(100)]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    progress_queue = queue.Queue()
    file_path = 'df_output.txt'

    progress_thread = threading.Thread(target=track_progress, args=(len(df), progress_queue))
    processing_thread = threading.Thread(target=process_dataframe_parallel, args=(df,file_path, progress_queue))


    progress_thread.start()
    processing_thread.start()

    processing_thread.join()
    progress_thread.join()
    print("Dataframe processing completed.")
```

In this example, `process_dataframe_parallel` uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to process each row in the dataframe concurrently, and `process_and_log_row` then saves that row, while the `track_progress` thread prints the running total from the `progress_queue`.

These approaches – using threads, asyncio, or process pools – each have their trade-offs and best use cases. Threads are fine for simple I/O or computations that don’t require shared memory access and can be simplified with a queue. `asyncio` is generally better for I/O-bound tasks. Process pools are ideal for CPU-intensive operations where you want to maximize the utilization of multiple cores.

For further reading, I would recommend David Beazley’s “Python Cookbook” for a great overview of concurrency and asynchronous techniques in Python, and for a deeper understanding of asynchrony, read “Concurrent Programming on Windows” by Joe Duffy, which, while focused on Windows, offers foundational insight applicable across platforms. For those needing to work with shared variables within threads (and avoiding race conditions), concepts such as critical sections and mutexes covered in operating system texts such as “Operating System Concepts” by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne would be insightful. Proper use of these principles will ensure that data written to disk is both consistent and the UI remains responsive, offering a better experience overall.
