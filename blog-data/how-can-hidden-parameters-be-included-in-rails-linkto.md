Okay, let's tackle this. Instead of diving straight into the syntax, let's first think about why we'd even want hidden parameters in a `link_to` tag. I've seen this need pop up more times than I care to remember, often in scenarios involving state management or passing additional context to controllers without exposing it directly in the URL. Early on in my career, I was working on an e-commerce platform, and we needed to track the source of a user's visit to specific product pages, but showing that in the URL felt clunky. That's where hidden parameters came to the rescue.

The standard `link_to` helper in Rails primarily uses query parameters to pass information. These parameters are appended to the URL and are visible in the browser's address bar. This is perfectly acceptable for many situations, but it's not ideal for sensitive data or parameters that are meant to influence server-side logic without being a persistent, addressable part of the navigation. Hidden parameters, on the other hand, are tucked away within the request's form data when a link is clicked, typically as a *post* request, allowing for more discreet data handling.

Rails doesn't offer a direct, built-in mechanism to inject hidden fields directly into the HTML generated by `link_to`. The helper is designed to generate anchors (`<a>` tags), which by their nature, do not support the concept of hidden form fields. However, this doesn't mean it's impossible to achieve. What we need is to essentially transform the `link_to` into something that triggers a form submission via javascript. This is a common pattern, and it's something I’ve relied on heavily. We accomplish this by wrapping the link within a form element and programmatically submitting the form upon clicking the link.

The primary hurdle is that the link itself must visually maintain its appearance. I have found that a combination of form generation and a bit of javascript is the optimal path for this kind of manipulation.

Here's an example of how we can achieve this using Rails view code and javascript:

```erb
<%= form_tag products_path, method: :post, id: "hidden_form_1", style: "display:none;" do %>
  <%= hidden_field_tag :source, 'external-marketing-campaign' %>
<% end %>

<%= link_to "View Product A", "#", onclick: "document.getElementById('hidden_form_1').submit(); return false;" %>

```

In this example, we're wrapping a form around the content of the link_to. The form is hidden via styling because we don’t actually want a visible form. The javascript triggers the submission of the invisible form when the user clicks the link. This approach provides us with a way to send hidden parameters to the `products_path` as a *post* request, along with the `source` parameter.

Let's break down another use case I've encountered—passing information about a specific action context. In a dashboard application, I needed to enable bulk deletion of items, but I didn't want to expose the IDs in the URL during the navigation phase. Here's how I implemented it using a similar technique:

```erb
<% item_ids = [1, 2, 3, 4] %>

<%= form_tag delete_items_path, method: :post, id: "hidden_form_2", style: "display:none;" do %>
  <% item_ids.each do |id| %>
      <%= hidden_field_tag 'item_ids[]', id %>
  <% end %>
  <%= hidden_field_tag :context, 'bulk_delete' %>
<% end %>

<%= link_to "Delete Items", "#", onclick: "document.getElementById('hidden_form_2').submit(); return false;" %>
```

In this instance, an array of `item_ids` is passed as hidden fields. Note the use of the square brackets `[]` in the field name— this allows Rails to collect the values into an array in your controller parameters. We also include a `context` field to inform the server about the operation being performed.

It’s important to understand that submitting a form this way is technically creating a new http request which could, if not handled correctly, affect the rendering context. We need to ensure that our routes and controllers are configured to appropriately handle *post* requests. If you try to access the path in the browser via a standard GET request, the hidden form values will be absent.

Now let's discuss an edge case where you might want to send a complex object as part of your hidden form data. Let’s say you wanted to pass user preferences that were temporarily generated in javascript. You could send them as a serialized string using a similar method:

```erb
<%= form_tag update_preferences_path, method: :post, id: "hidden_form_3", style: "display:none;" do %>
  <%= hidden_field_tag :preferences, "" %>
<% end %>

<%= link_to "Save Settings", "#", onclick: "
    const preferences = {theme: 'dark', fontSize: 16, notifications: true};
    const form = document.getElementById('hidden_form_3');
    form.querySelector('input[name=\\'preferences\\']').value = JSON.stringify(preferences);
    form.submit(); return false;
  " %>
```

Here we're using javascript to dynamically serialize a javascript object to a string using `JSON.stringify` and assign it to the hidden input’s value before the form is submitted. You'd need to deserialize this on the server-side, typically using `JSON.parse`. This technique is useful for situations where data manipulation on the client-side before server submission is required.

It is paramount, as with all user input, to carefully sanitize and validate this data server-side to avoid security vulnerabilities. Don't trust the client. Always double-check on the server.

For further in-depth understanding, I recommend delving into the mechanics of HTTP requests, specifically the difference between GET and POST requests, and how forms are processed in browsers. The book "HTTP: The Definitive Guide" by David Gourley and Brian Totty is an exceptional resource for understanding the underlying protocols. For a Rails-specific perspective, examine the source code for the `link_to` helper and how Rails processes form data within controller actions. Additionally, reading through the Rails documentation on form helpers will give a deeper understanding on how to use them effectively to manipulate the HTML structure.

This method of adding hidden parameters to `link_to` is not immediately intuitive but it offers a powerful mechanism for passing data in more nuanced ways than standard query parameters would allow. It’s a technique I’ve found particularly valuable for building complex and robust web applications, and a crucial aspect of creating usable and secure web applications.
