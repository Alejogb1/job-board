, let's unpack this. It's a common scenario, and frankly, one I’ve tackled countless times over the years. You've got a product view in your rails application, presumably with some kind of form, and you need to get that submitted data—a specific field— into your model. Now, there are several ways to approach this, each with its own nuances. It’s not about just throwing code at the problem; it’s about understanding the underlying mechanics of how rails handles form submissions and then crafting the solution that best fits your specific context.

The core principle here revolves around correctly defining the routes, controller actions, and model attributes. The form in your view, when submitted, sends a request to a particular controller action. That controller action then needs to: (a) identify the relevant model instance (typically through an id), and (b) update that instance using the submitted data. Let's consider the most straightforward setup first and then dive into some variations.

A typical setup might involve a 'Product' model and a view that lets you update, say, a product’s name. The form tag helper within your rails view would usually look something like this:

```ruby
<%= form_for @product, url: product_path(@product), method: :patch do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :name %>
  <%= f.text_field :name %>
  <%= f.submit "Update Name" %>
<% end %>
```

In this snippet, `@product` is an instance variable holding a specific `Product` object that you have passed from your controller. The `form_for` helper intelligently infers the fields within your `Product` object from the given `@product` instance, creating the necessary html for the input. You’re directing the submission to the `update` action using the `:patch` method.

The corresponding controller action in `products_controller.rb` would then be:

```ruby
def update
  @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  if @product.update(product_params)
    redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product name was successfully updated.'
  else
    render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end

private

def product_params
  params.require(:product).permit(:name)
end
```

Here, the `update` action locates the specific product using `Product.find(params[:id])`, then updates the product record with the parameters obtained using `product_params`. The `product_params` method employs strong parameters, which are crucial for security as they permit only specific model attributes to be updated from the form submission, preventing unwanted mass-assignment exploits. Crucially, note the `.permit(:name)` part, that ensures that only the name attribute is updated by the form. This is where you specify exactly what attributes you're pulling from the form.

This process captures the "name" form field and updates the corresponding attribute of the product model.

Now, let's consider a slightly more complex scenario. What if you need to capture data from a nested form, perhaps related to a child model association? Suppose your `Product` model `has_many :variants`. In the view, you could have:

```ruby
<%= form_for @product, url: product_path(@product), method: :patch do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :name %>
  <%= f.text_field :name %>

  <%= f.fields_for :variants do |variant_form| %>
    <%= variant_form.label :sku %>
    <%= variant_form.text_field :sku %>
  <% end %>

  <%= f.submit "Update Product and Variants" %>
<% end %>
```

The corresponding update action would need to be modified like this:

```ruby
def update
  @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  if @product.update(product_params)
      redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product and variants updated successfully.'
    else
      render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
end

private

def product_params
    params.require(:product).permit(:name, variants_attributes: [:id, :sku, :_destroy])
end
```

Here, `variants_attributes` is used to capture nested form fields, `[:id]` allows updates to pre-existing variants using the id field, and `:_destroy` enables removing of existing variants.

Finally, consider a scenario where you're capturing a field that isn’t directly part of the `Product` model but perhaps an associated setting or attribute from another model via an association or even from a join table. For example, lets say we have an additional model 'Settings' that `belongs_to` 'Product' and we want to capture an associated setting from that model in the product update view.

```ruby
<%= form_for @product, url: product_path(@product), method: :patch do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :name %>
  <%= f.text_field :name %>

  <%= f.fields_for :setting, @product.setting do |setting_form| %>
    <%= setting_form.label :theme %>
    <%= setting_form.text_field :theme %>
  <% end %>
  <%= f.submit "Update Product and Settings" %>
<% end %>
```

And your `update` action could be modified to look like this:

```ruby
def update
  @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  if @product.update(product_params)
    redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product and settings were updated successfully.'
  else
    render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end

private

def product_params
    params.require(:product).permit(:name, setting_attributes: [:id, :theme])
end
```

The principles remain the same: you use `fields_for` to work with associated models, and you permit the relevant attributes within your `product_params` method. Notice that if a setting record doesn't exist for the current product you might need to create one. That kind of logic could potentially be handled in the `new` action on the controller, instantiating a new 'Setting' object when the product object is instantiated, or more appropriately on the model layer, depending on the required behaviour.

Key aspects to pay attention to when you're working with this include ensuring:

1.  **Correct Routes:** Your routes need to be set up correctly so that the form submission points to the appropriate controller action.
2.  **Strong Parameters:** Always use strong parameters to protect against mass assignment vulnerabilities.
3.  **Error Handling:** Proper error handling ensures that if validations fail, the user is presented with relevant information, and the form isn't simply reloaded with a blank slate.
4.  **Nested Attributes:** Be mindful of correctly naming and permitting attributes when dealing with nested forms or associations.
5.  **Model Validations:** Always define model-level validations to safeguard the integrity of data entered through the form.

For further understanding, I’d strongly recommend diving into the Rails documentation on form helpers, especially `form_for` and `fields_for`. The guide on 'Active Record Basics' is also invaluable for understanding how data flows between your models and database. Additionally, "Agile Web Development with Rails" by Sam Ruby and David Thomas provides excellent, practically-oriented explanations that will prove helpful. Understanding the underlying architecture in more detail will always give you a better handle on situations like these, and prevent headaches down the line. You’ll find these concepts coming up over and over again. It's fundamental rails stuff.
