Alright, let's tackle this. It’s a situation I've bumped into more than once, particularly when working with Node.js and dealing with asynchronous operations within array iterations. Seeing that empty array after pushing data in what seems like a straightforward loop can definitely throw you for a loop (no pun intended). The core issue stems from how javascript handles asynchrony, and how it interacts with the procedural nature of a `forEach` loop. Let’s break it down.

The fundamental problem lies in the fact that `forEach` is synchronous. While you can include asynchronous operations *within* the callback of a `forEach` loop, the loop itself will not wait for those asynchronous operations to complete. Think of it like this: the loop iterates through your array, and for each element, it fires off an asynchronous task. However, the loop doesn't pause to see those tasks through. It completes all iterations immediately, and then the asynchronous tasks execute whenever their time comes, not necessarily in the order of the loop's iterations, or necessarily before you look at the results.

This becomes a problem when you’re trying to modify an array inside the asynchronous callback of the `forEach` loop. The loop finishes, the array is returned/inspected before the callbacks have completed, and therefore, you see an empty array, or an array not yet populated with the data from those asynchronous actions.

I recall one project where we were fetching data from multiple APIs based on an initial set of IDs, and then trying to aggregate the results into a final array. The code looked something like this, and as you can imagine, yielded an empty result initially:

```javascript
async function fetchAndProcessData(ids) {
  let results = [];

  ids.forEach(async (id) => {
    const data = await fetchDataFromApi(id); // pretend this is an async call
    results.push(data);
  });

  return results;
}

// example usage
async function main(){
    const ids = [1,2,3];
    const finalResults = await fetchAndProcessData(ids);
    console.log(finalResults); // often shows [] or partially populated
}

main();

async function fetchDataFromApi(id) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve({id:id, value:"data " + id}), Math.random()*100); //simulating an async call
    })
}
```

The issue here isn’t that the `push` operation is faulty. The issue is that `fetchAndProcessData` returns the `results` array *before* all the asynchronous `fetchDataFromApi` calls have had a chance to finish and push data into that array.

So, how do you solve this? The most straightforward approach is to switch from a `forEach` loop to something that respects the asynchronous nature of the operations you're performing. Several approaches work:

**1. Using `for...of` with `await`:** The `for...of` loop will iterate over the array, and we can use `await` to pause the loop until each asynchronous operation has resolved. This method preserves the order of the data based on the order of iterations, which is important in some situations.

```javascript
async function fetchAndProcessDataCorrectedForOf(ids) {
    let results = [];

    for (const id of ids) {
      const data = await fetchDataFromApi(id);
      results.push(data);
    }

    return results;
}


// example usage
async function mainForOf(){
    const ids = [1,2,3];
    const finalResults = await fetchAndProcessDataCorrectedForOf(ids);
    console.log(finalResults); // shows the populated array as expected
}

mainForOf();
```

**2. Using `Promise.all` and `.map`:** If the order of the results isn't crucial, we can use the combination of `map` and `Promise.all`. The `.map` will transform the array of ids into an array of promises. The `Promise.all` will wait for all those promises to resolve, and then we will return the values of the resolved promises. It is a powerful way to make your code run concurrently for improved performance in situations where order is not critical.

```javascript
async function fetchAndProcessDataCorrectedPromiseAll(ids) {
    const promises = ids.map(id => fetchDataFromApi(id));
    const results = await Promise.all(promises);
    return results;
}

// example usage
async function mainPromiseAll(){
    const ids = [1,2,3];
    const finalResults = await fetchAndProcessDataCorrectedPromiseAll(ids);
    console.log(finalResults); // shows the populated array as expected
}

mainPromiseAll();
```

**3. Using a `reduce` with `async/await` and a promise:** For more complex scenarios where aggregation or transformation is required beyond simple array population, a reduce with async/await and promise resolution can be helpful. This method is valuable when you need to process previous results as you iterate.

```javascript
async function fetchAndProcessDataCorrectedReduce(ids) {
  return ids.reduce(async (accumulatorPromise, id) => {
        const accumulator = await accumulatorPromise;
        const data = await fetchDataFromApi(id);
        accumulator.push(data);
        return accumulator;
    }, Promise.resolve([]))
}

// example usage
async function mainReduce(){
    const ids = [1,2,3];
    const finalResults = await fetchAndProcessDataCorrectedReduce(ids);
    console.log(finalResults); // shows the populated array as expected
}

mainReduce();
```

The choice of which method to use often boils down to the specific constraints and requirements of your project, whether you care about preserving the initial order, or if you need to manipulate previous elements. In most cases, the `for...of` loop or the `map` with `Promise.all` will address the issue effectively, and offer greater predictability when dealing with asynchronous calls within array iterations.

For further reading, I highly recommend digging into the "You Don't Know JS" series by Kyle Simpson, particularly the volumes on "Async & Performance" and "ES6 & Beyond." They offer a very detailed and practical dive into the core mechanisms of asynchronous javascript. Also, "Effective JavaScript" by David Herman provides a pragmatic approach to javascript best practices, and has some excellent advice on working with asynchronous operations. Finally, exploring the ECMAScript specification itself regarding Promises will prove very beneficial for mastering async JavaScript.
