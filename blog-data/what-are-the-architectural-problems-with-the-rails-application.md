Alright, let’s talk about the architectural quirks you often stumble upon in larger Rails applications. It's a topic I've spent a good chunk of my career grappling with, migrating and refactoring my way out of some truly interesting messes. It’s never a single, colossal flaw, but rather a collection of decisions made over time that, when combined, create headaches. I've seen the same patterns emerge across various projects – and that, in itself, is valuable insight.

One of the primary concerns that tends to surface is the notorious ‘fat model’ problem, or even more precisely, the ‘god model’ antipattern. In many early Rails projects, especially those that grew organically, the model layer becomes an indiscriminate dumping ground for all business logic. Instead of focusing purely on data persistence and retrieval, these models end up handling everything from complex calculations to interactions with external services and validations that should rightly belong elsewhere. I remember a particularly challenging e-commerce platform where the ‘product’ model, in addition to managing product attributes and database operations, was also handling inventory management, discount calculations, and even the generation of order summaries for emails. This not only bloated the model, making it difficult to maintain and test, but it also violated the single responsibility principle, making changes risky and error-prone. Any modification, even seemingly minor, had the potential to impact other unrelated areas of the application. It was a nightmare to debug.

Secondly, tight coupling between layers is a recurring issue. Often you’ll see controllers directly invoking methods on models that should only be accessed via a service layer or a repository. This makes it hard to test controllers in isolation and creates hidden dependencies that become difficult to untangle later. This direct communication between layers makes changes anywhere in the system complex and fragile. I’ve witnessed projects where a simple schema change in the database caused cascading errors through controllers, services, and views because everything was interconnected so tightly. Refactoring such code is akin to performing open-heart surgery – slow, painstaking, and with a high potential for unexpected complications.

Third, a lack of explicit service layers is a common pain point. In many cases, business logic is scattered throughout the controllers and models, making it difficult to understand the flow of data and the responsibilities of each component. Without a designated service layer, complex operations become increasingly hard to abstract, test and manage. Imagine trying to implement an A/B testing system when all your logic is embedded directly into the controllers; adding a new test or modifying the existing one can become incredibly arduous. I recall an old project where our billing processes were implemented directly in the controller action associated with payments, along with the logic of applying promotions and coupons, and integrating with different payment gateways. This made it so difficult to add a new gateway, and every modification in the billing process was accompanied by a long-winded and nerve-wracking process of refactoring.

Let me illustrate this with some code examples:

**Example 1: A Fat Model**

```ruby
# This is a simplified example, but it highlights the core problem
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  def calculate_discounted_price(user)
    if user.premium?
      price * 0.90 # Premium users get a 10% discount
    else
      price # Regular users pay full price
    end
  end

  def notify_stock_low
     if quantity < 10
      Mailer.notify_admin("Product #{name} stock low").deliver_now
     end
  end
end

# In this example, the Product model is doing more than handling data, and is responsible for logic that does not necessarily belong to it.
```

**Example 2: Tight Coupling**

```ruby
# A controller that directly accesses the model
class OrdersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @order = Order.create(order_params) # Direct model creation

     # Example of business logic in the controller itself
      @order.update(total: @order.items.sum(&:price))


    if @order.valid?
      redirect_to @order, notice: 'Order was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end
end

# Here, the controller is creating the model instance directly, which is then updated using complex logic, it is not using a designated service.
```

**Example 3: Missing Service Layer**

```ruby
# Without a service layer, you might find code like this in the controller
class UsersController < ApplicationController
   def update
       @user = User.find(params[:id])

        if params[:update_email]
            @user.email = params[:email]
            @user.save!
            UserMailer.email_updated(@user).deliver_now
         elsif params[:update_address]
            @user.address = params[:address]
            @user.save!
          end
        redirect_to @user, notice: 'User successfully updated'
   end
end

# The logic for handling different updates are directly handled by the controller, rather than a service that should handle it.
```

Now, let’s discuss practical solutions. Firstly, you should aim to move business logic out of the models and controllers and into service objects or interactors. Service objects should handle complex operations that involve multiple models or external systems, while interactors can be used for specific use cases involving business rules. For example, instead of calculating discounts directly in the `Product` model, it could delegate that logic to a `DiscountService`. Similarly, controllers should invoke operations via these services rather than working directly with model instances, thus decoupling the layers and increasing maintainability.

Secondly, consider implementing a repository pattern for data access. This creates an additional layer of abstraction between the models and the data storage mechanisms. This allows for more flexibility and testability, and can become invaluable if you need to, for instance, switch to a different database system. The repository pattern ensures that you are not dependent on the specific implementation of the database or how the data is retrieved.

Thirdly, a clear and consistent directory structure is crucial. As an application grows, it's important to organize code into logical components and directories. This typically involves having dedicated directories for services, interactors, repositories, form objects and other similar elements. It’s about creating a system that is easy to understand and navigate, enabling developers to quickly find the code they need without spending too much time locating the relevant files.

To delve deeper into these concepts, I’d highly recommend exploring the following resources:

*   **"Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" by Martin Fowler:** This is a foundational text for understanding enterprise-level design patterns, and is relevant even when talking about Rails apps.
*   **"Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" by Eric Evans:** While not Rails-specific, it provides invaluable guidance on organizing business logic into domains and subdomains, which is very useful when designing the architecture of large Rails applications.
*  **“Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code” by Martin Fowler**: This book will help understand how to move from a "fat" Rails project to a lean, well structured one.

Ultimately, building maintainable Rails applications isn't about adhering to a rigid set of rules, but rather applying design principles consistently and understanding how different architectural choices will impact your project over time. It's an ongoing process, a constant balancing act between features and maintainability. My experience tells me that by addressing these problems early on, you can save yourself a lot of headaches down the line.
