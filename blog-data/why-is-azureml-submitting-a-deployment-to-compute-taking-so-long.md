alright, so you're seeing azureml deployments to compute taking forever, eh? i’ve definitely been there. it's a frustrating situation, and i know exactly what you mean when it feels like it's just spinning its wheels. let me walk you through some of the usual suspects and things to check based on my past experiences, along with a few code bits to help diagnose.

first off, let's talk about the compute target itself. is it actually *there* and ready? i've had times where i’ve sworn i spun up a compute cluster, only to find that it was either still provisioning or had gotten deallocated. in the azure ml studio, it should be showing a "running" status. if it's in a "creating" state or, worse, "failed," well, there's your problem. it’s the foundation and if that's shaky, everything else will be slow. the vm sizes matter, as if the machines you chose are too small it is another obvious cause that it could take long to load things or just fail. 

another thing i’ve stumbled into more than once is resource contention. if other azure services are hammering the same region or availability zone, azureml deployments will definitely feel the pinch. i once spent nearly a whole afternoon trying to figure out why deployments were taking almost an hour. turns out, a massive data ingestion process was clogging up all the network bandwidth within our vnet. it wasn't azureml’s fault, just bad timing and planning on our end. so, do some checks if you have other things running in the same vicinity. you might need to look at azure monitor to see the resource utilization in that specific region, paying close attention to cpu, memory, and network.

container image size is another biggie. azureml deployments use container images, and if your image is gigantic, pulling it down to the compute instance will take time. each layer in the container contributes to the overall size, and these are typically downloaded separately. have you built a custom image or are you using a standard one? if it is a custom one, did you optimize it? for instance, i once inherited a project that was shipping almost all of their data with the container image, thinking it was better to have it local for speed. it turned the containers over 10 gigabytes. the deployment took almost 1 hour to just pull the image, not even counting the actual process of deploying it.

here's a snippet demonstrating how you can check your container image size using docker:

```bash
docker image inspect your_image_name:your_image_tag --format='{{.Size}}'
```

replace `your_image_name:your_image_tag` with the name and tag of the container image used in your azureml deployment. this will return the size in bytes. try to keep it small by using optimized bases, and avoid shipping huge unnecessary dependencies or data.

then there's dependency hell. if your deployment environment needs to install a long list of python packages, that can add to the overall deployment duration. it is more common than one may think. during the deployment process, azureml installs those requirements by using pip, and sometimes pip takes a while when resolving a tree of dependencies and downloading packages. i remember in one project, i had not pinned my dependencies properly. so, when the azureml environment was being deployed, pip would just grab the latest versions of everything, sometimes resulting in incompatibility issues or just taking long to resolve. you should aim to make your requirements minimal, using only what your service truly needs, and, also, version-pin them.

here's an example of how to specify a minimal, version-pinned requirements file:

```text
numpy==1.23.5
pandas==1.5.2
scikit-learn==1.2.0
```

and, don't forget to consider the deployment configuration itself. if you're doing a real-time endpoint deployment, for example, you could be facing problems with slow start-up scripts. i've seen people deploying models that first try to load data from some external blob storage into ram on the compute when the deployment starts. that's a big no no, especially with bigger datasets. the model should be able to load, ideally, quickly and start serving predictions on demand, not spending valuable time loading data. start-up code should be as minimal as possible.

let’s get a bit more hands-on. here’s how you can create an environment object for azureml specifying a docker image and a pip requirements file:

```python
from azure.ml import Environment
from azure.ml.entities import BuildContext

env = Environment(
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04:latest", # or custom image
    conda_file="conda.yaml",
    pip_requirements=["requirements.txt"],
)

env.build = BuildContext(path="src/")
```

this code snippet defines an azureml environment using a pre-built docker image or you can replace the image with your custom image. it also specifies a conda environment file and, importantly, a pip requirements file that contains the version-pinned dependencies you need.

then the actual deployment code. here you also can have things taking a long time to deploy, such as the number of instances you set in your deployments. if you are setting up more instances, it will be more time to deploy the model, so keep that in mind when checking on deployment times. you should experiment with the minimum required instances for your use case, otherwise, you will be wasting money and time.

now, about the actual 'why' it takes so long. it's rarely one single reason. it's usually a combination of these factors, and it often feels like a process of elimination. you might have to dive into azure monitor logs for your machine learning workspace, experiment with different image builds, and meticulously check your deployment configs. and, this might be a bit obvious, but check if you have a good enough internet connection. sometimes it is just that.

now, just for fun, why did the programmer quit his job? because he didn't get arrays.

for resources, instead of just giving you links, i suggest a deep dive into microsoft's own documentation for azure machine learning, especially the sections on environment management, compute targets, and deployment strategies. also, look at books about optimizing docker containers and python environments; there are some gems out there that talk about optimizing for production environments. and that will surely be useful for you in the future. i also recommend looking at the paper "understanding the performance of cloud applications" by arun kumar et al. it's a bit old, but it has useful general information about why things are taking a long time to do stuff in the cloud.
    
anyways, that is what i've gathered from years of battling with azureml deployments. hopefully, this helps you track down the root of your slow deployments. let me know if you have more questions, or if you find any new issues.
