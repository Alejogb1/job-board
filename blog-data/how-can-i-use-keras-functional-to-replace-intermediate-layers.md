,  It's something I've had to do a fair bit over the years, specifically in some older projects where models were constructed more organically and then required surgical alterations later. It's a common scenario, and Keras's functional API is, thankfully, up to the task.

The core idea when using the Keras functional api to replace intermediate layers is that you aren't directly manipulating the layers within an existing `keras.Model` instance. Instead, you're rebuilding parts of the computational graph, while reusing the weights from the original model. This is particularly useful when you want to maintain the learned parameters of certain portions of your network while substituting a different architecture for others. It’s more of a graph manipulation rather than a layer-by-layer edit.

Let's establish a fundamental concept: in a functional model, each layer is a *callable object* that takes a tensor as input and produces another tensor as output. This output tensor can then be used as input to the next layer, creating a directed acyclic graph. This graph structure is what makes it possible to re-route tensors and integrate alternative layer configurations, or even entire sub-networks.

Now, consider a hypothetical scenario from a few years back. I was working on a project involving image classification using a model that, due to some initial limitations, ended up with a series of dense layers that were suboptimal. The performance was lackluster, and what we really needed was a more convolutional approach in those early stages. Simply put, we had to tear out some dense layers and inject a small convnet.

Here’s how I approached it:

First, I needed to identify the exact input and output tensors associated with the layers I intended to replace. Because it's a functional model, every layer has an `input` and `output` attribute of type `keras.tensor.Tensor`, which are crucial here. We can't directly access or manipulate the layers in a functional model. We are just manipulating the tensor flow.

**Example Code Snippet 1: Identifying Input and Output Tensors**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers

# create a sample model (like my initial, flawed one)
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(x) # the 'flawed' dense block
output_tensor = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

original_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)

# now, we identify the tensor *before* the flawed dense block
tensor_before_dense_block = original_model.layers[1].input
# and the tensor *after* the flawed dense block, but before the output layer
tensor_after_dense_block = original_model.layers[3].output

print("Input Tensor of the dense block:", tensor_before_dense_block)
print("Output Tensor of the dense block:", tensor_after_dense_block)
```

In the snippet above, `tensor_before_dense_block` points to the input tensor of the first problematic dense layer (`original_model.layers[1]` because `original_model.layers[0]` is the input layer itself), and `tensor_after_dense_block` refers to the output of the last dense layer within that section. These two tensors are our anchor points.

Now, with these anchor points established, we build the replacement layers. This involves defining a new series of layers that starts where the old layers ended and concludes at the same output tensor, allowing the data to flow where the previous layers once did. It's essentially grafting a new branch onto the existing computation graph.

**Example Code Snippet 2: Constructing the Replacement Layers**

```python
# Construct new convolutional layers to replace dense block

conv_x = layers.Reshape((28, 28, 1))(tensor_before_dense_block) # Reshape for conv layers
conv_x = layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv_x)
conv_x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2))(conv_x)
conv_x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv_x)
conv_x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2))(conv_x)
conv_x = layers.Flatten()(conv_x)

# The output of the conv block MUST have the same dimension as tensor_after_dense_block
# In this case, we are replacing the flattened dense layers with a flattened convolution
# which outputs a tensor that can feed into layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax').

new_output_tensor = conv_x #the output of the new layers.

# now, construct the new model, connecting the new branch to original model

output_of_orig_model = original_model.layers[-1](new_output_tensor)

new_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_of_orig_model)

# Verify shapes. The output shape of the last layer should be equal to the output of the old model
# The important part is not to change any layer that comes after the replacement layers, i.e., the final dense layer.

print("Output shape of original model:", original_model.layers[-1].output.shape)
print("Output shape of new model:", new_model.layers[-1].output.shape)

```

In the example above, `conv_x` is the output of our convolutional block. Crucially, the output shape of `conv_x` must be compatible as input to the layer originally connected to the end of our old dense block. We are not only replacing layers but also ensuring that the data flowing through the new layers, in this case, after reshaping and passing through a few convolutional layers, is shaped correctly for the downstream layers.

Finally, the `new_model` is constructed with the original input, our new branch instead of the dense block, and the original output tensor of the entire model. The new model retains the weights of the other layers from original model which we didn't replace. The key is to reconnect the computations correctly, while the layers we didn’t touch are the same as before.

Let me give you one more practical example of a situation I've encountered. Imagine, instead of reshaping the output from the original block, you had two different paths which then concatenated back together. This requires a slightly different approach.

**Example Code Snippet 3: Replacing Layers with a Branch and Merge**

```python
# assume we want to replace a single dense layer with a more complex branch

input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
split_point = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x) # we are replacing this
y = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(split_point)
output_tensor = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(y)

original_model_branch = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)

tensor_before_replacement = original_model_branch.layers[1].output
tensor_after_replacement = original_model_branch.layers[3].output

# Construct the new branch

branch1 = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(tensor_before_replacement)
branch2 = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(tensor_before_replacement)

merged = layers.concatenate([branch1, branch2])

new_output_tensor_branch = merged # we feed the merged tensors to the rest of the model.

output_of_original_model_branch = original_model_branch.layers[-1](new_output_tensor_branch)

new_branch_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_of_original_model_branch)

print("Shape of original model output", original_model_branch.layers[-1].output.shape)
print("Shape of new model output", new_branch_model.layers[-1].output.shape)

```

Here, we replace the single `split_point` with two branches, which are concatenated. The `concatenate` layer ensures the two branches are joined together to produce a tensor which can feed the output layer of our model. The general idea is still the same: find the input and output tensors, reconstruct the graph, and finally rebuild the model.

As a note, when doing something like this, always make sure to carefully check layer dimensions and data types. Often, subtle issues in mismatched dimensions are easy to miss and can lead to unexpected errors during runtime. The functional api is very powerful, but requires some careful planning and tracing of your tensors.

For deeper understanding on this, I would recommend reading "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet, the creator of Keras. It provides an excellent and detailed explanation of the Keras API and model building principles. Also, exploring research papers on model surgery or pruning can offer additional context and insights, even though those topics focus on a different goal. "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop, is an excellent resource for mathematical foundations of these methods.

In essence, replacing intermediate layers with Keras Functional API isn't about physically altering an existing model object. It's about strategically building a new model by re-routing tensor flow, leveraging the functional API to construct and integrate replacement components. The trick is not to modify individual layers but to reconstruct the paths using a computational graph and re-attach everything back together. I hope that helps, and remember always to double check your shapes!
