Alright, let's unpack this peculiar issue with ip links and macvlan containers disconnecting shortly after being established. I’ve definitely been down this rabbit hole a few times, and trust me, it can be more than a little frustrating. The symptoms you’re describing – the initial successful connection followed by an immediate break – often point to a few key underlying problems, and it's usually not the macvlan configuration itself that's the culprit. Let me share some insights based on my past encounters and how to troubleshoot them effectively.

The core of the problem generally boils down to either improper network address configuration, conflicts with existing network services, or, less commonly, inconsistencies with underlying kernel modules. Often, it’s not a single issue, but a confluence of factors interacting poorly.

Let’s start with what’s likely the most common suspect: ip address conflicts. When you set up a macvlan interface, you are essentially creating a virtualized network interface attached to a parent interface. Each container or virtual machine on that macvlan needs a unique ip address. If two entities on the same macvlan or even elsewhere on your host are using the same ip address, you'll witness intermittent network disconnections. This stems from the inherent nature of layer-2 networking; duplicate mac addresses on a network segment will invariably cause chaos and disconnections as the switches struggle to route traffic. The same principle applies here, since macvlan interfaces are sharing the layer-2 segment.

I recall a specific project where I was deploying a microservices architecture using docker containers and macvlan. Initially, I thought everything was set up correctly, but the services would inconsistently lose connectivity. It took me some time, but it turned out the issue was that my dhcp server was assigning the same ip addresses to the container via the dhcp lease as well as another device on the same network as the host. When the containers initially connect, they may acquire a valid address, but once the network senses a conflicting ip, the connection collapses. The quick fix involved statically assigning ip addresses within the subnet allocated for my containers or setting up dhcp reservations.

Now, let's move to another potential problem: conflicts with other network services. This can be particularly troublesome when there are other tools managing the same interface. For example, if you have NetworkManager or similar services automatically attempting to manage interfaces which you have manually defined with ip link, they may try to override your settings or create additional routes that cause problems. It can manifest in unpredictable behaviour, especially after a few seconds while the auto-discovery processes take place. When you are working with macvlans, it’s typically best to ensure these services are not attempting to manage the specific interfaces you’re working with by creating explicit rules to prevent this.

Lastly, while less common, inconsistencies with kernel modules can lead to these kind of networking problems. Macvlan relies on the 'macvlan' kernel module; if there’s an issue with it, like a missing module or version mismatch, then strange things can happen. This rarely happens, but it’s something to keep in mind as an outside possibility.

To provide concrete examples, let's look at how we would actually address these in practice.

**Example 1: Correcting IP Address Conflicts**

Suppose our host network interface is 'eth0' and we're creating a macvlan called 'macvlan0' associated with eth0. Let's assume we’re creating this interface for a docker container that needs to have ip address 192.168.100.10 with a netmask of 24. This code will make the initial connection but it’s important to note that it won't persist across reboots or network interface restarts:

```bash
# Create the macvlan interface.
sudo ip link add link eth0 name macvlan0 type macvlan mode bridge

# Bring up the interface
sudo ip link set macvlan0 up

# Assign an IP address.
sudo ip addr add 192.168.100.10/24 dev macvlan0

#Now, this address must be exclusive
#Check if this is conflicting with another device or container
ip neighbor show dev macvlan0
#and other interfaces
ip neighbor show dev eth0

#If there's another device with the same ip, the connection may fail immediately

```

In a scenario like this, and as mentioned earlier, you might find that even if you issue the commands to set an address, a dhcp lease from the router could be conflicting. This command alone won't prevent the conflict, but it will help us to see it if it occurs after initially setting the ip. To prevent this, you would either need to configure a dhcp reservation or use static addresses for the container. If you have a docker environment, this can be achieved with the `docker network create` command, with custom subnets.

**Example 2: Managing NetworkManager Interference**

Now, let’s address the problem of network management tools potentially interfering. Here's how you might prevent NetworkManager from touching your manually created interfaces. You need to create a configuration file in the NetworkManager configuration folder:

```bash
# Create a configuration file to ignore the macvlan0 interface
echo "[keyfile]" | sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-unmanaged-interfaces.conf
echo "unmanaged-devices=interface-name:macvlan0" | sudo tee -a /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-unmanaged-interfaces.conf

#Restart networkmanager to apply the changes
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

This command will add an exclusion so that `NetworkManager` does not attempt to interfere with the macvlan interface, thus preventing it from trying to manage and override the existing configuration.

**Example 3: Addressing Kernel Module Issues**

Let’s say you suspect a kernel module problem. While this is rarer, it’s good to verify. You can check if the macvlan module is loaded using this:

```bash
# Check if the macvlan module is loaded
lsmod | grep macvlan

# If it's not loaded, try loading it:
sudo modprobe macvlan

#After loading, check if the connection is stable
```

If the module is not loaded, then the command above will load it. Check your kernel logs if the issue persists. In rare cases, you might need to update your kernel or recompile the module, though I would strongly suggest against that in a production setting, unless you are intimately familiar with the process and its implications.

In terms of recommended reading, I’d suggest diving into the following resources. For a comprehensive understanding of networking in Linux environments, “TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols” by Richard Stevens is still the go-to bible. While it's not macvlan specific, it's invaluable for understanding the foundation. For more practical implementations and in-depth Linux specifics, check out “Linux Network Administrator’s Guide” by Olaf Kirch and Terry Dawson. Although older, its concepts are fundamental and still very relevant. Finally, for more up-to-date information on macvlans specifically, consult the official Linux kernel documentation found on kernel.org. These documents are highly technical but essential for the details.

I hope this helps provide a clear understanding of the typical pitfalls and how to address them when working with macvlan interfaces. It’s often a process of elimination, but these are the most common reasons why those connections might drop after a few seconds. Remember, methodical troubleshooting is key; start with the simplest possible setup and gradually add complexity. Good luck.
