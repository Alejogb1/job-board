Okay, let's tackle this. It's a problem I’ve certainly bumped into a few times during my career, often in situations where time wasn't exactly on my side. The symptom—a task group not behaving as expected when triggering downstream tasks—can stem from a few core issues in Airflow. We'll go through those, and I'll even include some code snippets to illustrate the points better.

My experience points to a hierarchy of potential problems. First, we need to be sure the task group itself is concluding successfully. Then, we move to its *relationship* with subsequent tasks. Let’s look deeper.

First, a task group’s state reflects the state of its contained tasks. If, for example, any task within the group fails, and the task group itself isn’t configured to handle it (such as with a *trigger_rule* set to “all_done”), the task group won’t be marked as successful, preventing downstream tasks from running. This is not about downstream tasks; it's the task group *itself* not finishing. I once spent hours debugging a dag because one task inside a TaskGroup was experiencing random network hiccups, and was causing the whole group to hang and preventing the downstream tasks from even begining. That's lesson number one: task group success isn’t automatic – it requires successful completion of every task it encompasses (or a specific triggering mechanism).

Second, and this is quite common, is a misunderstanding of how Airflow handles dependencies involving task groups. Specifically, simply having a downstream task after a TaskGroup may not be enough, depending on how dependencies are defined. For the simplest case, when using the bitshift operator `>>`, one needs to make sure the left side is the task group instance and the right side is the downstream task, and it’s essential that the TaskGroup's ID itself isn't accidentally used. In older airflow versions, the task group's ID would not correctly trigger.

Finally, a not infrequent source of headaches is the improper usage of trigger rules (i.e., *trigger_rule*) within either the task group or the downstream tasks. It's easy to introduce confusion here by setting a rule on a task group that conflicts with what the downstream task expects.

Let's illustrate these with examples.

**Example 1: Task Failure within the TaskGroup**

Here, the `task_c` within the TaskGroup, is purposefully configured to fail in the `on_failure_callback`. This will prevent the whole task group from being marked as successful.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.utils.trigger_rule import TriggerRule
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
from airflow.utils.task_group import TaskGroup

def fail_task_function(**kwargs):
    raise Exception("This task is designed to fail.")

with DAG(
    dag_id="task_group_failure_example",
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    with TaskGroup("my_task_group", tooltip="Tasks to be completed together") as my_task_group:
        task_a = PythonOperator(task_id="task_a", python_callable=lambda: print("Task A"))
        task_b = PythonOperator(task_id="task_b", python_callable=lambda: print("Task B"))
        task_c = PythonOperator(
            task_id="task_c",
            python_callable=fail_task_function,
            on_failure_callback = fail_task_function
        )
        task_a >> task_b >> task_c

    task_d = PythonOperator(task_id="task_d", python_callable=lambda: print("Task D"))

    my_task_group >> task_d
```

In this case, `task_d` will not be triggered. `task_c` throws an exception, thus failing the whole group which prevents `task_d` to start execution.

**Example 2: Incorrect Dependency Setup**

This example demonstrates the correct and incorrect ways of setting dependencies to a TaskGroup. In the incorrect case, we are using `my_task_group`, which is an ID string. In the correct case, we are using the actual taskgroup object instance, as `my_task_group`.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
from airflow.utils.task_group import TaskGroup

with DAG(
    dag_id="task_group_dependency_example",
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    with TaskGroup("my_task_group", tooltip="Tasks to be completed together") as my_task_group:
        task_a = PythonOperator(task_id="task_a", python_callable=lambda: print("Task A"))
        task_b = PythonOperator(task_id="task_b", python_callable=lambda: print("Task B"))
        task_a >> task_b

    task_d = PythonOperator(task_id="task_d", python_callable=lambda: print("Task D"))
    task_e = PythonOperator(task_id="task_e", python_callable=lambda: print("Task E"))

    # Incorrect dependency, task_d won't run as expected in certain Airflow versions.
    "my_task_group" >> task_d

    # Correct dependency, task_e will execute after the TaskGroup
    my_task_group >> task_e
```
Here, `task_d` might not trigger, particularly with older airflow versions, as `"my_task_group"` represents only a string with the ID and not the task group instance itself. `task_e` will trigger correctly since `my_task_group` is the TaskGroup instance.

**Example 3: Trigger Rule Conflicts**

This final example illustrates how conflicting *trigger_rules* can cause issues, in this case using `TriggerRule.ALL_DONE` on the task group, which will prevent subsequent tasks from triggering when any of its tasks fail.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.utils.trigger_rule import TriggerRule
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
from airflow.utils.task_group import TaskGroup

def fail_task_function(**kwargs):
    raise Exception("This task is designed to fail.")

with DAG(
    dag_id="trigger_rule_conflict_example",
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    with TaskGroup(
        "my_task_group", tooltip="Tasks to be completed together", trigger_rule=TriggerRule.ALL_DONE
    ) as my_task_group:
        task_a = PythonOperator(task_id="task_a", python_callable=lambda: print("Task A"))
        task_b = PythonOperator(task_id="task_b", python_callable=lambda: print("Task B"))
        task_c = PythonOperator(
            task_id="task_c",
            python_callable=fail_task_function,
        )
        task_a >> task_b >> task_c

    task_d = PythonOperator(
        task_id="task_d",
        python_callable=lambda: print("Task D")
    )

    my_task_group >> task_d

```

Even though the group is linked to `task_d`, because `task_c` will fail, the task group will not be marked as finished due to the `trigger_rule=TriggerRule.ALL_DONE` declaration. Consequently, `task_d` won't execute.

In summary, the key takeaways when troubleshooting TaskGroup downstream trigger issues are:

1.  **Check Task Status Within the Group:** Ensure all tasks inside the task group are finishing as expected, or that the task group's `trigger_rule` allows it to finish even with failures.
2.  **Correct Dependencies:** The bitshift operator `>>` should always use the task group instance itself, not its ID string.
3.  **Trigger Rules Clarity**: Be mindful of trigger rules across the task group and its downstream tasks, ensuring compatibility and avoiding conflicting logic.

For a more in-depth understanding of task group behavior, I recommend diving into the official Airflow documentation, specifically the sections on TaskGroups and trigger rules. Additionally, the "Programming Apache Airflow" book, by Bas P. Harenslak and Julian Rutger de Ruiter, offers a comprehensive overview of Airflow’s features and underlying mechanisms. Also, the Apache Airflow documentation's *Concepts* section provides foundational knowledge that is useful to understand all aspects of an airflow DAG. I've found these resources indispensable over the years.

By methodically investigating these three areas, you'll usually find the culprit behind the unresponsive downstream tasks. If the issue remains after covering these points, consider adding logging within your tasks for more insight, and remember to leverage Airflow's UI for real time monitoring of the DAG executions.
