Alright, let's tackle this. I’ve definitely been in the weeds with this exact issue more than once, and it usually boils down to a few common culprits when dealing with rails in docker. It's a frustration shared by many, and understanding the nuances can save a significant amount of debugging time. I remember this one project back in '18, a relatively complex ecommerce platform, where we wrestled with this reload issue for what felt like an eternity. It was a classic case of misconfigured volume mounts and how they interact with the development environment.

The core problem stems from the way Docker containers and host filesystems interact when you’re setting up a development environment. When you make changes to your files on your host machine, those changes are only reflected within the docker container if you have properly configured volume mounts. However, it's not just about *having* a mount – it's about how those changes are being observed within the container, particularly concerning rails.

Rails, by default, relies on a process called “polling” to detect changes in your files when running in development mode. Polling works by periodically checking the modification time of files. This works reasonably well on a local file system, but it can be problematic inside a docker container, especially with mounted volumes. Docker mounts, particularly those using virtualized filesystems on platforms like macOS or Windows, can exhibit subtle discrepancies in the timing information (like modification times) between the host and the container. The polling mechanism used by rails might simply miss the changes or fail to pick them up fast enough.

This inconsistency can lead to your frustration: you modify a file, save it, and yet the application running in the docker container doesn't pick up these changes. It's not that the changes aren’t there, it's that rails is not being notified about them properly. Moreover, the container file system is not the same as the host, creating another potential source of delay.

Here's the crux: the problem isn’t always about the volume mount being *missing*, but about the *timing* and *perception* of file changes inside the container. Rails isn't broken, docker isn't broken, they just need a bit of help to talk to each other effectively.

To address this, we typically have three primary strategies at our disposal: modifying polling behavior, leveraging tools like `listen`, and using optimized volume mounts where available. Let’s explore each with practical examples.

**1. Modifying Polling Behavior:**

We can instruct rails to poll more aggressively or use a more efficient watcher in development by tweaking the `config/environments/development.rb` file. The standard polling approach is often insufficient inside docker, so we can configure the `config.file_watcher` option.

Here is a simple snippet that sets up an aggressive polling rate:

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb

Rails.application.configure do
  #... other configurations
  config.file_watcher = ActiveSupport::EventedFileUpdateChecker
  config.file_watcher.instance_variable_set(:@polling_interval, 0.1) #checks every 0.1 seconds
end

```

What this snippet accomplishes is the following: we specifically use the `ActiveSupport::EventedFileUpdateChecker` which uses an operating system dependent watcher for increased performance. However, in some environments or when issues arise, we want more granular control, so we manually set the `@polling_interval` to a much more aggressive value (0.1 seconds). This forces rails to check for changes much more frequently and can often solve the problem, particularly in less performant environments. I've seen this alone fix most common cases of non-refreshing rails apps, although this can be a little heavy on system resources, depending on the size of the project.

**2. Leveraging `listen` gem:**

A much more sophisticated and effective solution, especially on macOS, is using the `listen` gem. This gem employs operating system-level mechanisms to receive notifications about filesystem changes, which is more efficient than the periodic polling. To use it, you will need to add it to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# Gemfile

gem 'listen', '~> 3.7'

```

Then, you should also update your `development.rb` configuration:

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb

Rails.application.configure do
   #... other configurations
   config.file_watcher = ActiveSupport::FileUpdateChecker
  # or
   config.file_watcher = ActiveSupport::EventedFileUpdateChecker
end
```

In this example, we are essentially just ensuring `ActiveSupport::FileUpdateChecker` or `ActiveSupport::EventedFileUpdateChecker` are used.  Note that `listen` works underneath these abstractions. `listen` will then try to use native operating system specific tools that are much faster and don't have the same timing issues present in a standard polling system.

It's also important to mention here that sometimes, even with `listen`, you might need to install the `fswatch` binary inside the docker image itself, depending on your specific `listen` version and setup. `fswatch` is a prerequisite for some system specific watchers and is quite small, so it shouldn’t add significant size to your container image, usually.

**3. Optimized Volume Mounts:**

Finally, sometimes the issue is not entirely with rails’ file-watching but with the volume mount itself. This is particularly true on macos with older docker desktop implementations. Newer versions of docker desktop use a filesystem called `virtiofs` which is much more efficient than the older implementation called `osxfs`. Make sure you’ve updated to the latest version of Docker Desktop to fully realize the benefits of this change.

Here’s a breakdown, in docker-compose format, of how you would typically structure a volume mount for your application, where `.` refers to the project root in the host machine.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml

version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app # mounts the entire project directory
      - bundle_cache:/usr/local/bundle # mounts the bundle cache for performance
    command: bash -c "rm -f tmp/pids/server.pid && bundle exec rails server -b 0.0.0.0"
volumes:
    bundle_cache:
```

In this snippet, we map the directory from the host to the container under the path `/app` in the container. Any change made on the host should also be available in the docker container, but the file watching system inside the container needs to pick those up as shown above. It is also a good practice to mount the bundle cache so that gem installation doesn't need to occur every build, increasing the speed of any rebuild.

It’s crucial to note that the choice between these approaches often depends on the specific development environment and the performance characteristics of your system. Starting with option one, the `polling_interval` tweak, is often a quick win. If that doesn't work `listen` combined with correct `config.file_watcher` setting will most of the time resolve the issue. You might need to experiment to see which combination works the best for you. I generally prefer `listen` due to its performance and ability to detect file changes more efficiently.

For more in-depth understanding of rails file watching behavior, I highly recommend diving into the ActiveSupport documentation (specifically on `FileUpdateChecker` and `EventedFileUpdateChecker`). Also, a good resource for understanding docker performance, especially volume mounts, is the official docker documentation itself, which is very well written and comprehensive. Lastly, to understand `listen`, the github repository and the gemspec are good sources of truth. These resources should provide a more complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms, allowing for more targeted troubleshooting in the future.

Debugging these types of problems is often iterative, but having a strong understanding of the core concepts is essential to efficiently find the root cause. I hope that gives you a practical starting point for addressing this common challenge. Let me know if you have other questions.
