Okay, let's tackle this. I've actually dealt with this exact scenario a few times, particularly when optimizing complex machine learning models with custom loss functions. It’s a step that's often overlooked, but crucial for understanding the uncertainty around your parameter estimates.

The core challenge here revolves around deriving the standard errors of parameter estimates when you’re not using a standard loss function, like mean squared error (mse) or cross-entropy. With those, you often get standard error calculations baked into the optimization algorithms or statistical packages. However, when you roll your own, you’re on your own. The Hessian matrix, in such cases, becomes our primary tool for extracting that information.

The Hessian, you'll recall, is the matrix of second-order partial derivatives of your error (loss) function with respect to its parameters. It provides information about the local curvature of the error surface. Intuitively, a higher curvature around a minimum indicates more certainty in the parameter estimates. This ‘certainty’, mathematically speaking, is inversely related to the standard error.

The procedure involves a couple of key steps. First, you calculate the Hessian of your custom error function. Next, you compute the inverse of this matrix. Finally, the square root of the diagonal elements of the inverse Hessian gives you the standard errors of the respective parameters.

Specifically, let's break down those steps further:

**1. Calculating the Hessian:**

This is usually the most computationally expensive part. For a function with `n` parameters, the Hessian is an `n x n` matrix. Each element `H_ij` represents the second partial derivative of the loss function `L` with respect to the `i`th and `j`th parameters:

```
H_ij = ∂²L / ∂θ_i ∂θ_j
```
Where `θ_i` and `θ_j` are the `i`th and `j`th parameters, respectively.

Depending on the complexity of the function, you might be able to derive these analytically, or more likely, you'll need to approximate it using numerical methods. Finite difference methods are quite common here, either central differences (more accurate but more computationally expensive) or forward/backward differences (less accurate, but faster).

**2. Inverting the Hessian:**

Once you have your Hessian, you need to invert it. This gives you the variance-covariance matrix. This matrix, let's call it `Σ`, reveals not just the variances (along the diagonal), but also the covariances between parameters.

```
Σ = H⁻¹
```

Numerical stability can be an issue when inverting the Hessian. Singular matrices are notoriously problematic. Some regularization can help, as I've sometimes employed adding a small diagonal matrix to the Hessian before the inversion – essentially, a "ridge" regularization – it's a trick worth keeping in mind.

**3. Extracting the Standard Errors:**

The standard error of the `i`th parameter is the square root of the `i`th diagonal element of the variance-covariance matrix `Σ`.

```
se(θ_i) = sqrt(Σ_ii)
```

Let me show you a couple of code examples. These are in python, leveraging numpy for the calculations, and you might need some autodifferentiation tools (like `jax` or `tensorflow`) for automatic gradient computation if you decide to work with more complex functions. However, I'm going to keep it simple and assume we can calculate derivatives analytically.

**Code Example 1: Simple linear regression with custom loss.**

Let’s assume our custom loss is the absolute difference of the residuals squared, a simplified example but sufficient for demonstration. Here we assume one parameter `w`, for simplicity (with `b=0`) and we know the input data `x` and the output data `y`.

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_loss(w, x, y):
  residuals = y - (w * x)
  return np.sum(np.abs(residuals)**2)


def hessian(w, x, y):
    # analytic second derivative (Hessian for single parameter w)
    # Note, the double derivative of |r|^2 w.r.t. w is 2x^2*sign(y-wx), 
    # the sign part depends on which side of the zero the prediction falls.
    #  Here I am approximating it as |r| not zero, which works fine for most data.
    
    residuals = y - (w*x) 
    hessian_val = np.sum(2 * x**2 * np.sign(residuals))

    return hessian_val

def calculate_standard_error(w_opt, x, y):
  h = hessian(w_opt, x,y)
  variance = 1/h
  standard_error = np.sqrt(variance)
  return standard_error

# Example Usage
x_data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y_data = np.array([2.1, 3.9, 5.8, 7.9, 10.1])
w_optimal = 2  # Let's assume this is from some optimization method.
standard_error = calculate_standard_error(w_optimal, x_data, y_data)
print(f"Standard Error: {standard_error}")

```

**Code Example 2: A slightly more complex case with two parameters.**

Now, consider a scenario with two parameters (`w1`, `w2`) and again a simple squared residual absolute difference:

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_loss(params, x1, x2, y):
    w1, w2 = params
    residuals = y - (w1*x1 + w2*x2)
    return np.sum(np.abs(residuals)**2)



def hessian(params, x1, x2, y):
    w1, w2 = params
    residuals = y - (w1 * x1 + w2 * x2)

    h11 = np.sum(2*x1**2 * np.sign(residuals))
    h12 = np.sum(2*x1*x2 * np.sign(residuals))
    h21 = h12 #Hessian is symmetric
    h22 = np.sum(2*x2**2 * np.sign(residuals))
    return np.array([[h11, h12], [h21, h22]])


def calculate_standard_errors(params_opt, x1, x2, y):
  hess = hessian(params_opt, x1, x2, y)
  inv_hess = np.linalg.inv(hess)
  standard_errors = np.sqrt(np.diag(inv_hess))
  return standard_errors

# Example Usage
x1_data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
x2_data = np.array([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5])
y_data = np.array([3.0, 5.2, 7.1, 9.2, 11.3])
params_optimal = np.array([2, 1])  # Assume this is from some optimization method
standard_errors = calculate_standard_errors(params_optimal, x1_data, x2_data, y_data)
print(f"Standard Errors: {standard_errors}")
```

**Code Example 3: Numerical approximation of the Hessian (more general)**

Here, I'll show a function to estimate the Hessian numerically, this is useful if the analytical derivative is hard. Central difference is used for accuracy

```python
import numpy as np

def numerical_hessian(func, params, *args, delta=1e-5):
    n = len(params)
    hess = np.zeros((n, n))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            params_plus_i = params.copy()
            params_plus_i[i] += delta
            params_minus_i = params.copy()
            params_minus_i[i] -= delta

            params_plus_j = params.copy()
            params_plus_j[j] += delta

            params_minus_j = params.copy()
            params_minus_j[j] -= delta

            params_plus_ij = params.copy()
            params_plus_ij[i] += delta
            params_plus_ij[j] += delta

            params_minus_ij = params.copy()
            params_minus_ij[i] -= delta
            params_minus_ij[j] -= delta


            if i == j:
              hess[i,j] = (func(params_plus_i, *args) - 2*func(params, *args) + func(params_minus_i,*args)) / (delta**2)
            else:
                hess[i,j] = (func(params_plus_ij, *args) - func(params_plus_j, *args) - func(params_plus_i,*args) + func(params, *args) + func(params_minus_ij,*args) - func(params_minus_i, *args) - func(params_minus_j, *args) + func(params, *args) )/ (2*delta*delta)


    return hess


def calculate_standard_errors_numerical(func, params_opt, *args):
  hess = numerical_hessian(func, params_opt, *args)
  inv_hess = np.linalg.inv(hess)
  standard_errors = np.sqrt(np.diag(inv_hess))
  return standard_errors

#Example
def my_function(params, x1, x2, y):
  w1, w2 = params
  residuals = y - (w1*x1 + w2*x2)
  return np.sum(np.abs(residuals)**2)

x1_data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
x2_data = np.array([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5])
y_data = np.array([3.0, 5.2, 7.1, 9.2, 11.3])
params_optimal = np.array([2, 1])

standard_errors = calculate_standard_errors_numerical(my_function, params_optimal, x1_data, x2_data, y_data)
print(f"Standard Errors with numerical Hessian: {standard_errors}")

```

Keep in mind, these examples are fairly simple. In practice, you’ll likely encounter more complex error functions, requiring careful attention to both the analytical derivatives (if possible) and the numerical methods used to approximate them.

Regarding literature, for a solid mathematical foundation, I'd recommend “Numerical Optimization” by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen Wright. For a more statistical view of parameter estimation, “Statistical Inference” by George Casella and Roger L. Berger is invaluable. These resources will give you a very comprehensive view of not just the theory, but also the practical considerations that come up frequently when working with such problems. Also, “All of Statistics” by Larry Wasserman is an excellent and less dense book that is useful to refresh basic concepts.

In summary, calculating standard errors from the Hessian of a custom error function is a vital step when you move beyond predefined losses. While it might feel like extra work, it ultimately gives you much more confidence and insight into the uncertainties of your model’s parameters. And, as we all know, understanding uncertainty is crucial for making sound interpretations.
