Alright, let's tackle this one. I've definitely seen this sort of thing crop up a few times, especially when dealing with large datasets and trying to perform complex queries in Django. The core of the problem lies in understanding the underlying database interactions and how Django translates your queries into SQL.

The specific error you're encountering with `object.filter(X__contains = 210922143300)` isn’t directly about the size of the number itself, but rather about how `__contains` is implemented in the Django ORM, and what data types it expects to work with. I recall one particular project, a system managing high-volume sensor data, where a similar issue stumped the team for an afternoon. We were trying to filter by specific identifiers within a text field, naively assuming `__contains` would behave like a generic string search, but that assumption quickly led to headaches.

Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening: `__contains` is designed to work with specific field types—primarily text-based fields like `CharField` or `TextField`, or certain array-like fields depending on your database. Critically, it performs a substring search on the *textual representation* of the target field. This means it expects a string on both sides of the operation. When you throw a large integer at it, particularly if the field you're searching against isn't a text-based field, a couple of things could go wrong, typically leading to an error that might mention database type mismatches or failed implicit conversions. The underlying SQL query generated by django's ORM would essentially be attempting to find the *literal string* representation of `210922143300` inside your database field, and the database will balk when it attempts to execute operations not defined for the data types involved.

Let's illustrate this with some examples, specifically by showcasing common scenarios that highlight the pitfall you encountered.

**Example 1: Incorrect Field Type**

Consider a Django model like this:

```python
from django.db import models

class SensorReading(models.Model):
    reading_id = models.IntegerField() # intended numeric ID, not a string
    data_payload = models.TextField()
```

If you tried:

```python
SensorReading.objects.filter(reading_id__contains=210922143300)
```

This would very likely throw an error. The `__contains` lookup is inappropriate for an `IntegerField`. Django will try to convert the integer to a string in the query but the database engine cannot compare a string with a number in the requested way, hence the error. What the ORM is trying to express is an SQL `LIKE` operation which does not make sense in this specific context.

**Example 2: Correct Field Type, But Implicit Conversion Issues**

Now, let's look at a case where the field *is* text-based, but the numerical string is not what you expect within the text column:

```python
from django.db import models

class LogEntry(models.Model):
    details = models.TextField() # text field that might contain the number but not formatted that way
```

And if, within the `details` field, some data exists such as "Event ID: 123456789" and not just the raw number itself. So,

```python
LogEntry.objects.filter(details__contains = 210922143300) # will likely return an empty query set because that specific string doesn't exist
```

This wouldn't produce an *error*, per se, but is very unlikely to find anything. This is because the search is looking for the literal string '210922143300' and not any other representation of the number (e.g. as part of a string).

**Example 3: Correct Use of `__contains`**

Now to contrast, consider this model and the correct usage of `__contains`:

```python
from django.db import models

class Tag(models.Model):
  tags_text = models.TextField()
```

Assuming `tags_text` contains data such as `",210922143300,456,789,"`, then, the following code would work correctly:
```python
Tag.objects.filter(tags_text__contains = "210922143300") # This works correctly since it's looking for a string inside another string field
```

In this correct scenario, Django's ORM will generate the proper SQL query with `LIKE` and correctly process the request.

So, what’s the right approach? Instead of using `__contains` when filtering numerical data, you should use the appropriate comparison operators such as `__exact`, `__gt`, `__lt`, etc. If you're storing numbers as strings, you might consider casting during the filtering process at the database level, although this may vary by the database engine and could be more complex. If you're trying to locate specific *text* containing that number, then ensure you're searching against a `CharField` or `TextField`. A possible solution would involve checking that the *entire* text field contains *only* that specific number, but it will not scale well and is not an optimal solution to storing numeric values.

For a deeper dive into these concepts, I highly recommend exploring Django's official documentation, especially the section detailing database field types and query lookups. Additionally, “SQL and Relational Theory” by C.J. Date provides a thorough understanding of relational database concepts which are useful when troubleshooting such problems. For an understanding of how ORM's translate to SQL queries, I found “Database Internals: A Deep Dive Into How Databases Work” by Alex Petrov to be particularly insightful. Examining your database engine's SQL dialect documentation can also be helpful, specifically the documentation related to type conversion and casting.

In my experience, errors like these highlight the importance of understanding the data types involved at both the application and database level, and how they interact through an ORM. It's also a great reminder to not make assumptions about implicit type conversions and carefully analyze the specific data and SQL queries being generated. While it can be tempting to directly search for numbers using `__contains`, that path rarely leads to success. Instead, carefully consider the field type you’re querying and utilize the tools provided by Django and your database engine to find the data you seek.
