, let's tackle this one. I've seen this particular headache more times than I'd care to count, and it often boils down to a few common culprits when dealing with Java JARs on App Engine Flexible. Let's unpack the usual suspects and how to debug them, shall we?

Firstly, health checks on App Engine Flexible are designed to ensure that instances are healthy and ready to serve traffic. If an instance fails these checks, App Engine will usually terminate and recreate it. The whole point is resilience, so we really need to pay attention to what these checks are actually testing. A failing health check typically means one of two things: the application isn’t starting correctly, or it's not responding to the requests made by the health checker. Let’s break these down.

From my experience, a common scenario involves the startup phase. Your JAR might be loading correctly and outputting logs like there's no tomorrow, but it's still not considered healthy. This is because the health checker typically makes a simple http request to a designated endpoint to determine if your application is ready. This could be `/_ah/health` which is the default, but you might have a custom one set in your `app.yaml`. If this endpoint is not listening or returning a 200 ok, or is taking an unreasonable amount of time, the health check fails.

Let's say you have a basic Spring Boot application, and your controller setup is seemingly perfect, but you keep getting health check fails. You might think, "but, I have the `/health` endpoint set up!". The health endpoint needs to *explicitly* listen for the http request, and be configured properly. Remember, app engine sends a HTTP request to your application’s configured health check path, and expects a timely response with a 200 status code. Anything else is an indication that the application is not ready to handle user requests.

Here's an initial example of a spring boot controller with a basic health check endpoint. This might look fine on the surface, but there could be subtle problems with the configuration elsewhere, or this endpoint might not even be accessible based on your app settings:

```java
@RestController
public class HealthController {

  @GetMapping("/_ah/health")
  public ResponseEntity<String> healthCheck() {
    return new ResponseEntity<>("ok", HttpStatus.OK);
  }
}
```

Now, the next typical problem I've seen is related to the `app.yaml` configuration. You need to ensure your `health_check` settings are configured correctly. In particular, `check_interval_sec`, `timeout_sec`, and `unhealthy_threshold` often cause confusion. These settings determine how often the health check is performed, how long App Engine will wait for a response, and how many consecutive failures need to occur for the instance to be deemed unhealthy. If your startup process is slow, the default values might be too aggressive. Here's an example of what a basic configuration might look like:

```yaml
runtime: java
env: flex

runtime_config:
  jdk: "openjdk17"

handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: this will never be used

health_check:
  enable_health_check: True
  check_interval_sec: 5
  timeout_sec: 4
  unhealthy_threshold: 2
  healthy_threshold: 2
  restart_threshold: 6
```

The above yaml will perform a check every 5 seconds, wait a maximum of 4 seconds for a response and if 2 checks fail in a row, the instance will be declared unhealthy, and if 6 subsequent checks fail, the instance will restart. If you’re using spring boot's default behaviour, where it takes some time to start, this can cause issues if the initial startup time is longer than 4 seconds. You might need to increase `timeout_sec` to accommodate longer startup processes, or add additional configuration to ensure the `/health` endpoint is available as soon as possible after the jar is loaded.

Another aspect often overlooked is related to the actual response content. You might correctly return a 200 status code, but the content-type header may be incorrect or the body may be malformed. For example, if the response content type is not what the health checker expects, that can also register as an unhealthy instance, even if the server is otherwise functioning perfectly. Often this will appear as a generic health check failure, and you will have to investigate the log files to get a better idea of the problem.

It’s useful to add logging to your health check endpoint to diagnose these issues, as often the health check failures are intermittent or related to application load. For example, if database connection pools are taking a long time to initialize, they may cause a delayed response and subsequent failure. Here's how you might implement a more robust health check with logging:

```java
@RestController
public class HealthController {

  private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HealthController.class);

  @GetMapping("/_ah/health")
  public ResponseEntity<String> healthCheck() {
      try {
          // Simulate some check - replace with actual checks
          boolean databaseHealthy = isDatabaseHealthy();
          if(databaseHealthy) {
            logger.info("Health check successful, Database is healthy");
              return new ResponseEntity<>("ok", HttpStatus.OK);
           } else {
             logger.warn("Health check failed, Database is not healthy");
             return new ResponseEntity<>("Database not healthy", HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
            }
      } catch(Exception e) {
         logger.error("Health check failed due to exception", e);
           return new ResponseEntity<>("error", HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
      }
  }

   private boolean isDatabaseHealthy() {
      // Simulate database health check
      // Replace this with your actual database health check logic
      try {
          // Connect to database etc
         Thread.sleep(100);
         return true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
           return false;
      }
   }
}
```

In that example, we're logging whether we consider the database to be healthy, and if not returning an `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`. Now this may not be appropriate for a generic health check, as you may want that to be a simple 200 response, but the important thing here is the logging - it can really help identify what part of your application is causing the health check failure.

As a final troubleshooting step, if your logs aren't giving you clear answers, consider using `gcloud app instances describe` which can provide a more detailed view of why an instance is marked as unhealthy. This will show you exactly what the health checker is reporting in the diagnostic logs. It is also helpful to remember that logs for Google Cloud’s App Engine are typically found in Cloud Logging.

For in-depth material, I'd recommend checking out “Cloud Native Patterns” by Cornelia Davis for a broader understanding of microservices architectures and health checking in cloud environments. Also the official Google Cloud documentation for App Engine Flexible, specifically the sections on health checking is indispensable. You can typically find very up-to-date guidance on the health checks and how it interacts with other services. Lastly, the spring boot documentation also provides details on how to properly configure and utilize health checks, so it is always worthwhile to go back to the source.

In summary, consistently failing health checks often means there's either a problem with the application’s startup sequence, the application is not listening on the endpoint, or you have an improperly configured `app.yaml`. Carefully debugging each of these potential problems using logging, gcloud and by revisiting the documentation often sorts these issues. These things can be tricky but with a solid, methodical approach, you will get to the bottom of the problem. I hope this helps.
