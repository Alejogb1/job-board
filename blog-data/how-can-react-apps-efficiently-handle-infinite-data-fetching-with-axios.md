Okay, let's tackle this. I remember a project back at "Synthetica Solutions" – a real behemoth of a single-page application, basically a dashboard showing intricate manufacturing data. We hit the wall pretty quickly when trying to display thousands of entries fetched from our legacy systems. Infinite scrolling, coupled with user filtering and sorting, became a performance nightmare. What we learned back then about effectively managing infinite data fetches with React and axios proved invaluable. The key is not just fetching data; it's about doing it intelligently.

First, understand that "infinite scrolling" isn’t truly infinite. It’s about loading data in chunks, typically based on the user’s viewport. This means we're dealing with pagination, and effectively handling that is step one. The naive approach of just making successive axios calls without proper state management or cancellation can quickly become a performance bottleneck.

The first critical concept is *debouncing* or *throttling* the scroll event listener. React renders can be expensive, particularly when the list of items starts getting large. Firing off a fetch on *every* scroll event can cause a storm of requests, many of them unnecessary. We can use a simple debounce function to only trigger a request when the user has paused scrolling for a brief duration. This prevents the server from being overwhelmed and also keeps the user interface responsive.

Here’s a basic example of how we might debounce a function:

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeout;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(this, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}

// Usage within our component
const handleScroll = debounce(() => {
    //logic to fetch data from the server.
    fetchMoreData()
}, 200); // 200ms delay
```

We wrap our `fetchMoreData` function in the debounced version, which prevents multiple simultaneous calls.

Next, let’s discuss state management. It's crucial to manage the incoming data, loading states, error conditions, and potentially, a 'hasMore' flag. When fetching new data, we don't want to overwrite what's already there. We want to *append* to our existing data. This can be done efficiently using the spread syntax in react state updates.

Here's an example within a simplified functional component using the `useState` hook.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';


function DataList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [hasMore, setHasMore] = useState(true);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);


  const fetchData = async () => {
      setLoading(true);
      try {
        const response = await axios.get(`https://api.example.com/data?page=${page}`);
        if (response.data.length > 0) {
          setItems((prevItems) => [...prevItems, ...response.data]);
          setPage((prevPage) => prevPage + 1);
        } else {
          setHasMore(false); // no more data to load
        }

      } catch (err) {
        setError(err);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    useEffect(() => {
        if(hasMore){
         fetchData()
        }
    }, [hasMore]); //Only run when "hasMore" is true



  const handleScroll = () => {
    if (
        window.innerHeight + document.documentElement.scrollTop !==
        document.documentElement.offsetHeight || loading || !hasMore
      ) {
          return;
      }
    setHasMore(true)
  };

    useEffect(() => {
        window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
        return () => window.removeEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
      }, [handleScroll]);


  if (error) {
    return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {items.map(item => <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>)}
      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {!hasMore && <p>No more data</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default DataList;
```

Here, when a scroll event triggers, it checks whether the user has reached the end of the page. If yes, and there is still more data to be loaded (`hasMore === true`), it fetches the next page. It uses the `setItems` function to *append* the new data, not replace it. We also update the `page` to fetch the next set of results when required. We are also handling the `loading` and `error` states effectively.

The third crucial aspect is *cancellation*. While our `debounce` prevents rapid-fire calls, what if the user scrolls quickly, triggering a request that then becomes obsolete because the user scrolled further down? Unnecessary server requests are wasteful and can lead to race conditions. Axios offers a clean way to handle cancellations through its `CancelToken`.

Here’s how we can modify our `fetchData` function using a `CancelToken`:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function CancelableDataList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [hasMore, setHasMore] = useState(true);
    const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
    const [error, setError] = useState(null)
    const [cancelTokenSource, setCancelTokenSource] = useState(null);


  const fetchData = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
     if (cancelTokenSource) {
        cancelTokenSource.cancel('Operation canceled due to new request.');
    }
    const source = axios.CancelToken.source();
     setCancelTokenSource(source);
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(`https://api.example.com/data?page=${page}`,{
          cancelToken: source.token
      });
      if(response.data.length > 0) {
          setItems((prevItems) => [...prevItems, ...response.data]);
          setPage((prevPage) => prevPage + 1);

      }else {
         setHasMore(false)
      }

    } catch (error) {
        if (axios.isCancel(error)) {
            console.log('Request canceled', error.message);
           } else {
             setError(error);
            }
    }finally {
        setLoading(false);
         setCancelTokenSource(null)
      }

  };

 useEffect(() => {
     if(hasMore){
        fetchData();
      }
}, [hasMore]);

    const handleScroll = () => {
        if (
            window.innerHeight + document.documentElement.scrollTop !==
            document.documentElement.offsetHeight || loading || !hasMore
          ) {
              return;
          }
       setHasMore(true)
      };

      useEffect(() => {
        window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
        return () => window.removeEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
      }, [handleScroll]);


    if (error) {
      return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
    }

  return (
    <div>
      {items.map(item => <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>)}
       {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
       {!hasMore && <p>No more data</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default CancelableDataList;
```

Here, before making each request, we create a new `CancelToken`. If a request is already in progress, we use our set cancel token function `cancelTokenSource.cancel()`. This ensures only the latest request is processed.

For deeper understanding, I’d recommend looking at "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch for principles on resource management and best practices which are applicable here too. For React-specific optimizations, "React Performance" by Alex Rattray is a good starting point. On the subject of asynchronous JavaScript, "You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance" by Kyle Simpson provides a solid foundation.

In summary, efficiently handling infinite data fetching requires thoughtful state management, effective event handling using techniques like debouncing, and handling possible request cancellations. These combined principles greatly improve the overall performance and responsiveness of your React application, preventing many of the common pitfalls we faced at "Synthetica Solutions" many years ago. This layered approach ensures that your application remains user friendly even with enormous amounts of data being served.
