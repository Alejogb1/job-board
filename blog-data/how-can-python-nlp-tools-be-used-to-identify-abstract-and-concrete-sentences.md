Alright,  Identifying abstract versus concrete sentences using python's natural language processing (nlp) capabilities is a challenge I've often faced, particularly when working on automated summarization and text classification projects. It's not as simple as flagging keywords; rather, it requires a more nuanced understanding of semantic context. I remember one specific project, a contract analysis tool, where the failure to accurately distinguish between concrete factual statements and abstract stipulations led to significant misclassifications. This experience taught me the importance of a multi-faceted approach.

The core problem lies in the subjectivity of 'abstract' and 'concrete.' A concrete sentence typically describes something tangible, observable, or measurable in the real world. Think of something like "the car is red," or "the server responded in 200 milliseconds." Abstract sentences, conversely, deal with concepts, ideas, emotions, or generalities—things that are not readily perceptible through the senses. Examples would include "justice is important," or "efficiency is crucial." The distinction isn’t always clear-cut, and context heavily influences the interpretation. So, our tools need to capture this context.

Here's how I approach it, utilizing a combination of techniques that leverage common Python NLP libraries:

**1. Utilizing Word Embeddings and Semantic Similarity:**

The first layer involves analyzing the semantic nature of words within the sentence. Word embeddings, generated by models like word2vec, GloVe, or fastText, provide vector representations of words that capture semantic relationships. If the words in a sentence tend to have embeddings closer to words associated with tangible entities or actions, it leans towards being concrete. Conversely, embeddings clustered around conceptual terms indicate abstractness.

Here’s a basic python example using `spaCy` and the pre-trained `en_core_web_lg` model, which includes word vectors:

```python
import spacy
import numpy as np

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')

def calculate_concrete_score(sentence):
    doc = nlp(sentence)
    concrete_words = ["table", "chair", "car", "house", "build", "drive", "eat", "run", "see", "hear", "measure"] # Examples
    abstract_words = ["justice", "freedom", "love", "efficiency", "theory", "concept", "idea", "belief", "knowledge"] # Examples
    concrete_vectors = [nlp(word).vector for word in concrete_words]
    abstract_vectors = [nlp(word).vector for word in abstract_words]
    sentence_vectors = [token.vector for token in doc if not token.is_stop and not token.is_punct]
    if not sentence_vectors:
        return 0.5  # Handle empty sentences, consider as moderately abstract
    avg_sentence_vector = np.mean(sentence_vectors, axis=0)
    concrete_similarity = np.mean([np.dot(avg_sentence_vector, vec) / (np.linalg.norm(avg_sentence_vector) * np.linalg.norm(vec)) for vec in concrete_vectors]) if concrete_vectors else 0
    abstract_similarity = np.mean([np.dot(avg_sentence_vector, vec) / (np.linalg.norm(avg_sentence_vector) * np.linalg.norm(vec)) for vec in abstract_vectors]) if abstract_vectors else 0
    return (concrete_similarity - abstract_similarity + 1) / 2 # Normalize to [0, 1], 1 being highly concrete


sentence1 = "The blue car is parked in the garage."
sentence2 = "Freedom is a fundamental human right."
sentence3 = "The team's efficiency improved with the new software."


print(f"Sentence 1 score: {calculate_concrete_score(sentence1):.2f}")
print(f"Sentence 2 score: {calculate_concrete_score(sentence2):.2f}")
print(f"Sentence 3 score: {calculate_concrete_score(sentence3):.2f}")
```

In this example, we calculate the average vector representation for a sentence (excluding stop words and punctuation), then calculate cosine similarity with pre-defined concrete and abstract word vectors. This gives us a score, normalized to range between zero (highly abstract) and one (highly concrete). You could experiment with adjusting the `concrete_words` and `abstract_words` lists to tailor it for the specific domain of your analysis.

**2. Analyzing Part-of-Speech (POS) Tags:**

Another technique I've used with good success relies on analyzing the part-of-speech (POS) tags. Concrete sentences tend to contain more nouns, verbs, and adjectives, often related to tangible objects and actions. Abstract sentences are more likely to contain abstract nouns (e.g. "concept," "idea"), linking verbs (e.g. "is," "become") and adverbs. Using this information as a complementary feature can improve accuracy.

Here’s a code snippet that illustrates this:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')

def pos_feature_score(sentence):
    doc = nlp(sentence)
    concrete_pos = ["NOUN", "VERB", "ADJ"] # POS tags to look for
    abstract_pos = ["ADP", "DET", "AUX", "SCONJ", "PART", "PRON"] # Commonly found in abstract language, depending on the specific approach.
    concrete_count = 0
    abstract_count = 0
    total_count = 0
    for token in doc:
      if not token.is_stop and not token.is_punct:
        total_count += 1
        if token.pos_ in concrete_pos:
          concrete_count+=1
        if token.pos_ in abstract_pos:
          abstract_count+=1
    if total_count == 0:
      return 0.5
    score = (concrete_count - abstract_count + total_count) / (2*total_count) # Normalize to [0, 1]
    return score

sentence1 = "The cat sat on the mat."
sentence2 = "The nature of consciousness is a complex problem."
sentence3 = "The new approach significantly improved the efficiency."

print(f"Sentence 1 score: {pos_feature_score(sentence1):.2f}")
print(f"Sentence 2 score: {pos_feature_score(sentence2):.2f}")
print(f"Sentence 3 score: {pos_feature_score(sentence3):.2f}")
```

In this example, we analyze the distribution of concrete and abstract POS tags, providing a score based on the relative prevalence of concrete tags versus abstract tags. Again, it's a normalized score between zero (highly abstract) and one (highly concrete), and should be considered in conjunction with other metrics.

**3. Combining Features with a Machine Learning Classifier:**

Ultimately, I find that the best results come from combining these individual metrics using a machine learning classifier. The scores from the word embedding similarities, the pos tag features, and other relevant characteristics, like the presence of specific types of verbs or adverbs, can be used as features to train a classifier. Support vector machines, logistic regression, or even simple neural networks can do the job.

Here's a very simplified example using `scikit-learn`, illustrating the combination:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Assume the existence of calculate_concrete_score and pos_feature_score functions
def extract_features(sentence):
    return [calculate_concrete_score(sentence), pos_feature_score(sentence)]

sentences = [
    "The robot completed its task.",
    "The theory of relativity is complex.",
    "The project team met in the conference room.",
    "Empathy is a crucial aspect of human interaction.",
    "The data was analyzed using the new algorithm.",
    "Justice is not always served.",
    "The server processed the request in 10ms",
    "The definition of progress is subjective."
]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0] # 1 for concrete, 0 for abstract

features = [extract_features(sentence) for sentence in sentences]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")

# Prediction on new sentences
new_sentences = ["The dog barked at the mailman.", "The concept of time is relative."]
new_features = [extract_features(sentence) for sentence in new_sentences]
predictions = model.predict(new_features)
print(f"New Sentence Predictions: {predictions}")

```

In a real-world scenario, I'd use a much larger dataset, along with more sophisticated feature engineering, cross-validation techniques and hyper-parameter optimization.

**Key Resources:**

For a deep understanding of word embeddings and their applications, I'd highly recommend starting with *'Speech and Language Processing'* by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin. It's a comprehensive resource that covers almost everything in nlp. For more on linguistic analysis, including part-of-speech tagging, exploring materials related to corpus linguistics, particularly the Brown Corpus, can be extremely useful. The spaCy documentation itself is also incredibly detailed and serves as an excellent resource, guiding one through its API and its capabilities. Finally, to get a grip on the machine learning side of things, *'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow'* by Aurélien Géron is a solid choice and will provide the needed practical experience.

In closing, discerning abstractness from concreteness using Python NLP isn't a single-step process. It's a combination of semantic understanding (through embeddings), structural analysis (using POS tagging), and potentially incorporating even more sophisticated approaches such as analyzing sentence complexity and discourse structure that can yield the best results. The above examples provide a good starting point, and hopefully will give you some idea as to how to proceed.
