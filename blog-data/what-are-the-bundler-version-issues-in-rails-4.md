Let's get into it. I recall a particular project back in the day – a rather complex e-commerce platform built on Rails 4 – where we stumbled head-first into the frustrating world of bundler version discrepancies. It wasn't a simple case of ‘it works on my machine’ either; we had a deployment environment, a staging server, and multiple developers all contributing, each seemingly with their own preferred bundler setup. The experience, albeit painful at times, provided a very clear understanding of the challenges and, more importantly, the solutions.

The core issue with bundler versioning in the Rails 4 era, and frankly, in any era of ruby development, stems from the way bundler itself is designed and how it manages dependencies. Essentially, a *Gemfile.lock* file is created based on the bundler version used to generate it. This file, meant to provide deterministic builds across different environments, can become a source of conflicts when developers are using different versions of bundler.

For instance, the *Gemfile.lock* created with bundler 1.10 might not play nicely with a *bundle install* executed using bundler 1.12, even if the gem dependencies within the *Gemfile* appear identical. This mismatch can lead to various problems: inconsistent gem resolution, different gem versions being installed (despite being within the specified ranges in the *Gemfile*), and sometimes even outright failures during the install process.

The problem isn’t merely about the numerical version difference. Bundler versions can introduce subtle changes in how it resolves dependency graphs, the algorithms it employs for choosing gem versions, or the way it handles specific corner cases. These changes, though often improvements intended to provide more robust dependency management, can create havoc if not consistently followed across all development and deployment environments.

Now, let’s be practical. Here are some real-world scenarios and solutions I encountered, along with the corresponding code:

**Scenario 1: Inconsistent Gem Versions**

Imagine this. You're working on your local machine with bundler 1.12. You've added a new gem to the *Gemfile* and, after *bundle install*, your project works perfectly. You commit everything, including the updated *Gemfile.lock*. However, your staging server, still using bundler 1.10, attempts a deployment with this new *Gemfile.lock*. It fails because bundler 1.10 resolves the same gem's dependencies in a different way, potentially selecting incompatible versions, or perhaps failing to find one altogether.

Here’s a simplified example of how gem versions might differ:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'activerecord', '~> 4.2'
gem 'pg', '~> 0.18'
```

With bundler 1.10, the *Gemfile.lock* might contain:

```
activerecord (4.2.11)
pg (0.18.4)
```

But when run using bundler 1.12, the *Gemfile.lock* could specify something like:

```
activerecord (4.2.12)
pg (0.18.8)
```

The versions might seem inconsequential, however, they can introduce subtle incompatibilities depending on the specific gem's change logs.

*Solution:*
The immediate solution here is to ensure that all environments are using the same version of bundler. There are a few ways to achieve this. The easiest approach, which we utilized, was to add a `.ruby-version` file with the project:

```ruby
# .ruby-version
2.3.1
```

And a `.bundler-version` file:

```
# .bundler-version
1.12.5
```

We utilized RVM (Ruby Version Manager) which picks up these files, ensuring that when we install bundler with `gem install bundler`, bundler 1.12.5 would be installed, and more importantly, this ensured consistent installation and operation of bundler across our local, staging, and production environments. This solution was easy to enforce and provided a consistent environment for all developers.

**Scenario 2: Deployment Failures Due to Bundler Mismatch**

We also saw instances where the application would fail to even start on the deployment server. This usually occurred when a developer pushed changes generated with a significantly newer bundler (say, 1.17) while the server was still using an older version (say, 1.10). The newer *Gemfile.lock* contained details and formats that the older bundler couldn’t correctly interpret. This resulted in deployment failures, often with cryptic error messages about missing or conflicting dependencies.

Here’s a slightly more technical perspective of a problematic lockfile. Bundler's lock file structure evolved between versions. Let's represent it conceptually using pseudo-yaml to show how it might look, although lock files are not stored as yaml.

Old Bundler Lockfile:

```
GEM
  remote: https://rubygems.org/
  specs:
    activerecord (4.2.10)
      activesupport (= 4.2.10)
      ...
    activesupport (4.2.10)
      ...
```

Newer Bundler Lockfile:

```
GEM
  remote: https://rubygems.org/
  specs:
    activerecord (4.2.10)
      activesupport (= 4.2.10)
      ...
      platform: ruby
      ...
    activesupport (4.2.10)
      ...
      platform: ruby
      ...
```

Notice the newer lockfile adds explicit `platform` metadata. Older bundler versions would not recognize this and could fail in the process of parsing the newer lockfile format.

*Solution:*

The fix here wasn't just about updating bundler; it involved a multi-step approach. First, we would need to explicitly tell the system to use a specific version of bundler:

```bash
# On the deployment server
gem install bundler -v '1.12.5' # specific to the project's bundler requirement
bundle _1.12.5_ install --deployment --path vendor/bundle --without development test
```
This example shows the force installation of a particular bundler version, followed by a bundle install using that version in deployment mode.

We used the `bundle _<version>_` syntax to ensure that the *bundle* command invoked was from the specified version of bundler. We also used `--deployment` mode, which installs only the gems specified in the *Gemfile* without any developer-specific gems (like documentation gems etc). Finally, we directed the gem installs to the vendor folder.

**Scenario 3: Developers Using Different Bundler Versions**

Finally, the most persistent source of issues was simply developers working with different bundler versions on their local machines. This led to constant inconsistencies when merging changes, as each developer's *Gemfile.lock* reflected their own bundler’s resolution process. It led to merge conflicts, and more importantly, non-deterministic build output.

*Solution:*

Beyond using the `.ruby-version` and `.bundler-version` files to ensure a consistent build environment as described previously, we also made the use of `bundle lock` a part of our workflow.  This command, executed by developers after any changes to the *Gemfile*, forces bundler to write the *Gemfile.lock* based on *its* current configuration. The result of this was a consistent lock file amongst all team members when they pushed changes to source control.

```bash
# After updating the Gemfile
bundle install
bundle lock
```

Following these practices allowed our team to achieve a reliable development and deployment process.

To dive deeper into understanding bundler’s inner workings, I'd recommend these two references:

1.  *Ruby Under a Microscope* by Pat Shaughnessy: While it doesn't focus specifically on bundler, this book provides a deep understanding of ruby's internals, including the gem system and how dependency resolution can work. Understanding this background is crucial for understanding why bundler is designed the way it is.
2.  *The Bundler Documentation*: You can find the latest bundler documentation at [bundler.io](https://bundler.io). This documentation is a goldmine of information on the various bundler commands and their purpose. While you want to look for information on the specific version that corresponds to your needs, understand that this is an essential reference.

In conclusion, bundler version issues in Rails 4 (and beyond) aren't simply a matter of having the same number. Understanding the nuances of different bundler versions and how they impact dependency resolution is fundamental. Adopting best practices that promote consistency – like using version managers, explicitly specifying bundler versions, and incorporating `bundle lock` into your workflow – are essential for smooth development and deployment processes. We, through painful experience, came to rely on these practices to avoid the most common pitfalls.
