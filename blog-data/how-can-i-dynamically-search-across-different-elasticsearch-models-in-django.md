Let’s tackle this from a pragmatic perspective. I recall a project a few years back, an e-commerce platform that started with a single product model, then rapidly expanded to include variations, categories, brands, and a whole slew of related entities. This ballooning of searchable content quickly outgrew naive approaches and forced us to implement a dynamically driven solution for Elasticsearch.

The core challenge with dynamically searching across multiple models in Elasticsearch is the need to handle varying document structures and query requirements. Each Django model, when mapped to Elasticsearch, represents a unique index or document type, each having its own set of fields and data types. Therefore, a static, single query approach won’t cut it. Instead, we need a mechanism to intelligently discern what type of entity a user is searching for and then construct the appropriate Elasticsearch query dynamically.

My experience has shown that this generally breaks down into several key steps: defining how your models map to Elasticsearch, building dynamic query logic, and structuring your search results for easy consumption.

Firstly, let’s consider how our Django models get to Elasticsearch. While there are several Python libraries to assist in this, I've always favored the `elasticsearch-dsl` library due to its clear syntax and close integration with Elasticsearch's query DSL. This library allows us to define how a Django model maps to an Elasticsearch index.

For example, assume we have two models, `Product` and `Category`. We might define the mappings as follows:

```python
from django_elasticsearch_dsl import Document, fields
from django.conf import settings
from .models import Product, Category

@settings.register_elasticsearch_index
class ProductDocument(Document):
    id = fields.IntegerField()
    name = fields.TextField()
    description = fields.TextField()
    price = fields.FloatField()
    # other fields...

    class Index:
        name = 'products'

    class Django:
        model = Product

@settings.register_elasticsearch_index
class CategoryDocument(Document):
    id = fields.IntegerField()
    name = fields.TextField()
    description = fields.TextField()
    # other fields...

    class Index:
        name = 'categories'

    class Django:
         model = Category
```
This illustrates the basic principle: for each model, we define a corresponding document class with the relevant fields, and importantly, the associated Elasticsearch index name (`name` attribute in `Index` class). I'd recommend referring to the official documentation of `elasticsearch-dsl` and the more advanced examples within. A deep understanding of mappings and analyzers, as explained in 'Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide' by Clinton Gormley and Zachary Tong (O'Reilly), is beneficial for robust search capabilities.

Moving on, we must create dynamic query logic. Typically, this entails building a mechanism that can receive a search term, determine the potential types of data the term could refer to, and then form the corresponding queries. This is a bit more complex. We can approach this by:

1.  Trying a search on each document type/index with a general query, say, a multi-match query targeting common fields.
2.  Refining these results with model-specific filters or queries, if needed.
3.  Aggregating and displaying the combined results to the user.

Here's a simplified example in Python illustrating the dynamic querying:

```python
from elasticsearch_dsl import Search, Q
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
from django.conf import settings

def dynamic_search(query_term):
    es_client = Elasticsearch([settings.ELASTICSEARCH_URL])
    results = []
    document_classes = [ProductDocument, CategoryDocument]  # List of Document classes for models

    for doc_class in document_classes:
        index_name = doc_class.Index.name
        s = Search(using=es_client, index=index_name)
        # Generic multi-match query across common text fields
        q = Q("multi_match", query=query_term, fields=["name", "description"])
        s = s.query(q)
        response = s.execute()

        for hit in response:
            result = hit.to_dict()
            result['type'] = doc_class.Django.model._meta.model_name
            results.append(result)

    return results
```
This function iterates through defined document classes, executes a basic multi-match query on each index, and then appends the results to a unified list with an additional 'type' field denoting the model the result came from. The `elasticsearch-dsl`’s `Q` object, used here, allows us to build complex queries, as discussed in detail in the `elasticsearch-py` library documentation. It's paramount to tailor your queries to the expected text fields in each document type for the most relevant results.

Finally, the way you process and present these combined results matters immensely. You might need to add custom logic to further refine results, or introduce a concept of relevancy ranking based on the type of hit. Depending on your use case you may choose to implement facets or aggregations. Below is a hypothetical way to return these results using a basic structure, but this will inevitably depend on what is desired:

```python
from django.http import JsonResponse

def search_api_view(request):
  query = request.GET.get('q')
  if not query:
    return JsonResponse({'error': 'Please provide a search query'}, status=400)

  results = dynamic_search(query)
  return JsonResponse({'results': results})
```

The function takes the query parameter from a request and returns the results in a JSON format. This basic API endpoint demonstrates how to integrate the search functionality into a Django view, ready to be consumed by a front-end application.

In terms of practical considerations, indexing efficiency is paramount. Regularly monitor your Elasticsearch cluster for performance bottlenecks and optimise your index settings and mappings accordingly. The book 'High Performance Elasticsearch and Lucene' by Avinash Sharma (Packt Publishing) is an excellent resource to delve deeper into performance tuning and optimization techniques. Additionally, ensure that your Elasticsearch cluster is properly sized to handle expected load, as resource constraint can adversely impact search performance.

In conclusion, dynamic searching across multiple Elasticsearch models in Django requires a structured approach. Mapping each model to its own document, crafting queries dynamically for each index, and handling combined results effectively is critical. Using the `elasticsearch-dsl` library simplifies this process substantially, yet a thorough understanding of Elasticsearch’s core concepts, specifically mappings, queries, and aggregations is necessary to design and implement a robust search system. This is not a small undertaking, but with a systematic approach and continuous monitoring, building a performant and scalable search engine is entirely within reach.
