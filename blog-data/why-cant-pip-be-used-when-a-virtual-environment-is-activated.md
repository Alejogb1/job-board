Alright, let's tackle this one. It's a question I’ve seen pop up more times than I care to count, and it often boils down to a fundamental misunderstanding of how virtual environments operate and how pip interacts with them. Let's break it down, shall we? It's not that `pip` *can't* be used when a virtual environment is activated; it's that `pip` *shouldn't* be used outside an active virtual environment if you aim to keep your projects clean and reproducible.

The core issue stems from the way python manages packages and dependencies. If you install a package using `pip` globally, it'll be placed within the system-wide python installation, typically in a location like `/usr/lib/python3.x/site-packages` on linux-based systems or similar locations on other OSes. This global location can become a chaotic jumble of packages from various projects, leading to potential conflicts and unpredictable behavior when different projects require different versions of the same package. I’ve seen that mess firsthand countless times in my career.

Virtual environments, created usually with `venv` (python's built-in module) or tools like `virtualenv`, exist precisely to isolate these dependencies. When you activate a virtual environment, you're essentially telling your shell and, more crucially, the python executable, that it should look within that environment first for packages before checking the global installation. This isolation is the key to ensuring that each project has its own bespoke set of dependencies, avoiding the dreaded "works on my machine" syndrome.

Now, let’s talk about why you should always use `pip` within the virtual environment. Activating a virtual environment essentially manipulates your shell’s environment variables, specifically the `PATH` and some other python-related variables. This modification changes which python executable is called when you type ‘python’ in the terminal. Instead of calling the system-wide python, it points to the python executable within your virtual environment. Similarly, when you use `pip`, the associated `pip` executable within the virtual environment is called, which then installs the packages in the virtual environment's site-packages directory.

If you were to use the *system* `pip` command while a virtual environment is activated, you might expect it to install packages in your virtual environment, but it doesn’t. The system `pip` ignores the virtual environment settings and installs the packages in the *global* python location. This defeats the purpose of having a virtual environment. It can even cause unforeseen issues because the virtual environment’s python interpreter will still look for packages in its own isolated site-packages directory first, which could lead to missing dependencies or even version mismatches.

Let's illustrate with examples. Assume you have a virtual environment named ‘myenv’ that you created with `python3 -m venv myenv`.

First, the creation of the venv and activation:

```bash
# create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# activate the virtual environment (linux/macos)
source myenv/bin/activate

# (windows)
# myenv\Scripts\activate
```

Now, consider this scenario without activation, but still using the 'pip' that should belong to the *system* python:

```bash
# (assuming 'myenv' is not active)
pip install requests

# This will install "requests" globally, not in 'myenv'.
# If you activated 'myenv' now and tried to use it, it might fail
# or use different versions of modules if they were previously
# installed. This is the core issue to avoid.
```

And now, properly, using pip *within* the active environment:

```bash
# First, make sure the virtual environment is active as per example 1
source myenv/bin/activate
# or myenv\Scripts\activate on Windows

pip install requests

# Now, "requests" is installed in 'myenv/lib/python3.x/site-packages'
# this ensures the correct isolated environment.
```

Finally, let's also look at the command that shows where an executable is: `which`. This helps show the location of the `pip` executable:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate #Activate as per first example
which pip
#Should output something like myenv/bin/pip

deactivate # To deactivate the env

which pip
#Should output something like /usr/bin/pip
```

As you can see, when the environment is activated, the *local* `pip` is invoked which installs in the environment. When not active the *system* `pip` is invoked and install globally.

For further insight, I'd recommend delving into “Python Packaging User Guide” available at packaging.python.org. The guide provides an in-depth look at the principles behind virtual environments and packaging in Python, which greatly enhances the understanding why `pip` should only be used within the active environment. Specifically, pay attention to the “venv” sections. Another excellent resource is Brett Cannon's “PEP 582 – Python Local Packages Directory”, even if not yet implemented, its rationale illuminates the issues associated with global package management, making it relevant to understand why venv is a solution.

In essence, using `pip` without an active virtual environment leads to a global installation and breaks the isolation of your project dependencies. The key is that the activated virtual environment redirects the calls to `python` and `pip` to the specific ones in the virtual environment. By understanding this mechanism, you can avoid common headaches related to dependency management, ensuring that each project has the correct package versions and is isolated from conflicts that might arise. It is a foundational practice for any serious python development workflow. The habit will save a good number of hours of debugging down the line.
