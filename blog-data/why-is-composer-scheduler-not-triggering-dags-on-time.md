Alright, let's talk about Composer scheduler delays. I've seen this particular headache crop up more times than I care to count, and it rarely boils down to a single, easy fix. It's almost always a combination of factors at play, and it requires a methodical approach to unravel. Let's dive into the typical culprits.

The core issue, as the question implies, revolves around why scheduled dags in airflow running on google cloud composer aren't executing when we expect them to. The underlying mechanism relies on a scheduler component that periodically scans the configured dag files, parses their schedule definitions, and enqueues dag runs for execution. When this process breaks down, we’ll see delays, and it's usually not a problem with the scheduler itself being "broken", but more about resource contention, configuration mismatches, or bottlenecks.

First, consider resource constraints. In the past, I managed a platform where we initially underestimated the necessary horsepower for the composer environment. We had a rapidly increasing number of dags – many with complex dependencies – and the scheduler simply couldn’t keep up. The scheduler's database, by default, is a fairly small instance; if the scheduler is constantly trying to pull information to make scheduling decisions, and that information can't be delivered in a timely manner, the entire system grinds to a halt. A telltale sign is consistently high cpu and memory utilization on the scheduler and database components. This often manifests as increased latency in the scheduler’s processing loop, causing the dag runs to drift further and further away from their intended schedules. In the google cloud console, you will notice a consistent utilization above 80% in resources related to airflow.

Second, dag parsing can be a significant bottleneck. Each time the scheduler runs, it must parse all the dag definitions. If you have overly complex dags, or dags referencing external files or resources that are slow to load, the parsing process can take a considerable amount of time. This directly impacts how quickly the scheduler can detect eligible dag runs and enqueue them. I once had to refactor several monolithic dag files into smaller, more manageable units to alleviate this issue; it wasn't elegant, but it was necessary. Additionally, the way that dags are stored, and retrieved by the scheduler can be another point of contention, if this storage isn't performant, or the connection to it is not optimized, then the scheduler will suffer.

Third, the configuration of the scheduler itself matters. Specifically, the `scheduler.dag_dir_list_interval` configuration parameter controls how frequently the scheduler checks for new or modified dag files. A value that’s too high means that new dags, or changes, take longer to be detected. A lower value, while increasing the likelihood that changes are detected, can lead to excess cpu load, as the scheduler will spend more time on the file system. Related to this is the `scheduler.min_file_process_interval` parameter which limits the rate of parsing. Increasing this value might help with cpu load, but could cause delays if not carefully evaluated. It's a balancing act, and there isn't one 'magic' setting that applies to all situations.

Finally, concurrency settings such as `max_threads` and `max_dagruns_per_loop` can be a cause of latency. If `max_threads` is low, the scheduler will process jobs in a sequential manner, severely hindering performance with multiple jobs present. `max_dagruns_per_loop` dictates how many dags runs can be enqueued during one scheduling loop. if you are running multiple dags, all within their scheduled time, this value can cause issues in the scheduling of all of them.

Now, let’s illustrate some of these points with code examples. These are simplified for clarity, but they demonstrate the underlying concepts.

**Example 1: Dag Parsing Bottleneck**

This example shows a dag with an unnecessarily complex initialization phase, causing a delay during dag parsing by the scheduler. This type of thing can happen if you have several complex functions in the initialization step.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import time

def slow_initialization():
    time.sleep(10)  # Simulate a slow process
    return "Initialization complete"

def dummy_task():
    print("This task runs.")

with DAG(
    dag_id='complex_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    init_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='init_task',
        python_callable=slow_initialization,
    )
    main_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='main_task',
        python_callable=dummy_task
    )

    init_task >> main_task
```

This dag will not cause a direct delay in *execution* of the dag itself, but it will cause a delay in the time it takes to load into the scheduler, potentially missing its scheduled time. The solution here isn't really about changing airflow configuration, but rather optimizing the dags themselves by loading any data required into memory as needed, rather than during initialization.

**Example 2: Scheduler Resource Issues**

This is a hypothetical dag designed to overload resources on the scheduler environment. Please note, this should not be run in a production environment. I've simplified it, but you get the idea.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import time
import logging

def resource_hog():
  logging.info(f"Resource Hog started...")
  time.sleep(60)
  logging.info("Resource Hog finished...")

with DAG(
    dag_id='resource_intensive_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False,
    max_active_runs=1,
) as dag:
    for i in range(20):
        resource_task = PythonOperator(
            task_id=f'resource_hog_task_{i}',
            python_callable=resource_hog
        )
```

This dag has 20 tasks that are designed to take 60 seconds each to complete, but also consume as much resources as they are able. This dag won't delay the schedule of itself, as each individual task won't start until the previous one has completed; however, by running 20 of these at a single time, along with other dag runs, the scheduler can be stressed to the point where other dags won't be triggered. In this scenario, monitoring cpu and memory utilization in the airflow scheduler process will indicate the source of the problem. The immediate fix here would be to reduce the amount of resources this dag is using by running fewer tasks in parallel, but that might not be possible, so the next solution would be to increase the resource availability to airflow.

**Example 3: Misconfigured Scheduler Interval**

Here's a snippet demonstrating an example of how the scheduling mechanism works. This example shows the problem of not having a sufficiently low 'dag_dir_list_interval' when creating or updating dags, causing the scheduler to not detect these changes in a timely fashion. This dag will run every minute.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def print_time():
    print(f"The time is: {datetime.now()}")

with DAG(
    dag_id='interval_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='* * * * *',
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    print_time_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='print_time_task',
        python_callable=print_time,
    )
```

If this dag was uploaded to airflow, and the `scheduler.dag_dir_list_interval` setting was, for example, 60 seconds, then we would see this dag not start for up to a minute after it has been added. This demonstrates that, while a dag may be scheduled to run at a specific time, it will not be triggered until the scheduler has detected the dag in the first place. This is a different issue than the first two examples, and needs to be considered when dealing with scheduler delays.

To further investigate and manage issues, I recommend studying the Apache Airflow documentation, specifically the sections on the scheduler, configuration, and resource management. "Programming Apache Airflow" by Bas P. Geelen is a valuable resource as well. For cloud-specific nuances in Google Composer, refer to the official Google Cloud documentation for Composer. Reading these documents will provide a much more thorough understanding of the issues presented here, as well as strategies to combat them. In addition, familiarity with profiling tools for the specific environment is also key, especially when dealing with complex configurations.

In conclusion, diagnosing scheduler delays requires a holistic approach. It’s rarely just one thing, but a combination of factors. By meticulously analyzing resource utilization, dag complexity, and configuration parameters, and utilizing the monitoring tools available in the cloud environment, we can identify and remediate these issues. This experience has taught me patience and the importance of a solid understanding of the underlying system, and a systematic approach.
