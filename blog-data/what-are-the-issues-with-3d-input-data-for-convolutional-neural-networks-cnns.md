Okay, let’s talk about feeding 3d data into convolutional neural networks. It's a topic I’ve tackled quite a few times across different projects, and it definitely has its particular set of challenges. I recall one instance where we were building an automated quality control system for 3d-printed parts; the sheer volume and complexity of the point cloud data almost brought the entire pipeline to a standstill. So, from that and other experiences, let's break down some of the prominent issues.

One of the first things you'll bump into is the computational cost. 3d data, be it voxel grids, point clouds, or meshes, inherently carries significantly more information than its 2d counterpart. This increase in dimensionality directly translates to a greater number of parameters in the neural network, especially when dealing with convolutional layers. Consider a typical 2d image—perhaps a 256x256 matrix—and compare that to a 3d voxel grid of, say, 64x64x64. The latter requires vastly more memory to store and process. When those volumes start getting bigger, the computational requirements grow rapidly. And this increased processing often means longer training times and more specialized hardware, such as high-performance GPUs or even TPUs, becoming practically essential. This is not just about the training phase; even inference time can suffer if the network isn't properly optimized. I’ve seen models take seconds, sometimes minutes, for a single prediction on complex 3d datasets without adequate pre-processing.

Then there's the problem of data representation. There isn't one universally best way to represent 3d data for CNNs. Each approach has inherent trade-offs. For instance, voxel grids are conceptually straightforward, but they suffer from sparsity. Empty space in a voxel grid still consumes memory, which can make the whole process inefficient, especially when most of the grid is void of meaningful data. Point clouds, on the other hand, are more flexible and only store information where there's actually data, avoiding the sparsity issue with voxel grids. However, they are unordered and non-uniformly sampled, which presents a different challenge for convolutional operations. There's no inherent grid structure to easily apply standard convolutions. We've had to extensively preprocess point cloud data before feeding it into networks, using techniques like octree partitioning or k-nearest neighbors to impose some sort of local structure. Meshes introduce their own set of complexities, including non-uniform sampling, topological variations, and the need for custom graph convolution methods, which are quite different from standard 2D convolutions.

Dealing with rotational invariance and scale variability is another key issue that surfaces when working with 3d input data. CNNs, by their design, are not naturally invariant to rotation or scaling. While data augmentation can sometimes help, it's not always a robust or efficient solution, especially in 3D where the possible transformations are far more complex and extensive than in 2D. For our 3D printed parts project, we needed to meticulously normalize and align the objects before feeding them into the network. This involved aligning point clouds based on principal component analysis and also involved scaling.

And finally, let's consider the issue of limited annotated 3D datasets. Compared to 2D image datasets, the availability of labeled 3D data is comparatively scarce. This is because collecting and annotating 3D data, whether it's through scanning or manual labeling, is significantly more time-consuming and expensive. This scarcity often leads to models over-fitting to small datasets, making their generalization ability subpar when used on unseen data. To address this, I've employed techniques like synthetic data generation and transfer learning from models trained on related but larger 2D datasets, projecting 2d outputs on 3d to help get better results.

Let’s look at some concrete examples in Python, specifically using pytorch and illustrating different 3d data representations.

First, here's an example of how you might represent and process a *voxel grid* using `torch`:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Example of a simple voxel grid
voxel_grid = torch.rand(1, 64, 64, 64) # Batch size 1, 64x64x64 volume

# A simple 3D convolutional layer
conv3d = nn.Conv3d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
output = conv3d(voxel_grid)
print(f"Voxel grid output shape: {output.shape}")

```
Here we use `nn.Conv3d`, a standard layer used for processing 3d grids.

Next, consider how you might use a *point cloud*. You will need to apply some kind of structure and processing to it for CNNs. Here's an example of using a simple k-nearest neighbours based approach in conjunction with a convolutional layer (assuming you have this precomputed) and assuming that each point has associated features:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Example point cloud data and associated features
points = torch.rand(1, 1024, 3)  # Batch size 1, 1024 points with 3 coordinates
features = torch.rand(1, 1024, 32) #Batch size 1, 1024 points, 32 features per point.

# Example k-nearest neighbor (knn) graph structure - assume these precomputed
knn_indices = torch.randint(0, 1024, (1, 1024, 8)) # indices of the 8 nearest neighbours for every point.

# Define a layer that performs convolution over the local neighbourhoods based on knn.
class PointConv(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(PointConv, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv1d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=1)

    def forward(self, features, knn_indices):
        batch_size, num_points, num_features = features.size()
        _, _, num_neighbours = knn_indices.size()
        # Gather features of the neighbours
        neighbour_features = torch.gather(features, 1, knn_indices.unsqueeze(-1).expand(-1,-1,-1,num_features))
        neighbour_features = neighbour_features.transpose(3, 2)
        # Perform 1D convolution on the feature dimensions
        out_features = self.conv(neighbour_features)
        out_features = out_features.transpose(3, 2)
        return torch.max(out_features, dim = 2)[0]

# Usage
point_conv = PointConv(32, 64)
output = point_conv(features, knn_indices)

print(f"Point cloud output shape: {output.shape}") # Output will be (1, 1024, 64)

```
This shows how the knn neighborhood information is used to gather feature information in a way that standard convolutions can be applied. Note, the knn indices must be precomputed.

Finally, a simple example to show processing *mesh data* using a mesh convolution approach can be done using a package like torch_geometric. Here we will assume the user has installed torch_geometric.
```python
import torch
from torch_geometric.data import Data
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

# Example mesh data, assuming faces and vertices are already read in and converted
vertices = torch.rand(1000, 3)  # 1000 vertices, 3 coordinates
faces = torch.randint(0, 1000, (2000, 3))  # 2000 faces, each with 3 vertex indices

# Generate a edges adjacency representation from faces, needed for geometric convolutions
edges = torch.cat([faces[:, [0, 1]].T, faces[:, [1, 2]].T, faces[:, [2, 0]].T], dim=1)
edges = edges.long()

# Initialize some dummy features
mesh_features = torch.rand(1000, 32) # 1000 vertices, 32 features

data = Data(x=mesh_features, edge_index=edges, pos=vertices) # Create a data object that contains both edge and features for the GNN

# Example graph convolutional layer
conv = GCNConv(32, 64)
output = conv(data.x, data.edge_index)
print(f"Mesh output shape: {output.shape}")
```
Here, the connectivity of the mesh (defined by `edges`) are used to perform graph convolutions which allows information to be passed between vertices as a function of connectivity as well as vertex features.

In each of these examples, we're using a different approach to represent 3D data and a different kind of convolution layer. Each approach has its own considerations in terms of performance, robustness, and implementation complexity.

In summary, building effective models that can process 3d input for CNNs require not just an understanding of the theoretical aspects of CNNs but also deep insights into the practical issues that arise with 3D representations, from the computational load to the challenges posed by sparsity, rotational invariance, and the scarcity of annotated datasets. It's a space where continuous experimentation and careful application of the correct tools and methods make a huge difference to the end results. For further study, I recommend delving into research papers on PointNet and its variations for point cloud processing, graph neural networks for mesh processing, and classic works on 3D object recognition. Textbooks on deep learning and computer vision, such as *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow et al. and *Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications* by Richard Szeliski, also provide the necessary foundational knowledge.
