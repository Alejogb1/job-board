Okay so you're wrestling with cost optimization for a petabyte-scale stateless search engine right  that's a big hairy problem  lots of moving parts  but let's break it down  the key is minimizing those cloud storage read operations  because that's where the money bleeds away fast

First  stateless is your friend here  no session data to worry about means we can parallelize everything  think massive scalability  but it also means every query is a cold start  we gotta fetch everything from scratch  thats where optimization gets tricky

Your biggest cost is going to be data transfer  getting those petabytes from cold storage like Glacier or Archive to something faster like S3 or even memory is expensive  and slow  the solution isn't just throwing money at it by upgrading storage tiers though that would work but at some point its not cost effective

We need smart query processing  and this is where indexing comes into play  don't just dump your data in a blob and hope for the best  think of your data as a giant library  you wouldn't search it by reading every book cover to cover right  you'd use a card catalog an index

This leads us to different indexing strategies each with their own trade-offs  I'd recommend digging into "Introduction to Information Retrieval" by Manning Raghavan and Sch√ºtze  it's the bible for this stuff  it covers everything from inverted indexes  which are really common in search engines  to more advanced techniques like LSM trees  which are fantastic for write-heavy workloads

Now here's where code snippets come in  let's imagine a simplified example using Python and some pseudo-cloud storage interactions  I'm not gonna use a specific cloud provider's API because they all differ  but the concepts are universal

**Snippet 1 Basic Inverted Index Creation**

```python
# super simplified inverted index creation
documents = [
    "the quick brown fox",
    "the lazy dog"
]

index = {}
for i doc in enumerate(documents):
    for word in doc.split():
        if word not in index:
            index[word] = set()
        index[word].add(i)

print(index) #{'the': {0, 1}, 'quick': {0}, 'brown': {0}, 'fox': {0}, 'lazy': {1}, 'dog': {1}}
```

This is just a barebones example  a real-world inverted index would be much more complex  handling stemming lemmatization stop words etc  check out "Managing Gigabytes" by Witten Moffat and Bell for a deep dive into efficient data structures for large indexes

**Snippet 2  Query Processing with Filtering**

```python
query = "lazy dog"
query_terms = query.split()

matching_docs = set(range(len(documents))) # start with all documents

for term in query_terms:
    if term in index:
        matching_docs.intersection_update(index[term])
    else:
        matching_docs = set() # no match
        break

print(f"Matching documents: {list(matching_docs)}") #Output depends on the query
```

This demonstrates the power of the index  instead of scanning all documents  we're only looking at potentially relevant ones  reducing the amount of data we need to retrieve from storage dramatically  this becomes even more crucial at petabyte scale

But even with an index  fetching all the relevant documents might still be expensive  especially from cold storage  that's where smart query processing techniques and filtering come in  you can add relevance scoring techniques to further narrow the results

**Snippet 3  Tiered Data Retrieval**

```python
#pseudo-code demonstrating tiered retrieval from slow to fast storage
import time

def retrieve_data(doc_id tier):
    if tier == "cold":
        print("Retrieving from cold storage")
        time.sleep(10) #Simulate slow retrieval
    elif tier == "warm":
        print("Retrieving from warm storage")
        time.sleep(1) #Simulate faster retrieval
    #add hot storage if needed
    return f"Document {doc_id}"

#Prioritize warm storage
warm_storage_docs = {1}

for doc_id in matching_docs:
    if doc_id in warm_storage_docs:
        print(retrieve_data(doc_id "warm"))
    else:
        print(retrieve_data(doc_id "cold"))

```

This isn't real code  I'm using `time.sleep` to simulate the latency differences between cold and warm storage  you'd interact with the cloud provider's APIs here  the idea is to keep frequently accessed data in faster storage  and only retrieve less frequently accessed data from colder slower cheaper storage  this requires careful monitoring and analysis to determine which data fits where

Beyond these snippets  consider techniques like distributed indexing  sharding  and query optimization techniques  that's a whole other rabbit hole  "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann is a fantastic resource for that  it's a bit heavier but worth the read  it covers a lot more than just search engines but the fundamentals are invaluable

Remember  cost optimization is an iterative process  you need to monitor your costs closely  experiment with different strategies  and adapt your approach based on your data access patterns  It's not about a single perfect solution but an ongoing balancing act between performance cost and scalability  good luck its going to be a wild ride
