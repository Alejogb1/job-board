, let's talk about Altair choropleth maps. It's a tool I’ve spent quite a bit of time with, and I can definitely speak to the pain points I've encountered. It's not that Altair itself is inherently flawed; rather, it's more about understanding the limitations and nuances involved when you try to use it for geospatial visualizations, specifically choropleth maps. I've lost a good few hours debugging various issues over the years, so let's delve into the common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

The core challenge with Altair choropleth maps, in my experience, stems from its reliance on data transformations and geographic data representation. It isn't a dedicated GIS system; it's a visualization library, and therefore it relies on pre-processed spatial data, typically in the form of GeoJSON. This isn't a bad thing, but it often leads to common issues, primarily around projection and data alignment.

First off, projection is absolutely critical. Altair doesn't automatically handle map projections, which means your GeoJSON data *must* be in the same coordinate reference system as the intended visualization. If you're using, say, a standard WGS 84 lat/long GeoJSON file, and you're plotting without a specific projection setup, you might find your map is distorted, or simply not visible at all. Over the years I have seen cases where people have tried combining data from different sources using different coordinate systems and the result is just a mess. You’ll often need to project your data into a suitable coordinate system before bringing it into Altair. For example, you might need to project to a Lambert Conformal Conic projection if you’re working with a specific region, and this process is external to Altair itself.

Secondly, there's the matter of data matching. In a choropleth map, you're usually binding data values to specific geographic areas (polygons in your GeoJSON). If the identification keys in your data aren't a 1:1 match with the identifier properties in your GeoJSON, you'll end up with blank areas, mismatches, or errors. Often times you end up with a partial map that has some data correctly shown but several areas left with default colors, it can be really confusing, especially if your geo-data files were produced by other teams and you are not familiar with the specifics of how the data was prepared. It’s critical that the identifying properties in your GeoJSON precisely correlate with the data keys you are using to bind the values. This often means meticulously cleaning and checking your datasets.

Now, let’s get into some code examples to solidify what I mean, highlighting these exact problems.

**Example 1: Demonstrating Proper Projection (Simplified)**

This example focuses on showing the projection requirements. I am going to assume you have already done your coordinate transformation. For example you may have used something like GDAL's `ogr2ogr` tool to convert from a different projection into a Web Mercator projection (EPSG:3857).

```python
import altair as alt
import json
import pandas as pd

# Assume this is your correctly projected GeoJSON data
geojson_data = {
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
        {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"id": 1, "name": "Area A"}, "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1], [0, 0]]]}},
        {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"id": 2, "name": "Area B"}, "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[2, 0], [3, 0], [3, 1], [2, 1], [2, 0]]]}},
    ]
}
# Convert the geojson data to text
geojson_string = json.dumps(geojson_data)

data = pd.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 2],
    "value": [10, 20]
})

chart = alt.Chart(alt.Data(values=json.loads(geojson_string), format=alt.DataFormat(property='features'))
).mark_geoshape(stroke='black').encode(
    color=alt.Color('properties.id:Q',
                    scale=alt.Scale(scheme='blues'),
                    title="Area ID"
                   )
).transform_lookup(
    lookup='properties.id',
    from_=alt.LookupData(data=data, key='id', fields=['value'])
).encode(
    tooltip=['properties.name', alt.Tooltip('value:Q')]
)


chart.show()
```

In this simple snippet, we have a basic GeoJSON structure with two polygons, each identified by an `id` and a name in properties. We also have a dataframe with corresponding ids and their values. Critically, our `geojson_data` is assumed to already be projected into the same coordinate system that Altair utilizes, otherwise the map could be severely distorted.  Note how the data lookup is performed using the 'id' values and is combined to the geometry.

**Example 2: Illustrating Data Matching Issues**

Now let’s show what happens if the data matching is not correct.

```python
import altair as alt
import json
import pandas as pd

geojson_data = {
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
        {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"region_code": "A", "name": "Area A"}, "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1], [0, 0]]]}},
        {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"region_code": "B", "name": "Area B"}, "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[2, 0], [3, 0], [3, 1], [2, 1], [2, 0]]]}},
    ]
}
geojson_string = json.dumps(geojson_data)

# Incorrect data matching - we use different identifiers
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "id": ["X", "Y"],
    "value": [10, 20]
})

chart = alt.Chart(alt.Data(values=json.loads(geojson_string), format=alt.DataFormat(property='features'))
).mark_geoshape(stroke='black').encode(
    color=alt.Color('properties.region_code:N',
                    scale=alt.Scale(scheme='blues'),
                    title="Region ID"
                   )
).transform_lookup(
    lookup='properties.region_code',
    from_=alt.LookupData(data=data, key='id', fields=['value'])
).encode(
    tooltip=['properties.name', alt.Tooltip('value:Q')]
)

chart.show()

```

Here, the GeoJSON uses "region_code", but the data uses a different "id". This results in the values from the DataFrame not being correctly mapped to the regions of the map. The map would be shown, but it will not contain values, and it will have the default color for each region, even though the correct geometrical regions are plotted. You have no way of knowing if the problem is with the visualization, or with the data transformation. The data key mismatch is one of the most common issues with Altair choropleth map and is frequently the cause of a lot of headaches.

**Example 3: Dealing with Complex GeoJSON**

In a real-world scenario, you might have far more complex GeoJSON. I have had my share of problems when the data is large and comes from different sources. Here's an idea of what it would be like:

```python
import altair as alt
import json
import pandas as pd

# Example, complex GeoJSON data - this would typically be loaded from a file
geojson_data = {
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
        {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"region_id": "A1", "name": "Area 1", "country":"USA"}, "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[-120, 40], [-110, 40], [-110, 50], [-120, 50], [-120, 40]]]}},
        {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"region_id": "B2", "name": "Area 2", "country":"USA"}, "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[-100, 30], [-90, 30], [-90, 40], [-100, 40], [-100, 30]]]}},
        {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"region_id": "C3", "name": "Area 3", "country":"CAN"}, "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[-80, 60], [-70, 60], [-70, 70], [-80, 70], [-80, 60]]]}}
    ]
}
geojson_string = json.dumps(geojson_data)

# Example data for the regions
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "region_id": ["A1", "B2", "C3"],
    "value": [25, 50, 75]
})


chart = alt.Chart(alt.Data(values=json.loads(geojson_string), format=alt.DataFormat(property='features'))
).mark_geoshape(stroke='black').encode(
    color=alt.Color('value:Q',
                    scale=alt.Scale(scheme='greens'),
                    title="Value per Region"
                   )
).transform_lookup(
    lookup='properties.region_id',
    from_=alt.LookupData(data=data, key='region_id', fields=['value'])
).encode(
    tooltip=['properties.name', alt.Tooltip('value:Q'), 'properties.country']
)

chart.show()
```

This example shows that in a realistic situation your geojson data might contain many different regions. It also includes additional properties such as country name. You would want to properly extract your correct identifier ("region_id" in this case) and bind data to that.

To get a better handle on these issues, I'd recommend looking at several sources: First, for understanding GeoJSON and coordinate reference systems, I've found the OGC standard specification (Open Geospatial Consortium) for GeoJSON to be very valuable. This can be found directly on their website. Similarly, to understand projections, the book “Map Projections: A Working Manual” by John P. Snyder is considered an authoritative source. For the Altair specific parts of this process, I would recommend going through the official Altair documentation. They also have several helpful examples of using geojson data for choropleth maps. Finally, I would suggest getting proficient with the GDAL library and its `ogr2ogr` tool, especially if you are dealing with data from many different sources and data formats.

In conclusion, Altair's choropleth maps are powerful, but they require careful data preparation, proper projection setup, and meticulous data matching. Understanding these potential issues and how to address them will be essential in creating reliable visualizations. The examples above should serve as starting point in identifying the potential causes when issues with Altair choropleth maps arise.
