Okay, let's unpack this. I’ve seen this particular quirk crop up more often than one might expect, especially during early development or when transitioning to a newer rails version like 7. The issue of objects being rendered as text in rails views usually boils down to how ruby implicitly handles object conversions within the rendering process. This isn't some kind of mystical behavior; it's a fairly straightforward consequence of how rails interprets and renders data.

Essentially, when rails encounters an object within your view that isn't explicitly a string or another type directly renderable by the view context (like a number, boolean, etc.), it relies on ruby's implicit `to_s` method. Every object in ruby inherits this method, and by default, it typically returns a string representation of the object's class and object id, which you'll see as something like "#<MyClass:0x000000010a2b3c>". This is what’s being displayed in your browser – not because rails is intentionally displaying objects this way, but because ruby is implicitly converting those objects to strings using their default `to_s` representation, which is, well, not particularly user-friendly.

I recall one particular project years ago, a complex e-commerce platform upgrade to rails 7, where we faced this constantly. We had models that contained quite a bit of logic, and when these models were accidentally passed directly to views, suddenly we were seeing these object representation strings littered across our pages. It highlighted a need for more explicit control over how we render data, rather than relying on implicit conversions. We had to get methodical about transforming these objects into renderable data.

Now, let's delve into the mechanics and look at some practical examples. The core principle to understand is that you, as a developer, are responsible for translating your model objects, or whatever you’re passing to the view, into strings, numbers, or similar, which your views can correctly render. Rails isn't going to automagically know exactly how each and every type of custom object you create should be displayed; that responsibility falls on you.

Here’s a basic code example, illustrating the problematic behavior:

```ruby
# app/models/product.rb
class Product
  attr_reader :name, :price

  def initialize(name, price)
    @name = name
    @price = price
  end
end

# app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @product = Product.new("Awesome Widget", 29.99)
  end
end

# app/views/products/show.html.erb
<div>
  <p>Product: <%= @product %></p>
</div>
```
If you run this example, you won't see "Product: Awesome Widget", or "Product: 29.99" in your view. Instead, you’d likely get "Product: #<Product:0x000000012a3b4c>". This is ruby's default `to_s` at work. It hasn't done anything unexpected; it simply rendered the string representation of your product object.

To resolve this, you need to explicitly format and extract the specific information you want to render from your object. Here’s one way to do it:

```ruby
# app/views/products/show.html.erb
<div>
  <p>Product: <%= @product.name %></p>
  <p>Price: <%= @product.price %></p>
</div>
```
In this second snippet, we're accessing the attributes `name` and `price` of the `@product` object, which returns strings and numbers, respectively, that the view rendering engine can then render without issue.

But let's say you have complex model interactions or a more complex display requirement. A better approach in many cases is to define a custom `to_s` method or dedicated presenter/view model classes within your model, which encapsulates all the specific display logic:

```ruby
# app/models/product.rb
class Product
  attr_reader :name, :price

  def initialize(name, price)
    @name = name
    @price = price
  end

  def to_s
    "#{name} - $#{'%.2f' % price}"
  end

  def formatted_price
     "$#{'%.2f' % price}"
  end
end

# app/controllers/products_controller.rb (unchanged)
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @product = Product.new("Awesome Widget", 29.99)
  end
end

# app/views/products/show.html.erb
<div>
  <p>Product: <%= @product %></p>
  <p>Price: <%= @product.formatted_price %></p>
</div>

```

Now, when the view calls `<%= @product %>`, the custom `to_s` method is used, and you’ll see “Awesome Widget - $29.99” rendered, and the second `<p>` tag will be "Price: $29.99". This demonstrates two approaches. The first, using to_s, alters the default way the object is rendered. The second, using a custom formatted_price method, offers flexibility and avoids altering the default behaviour of to_s. While using `to_s` within a view might seem like a simpler solution, especially when dealing with objects that already have a to_s method, using explicitly defined methods (like formatted_price), or dedicated presenters are much better patterns in larger, more complex applications. They make clear that the method is there for view presentation purposes.

The reason why this issue comes up particularly in rails 7 isn't that rails 7 is doing something new or different in rendering. Rather it's more likely that people are moving to rails 7, are still working with earlier development practices, and are passing model objects directly into views because that approach used to ‘work’ for simpler cases. The issue has always existed, but it becomes more noticeable and problematic as rails projects grow more complex.

For more details about object conversions in ruby, I recommend examining the documentation on the `to_s` method within the ruby documentation itself (although, its very core behavior can be observed when simply calling the method on any object from a ruby console). To get more concrete knowledge on rails’ rendering process, delve into the ActiveView source code specifically related to rendering templates, which will further explain the process of converting objects into strings in views. The book "Agile Web Development with Rails 7" by Sam Ruby et al., also covers rails rendering in significant depth, and will further deepen your understanding.

Ultimately, understanding this mechanism within rails requires a grasp of core ruby concepts. Don’t think of this as a rails-specific issue; it’s a general ruby principle that has specific consequences within rails’ rendering context. The fix isn't some esoteric configuration; it's merely a matter of converting your data, objects or otherwise, into formats that your views can handle. And, most importantly, it’s a reminder that relying on implicit object conversions is generally not a good approach for maintainable and predictable applications. It’s better to be explicit about how your objects are rendered.
