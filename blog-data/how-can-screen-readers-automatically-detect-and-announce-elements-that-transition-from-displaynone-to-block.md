Alright, let's talk about the often-tricky subject of dynamic content and screen readers, specifically regarding elements transitioning between `display:none` and `display:block`. I've navigated this issue in quite a few projects over the years, and it always seems to present unique challenges. It's not as simple as just switching visibility; we need to ensure the content is also accessible. It’s a point where seemingly benign changes can create a seriously degraded user experience for those relying on assistive technology.

The core problem arises because screen readers primarily operate off the Document Object Model (DOM). When an element goes from `display:none` to `display:block`, it’s not inherently a ‘change’ that a screen reader automatically recognizes as needing an announcement. The element technically *exists* in the DOM regardless of its display state. It's not like adding or removing a node, which would trigger DOM mutation events that screen readers typically observe. Instead, we are changing visual properties, something that doesn't inherently signal a crucial user experience change. Essentially, we are working with a semantic disconnect - visible to the eye doesn’t equal available to assistive tech, and the change in `display` is only cosmetic from the DOM perspective.

The typical naïve approach, relying only on the display property, often fails. Users who rely on screen readers might miss critical content updates because their assistive tech remains silent during these transitions. We need to find ways to explicitly communicate the change in state to the screen reader. There are a few techniques that I have found consistently effective, focusing on using ARIA attributes and JavaScript to bridge that semantic gap. Let's get into the approaches, along with some code examples.

First, consider the `aria-live` attribute. It's specifically designed to notify assistive technologies when content changes within a region. We'll pair this with JavaScript that triggers the change in display and also uses some specific ARIA attributes. In my experience, `aria-live` works best with `polite` or `assertive` values. `polite` is preferred when the change is not urgent, but if the transition contains crucial feedback, for example, a validation error, `assertive` might be required – use with caution. It can disrupt the user experience if overused.

Here's a basic example demonstrating this:

```javascript
function toggleElement(elementId) {
  const element = document.getElementById(elementId);
  if (!element) {
    console.error("Element not found with id:", elementId);
    return;
  }
  const isCurrentlyHidden = element.style.display === 'none';
  element.style.display = isCurrentlyHidden ? 'block' : 'none';
    // Clear aria-live region before setting text
    element.textContent = "";
    // Update aria-live region after display update to trigger announcement.
    element.textContent = isCurrentlyHidden ? 'The content is now visible.' : 'The content is now hidden.';

}
```

And here's the corresponding HTML:

```html
<button onclick="toggleElement('myContent')">Toggle Content</button>
<div id="myContent" style="display: none;" aria-live="polite"></div>
```

In this case, the JavaScript both toggles the display property and updates the text content within the div. That change of text is what triggers the screen reader to announce what's happening, which leverages the `aria-live` attribute. This pattern is robust and efficient when it’s appropriately scoped. By modifying the content, we are ensuring that screen readers are informed about the change. The key here is that just updating the `display` doesn't inform assistive technologies; we need an associated DOM manipulation they *do* react to.

Now, consider a slightly more complex scenario where the transitioned element contains more substantial content. In this case, we might want to use a combination of `aria-expanded` to indicate whether the content is visible and update the accessible name. Here’s the code:

```javascript
function toggleSection(buttonId, contentId) {
    const button = document.getElementById(buttonId);
    const content = document.getElementById(contentId);

    if (!button || !content) {
        console.error("Button or Content element not found.");
        return;
    }

    const isExpanded = button.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true';
    button.setAttribute('aria-expanded', String(!isExpanded));
    content.style.display = isExpanded ? 'none' : 'block';

    if (isExpanded) {
       button.setAttribute('aria-label', 'Show ' + button.innerText) ;
        } else {
       button.setAttribute('aria-label', 'Hide ' + button.innerText) ;

        }


}
```

And the related HTML:

```html
<button id="myButton" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Show my section" onclick="toggleSection('myButton', 'mySection')">My Section</button>
<div id="mySection" style="display: none;">
    <p>This is the content within my section.</p>
</div>
```

Here, the button manages both display state and ARIA state, and modifies the accessible name of the button. This allows screen reader users to understand what will happen when clicking the button, and provides them with a context. Setting the button’s accessible name also prevents screen readers from using the content as part of the button’s accessible name. This approach is especially important in more complex, dynamic UI layouts such as nested menu components or expandable lists.

Finally, let’s discuss a situation where you are loading content asynchronously. In this case, you will want to use the `aria-busy` attribute to inform screen readers that a change is occurring. The content will not necessarily be available when you update the state from display none to block. We need to set `aria-busy` to `true` during the loading phase and `false` when the loading completes.

```javascript
function loadAndDisplayContent(targetElementId) {
  const target = document.getElementById(targetElementId);
  if (!target) {
      console.error("Element not found with id:", targetElementId);
    return;
  }

  target.setAttribute('aria-busy', 'true');
  target.style.display = 'block';

  // Simulate an async content fetch
  setTimeout(() => {
    target.innerHTML = "<p>Content loaded asynchronously.</p>";
    target.setAttribute('aria-busy', 'false');
  }, 1000); // Simulated delay
}
```

And the related HTML:

```html
<button onclick="loadAndDisplayContent('asyncContent')">Load Content</button>
<div id="asyncContent" style="display: none;" aria-live="polite"></div>
```

In this case, we set `aria-busy` to `true` at the start of the process and revert back to `false` when the loading completes. The screen reader will announce that a change is occurring.

For further reading, I recommend looking at the following resources: The W3C's ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) is essential. Deque University also has invaluable material on accessible development. "Inclusive Design Patterns" by Heydon Pickering is a fantastic book for best practices in accessibility, including strategies for dynamic content. The web accessibility initiative (WAI) is also a very valuable resource. These cover many patterns and offer very solid guidance.

In summary, ensuring screen readers detect and announce the transition of `display:none` to `display:block` requires intentional action. By correctly applying ARIA attributes such as `aria-live`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-busy`, along with carefully considered DOM manipulation, you can create interfaces that are not only functional but also truly inclusive. It requires more than just visual updates; the assistive tech experience must be meticulously considered and implemented. This approach is not just about technical compliance; it's about enabling a universally accessible and equitable web.
