Okay, let's tackle this. I’ve definitely been down this road a few times, especially back in the day when we were building that massively multiplayer game with a client-server architecture reliant on frequent web communication. The key to managing asynchronous web requests in Unity, using Coroutines, really boils down to understanding the workflow and how to leverage Unity's built-in `UnityWebRequest` class in conjunction with Coroutines' ability to pause and resume execution.

The problem we face is that traditional synchronous web requests would block the main thread, causing the game to freeze while waiting for a response. This is unacceptable, particularly when dealing with longer-running operations. Coroutines, on the other hand, allow us to perform operations asynchronously, meaning they don’t lock up the main thread. They enable a kind of "pseudo-multithreading" within a single thread, which is particularly effective for I/O-bound operations like network requests.

In my experience, a solid approach involves creating a Coroutine that wraps a `UnityWebRequest` operation and yields until the request completes, then handles the response. The general structure looks like this:

1.  **Initiate the Request:** Create a `UnityWebRequest` instance, setting up the URL, headers, and any other relevant request properties.
2.  **Send the Request:** Use `UnityWebRequest.SendWebRequest()` to begin the network communication.
3.  **Yield until Completion:** This is where the Coroutine magic happens. We use `yield return request.SendWebRequest()` to pause the Coroutine until the request finishes. Unity will seamlessly resume the Coroutine when the request’s status changes.
4.  **Handle the Response:** After the Coroutine resumes, we check the status of the `UnityWebRequest`. We can access the request's status using `request.result`, and then, if successful, parse the data.
5.  **Clean up:** It’s crucial to properly dispose of the `UnityWebRequest` to prevent memory leaks.

Let's examine some code examples.

**Example 1: Basic GET Request**

This shows how to perform a simple GET request and handle the JSON response:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Networking;
using System.Collections;
using Newtonsoft.Json; // Assuming you're using Newtonsoft.Json for JSON parsing

public class WebRequestHandler : MonoBehaviour
{
    private const string apiURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"; // Just an example url for a quick test

    IEnumerator GetTodoItem()
    {
        using (UnityWebRequest request = UnityWebRequest.Get(apiURL))
        {
            yield return request.SendWebRequest();

            if (request.result == UnityWebRequest.Result.Success)
            {
                string jsonResponse = request.downloadHandler.text;
                TodoItem todoItem = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<TodoItem>(jsonResponse);
                Debug.Log($"Todo Title: {todoItem.title}");
            }
            else
            {
                Debug.LogError($"Error: {request.error}");
            }
        }
    }

    public void StartGetRequest()
    {
        StartCoroutine(GetTodoItem());
    }

    [System.Serializable]
    public class TodoItem
    {
        public int userId;
        public int id;
        public string title;
        public bool completed;
    }
}
```

In this code, we're making a GET request to a public API that returns a JSON object representing a todo item. We use `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<TodoItem>(jsonResponse)` from the Newtonsoft.Json library to parse the JSON into a C# object. It's important to have proper error handling to identify request problems.

**Example 2: POST Request with JSON Data**

Next, let's see a POST request, where we're sending some JSON data along:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Networking;
using System.Collections;
using System.Text;
using Newtonsoft.Json; // Assuming you're using Newtonsoft.Json for JSON parsing

public class WebRequestHandlerPost : MonoBehaviour
{
    private const string apiURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"; // an example URL

    IEnumerator PostNewPost(string title, string body, int userId)
    {
        PostData newPost = new PostData { title = title, body = body, userId = userId };
        string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(newPost);

        using (UnityWebRequest request = new UnityWebRequest(apiURL, UnityWebRequest.kHttpVerbPOST))
        {
             byte[] bodyRaw = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(json);
             request.uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(bodyRaw);
             request.downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer();
             request.SetRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");


            yield return request.SendWebRequest();

            if (request.result == UnityWebRequest.Result.Success)
            {
                Debug.Log("Post successful!");
                Debug.Log($"Response: {request.downloadHandler.text}");
            }
            else
            {
                Debug.LogError($"Error: {request.error}");
            }
        }
    }

    public void StartPostRequest()
    {
        StartCoroutine(PostNewPost("My New Post", "This is the post body", 1));
    }


    [System.Serializable]
    public class PostData
    {
        public string title;
        public string body;
        public int userId;
    }
}
```

In this example, we're creating a `UnityWebRequest` with the verb set to `POST`, encoding the data as a byte array, and setting the content type appropriately. We serialize our C# class into JSON, then deserialize it after the request, which shows it was a successful creation. This process of serializing and deserializing data for sending and parsing responses is very common when interacting with web APIs.

**Example 3: Handling Errors and Progress**

Finally, let's address error handling and provide a basic progress indicator:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Networking;
using System.Collections;

public class WebRequestHandlerProgress : MonoBehaviour
{
     private const string apiURL = "https://speed.hetzner.de/100MB.bin"; // a big file download to demonstrate progress

    IEnumerator DownloadFile()
    {
        using (UnityWebRequest request = UnityWebRequest.Get(apiURL))
        {
            var downloadProgress = 0f;
            var lastDownloadProgress = 0f;
            request.SendWebRequest();

            while (!request.isDone)
            {
                downloadProgress = request.downloadProgress;
                if (downloadProgress > lastDownloadProgress)
                 {
                    Debug.Log($"Download Progress: {downloadProgress * 100:F2}%");
                     lastDownloadProgress = downloadProgress;
                 }
                yield return null; //keep yielding while the request is not done
            }


            if (request.result == UnityWebRequest.Result.Success)
            {
                Debug.Log("Download Completed!");
                // Access the downloaded data using request.downloadHandler.data
            }
            else
            {
                Debug.LogError($"Download Error: {request.error}");
            }
        }
    }


    public void StartDownload()
    {
        StartCoroutine(DownloadFile());
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how we can monitor the download progress using `request.downloadProgress`. We use a `while(!request.isDone)` loop with a yield `null` statement to ensure our code is still executing while the operation is in progress and can report on how much has been downloaded. It's important to avoid blocking the thread while waiting for the download to finish.

For further reading, I'd recommend diving deeper into the official Unity documentation for `UnityEngine.Networking` namespace, specifically the `UnityWebRequest` class. Also, a good understanding of asynchronous programming patterns and the concept of coroutines is essential. The book "C# in Depth" by Jon Skeet provides a comprehensive look at coroutines and async/await constructs, although the focus on .net is not exclusively geared towards Unity, it provides invaluable information. Also, check out "Game Programming Patterns" by Robert Nystrom for patterns related to asynchronous workflows within games, although this is a bit more abstract than the code shown here, its conceptual lessons are vital for structuring complex systems. Lastly, familiarize yourself with the various status codes returned by web requests (e.g. 200, 404, 500) to enhance your error-handling capabilities. These resources, coupled with hands-on experimentation, will significantly improve your capacity to manage asynchronous web requests effectively within Unity using Coroutines. Remember, practice is key to mastering this area of development.
