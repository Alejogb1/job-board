Okay so you want to grab a return value from a thread right been there done that many times let me tell you its not exactly straightforward when you're just starting out I've lost more than a few nights to this kind of thing believe me

First off the core problem is that threads by their very nature operate concurrently they're off doing their own thing and they don't automatically hand back some results when they finish its not like a regular function call that gives you a value back on the spot You need some mechanism to receive that value after the thread has completed

Now the basic way to do this is through some kind of shared memory or synchronization technique lets start with the simplest approach using a variable which isn't optimal for every scenario but the easiest to understand and implement if your use case is simple enough

```python
import threading

def worker_function(result_container):
    # Perform some work
    result_container['value'] = 42  # Store the result
    print("Worker thread completed")

result = {}  # Shared container
thread = threading.Thread(target=worker_function, args=(result,))
thread.start()
thread.join() # Wait for the thread to finish
print("Main thread:", result['value'])
```

In this snippet I’m using a python dictionary as shared memory which can be problematic if the thread is modifying the same data as the main thread You'd need a proper lock system in place or a different thread-safe data structure if you plan to share more complex data across threads or have multiple threads modifying the same shared resource to avoid race conditions or corrupted data but this example its very straightforward.

Here I am using threading which creates a new thread of execution the `worker_function` does its thing stores a value in a shared dictionary then the main thread waits for that thread to complete with `thread.join()` once it’s completed it accesses that shared variable its a fairly simple and understandable process this solution is great for smaller cases but it becomes complex when the value you wanna obtain is more complex and you need to return it from multiple threads at the same time which is something I have had to face many times in my experience

This method works well if you have a simple value to return and only a few threads involved this was my go to method when I started out but as i said you quickly run into more complex scenarios where this will not be enough and you will be left debugging your multi-threading code for hours and this is not the way

Another common and in my opinion the recommended approach is using a queue or specifically a `queue.Queue` in Python or similar in other languages like `BlockingQueue` in java or similar. You could see those as communication channels between the threads instead of directly sharing variables

```python
import threading
import queue

def worker_function(q):
    # Perform some work
    q.put(42) # place the value inside the queue
    print("Worker thread completed")

q = queue.Queue() # The communication queue
thread = threading.Thread(target=worker_function, args=(q,))
thread.start()

result = q.get() # Get the return value
thread.join()
print("Main thread:", result)
```

Here the `worker_function` after doing its job pushes a value inside the queue and the main thread gets it using `.get()` it waits until the value is available inside the queue this is much more scalable and recommended since you don't need to keep track of shared variables and risk race conditions and locks all the time the queue takes care of the thread safety for you in this case but you should still be mindful of how you write your threaded code so you don't create deadlocks or unexpected behaviors

I personally had to implement this in a system where I was downloading multiple files simultaneously each thread was responsible for downloading a single file and placing it on the queue once completed the main thread would get the results from the queue and proceed with the files it was also useful for handling errors from the threads by placing error messages in the queue instead of returning values directly since we can put different data types inside of it

And then there is the approach of using the future class or `concurrent.futures` module in python which in my opinion is the most elegant one out of the three. It’s a more modern way to handle threaded code and in my experience it greatly simplifies complex threaded tasks by abstracting away the lower-level details.

```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

def worker_function(data):
    time.sleep(1)
    return data * 2 # some computation

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor: # Create the thread pool
    futures = [executor.submit(worker_function, i) for i in range(5)] # submit the jobs

    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures): # iterate when results are available
        print("Result:", future.result())
```
Here we're using a thread pool executor this makes it easier to manage multiple threads at once instead of manually creating and joining them individually and the `executor.submit()` method returns a `future` object you use this to get the result once the thread completes with `future.result()`. This approach was quite a game changer for me when I started to use this since it abstracts away the complexity of creating manually multiple threads and handling the return values at the same time. It also allows you to use callbacks or other advanced features for parallel processing.

The `as_completed` method is also great because you can process results in the order that they finish and this can speed things up considerably if some threads take more time than others.

Oh you know I once spent an entire weekend debugging a multi-threaded application because I forgot to use thread-safe data structures and this is why I always recommend to use the queues or concurrent futures now It is the best way to handle multi threading code and you will save yourself a lot of time and headaches

Now as for further readings if you want to dive deeper I would really recommend you checking “Operating System Concepts” by Silberschatz Galvin and Gagne it’s a bible for understanding the concepts behind multithreading and concurrency. If you want to dive deeper into python specific details check "Python Cookbook" by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones it has great recipes for solving common multithreading problems using the libraries I mentioned and more. You can also check some papers about concurrency from the ACM database they have a lot of papers on thread handling and concurrency.

In any case these are the methods I've used most often in the past these should be a great starting point for your problem Good luck and happy coding.
