Alright, let's tackle this. I remember debugging similar issues quite a few times back when I was setting up a particularly complex Hyperledger Fabric network for a supply chain application. We’d have these seemingly straightforward shell scripts, and yet, the execution chain would just break down mysteriously. The problem you're describing, where `./start.sh` fails to properly execute `./network.sh`, is usually symptomatic of a few common underlying causes, and they’re rarely ever *just* about typos. Let me break down some likely suspects and what to do about them.

First off, the most frequent culprit I've encountered is a problem with **file permissions and executability**. Linux, and consequently many of the environments we run Fabric in, is very particular about file permissions. If `./network.sh` doesn’t have the execute bit set, the shell interpreting `./start.sh` won't be able to launch it as a program. We need to ensure `./network.sh` has the `x` (execute) permission for the user running the script, or even just for any user depending on your setup. Here's a quick command I'd usually employ to fix that, if this is the issue: `chmod +x ./network.sh`. I'd recommend checking the output of `ls -l ./network.sh` before and after to see the change. You should see an 'x' appearing in the permissions string.

Another common reason for failure is an **incorrect relative path** to `./network.sh` within `./start.sh`. Although `.` represents the current directory, if the script is invoked from a different location than where the file resides, or if the script changes the working directory internally, the relative path will become invalid. For example, if the user executing `./start.sh` is in `/home/user/project` but the scripts are in `/home/user/project/scripts`, a simple `./network.sh` inside `./start.sh` wouldn’t work as intended. It would try to locate `network.sh` in `/home/user/project` instead of `/home/user/project/scripts`. To fix this, I've found it prudent to use absolute paths or explicitly define the directory for the nested script. For instance, if your start script is invoking it as `sh ./network.sh` it can help to ensure that the full path is used, like `sh "$(pwd)/network.sh"`. Using `pwd` ensures that the current directory of the script, which is known at execution time, is always used as the starting point for locating the second script.

A more insidious problem, and one I've spent a good amount of time debugging, relates to **environment variables and sourcing scripts**. Often, `network.sh` relies on certain environment variables being set before it runs. These variables could be critical path configurations, specific crypto material locations, or any number of parameters. If `./start.sh` doesn't correctly source or export these variables before calling `./network.sh`, the latter script will likely fail to execute properly. This is a very common scenario when Fabric is relying on external configurations. We need to source the environment or export the necessary variables, not just assume they exist in the child script’s shell.

Now, let’s get into some code examples to illustrate these points.

**Example 1: Permissions and Absolute Path Issues**

Here's a simplified version of `start.sh` to demonstrate the problem:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting the network setup..."
# Incorrect path, assuming start.sh and network.sh are in same directory
# ./network.sh
# Assuming current working directory of start.sh is what is needed for network.sh to execute
sh "./network.sh"
echo "Network setup script executed (or failed)."

```

And a very basic `network.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running network script"
echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
```
If `network.sh` does not have execute permission and is executed like the first line commented out above then it will cause the failure to run it.
If the user executes start.sh from `/home/user/project/` the current directory reported by network.sh would be the same. However if they execute it from `/home/user` then network.sh would report a different directory. Changing `start.sh` to the below would prevent this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting the network setup..."
# use the absolute path to invoke the script
sh "$(pwd)/network.sh"
echo "Network setup script executed (or failed)."
```

This change, combined with `chmod +x ./network.sh` , usually resolves pathing and execute permissions issues.

**Example 2: Environment Variables**

Consider a situation where `network.sh` depends on a variable `FABRIC_CONFIG_PATH`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# network.sh

echo "Network Config Path: $FABRIC_CONFIG_PATH"

if [ -z "$FABRIC_CONFIG_PATH" ]; then
    echo "Error: FABRIC_CONFIG_PATH is not set!"
    exit 1
fi

# other setup logic...
echo "Network script completed"

```

If `start.sh` does not set this variable, it would produce an error because `network.sh` would find that the necessary path is not defined.
A basic version of `start.sh` would look something like this which will fail:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting the network setup..."
sh "./network.sh"
echo "Network setup script executed (or failed)."

```

To fix this we can update the script to ensure that the variable is defined first.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting the network setup..."
export FABRIC_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/your/config"
sh "./network.sh"
echo "Network setup script executed (or failed)."

```
By using the `export` command the variable is set, and it will be available to any scripts launched after it.

**Example 3: Sourcing and Variable Scope**

Now, let's look at an example involving sourcing a file with variables. Suppose we have a `config.env` file:

```bash
#config.env
export CHANNEL_NAME="mychannel"
export PEER_ORG="org1"

```

Here's how `network.sh` might use those variables:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#network.sh
echo "Channel Name: $CHANNEL_NAME"
echo "Peer Org: $PEER_ORG"

if [ -z "$CHANNEL_NAME" ] || [ -z "$PEER_ORG" ]; then
    echo "Error: required variables are not set"
    exit 1
fi

# Rest of the script
echo "Network script completed"

```

Again, if `start.sh` doesn’t source `config.env` first, those variables will be undefined when `network.sh` runs. A failing version would be:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting the network setup..."
sh "./network.sh"
echo "Network setup script executed (or failed)."
```

To fix this, you would need to source the file like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting the network setup..."
source "./config.env"
sh "./network.sh"
echo "Network setup script executed (or failed)."

```

The `source` command imports the variables set in `config.env` into the current shell environment of start.sh, making them available to subsequent scripts executed in this shell, such as network.sh.

For deeper learning on shell scripting, the book "classic shell scripting" by Arnold Robbins and Nelson H.F. Beebe is an excellent resource. Additionally, the bash manual, `man bash`, is invaluable. For understanding Linux file permissions, any introductory text on Linux system administration will be helpful, though O'Reilly's "Linux in a Nutshell" is a great reference. Understanding the nuances of pathing and relative file references comes with practice and experience, and using the debugger built into bash, invoked by using `set -x` at the start of your script, can help in situations where the cause is not obvious.

In summary, when `./start.sh` fails to execute `./network.sh` in a Hyperledger Fabric setup, the most common causes often boil down to: file permissions, incorrect relative paths, unset or unsourced environment variables, or a combination of these. Working through these example scenarios, using the correct `chmod`, `source` and explicit path practices, combined with solid debugging technique, should help you pinpoint and resolve these issues. These kinds of problems are all a part of the journey when developing complex systems like Fabric networks.
