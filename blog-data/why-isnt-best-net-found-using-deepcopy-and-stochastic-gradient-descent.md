alright, let's unpack this. it's a question that hits close to home, having been there myself a few times, staring at a model that just wouldn't learn as expected. the core issue, as i see it, is with how we often *think* about the optimization process versus how it actually plays out when we're using stochastic gradient descent (sgd) with a copied model.

so, you've got your neural network, probably a decently complex one if you're concerned about deep copying, and you're iterating over your training data. within each iteration, you likely expect to see the model gradually converge towards better parameters, specifically those that minimize the loss function. we hope it's going to find the 'best' net. now, let's say that, for some reason, instead of updating the *original* model, you take a deep copy of it before each update, apply the gradients, and then discard the copy. that's a bit like trying to build a house by drawing a new blueprint every time you want to place a brick—doesn't work.

the fundamental problem here is that sgd, at its heart, relies on the concept of *cumulative updates*. each gradient you calculate is only a *local* direction, a small nudge towards a lower point in the loss landscape. by constantly making a copy before each update, you're essentially throwing away all that accumulated information from past iterations. each copy starts from the original weights, and thus it is not using previous history. you’re not allowing it to learn from any error, the model is constantly reset before each update and not progressing.

i remember once, early in my machine learning journey, i thought i was being clever by saving a "checkpoint" of my model after each epoch. i had some logic error that was taking the checkpoint copy, updating it using the next mini batch, and then saving that updated checkpoint as the next checkpoint. needless to say, the model never learned anything because the weights were never shared during iterations. i spent a good couple of days scratching my head about it. i ended up using a debugging session, that was when i noticed the copy-update-discard pattern. that experience taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of understanding the underlying mechanics of optimization algorithms.

it's easy to get tripped up by this pattern. the intuition that each update is a new step towards the global minimum is true, but that step needs to be building on past steps, not starting from the same initial point. imagine trying to walk up a mountain. stochastic gradient descent is like taking small steps upwards on each iteration. but if you have to teleport back to the bottom of the mountain after every step, your progress will be null.

to illustrate this more concretely, let's dive into a simplified python-like example of what's *not* going to work. assume we have a `simple_model` class that we want to train using sgd, and that we implement deep copying during the update.

```python
import copy
import numpy as np

class SimpleModel:
    def __init__(self, weights):
        self.weights = np.array(weights)
    def forward(self, x):
        return np.dot(x, self.weights)
    def backward(self, x, y, learning_rate):
        y_hat = self.forward(x)
        error = y_hat - y
        gradient = x * error
        return gradient * learning_rate

# dummy data
x_train = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])
y_train = np.array([3, 5, 7])
initial_weights = [0.1, 0.2]
learning_rate = 0.01
epochs = 100

model = SimpleModel(initial_weights)
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i in range(len(x_train)):
        # doing it the WRONG way using deep copy
        model_copy = copy.deepcopy(model)
        gradient = model_copy.backward(x_train[i], y_train[i], learning_rate)
        model_copy.weights = model_copy.weights - gradient # not updating the original
        
        # this will not do anything because model_copy is immediately out of scope
        # and not changing the weights of the original 'model' at all
print("weights after wrong approach:",model.weights)
```
in this example, a `simplemodel` instance is initialized with some random weights, and a small dummy training set. the loop is simulating sgd and inside it, you can see that we are deep copying the model before the update operation. thus, the actual model is never being updated, and this operation will produce the same weights. the problem is that it does not accumulate the gradient information, instead it throws it away and restart from the initial values, thus the weights are never updated.

in contrast, here's an example of how you would *correctly* apply sgd:

```python
# continuing with the previous example, with same class

model = SimpleModel(initial_weights) # reinitialize model
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i in range(len(x_train)):
        gradient = model.backward(x_train[i], y_train[i], learning_rate)
        model.weights = model.weights - gradient # correct update
print("weights after correct approach:",model.weights)
```
here, we're directly updating the `model.weights`, the weights are being correctly accumulated and the model is trained effectively. each iteration builds upon the previous ones. that's what lets the model move around in the loss landscape in an useful direction. that is, following the gradient direction. it will eventually converge to a local minimum (hopefully a pretty good one).

for more realistic cases you might consider using a library that implement deep learning capabilities like pytorch or tensorflow. these handle the updating of parameters behind the scenes for us. for example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# same data as before but as tensors
x_train = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]], dtype=torch.float32)
y_train = torch.tensor([3, 5, 7], dtype=torch.float32).reshape(-1, 1) #reshape to have same dim as output layer

class LinearRegression(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size):
        super(LinearRegression, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, 1) # single output

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# parameters
input_size = 2
learning_rate = 0.01
epochs = 100

# instantiate model and optimizer
model = LinearRegression(input_size)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()  # clear gradients
    outputs = model(x_train) # forward pass
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_train) # calculate loss
    loss.backward()   # backward pass
    optimizer.step() # apply accumulated gradients
print("weights after correct approach in pytorch:", list(model.parameters()))
```

in this pytorch version, the optimizer does the parameter update behind the scenes. you don't have to manually manage the weight updates. and here's a little joke i like, you would probably want to use adam, not sgd (it's much more fun). but to the issue, the core point is that you shouldn’t be creating a copy of your model before performing gradient updates.

to really solidify your understanding of optimization algorithms, i suggest delving into resources that go beyond the surface level. a fantastic resource to dig in into the mathematical foundations of optimization is "numerical optimization" by jorge nocedal and stephen wright, or "deep learning" by goodfellow, bengio, and courville. these texts will provide you with the necessary tools to see things behind the scenes, and understand what is actually happening at every point in the training process, giving you a more intuitive view of how these models operate. and that helps a lot in debugging these types of problems.
