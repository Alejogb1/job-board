Alright,  It's a scenario I've personally encountered quite a few times, usually after some late nights debugging seemingly inexplicable behavior. The issue of loaded PyTorch models behaving differently from their trained counterparts is, at its core, a matter of nuanced state and the potential for unintended deviations introduced during the saving and loading process. It's rarely a fundamental flaw in PyTorch itself, but rather a consequence of how we interact with it.

At the heart of it, when you train a PyTorch model, the `torch.nn.Module` object maintains a complex internal state. This state includes not only the learned weights (the parameters) but also things like the running statistics for batch normalization layers, or, if you’re using it, the state of optimizers. When you save the model using `torch.save`, depending on how you approach it, you might not be capturing the entire state precisely, leading to discrepancies upon reloading.

For instance, saving only the `model.state_dict()` captures just the parameters of the model. This is often sufficient for inference if your model does not contain layers that keep track of these running statistics. However, it doesn’t contain information about the optimizer’s state or any accumulated buffers that require ongoing tracking. This is perfectly acceptable, and frequently the desired method for deployment scenarios where training is not intended. The most common scenario in which one could experience differences is in the presence of batch normalization layers. The running mean and variance, computed during the forward pass in training, become critical for inference. These values are not part of the trainable parameters but are kept as model buffers.

Let's explore this with a simple example. Suppose we have a model with a batch normalization layer:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(num_features, 10)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm1d(10) # Batch Norm

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        return x

# Creating a dummy model and some data
num_features = 20
model = MyModel(num_features)
data = torch.randn(5, num_features)

# Training (with fake data). This will update the batch norm statistics.
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
for _ in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = torch.mean(output)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save ONLY the state_dict
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model_state.pth')

# Recreate the model, then load the state_dict
loaded_model = MyModel(num_features)
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_state.pth'))

# Run inference with both models
model.eval()
loaded_model.eval()
original_output = model(data)
loaded_output = loaded_model(data)

print(torch.allclose(original_output, loaded_output))
```

This will likely show that the outputs are *not* allclose. The discrepancy arises because when we load only the state dict, we load the parameters, but the batch norm layers are initialized with default running mean and variance of 0 and 1 respectively, and not the running statistics gathered from training. It is important to call `model.eval()` on both models as this disables dropout layers and ensures the batch norm layer switches to using running means instead of batch means. However, `eval()` does not fix the problem as it does not update the model to the correct running statistics.

The solution is to save the entire model object, which will include all the buffers and running statistics along with the weights. Here is how you can do it correctly:

```python
# Saving the entire model
torch.save(model, 'full_model.pth')

# Loading the entire model
loaded_model = torch.load('full_model.pth')

# Run inference with both models
model.eval()
loaded_model.eval()
original_output = model(data)
loaded_output = loaded_model(data)

print(torch.allclose(original_output, loaded_output))
```

Now, the outputs should be identical. This happens because saving and loading the entire model captures the complete state including those all-important batch norm statistics.

Another scenario where discrepancies can appear occurs when models are moved between different hardware setups. For instance, if you trained a model on a GPU and then load it onto a CPU, or even different kinds of GPU, the numerical precision can cause variations. This is especially prominent if you haven't enforced a specific floating-point type across your code. If you trained your model with `torch.float32` and you run it on another platform (or another device) with `torch.float64`, the precision of operations in the forward pass changes and you may get slightly different numerical results. While the result of these operations are still valid, they might diverge enough, especially in long sequences of operations, to be noticeable. PyTorch usually defaults to using `torch.float32`, but when you have the model on a CPU, PyTorch may use `torch.float64` as a fallback if the CPU does not support `float32` or has limited support.

To address precision related issues, here’s a simple illustration of how you can explicitly enforce the desired dtype during both training and inference:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Simple model
class SimpleLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleLinear, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Set the desired dtype
dtype = torch.float32 # Or torch.float64

# Training with specified dtype
input_size = 10
output_size = 5
model = SimpleLinear(input_size, output_size).to(dtype)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

data = torch.randn(1, input_size, dtype=dtype)
for _ in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = torch.mean(output)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model, 'precision_model.pth')

# Load the model with explicit dtype enforcement
loaded_model = torch.load('precision_model.pth').to(dtype)

# Run inference and compare
model.eval()
loaded_model.eval()
original_output = model(data)
loaded_output = loaded_model(data)
print(torch.allclose(original_output, loaded_output))
```

By explicitly converting the model to a specific dtype during training, and making sure the input data during inference is also of the same dtype, we reduce the chances of inconsistencies related to precision.

Finally, a common source of unexpected behavior stems from the evaluation vs. training mode. Remember that specific layers, like batch normalization and dropout, behave differently depending on the model’s mode (`model.train()` or `model.eval()`). You *must* put your model into `eval()` mode before inference. The example before this one already does this, but it is an easy step to miss when debugging.

For anyone looking to deepen their understanding of these nuances, I'd suggest reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on model saving and loading very carefully, including the sections on state dictionaries and buffers. The "Deep Learning with PyTorch" book by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann goes into the fine details of model structure and implementation, and is also a great source of knowledge. Also, research papers relating to batch normalization such as "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift" (Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy) provide very detailed knowledge on the inner workings of the batch normalization layers and why they can cause the discussed discrepancies. Furthermore, any deep learning textbook or course from a reputable university will cover this in a significant amount of detail. Understanding these details is vital for achieving consistent and reliable performance.

In conclusion, differences between trained and loaded PyTorch models typically come down to incomplete state capture, device mismatches, floating-point precision inconsistencies, and inappropriate modes. Paying careful attention to these aspects and following best practices for saving, loading and inference greatly reduces debugging headaches. These were hard lessons learned throughout my career but they are worth knowing and are extremely valuable when facing these problems.
