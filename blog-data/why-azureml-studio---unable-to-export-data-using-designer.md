so, you're hitting the wall with azureml studio's designer and data export, i've been there. it's usually not a problem with azure itself, but more likely with how the designer is configured or some sneaky data type issues going on. i've spent my fair share of late nights staring at error logs on that platform, so i might have a few ideas from my own experiences.

first off, let's talk about how the designer pipelines are structured. they're basically a chain of modules, where data flows from one to the other. if you're seeing a failure in the export, the most common problem lies somewhere upstream of the export module. the export module itself is usually pretty reliable when given valid input. the issue is almost never in the export function itself but in the preprocessing or formatting of the data.

i recall one time, back when i was working on a customer churn prediction project, i was pulling my hair out because the exported csv kept coming out empty. i had built a beautiful pipeline with feature selection, a trained model, and all that jazz, but the final step, exporting the predicted values, just wouldn't work. after what felt like an eternity of checking, and rechecking the modules, i realized my scoring module was outputting a column with a strange character encoding issue and the csv export module just choked, it did not know how to encode it, the error message was very non descriptive and the only message was something like “internal error”. that is a normal scenario in many cloud plataforms, the messages are sometimes too generic.

to debug your situation, my suggestion is to first, check the output of the module directly preceding the export module. you can usually do this by clicking the output port of the module and selecting "visualize". take a close look at the data types, any missing values, any odd characters, if anything looks out of ordinary it will be a great step in the right direction. if you see unusual characters there is the cause of your error.

here's a code snippet as a very basic example of a possible solution using python, where you are converting column data types to string using pandas, as data type mismatches are a frequent reason that break the pipe:

```python
import pandas as pd
import io

def data_type_fix(dataframe1):
    # Convert all columns to string, this avoids export issues with other types.
    for col in dataframe1.columns:
        dataframe1[col] = dataframe1[col].astype(str)
    return dataframe1

def azureml_main(dataframe1 = None, dataframe2 = None):
    # this is an example on how to apply the function to a dataframe loaded in an Azure ML module.
    df = data_type_fix(dataframe1)
    return df,
```

the code above shows you how to convert all columns to string to avoid issues, using the apply function you can convert only specific columns.

another thing to keep in mind is how you're trying to export the data. are you saving to a blob storage? are there any access control issues, are you using correct keys? if you are saving to a database, are the schema of the database in line with your data? it's also important to make sure the blob storage and other storage have proper access permissions configured. one time, i had a client who couldn't export because the storage container was private, they did not have set public access to the data. another frequent error is the use of wrong connection strings. sometimes is just a simple copy and paste mistake.

also, pay attention to your dataset size. azureml studio might struggle with very large datasets, especially if your workspace doesn't have sufficient resources. when dealing with large datasets, i often resort to downsampling or splitting the dataset into smaller chunks for export. that is something that can be done using the azureml designer with the split data module. also consider that the designer module might not be the most efficient way to export extremely large datasets. for extremely large scale exports you might need to use batch inferences, and process the data in chunks using code instead of the visual designer. i suggest you to read "data engineering with python" from paul teigen and jesse anderson to learn more about this topic.

here's another python example where the export format is handled specifically:

```python
import pandas as pd
import io

def data_to_csv(dataframe1):
    # Export to csv with a custom separator
    output = io.StringIO()
    dataframe1.to_csv(output, sep=';', index = False)
    return output.getvalue()

def azureml_main(dataframe1 = None, dataframe2 = None):
    # apply the export function on the dataframe from the module.
    csv_string = data_to_csv(dataframe1)
    return csv_string,
```

in that python script, the code shows how to export as a csv, you can change the output to other types such as json, xml, or any format you need, and you can add many options such as the separator used in the csv, if there is or not index in the output file. this kind of options are not always exposed in the designer.

also, consider the compute target you are using. if you are exporting very large datasets, the default compute instance may not be sufficient. it can timeout or run out of memory when the data is being processed. increasing the compute instance resources may solve many issues as this usually is a common bottleneck when exporting data with the designer. if you are using a compute cluster, increase it's resources as well.

another thing i've encountered is corrupted data. sometimes the data has some issue before being loaded into azureml studio. i once had to debug a pipeline for three days because of an undetected corrupt file, the load module did not return any error, the pipeline just stopped working when the data tried to be processed, at the time i was not familiar with the concept of data validation. you can use the "data validation" module to detect missing values, inconsistencies and many other issues, this is a powerful module that should be used at the beginning of the pipelines, it will save you many hours of debugging in the future. remember to learn from my mistakes, never skip data validation!

and last but not least, one thing that many developers forget: azureml studio is updated often and many modules are frequently deprecated, especially if you are using a very old account. i remember an old project that broke completely after some version update, and i had to migrate many modules because the old ones were completely deprecated. it is very important to check the documentation and update the modules if necessary when problems appear.

here’s an example of a python script using numpy to fill missing values with the mean, as many times a module crashes because of the existence of missing values that were not handled properly. this script covers a very common data preprocessing requirement.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def fill_missing_mean(dataframe1):
    # Fill missing values using the mean of each column
    for col in dataframe1.columns:
        if dataframe1[col].dtype in [np.float64, np.int64]:
            mean_val = dataframe1[col].mean()
            dataframe1[col] = dataframe1[col].fillna(mean_val)
    return dataframe1

def azureml_main(dataframe1 = None, dataframe2 = None):
    # Apply the missing value fill on the dataframe loaded in Azure ML module
    df = fill_missing_mean(dataframe1)
    return df,
```
that covers a lot of ground, i hope it can help you find the issue. i've covered some past issues that are frequent and that i faced in my past. and remember, in the world of tech, sometimes the problem isn't the system, it's the user *chuckles*. good luck, i am positive you will find the issue soon.
