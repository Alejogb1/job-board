Alright, let's tackle this. I've encountered this exact scenario a few times over the years, particularly when dealing with large-scale deployments of Apache Airflow. The frustration of seeing the scheduler not responding to `pid` commands can be a real headache, but more often than not, the root causes stem from a few specific areas. It's rarely a bug in Airflow itself, although that's always something we need to rule out.

First, let's clarify that when we talk about the Airflow scheduler not responding to `pid`, we're usually referring to the failure of commands like `airflow scheduler pid` to return a valid process ID, or, more concerningly, no output at all. This often leads us down a rabbit hole of diagnostics. What's going on under the hood is that when you execute `airflow scheduler pid`, the command attempts to find the pid file associated with the running scheduler process. If this file isn't present or accessible, the command will fail. This command relies heavily on the correct configuration and execution environment.

One major culprit is often related to the way Airflow is being initiated. If the scheduler isn’t started via the standard `airflow scheduler` command, or if the environment variables are not correctly set for Airflow to persist the pid file in the expected location, then the `airflow scheduler pid` command will fail. This happens more frequently in environments using custom systemd configurations, dockerized deployments or similar where the startup process is different from a plain `airflow scheduler` invocation on the command line. For instance, imagine a past project where we were experimenting with a kubernetes deployment of airflow. We didn't pay enough attention to the container setup and the `airflow scheduler` command was not running as a foreground process, thus it wasn't creating the required pid file.

Another cause is incorrect configurations, specifically how Airflow writes its pid files. The default location is often manageable but, in some setups, it’s been changed and if the `pid` command does not know of this custom location it won't be able to read it. This custom path is specified through the `pid_file` configuration option within the `[scheduler]` section of your `airflow.cfg` file. A misconfiguration here, or a discrepancy between what the configuration and your environment expect, is a common reason for issues. It's crucial that the user executing the `pid` command has the permissions to read the pid file, otherwise, it will fail silently.

Finally, it’s possible that the scheduler isn't even running. This sounds incredibly simple, but it’s easily overlooked when you’re deep in debugging a seemingly complex issue. A faulty deployment, an unhandled exception during startup, or a configuration conflict could all lead to a failed scheduler process, which inherently lacks an associated pid.

To illustrate these points more clearly, let me offer some basic Python-based examples simulating these scenarios. Note that these examples won't launch actual airflow processes but show the underlying logic and potential pitfalls.

**Example 1: Correct pid file retrieval simulation (Ideal Scenario)**

This Python simulation displays what a successful retrieval of the scheduler's pid should look like given the correct file path.

```python
import os

def simulate_scheduler_pid(pid_file_path="airflow-scheduler.pid"):
    try:
        with open(pid_file_path, "w") as f:
            # Simulating the scheduler writing its process id
            pid = os.getpid()
            f.write(str(pid))

        with open(pid_file_path, "r") as f:
            retrieved_pid = int(f.read())
            print(f"Scheduler PID: {retrieved_pid}")
            return retrieved_pid
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_scheduler_pid()
    os.remove("airflow-scheduler.pid") # Cleanup for a clean environment
```

This snippet simulates a scheduler writing a pid to a file and then reading it, similar to how the `airflow scheduler pid` command would behave with correct configurations. If this works but your actual `airflow scheduler pid` command does not, it indicates a problem with the actual Airflow configuration rather than the fundamental method.

**Example 2: Simulation of Missing PID File**

This example shows the failure that results when there is no corresponding file to read the pid from. This recreates the scenario where the scheduler did not start correctly or has a misconfigured pid file.

```python
import os

def simulate_missing_pid_file(pid_file_path="airflow-scheduler.pid"):
    try:
        with open(pid_file_path, "r") as f:
            retrieved_pid = int(f.read())
            print(f"Scheduler PID: {retrieved_pid}")
            return retrieved_pid
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: PID file not found at {pid_file_path}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_missing_pid_file()
```
This snippet simulates an issue if the file does not exist or is not at the expected location, mirroring a case when the scheduler has not been launched or has not written its pid correctly. This would output `Error: PID file not found at airflow-scheduler.pid`.

**Example 3: Permission Issue Simulation**

This snippet shows what happens when the script lacks the permissions to read the pid file. This simulates a common environment and permissions-related error.

```python
import os
import stat

def simulate_permission_error(pid_file_path="airflow-scheduler.pid"):
    try:
        with open(pid_file_path, "w") as f:
            # Simulating writing the process id, this still works.
            pid = os.getpid()
            f.write(str(pid))

        # Attempt to make the file non-readable by the current user
        os.chmod(pid_file_path, stat.S_IWUSR)

        with open(pid_file_path, "r") as f:
            retrieved_pid = int(f.read())
            print(f"Scheduler PID: {retrieved_pid}")
            return retrieved_pid

    except PermissionError as e:
        print(f"Error: Permission error: {e}")
        return None

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Other error: {e}")
        return None
    finally:
        os.chmod(pid_file_path, stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR) # Restore Permissions.
        os.remove(pid_file_path) # cleanup.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_permission_error()
```

This will trigger a `PermissionError`, simulating the scenario in which the user running the `airflow scheduler pid` command lacks the permissions to access the pid file.

To further your understanding, I'd suggest reviewing the *Apache Airflow Documentation*, paying particular attention to sections covering the scheduler configuration, specifically the `[scheduler]` section in `airflow.cfg`. Additionally, studying resources like “*Effective Python*” by Brett Slatkin, is useful for debugging and writing your own utilities around this type of problem. Also “*Operating System Concepts*” by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne is invaluable for understanding system calls, file permissions and process management which underpin these types of issues.

In summary, the failure of `airflow scheduler pid` typically points to problems with the scheduler's configuration, its execution environment, or file permissions. Start by verifying if the scheduler is actually running, check the `pid_file` path in your `airflow.cfg`, and ensure the necessary read permissions are in place. In my experience, systematically ruling out each of these potential issues usually leads to finding the root cause.
