Alright, let's tackle this. It’s a problem I’ve seen crop up quite a few times, especially back when we were experimenting with hybrid architectures for medical image analysis. The core challenge is that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) excels at feature extraction from raw data, while a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is excellent at classification, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data, even if that data isn't inherently spatial. So, combining them isn’t about just sticking one after the other; it’s about carefully considering the output of the CNN and how to feed that into the SVM.

Essentially, the integration process involves treating the CNN as a sophisticated feature extractor, and the SVM as the final classification layer. We aren’t replacing any fundamental parts of either network directly, but rather leveraging the strengths of both. The typical approach involves the following steps:

1.  **CNN Training:** First, you train your CNN on your target dataset until it achieves reasonable performance. This step is crucial because the CNN’s extracted features will be the SVM’s input. In my past experiences, ensuring the CNN’s performance was solid was critical – garbage in, garbage out, as they say. It means paying careful attention to loss functions, learning rates, and regularization techniques; all the fundamentals of deep learning apply here.

2.  **Feature Extraction:** Once the CNN is sufficiently trained, you’ll use it to forward-propagate all of your training data (or a representative subset if your data is vast) up to a layer just before the final classification layer. This chosen layer will serve as your feature representation. Often, we've found good success with the layer immediately before the flattening operation, but your specific needs might differ. Remember, what matters is a rich, high-dimensional feature vector, rather than an output ready for cross-entropy calculation.

3.  **SVM Training:** The activations from the chosen CNN layer are now used as input features to train the SVM. Here, it’s vital to experiment with different SVM kernels – linear, radial basis function (rbf), polynomial – to find what suits your data best. The decision here will be data dependent; linear kernels often perform well for higher dimensional spaces, while rbf kernels may better capture non-linearities. Techniques like cross-validation help significantly in choosing the optimal kernel and its associated parameters.

4.  **Integration & Testing:** Finally, when using the combined system, you first feed your input data to the CNN, then extract the features from that specified layer, and feed these features into the trained SVM to get your classification result. This process ensures that the CNN isn’t retrained but acts as the pre-processing step before the SVM. We would then test the combination using a holdout test set that wasn't involved in either CNN or SVM training to see its true efficacy.

Let me illustrate these steps with snippets of Python code using `scikit-learn` and `pytorch`. Note that these are simplified examples and don't include every detail of production code, but they should give you the gist of the process.

**Example 1: Basic Feature Extraction and SVM Training**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Assume 'images' and 'labels' are your loaded and preprocessed data
# For simplicity, creating dummy data
images = torch.randn(100, 3, 224, 224)
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))

# Split data
train_images, test_images, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(images, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Load a pretrained CNN
cnn = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
cnn = nn.Sequential(*list(cnn.children())[:-1]) #Remove the classification layers

# CNN in eval mode, no need to track gradients
cnn.eval()

# Function to extract features
def extract_features(images, model):
    features = []
    with torch.no_grad():
        for image in images:
           out = model(image.unsqueeze(0)) #Adding a batch dimension
           features.append(out.squeeze().numpy())
    return np.array(features)

train_features = extract_features(train_images, cnn)
test_features = extract_features(test_images, cnn)

# Initialize and train SVM
svm = SVC(kernel='rbf', gamma='scale')
svm.fit(train_features, train_labels)

# Test SVM
test_predictions = svm.predict(test_features)
accuracy = accuracy_score(test_labels, test_predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This snippet showcases how to use a pre-trained ResNet-18 model from torchvision to extract features and then train a SVM classifier. It shows the basic principle of forwarding data through a CNN and utilizing its outputs before the fully connected layer.

**Example 2: Using a Specific CNN Layer as Feature Extractor**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Assume 'images' and 'labels' are your loaded and preprocessed data
# Creating dummy data
images = torch.randn(100, 3, 224, 224)
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))
train_images, test_images, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(images, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Load a pretrained CNN
cnn = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Specific layer extraction
class FeatureExtractor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model, target_layer):
        super(FeatureExtractor, self).__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(*list(model.children())[:target_layer])

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.features(x)

extractor = FeatureExtractor(cnn, 7) # Choose the layer just before adaptive pooling

# CNN in eval mode
extractor.eval()

# Function to extract features (modified to work with specific layer)
def extract_features(images, model):
    features = []
    with torch.no_grad():
        for image in images:
            out = model(image.unsqueeze(0))
            out = torch.flatten(out, 1) #Flatten the output
            features.append(out.squeeze().numpy())
    return np.array(features)


train_features = extract_features(train_images, extractor)
test_features = extract_features(test_images, extractor)


# Initialize and train SVM
svm = SVC(kernel='rbf', gamma='scale')
svm.fit(train_features, train_labels)

# Test SVM
test_predictions = svm.predict(test_features)
accuracy = accuracy_score(test_labels, test_predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This example is a modification of the first, demonstrating the extraction of features from a specific intermediate layer of the CNN. It is achieved by making use of `nn.Sequential`, thereby allowing you to extract features from any layer.

**Example 3: Grid Search for optimal hyperparameter selection of SVM**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Assume 'images' and 'labels' are your loaded and preprocessed data
# For simplicity, creating dummy data
images = torch.randn(100, 3, 224, 224)
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))
train_images, test_images, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(images, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Load a pretrained CNN
cnn = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
cnn = nn.Sequential(*list(cnn.children())[:-1])

# CNN in eval mode
cnn.eval()

# Function to extract features
def extract_features(images, model):
    features = []
    with torch.no_grad():
       for image in images:
            out = model(image.unsqueeze(0))
            features.append(out.squeeze().numpy())
    return np.array(features)

train_features = extract_features(train_images, cnn)
test_features = extract_features(test_images, cnn)


# SVM parameter grid search
param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10],
              'gamma': [0.01, 0.1, 1, 'scale'],
              'kernel': ['rbf', 'linear']}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(SVC(), param_grid, cv=3, verbose=0) # cv = k-fold cross validation
grid_search.fit(train_features, train_labels)

best_svm = grid_search.best_estimator_
test_predictions = best_svm.predict(test_features)
accuracy = accuracy_score(test_labels, test_predictions)
print(f"Best Parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This final snippet displays how to use sklearn's GridSearchCV to fine-tune the hyper-parameters of the SVM. Optimizing the parameters improves its performance, especially when dealing with complex data.

For further study, I’d recommend starting with "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop for a solid foundational understanding of both SVMs and the statistical underpinnings of machine learning. For a deeper dive into CNN architectures, “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville is pretty essential. Also, the original papers on SVMs, like Cortes and Vapnik's work, can provide a lot of historical context. Also, check the documentation of scikit-learn and pytorch libraries, they provide lots of good examples of practical use.

Remember, the key is to leverage the strengths of each component effectively and not to overcomplicate. The combination works best when the CNN does its job of feature extraction well, and the SVM is trained on a rich and representative feature set. Good luck and let me know if you have other issues.
