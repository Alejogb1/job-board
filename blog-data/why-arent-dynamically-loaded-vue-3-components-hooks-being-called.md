Alright, let's get into this. The issue of dynamically loaded Vue 3 components not executing their lifecycle hooks is a classic head-scratcher, and frankly, I’ve seen it trip up even experienced developers. It’s one of those things that seems straightforward on the surface but reveals some nuances when you delve deeper. I encountered a similar situation while working on a large e-commerce platform a while back. We were implementing a highly modularized admin panel using dynamic component loading, and suddenly certain components simply refused to initialize correctly. Specifically, their `onMounted` and `onUpdated` hooks weren't firing as expected. After a considerable amount of debugging, the culprit, in our case, turned out to be a combination of misunderstanding Vue's reactivity system and how it interacts with dynamic imports.

The core problem lies not in the component itself, but in how Vue handles asynchronous component loading. When you use dynamic imports (e.g., `import('./MyComponent.vue')`), Vue doesn’t instantly have the component definition available. It gets it later, when the import resolves. Consequently, Vue needs a mechanism to signal when a dynamically loaded component is actually ready to be rendered and for its lifecycle hooks to be invoked. If we are not using `<suspense>` we do not get direct control over when the component is considered loaded.

Let's break down why this can happen and what we can do about it. The most common pitfalls usually boil down to:

1. **Incorrect Dynamic Component Binding**: If you're not providing Vue with a proper component definition when using the `<component>` tag, it won't know what it is supposed to load, even when the import has resolved. Typically, this means not passing the resolved promise of the dynamic import to the `is` attribute correctly.
2. **Asynchronous Data Loading in Setup**: A related issue occurs when the component itself performs asynchronous tasks in its `setup` hook, such as fetching data. If these asynchronous operations are not handled properly (e.g., not using `async` and `await`), the component might be mounted before the data is available. In these cases, hooks may execute early, but the component’s data may be in a transient state.
3. **Improper `key` Usage**: The `key` attribute is important in Vue when dealing with dynamic components. Without a unique key, Vue will attempt to reuse the same component instance whenever possible, skipping the lifecycle hooks when there is no effective change to the component.

Let’s address each of these with some practical code examples.

**Example 1: Proper Dynamic Component Binding**

In this first example, I’ll illustrate how to dynamically load a component using the `is` attribute of the `<component>` tag while using `<suspense>`. The key here is to handle the resolved promise correctly. Note, the template below is using the Options API for clarity but the same concepts apply to composition API and should be used within the `setup` method.

```vue
<template>
  <suspense>
    <template #default>
      <component :is="dynamicComponent" />
    </template>
    <template #fallback>
      <div>Loading...</div>
    </template>
  </suspense>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const dynamicComponent = ref(null);

      onMounted(async () => {
        try {
          const module = await import('./MyDynamicComponent.vue');
          dynamicComponent.value = module.default;
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Failed to load component:', error);
        }
      });

    return { dynamicComponent };
  }
};
</script>
```
In this example, we make use of `onMounted` as it's the most suitable to use alongside asynchronous code execution. We're using `await` to ensure that our component is available before we assign the `module.default` to our reactive `dynamicComponent` ref. Note the use of `<suspense>`. This is incredibly useful when dealing with async operations as it enables us to define a fallback while we wait for the operation to complete and allows us to handle the loading state much easier.

**Example 2: Handling Asynchronous Data Loading**

In the second scenario, we'll create a dynamically loaded component that fetches data during its initial setup. Crucially, we must use `async` and `await` to control execution and avoid lifecycle hook issues. This example illustrates the use of async/await within a composition setup function.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p v-if="data">Data: {{ data }}</p>
    <p v-else>Loading Data...</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const data = ref(null);

    onMounted(async () => {
      try {
          const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
          const jsonData = await response.json();
          data.value = jsonData;
          console.log('data fetch successful');
      }
       catch (error) {
          console.error('Data fetch failed:', error);
      }
    });

    return { data };
  }
};
</script>
```

Here, we’re demonstrating best practices for asynchronous data loading within the component itself. Note that if you use the `setup()` method, you must use `onMounted` in order to execute your asynchronous data fetching. By using async and await, we're ensuring that `data.value` is only set after the asynchronous API call is complete and the component is loaded as desired. This resolves the issue with asynchronous operations in the component's setup preventing it's lifecycle hooks from executing.

**Example 3: Proper `key` Usage**

Finally, let's look at how incorrect `key` usage might manifest. In the following example, we'll force a component reload by using a dynamic key.

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="toggleComponent">Toggle Component</button>
  <suspense>
      <template #default>
        <component :is="dynamicComponent" :key="componentKey"/>
      </template>
      <template #fallback>
         <div>Loading...</div>
      </template>
  </suspense>

</template>

<script>
import { ref, onMounted, onBeforeUnmount } from 'vue';

export default {
    setup() {
        const dynamicComponent = ref(null);
        const componentKey = ref(0);

        const toggleComponent = async () => {
           componentKey.value++;
           dynamicComponent.value = null;
            try {
                const module = await import('./MyDynamicComponent.vue');
                dynamicComponent.value = module.default;
             } catch (error) {
                 console.error('Failed to load component:', error)
             }

      };

        onMounted(() => {
        console.log("Parent Component Mounted");
        });

        onBeforeUnmount(() => {
         console.log("Parent Component Unmounted");
        })


    return { dynamicComponent, toggleComponent, componentKey };
  }
};
</script>
```

This example uses a button to increment a reactive `componentKey` ref, which is used by Vue’s virtual dom to determine if the component should be unmounted and remounted. This forces a reload of the component along with execution of all its lifecycle hooks. Without this changing key, Vue might reuse the same component instance instead of remounting it.

**Further Reading:**

If you're keen to delve deeper into Vue's reactivity system and component lifecycle, I strongly recommend reading Evan You's original "Reactive Programming with Virtual DOM" paper. It's the foundational text for understanding how reactivity works in Vue. Additionally, the official Vue 3 documentation is invaluable, especially the sections on Dynamic Components, Suspense, and component lifecycle hooks. Finally, the "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" by Martin Fowler offers broader insight into the architectural patterns that can inform how you structure larger applications using modular components.

In my experience, the issues with lifecycle hooks in dynamically loaded components stem more from misunderstanding Vue's underlying mechanics than from fundamental flaws in the framework itself. By paying close attention to how Vue resolves dynamic imports, correctly handling asynchronous operations in the setup function, and using the `key` attribute judiciously, you can ensure your components behave as expected. This, combined with a solid grasp of Vue's lifecycle, should help you solve most similar problems you encounter. Remember, clarity and careful consideration of asynchronous operations are key when dealing with dynamic components.
