Alright, let's unpack this `IndexError: too many indices for tensor of dimension 3` situation. I've been through this particular rodeo more times than I care to count, and it’s often a head-scratcher until you really break down what's going on with your tensor indexing.

Essentially, this error crops up when you’re attempting to access a tensor using more indices than its actual number of dimensions. Think of a tensor like a multi-dimensional array. A 3-dimensional tensor is like a cube; it has width, height, and depth, corresponding to three indices needed to pinpoint a specific element. If you mistakenly try to access it with four indices, your code is essentially asking for a location that doesn’t exist within the defined structure, leading to this `IndexError`. The core problem lies in a mismatch between your indexing operation and the tensor’s shape.

Now, let me offer a real-world example. Back in my days working on a medical imaging project, we were dealing with volumetric scans, which naturally represented 3D data. Imagine these scans were stored as a tensor with dimensions `(slices, rows, columns)`, each representing a particular aspect of the medical image data. Initially, we had code that was trying to index these scans in a 4D way; something similar to `tensor[slice_idx, row_idx, col_idx, time_point]`. The *time_point* element was completely wrong. These scans weren't video recordings; they were single-frame volumes captured at one instance. Because of this mistaken interpretation, an `IndexError` was thrown which sent us spinning for a bit before we figured it out. Let’s dive into specifics.

The heart of the problem usually boils down to how you’re creating, manipulating, or interpreting your tensors, and here are a few common culprits. Firstly, there might be a misconception about the actual number of dimensions in your tensor, which is easily misjudged if you're concatenating or reshaping them. Let's say you’re working with time series data, and you have a series of 2D images that are actually intended to form a single 3D volume, but due to some incorrect operation you may end up with them stored in a 4D tensor. The code expects a 3D tensor and indexes it as such, leading to this error.

Secondly, an unintentional mismatch in the code's assumptions can emerge. You might, for instance, assume that a function returns a 3D tensor when, in reality, it returns a 2D tensor. This mismatch in expectation can easily lead to an incorrect number of indices in downstream code, immediately triggering the error you're experiencing.

Thirdly, problems can surface during batch processing. For example, after batching, what was previously a 3D tensor might now be interpreted as 4D. If indexing isn't adjusted appropriately, errors will occur.

To illustrate these points, consider these three code examples (assuming usage with PyTorch, though the same principle applies to TensorFlow or other tensor libraries):

**Example 1: Incorrect Indexing after Concatenation**

```python
import torch

# Two example 2D image-like tensors
image1 = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
image2 = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)

# Intended stacking to make a 3D tensor (3rd dimension is like "time")
volume = torch.stack((image1, image2), dim=0)  # Shape: [2, 2, 3, 4] 

# Incorrect indexing; assuming volume is 3D, not 4D
try:
    element = volume[1, 2, 3] # this will fail!
    print(element)
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct Indexing (access the first of the stacked tensors, and its pixel at (1,2,3)
try:
    element = volume[0,1,2,3]
    print(element)
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")


```

In this example, the code intended to create a 3D representation using `torch.stack`. However, the stack method has introduced an extra dimension. The subsequent indexing attempts treat the result as a 3D tensor and fails.

**Example 2: Dimension Mismatch from Function Return**

```python
import torch

def process_image(image):
    # Intentionally returns only the row & column data to simulate a mistake
    return image[:,:, 1]   # shape [2, 3]

image = torch.randn(2,3,4)

# Intended usage assuming process_image returns a 3D tensor
try:
  processed = process_image(image)
  pixel = processed[0, 1, 1]  # This will trigger an IndexError since processed is only 2D
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct indexing
try:
  processed = process_image(image)
  pixel = processed[0, 1]
  print(pixel)
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")


```

Here, the `process_image` function unintentionally reduces the dimensionality of the tensor, but the indexing in the main code still expects a 3D tensor resulting in the error. This illustrates how subtle bugs can result from incorrect assumptions about function behavior.

**Example 3: Batch Processing Induced Dimensionality Change**

```python
import torch

image1 = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
image2 = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)

# Batch of 3D tensors
batch = torch.stack((image1, image2), dim=0) # shape [2, 2, 3, 4]


# Incorrect indexing assuming it's a collection of 3D tensors
try:
    element = batch[0, 1, 2] #This will cause an error because there is the batch index
    print(element)
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct indexing, now we access the batch element, then a 2x3x4 pixel
try:
    element = batch[0,0,1,2]
    print(element)
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this final example, the batching operation adds a new dimension, and subsequent indexing fails because the original code didn’t account for that extra batch dimension.

As for additional resources to deepen your understanding, I recommend focusing on specific tensor manipulation techniques. Reading through the official documentation of your chosen tensor library (e.g., PyTorch documentation, TensorFlow documentation) is always a good start. For more theory, you should look into resources like "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. This book provides solid grounding in the fundamentals. Additionally, the “Mathematics for Machine Learning” by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong is an excellent resource for understanding the underlying mathematical concepts that are foundational to tensor manipulation. Specifically focus on chapters relating to multi-dimensional arrays and vector spaces for a better technical understanding.

To summarise, this error usually points to either a misunderstanding of your tensor's shape or an issue arising from concatenating/reshaping, or how batches are handled. Carefully examine each step where a tensor is created or modified to see if the actual number of dimensions matches your intended indexing, and you should locate and fix the problem fairly rapidly.
