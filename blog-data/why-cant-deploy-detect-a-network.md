Okay, let's unpack this. I've seen my fair share of network detection issues during deployments, and it's rarely as simple as a single root cause. It's more often a confluence of factors. One particular incident comes to mind, a few years back, when we were rolling out a new containerized service; the deployment kept failing with seemingly random networking errors. Frustrating, to say the least. It took several hours of detailed investigation to trace it back to a combination of issues. Fundamentally, when a deployment fails to detect a network, it boils down to the deployed application, the network configuration, or the deployment environment itself not being aligned, each having its own nuances.

Firstly, the application itself could be the culprit. Consider that applications often rely on predefined network configurations or environment variables to determine where and how to connect. If these configurations are incorrect or missing, the application may not be able to establish a network connection, leading to a ‘no network detected’ situation from a deployment perspective. For example, suppose an application is hardcoded to connect to a specific IP address that isn’t accessible in the new deployment environment, or depends on a dns resolution that is not yet configured. The application then fails to initiate any network communication, and hence, appears as if there’s no network. I recall an incident where a developer had hardcoded the database server address into the application, which was obviously a huge headache when the deployment environment was totally isolated. I was able to resolve that with using environment variables and externalizing the database address. This kind of situation happens more than you might think.

```python
import os

# Inefficient: Hardcoded database address
# db_host = "192.168.1.100"  # Hardcoded IP (Bad!)

# Preferred: Using Environment Variable
db_host = os.getenv("DB_HOST", "localhost") #default to localhost if no env var is found
print(f"Attempting to connect to database at: {db_host}")
# Code to connect to the database would follow
```

This first code snippet illustrates the difference between a hardcoded, error prone IP address and the preferred way to rely on environment variables that can be configured during deployment. Using this pattern enhances flexibility and prevents hardcoded failures. This is a very common cause that I’ve had to troubleshoot.

Secondly, the networking configuration within the deployment environment plays a crucial role. Problems may arise from firewall restrictions, misconfigured subnets, or the absence of necessary routing rules. These issues can prevent a deployed application from reaching the external network, even if the application itself is configured correctly. I have witnessed situations where newly deployed services were placed on an isolated subnet lacking proper outbound network access. This often happens when creating new deployment environments without sufficient checks and balances. The problem can manifest in the deployment log as connection timeouts or DNS resolution errors, which in most case, would show that no network is detected from the application’s perspective. I've had to work with networking teams several times to iron out these issues.

```bash
# Example of a simplified firewall rule to open port 8080
# (This is illustrative and command syntax varies)
# Please consult your actual firewall documentation

# Example rule (may not work on all systems)
# Check existing rules
sudo iptables -L -v

# Add a rule to allow traffic on port 8080
# sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
# sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT

# Save the rules
# sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

This bash snippet offers a simplified example of the complexity involved in firewall rule configuration. Please keep in mind that actual implementation will vary across systems. Such settings, if incorrect, are a frequent reason for deployment failures. I have often had to troubleshoot incorrectly configured firewall rules.

Finally, the deployment environment itself (such as cloud platform or container orchestration system) can introduce its own complexities. These systems often have their own network abstraction layers and rules. For instance, a Kubernetes cluster’s service discovery mechanism may be misconfigured, preventing pods from accessing each other. Or, with cloud platforms, a virtual network might not be properly configured for the deployed instance. Another common problem is improperly configured network policies or insufficient permissions given to a newly deployed application, where the application fails to access the network due to system level permissions. In a recent project, we encountered an issue with Kubernetes' `networkpolicy` feature blocking network access; after a bit of tracing we found the policy was not configured to allow cross namespace traffic.

```yaml
# Example of a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy that allows traffic on port 8080
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-8080-traffic
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-application
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: another-application # Allows access from other pod with label app=another-application in this namespace
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080

```

This yaml example shows a snippet of a kubernetes network policy configured to allow traffic in the same namespace. Without this or similar policies, there may be cases where pods can't communicate, causing a 'network not detected' error. In kubernetes environments this can manifest in strange ways.

To tackle these issues effectively, it’s important to start with a clear understanding of the application's network requirements. Check if the application is hardcoded with IP addresses or DNS names; and if it is, immediately refactor it to rely on environment variables and proper resolution techniques. Then, meticulously examine the network configuration of the deployment environment, including subnets, firewalls, routing, and security policies. Finally, if you're dealing with a cloud platform or container orchestration environment, ensure the relevant networking components are correctly configured. This includes things like network policies, dns, services, virtual networks, and load balancers.

Debugging often involves detailed log analysis, network connectivity testing using tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, `netcat`, and in-depth inspection of system logs. Keep in mind each error message has its specific meaning and that is why it's very important to understand the underlying network and application mechanisms. For more comprehensive understanding, I would recommend diving into Richard Stevens' "TCP/IP Illustrated," and for modern cloud deployment concerns and networking, I’d advise checking out "Kubernetes in Action" by Marko Luksa.

In closing, network detection failures during deployments are rarely straightforward. They often stem from a combination of factors in the application itself, the underlying network configuration, and the specific deployment environment. Understanding each component's individual role is important for effective troubleshooting and to build reliable and scalable applications. That's where my real-world experience comes into play, having seen and fixed countless instances of these very issues.
