alright, let's break down layer assignment versus weight assignment, i've tripped over this myself more times than i care to remember. it's a subtle difference, but crucial for understanding how neural networks actually tick.

basically, when we're talking about assigning a layer, we're talking about hooking up the *output* of one computational unit to be the *input* of another. we're literally defining the network's architecture, the 'plumbing' if you will. think of it like connecting different lego blocks. one lego (a layer) takes the output from another lego as its input. no math is involved in this at this step, it's all about connectivity.

now, weight assignment. this happens *inside* of the layer. each connection from one neuron to another has an associated 'weight' (or sometimes 'bias' but that's a different can of worms for now). this weight is a numerical value that gets multiplied by the input to that connection. this is where the magic of learning happens. during training, the network adjusts these weights to minimize some error (like making a prediction come closer to the actual). these weights, these specific numbers, are what determine how strongly a signal is passed along the connections, it's the 'tuning' of the pipes.

so, layer assignment is about the structure, and weight assignment is about the values that determine the operation. i see many people mix this up, and it's totally understandable, this took me sometime to understand in detail too.

let me give you a simple analogy from my own experience, a very frustrating one actually. i remember working on a convolutional neural network for image classification a couple of years ago. i was building a simple model, and i was using tensorflow, back then i was learning the framework too. i had a convolutional layer followed by a max-pooling layer, followed by another convolutional layer, a flatten layer and finally the dense layers. i was using an sequential model, which i'm not a fan of now but at that time i did not know better options, anyway, i had a problem. i defined the layers correctly, meaning the input shape for the first layers was well set to the correct size, and every layer's output shape was coherent with the next layer. but for some reason, the model wasn't training well, it kept giving very strange, random, results. at the time, after many hours debugging, using `model.summary()` i finally noticed that i forgot to add the input shape to the first convolutional layer, meaning the input shape parameter was missing from the first layer constructor. at that moment it finally clicked, i was assigning layers in a way that was structurally correct, but i had made a big mistake which was a lack of proper data fed into my first layer. the weights are important of course but the structure is the foundation for these, you have to assign the layers and data correctly first or there's not much to learn with good weights. once i set up that parameter the model started training like crazy. that was a classic example of getting the layer assignment *almost* correct, but missing a vital little detail.

now, let's see some code snippets to illustrate this better, using keras api as it’s pretty common.

```python
# example 1: layer assignment (setting up the structure)
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),  #input_shape on first layer is crucial
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')
])

# at this point, the structure is defined, but the weights
# are all randomly initialized. we can see this in the model.summary() output
model.summary()

```

in this first snippet, we are defining the structure of our neural network using `tf.keras.models.sequential`. the dense layers are being assigned sequentially. no weights are assigned yet, internally the weights will be initialized randomly. the `input_shape` parameter, when present on the first layer, is crucial, the network *requires* it as a reference to know how big are the feature vectors to expect. without the input shape you will have a *structure* but nothing to feed to the structure. without this a lot of stuff will not function and be impossible to calculate and back propagate.

```python
# example 2: initial weight assignment (randomly assigned by default)
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')
])

# before training, all the weights are random.
# we can visualize these if we want by using layer.get_weights()
for layer in model.layers:
  if len(layer.get_weights()) > 0: # skip layers like flatten if present
      print(f"weights for {layer.name}: {layer.get_weights()}")

```

in example two, we're not *explicitly* assigning weights. we're seeing how they are *implicitly* assigned *during* layer creation, during initialization. the framework handles this part, we do not have direct control over these random values. they are random, but not completely random, many times there's a scheme behind them (like Xavier initialisation or similar) that tries to initialize them in a way that promotes good training, you can dig a little into those algorithms and initialization methods if you need to. you can also set a specific initializer to set the initial values of those weights but that is a topic for another time. we just check the initial weights of layers that have weights in this example, by iterating over the layers, and checking what's inside of `layer.get_weights()`. note that not every layer has weights associated, like `tf.keras.layers.Flatten()`.

```python
# example 3: updating weights during training

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# create a dummy dataset for this example
X = np.random.rand(100, 10) # 100 samples, 10 features
y = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100) # 100 labels (0 to 9)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# this is where we're actually using the weights
model.fit(X, y, epochs=5, verbose=0)
# after training the weights are different
for layer in model.layers:
    if len(layer.get_weights()) > 0:
        print(f"weights for {layer.name}: {layer.get_weights()}")

```

here, in example three, we're really seeing the action. the `model.fit()` method takes our data and starts adjusting the weights (not the structure), we are not assigning layers, but rather refining them. we are training a set of weights based on some input data and a cost function. the weights from the last `print` line are very different from the random ones in the previous example. after training, the weights are different from what they were at the beginning of the training, in this example i'm using random data because it does not matter much, the key takeaway from this example is to show what happens during training. this is where the learning magic happens, a series of little adjustments done using the back-propagation algorithm. in the first example we *assign* layers which provides the structure for our network, we also define the input and output shape, which is very important for the network to know what kind of tensors to expect from layer to layer. in example two, we see what is a random initial weight *assignment* which is generated internally by the framework during layer construction. and in the third example we train those weights, meaning, we're adjusting those weights via the training of the network. a whole world separates layer assignment, from weight assignment.

so, the takeaway is, think of layer assignment as designing the blueprints of a building, and weight assignment as selecting the materials, how much of each material to use, and how to join them. the structure or blueprint of the building is necessary for the materials and their connection. and you need materials with specific properties in order to be able to built the building. both are important, but very different concepts. one is structural, the other is the actual operation.

if you want to dive deep into the underlying math, i'd suggest checking out "deep learning" by goodfellow, bengio, and courville, it's kind of like the bible of deep learning. also, "neural networks and deep learning" by michael nielsen is a great option, especially if you like to start with the fundamentals. these should provide a solid foundation on the theory behind all of this. reading those texts will give you the intuition you might need about the different layers, weights, backpropagation and the actual math behind it.

i hope this helps, i know the first time i've come across this it felt like i was running into walls for days, you're not alone with that feeling. just keep experimenting and keep reading and it will eventually click. and remember, if you try to assign weights directly to layers using the setter method of `get_weights()` when they do not have a compatible shape with the current layer or dimensions, you're gonna have a bad time, that’s for sure. (it's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole).
