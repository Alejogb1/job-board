Okay, let's get down to brass tacks. Passing data directly to a command step in Azure machine learning, as you've framed it, is a common need, and I've certainly encountered it a fair number of times over the years. Back when I was working on a large-scale anomaly detection system for a manufacturing client, we frequently had to orchestrate complex preprocessing pipelines that relied on command steps to execute custom scripts, and properly feeding data into those steps was paramount. It’s not always as straightforward as a traditional function call; we're dealing with distributed execution and managed environments, so a bit of finesse is required.

The short answer is: it’s achieved through a combination of input specifications and careful use of file paths within your AzureML command step definitions. Think of it less like injecting data directly into a function, and more like setting up the environment so your script can access the necessary data. AzureML provides mechanisms to bind external data sources to the compute environment where your command runs. This is crucial, not just for accessing input data, but also for correctly versioning, managing, and tracking data throughout your pipeline.

Now, when I say "external data sources," I'm referring to both Azure storage blobs or data stores, but also literal, smaller datasets that you might want to pass in directly, which is often what people mean when they ask this question. You wouldn't be passing something like a huge dataset directly, of course; that would be incredibly inefficient and impractical. For those, you’d leverage azureml data assets or datastores. Instead, what we typically do is pass parameters, or smaller datasets as inputs. Let’s focus on those scenarios.

The key component here is the `inputs` parameter of the command step constructor in the python sdk. Let’s illustrate this with a few examples and break them down.

**Example 1: Passing a single string parameter.**

Let’s say you want your command step to know the name of a specific model configuration. You wouldn't create an entire dataset for that; it makes more sense to pass it directly.

```python
from azure.ai.ml import command, Input
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment

env = Environment(
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04:latest",
    conda_file="conda.yaml" #Assume this conda file sets up necessary deps
)

command_step_single_param = command(
    command="python my_script.py --model_name ${{inputs.model_name}}",
    inputs={
        "model_name": Input(type="string", description="Name of the model configuration")
    },
    environment=env,
    code="./src",  # Assumes your my_script.py is in a folder called src
    compute="my-compute-cluster" #Name of the compute target
)

#When submitted, the 'model_name' input is bound to a string
# you pass into the step via a dict:

inputs_for_submission = {
    "model_name": "bert-large-v2"
}

```

In this first snippet, we define a command step where the `command` argument invokes `my_script.py` and passes the value of the `model_name` input using the string substitution `{{inputs.model_name}}`. The `inputs` dictionary defines the input, specifying its name (model_name), its type (`string`), and optionally, a description. Importantly, the actual value for `model_name` will be provided when you submit the pipeline using something like, `my_pipeline_job = ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(pipeline_job, inputs = inputs_for_submission)`. You are binding data to the execution environment in the actual pipeline submission stage.

**Example 2: Passing a list of string parameters.**

Now let's say you need to pass a list of training parameters, something that is common.

```python
from azure.ai.ml import command, Input
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment

env = Environment(
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04:latest",
    conda_file="conda.yaml" #Assume this conda file sets up necessary deps
)

command_step_list_param = command(
    command="python my_script.py --training_params ${{inputs.training_params}}",
    inputs={
        "training_params": Input(type="string", description="List of training parameters, comma separated")
    },
    environment=env,
    code="./src",
    compute="my-compute-cluster"
)

#When submitted, the 'training_params' input is bound to a string
# you pass into the step via a dict:

inputs_for_submission = {
    "training_params": "learning_rate=0.001,batch_size=32,epochs=10"
}
```

Here, we're passing a comma-separated string that our Python script will need to parse. It's crucial that the script within `my_script.py` handles the string parsing itself. The AzureML step is only responsible for ensuring the data is available as part of the environment the script runs within. I’ve included the string type, for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you might choose to represent your parameters as JSON encoded string and parse that, especially for more complicated inputs.

**Example 3: Passing a small JSON-like configuration file as string**

This is perhaps the most versatile way to pass in complex configurations without needing full-fledged file paths.

```python
from azure.ai.ml import command, Input
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment
import json

env = Environment(
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04:latest",
    conda_file="conda.yaml" #Assume this conda file sets up necessary deps
)


command_step_config = command(
    command="python my_script.py --config ${{inputs.config}}",
    inputs={
        "config": Input(type="string", description="Json configuration string")
    },
    environment=env,
    code="./src",
    compute="my-compute-cluster"
)

config_data = {
    "data_path": "/path/to/your/data",
    "hyperparameters": {
        "learning_rate": 0.001,
        "dropout": 0.5
    }
}


inputs_for_submission = {
    "config": json.dumps(config_data)
}
```

In this case, we're passing a JSON string representation of a dictionary. The key here is the use of the `json.dumps` to convert a python dictionary to a string that the Azure command step can handle. The `my_script.py` must then parse this using `json.loads()`. This pattern is quite powerful; you can pass entire configuration files as strings, allowing for flexibility in how the command step is parameterized.

In practice, I've found that careful planning of your input and output parameters often determines the simplicity and maintainability of your azureml pipelines. Overly complex input handling within your script should be avoided; aim for clarity and separation of concerns.

For further study, I highly recommend "Programming Microsoft Azure" by Haishi Bai and “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” by Martin Kleppmann, which provides a solid foundation in distributed systems. Also, the official Azure Machine Learning documentation provides comprehensive examples and best practices for working with pipeline steps and data handling, especially look for documentation surrounding Input types. Lastly, keep abreast of the Azure Machine learning Python SDK updates, as features and best practices can evolve. The more time you spend looking into these foundational sources, the better you will be at setting up robust and flexible data pipelines. It makes a substantial difference when debugging.

Remember, while you might not literally ‘pass data’ into a command step the way you’d pass arguments into a function call, using inputs with proper type specification allows for robust and reliable data transfer within the managed AzureML environment. And this provides flexibility and control you need when orchestrating complex machine learning tasks.
