Okay, let's get into this. I've seen this particular headache quite a few times over the years, and it's usually not a single smoking gun, but a constellation of potential culprits. The situation where your Django/Wagtail admin page links are directing to invalid addresses is frustrating, but very solvable with a systematic approach. Let's break down some of the most common reasons this happens and how to address them.

Firstly, one frequent cause involves misconfigured url patterns, either in your Django project's root `urls.py` file or within individual apps. In a project I worked on circa 2016, we had a particularly gnarly instance of this. The admin urls, which are designed to live under the `/admin/` path, were being inadvertently clobbered by a catch-all rule meant for a different part of the application. This resulted in the admin pages redirecting to, effectively, page not found addresses. Essentially, the routing wasn't letting the intended admin handlers receive the request, and we kept getting bounced to the wrong place.

Another common issue, particularly prevalent with Wagtail, stems from incorrect configuration of Wagtail's own url routing, which lives on top of Django's system. Wagtail relies heavily on serving pages, including admin pages, based on defined paths and structures. Misaligned settings, or accidental duplication of url configurations, can wreak havoc. You might find that what looks like a perfectly valid admin url internally is not recognized correctly due to misconfigurations.

A third, often overlooked, problem is related to middleware. If you have custom middleware that modifies request paths, particularly if you're implementing some kind of localization or authentication system, you might find it inadvertently altering paths that are meant for the admin panel before they reach the intended handlers. This can lead to redirects and 404s, particularly if the middleware isn't designed to handle admin paths specifically. I remember one project where overly aggressive localization middleware was re-writing admin urls, rendering parts of the admin completely inaccessible.

To illustrate these points, letâ€™s look at some simplified code examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect URL Pattern in Root `urls.py`**

Imagine this snippet in your main project `urls.py`:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, re_path
from . import views # let's assume a basic views.py exists


urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    re_path(r'^(.*)$', views.catch_all, name='catch_all'),  # Problematic catch-all
]
```

Here, the `re_path(r'^(.*)$', views.catch_all)` acts as a catch-all, intercepting any requests to your domain which includes the intended admin pages. The `admin/` path is matched by the `^(.*)$` regex and passed to `views.catch_all`. The order matters a great deal; Django matches the first pattern that fits and this catch-all, being overly broad, shadows the admin URLs. The solution would be to reorder the patterns so the more specific pattern for admin comes first or exclude `admin/` from the catch-all using regex lookahead.

**Example 2: Misconfiguration of Wagtail URLs**

A simplified scenario in Wagtail:

```python
from django.urls import path, include
from wagtail import urls as wagtail_urls
from wagtail.admin import urls as wagtailadmin_urls
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
   path('cms/', include(wagtailadmin_urls)),
   path('', include(wagtail_urls)), # Wagtail pages, usually last
   path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
   path('some/other/url', views.some_other_view, name="some_other_view")
]
```

In this snippet, Wagtail's admin urls are defined under `/cms/`, not `/admin/`, which is the more usual and expected path. This is also common in cases where teams change the admin url to add security through obscurity. If a user expects to access the Wagtail admin at `/admin/` they will experience redirects to a place not configured to handle their requests. To address this, the admin url definition must be standardized to `/admin/`, or the Wagtail documentation must be consulted to understand how the urls are being managed. Furthermore, `/admin/` should be placed before the Wagtail page route to ensure admin takes priority.

**Example 3: Problematic Middleware**

Let's say you have some middleware like this:

```python
from django.utils import translation
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect


class LanguageRedirectMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        path = request.path
        if path.startswith('/admin'):
           return self.get_response(request)
        
        if not path.startswith(('/en/', '/fr/')): # Assume only EN and FR supported
           translation.activate('en')
           return HttpResponseRedirect(f'/en{path}')

        return self.get_response(request)

```

This middleware intends to prepend the appropriate language code to the URL. However, while it correctly *attempts* to exempt admin URLs from modification, a typo such as missing a trailing `/` in the condition would still cause re-writing of `/admin` to `/en/admin` , which, because of a lack of a route for `/en/admin`, results in a broken page load. The fix is in ensuring that all code blocks are correct by applying good testing practices. The middleware must also correctly handle requests that do not start with `/` to prevent further errors.

These examples highlight some common issues, but the resolution often involves a combination of things. Debugging this kind of problem is an iterative process. I usually start by carefully reviewing the project's `urls.py`, starting from the root `urls.py` file, then move to the relevant app's `urls.py` files or look for Wagtail specific definitions. Following that, I inspect middleware. Tools like Django's debug toolbar, when set to `DEBUG = True` is invaluable, and logging all the urls matched by the urlpatterns helps immensely. I also highly recommend the use of Django's `reverse()` function when creating URLs in templates to prevent hardcoded URLs.

For further study, I'd recommend exploring the following resources. Firstly, *"Two Scoops of Django"* by Daniel Roy Greenfeld and Audrey Roy Greenfeld is a practical, excellent resource and includes advice on URL patterns and request handling. For a deeper understanding of URL patterns, *"Regular Expressions Cookbook"* by Jan Goyvaerts and Steven Levithan is a very worthwhile read, and can help when dealing with complex regex. Finally, the official Django documentation, specifically the section on URL dispatch, is essential, and I always find myself consulting it, even after years of working with Django. And of course, the Wagtail documentation on routing and serving pages is essential if Wagtail is a component of the application.

In summary, when dealing with redirecting Django/Wagtail admin page links, remember to methodically examine your url configurations, watch out for middleware interference, and double-check any custom logic that might be redirecting your requests. With careful tracing and methodical debugging, the issue can almost always be tracked down and resolved.
