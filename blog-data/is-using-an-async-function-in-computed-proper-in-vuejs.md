Okay, let's dive into this. I recall a rather complex project a few years back involving a real-time dashboard built with Vue.js, where we initially tried to shoehorn async operations directly into computed properties. It quickly turned into a debugging nightmare, highlighting why that approach is generally not recommended. So, the short answer is: while technically possible, directly using async functions within computed properties in Vue.js is generally a bad practice and introduces significant complexity.

Why? Computed properties in Vue.js are designed to be synchronous and deterministic. They are meant to derive a value from existing data and return it immediately. The Vue reactivity system heavily relies on this predictable behavior. When you introduce asynchronous operations, like fetching data from an api, within a computed property, the expected flow breaks down. The reactivity system expects a return value instantly, not a promise that resolves at some future time.

Imagine, for instance, that a computed property fetches user data. If this fetching process is async, the computed property initially returns a promise. This promise then becomes the observed value. This is problematic as the template may attempt to access properties of this promise, leading to errors or unpredictable rendering behavior. Moreover, there's no straightforward way for the computed property to update the template with the actual data when the promise resolves. You'd find that the template wouldn’t update as it should because computed properties do not trigger updates when their values are derived from an async operation resolving.

Let's illustrate with a simple code snippet. Suppose you have something like this:

```javascript
// Incorrect usage of async in a computed property

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      userId: 1,
    };
  },
  computed: {
      async userData() {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${this.userId}`);
        return await response.json();
      },
  },
};
```

In this snippet, `userData` would initially resolve to a promise. Accessing `userData.name` in the template wouldn't work; it would attempt to read ‘name’ on a promise, not a user object. This leads to a poor user experience and hard to debug code.

The Vue documentation itself strongly advises against this. Computed properties should be synchronous and pure. Asynchronous side effects belong elsewhere. The recommended approach is to use methods or watchers instead for operations that involve asynchronous tasks. These provide more control and better integration with the Vue reactivity system.

Now, let's look at how to accomplish something similar correctly using a method. We would move the async logic to a method and handle the reactive state with a separate data property:

```javascript
// Correct usage of an async method for data fetching

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      userId: 1,
      user: null,
      loading: false,
      error: null
    };
  },
  methods: {
     async fetchUserData() {
        this.loading = true;
        this.error = null;
        try {
          const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${this.userId}`);
          if(!response.ok){
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
          }
          this.user = await response.json();
        } catch (err) {
          this.error = err.message
        } finally {
           this.loading = false;
        }
     }
  },
  watch: {
      userId: {
          immediate: true,
          handler: 'fetchUserData'
      }
  }

};
```

Here, we use a method, `fetchUserData`, to perform the asynchronous operation. We manage loading and error states, which is crucial for providing feedback to the user. The `watch` property ensures that whenever the `userId` changes, the function is called and the user data is fetched and updated. This provides much better control and clear separation of concerns compared to the computed example. This way, the asynchronous process does not interfere with the reactivity system of Vuejs. The computed properties can now work with the `user` property in a reactive and predictable manner.

Finally, consider a more nuanced scenario, where you need to format the fetched user data. Now, your computed property can actually do what it’s designed for – manipulate data synchronously:

```javascript
export default {
    data() {
      return {
          userId: 1,
          user: null,
          loading: false,
          error: null
      };
    },
   methods: {
     async fetchUserData() {
        this.loading = true;
        this.error = null;
        try {
          const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${this.userId}`);
          if(!response.ok){
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
          }
          this.user = await response.json();
        } catch (err) {
          this.error = err.message
        } finally {
           this.loading = false;
        }
     }
   },
    computed: {
        formattedUserName() {
            if(this.user){
               return `${this.user.firstName} ${this.user.lastName.toUpperCase()}`;
            }
            return "Loading..."; //Or perhaps a better placeholder here.
        }
    },
  watch: {
    userId: {
        immediate: true,
        handler: 'fetchUserData'
      }
  }
};

```

In this example, the `formattedUserName` computed property is now correctly used to format the user's name, based on the asynchronously fetched `user` data. The async logic is clearly separated into a method, making the system easier to reason about. Note the inclusion of the error handling, and loading state, as this is important for a better user experience.

For those looking to delve deeper, I'd suggest reviewing the Vue.js official documentation, particularly the sections on computed properties, methods, and reactivity. Also, “Eloquent JavaScript” by Marijn Haverbeke is a brilliant resource for understanding asynchronous programming concepts generally. Another worthwhile read would be "Effective JavaScript" by David Herman, which offers many valuable principles applicable to this discussion. Additionally, "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford although a little dated, still offers insights into how to use JavaScript well and should be on every experienced JavaScript developer's reading list.

In summary, avoid asynchronous operations within computed properties in Vue.js. It's a design principle that enhances predictability and keeps the codebase cleaner. Use methods or watchers for fetching data and use computed properties for data transformation once the data is loaded and available synchronously. This separation of concerns leads to more robust and maintainable Vue.js applications.
