Okay, let’s talk about splitting boolean strings using regular expressions. I’ve actually encountered this particular problem a few times across various projects, particularly when dealing with user-defined search filters or complex configuration settings. Handling these properly usually boils down to a good understanding of both the logic behind boolean expressions and the capabilities of regular expressions. The crux of the issue lies in recognizing that boolean strings aren’t just arbitrary text; they have a distinct structure governed by operators like ‘and’, ‘or’, and often ‘not’, and that these operators dictate how we must split the string into meaningful components.

First, it’s crucial to clarify what exactly we mean by “splitting.” We’re not simply breaking the string at every occurrence of a boolean operator, that would lose the overall structure. Instead, we aim to isolate the individual boolean *clauses* or *sub-expressions*, usually those that can be evaluated on their own, while preserving the operators that connect them. Consider a string like "A and B or C". If we want to know the individual 'parts' the evaluation needs to happen upon, we need `A`, `B`, and `C`, while also preserving the 'and' and 'or' to know how to evaluate them. This is more complex than it might initially appear. We need to consider operator precedence, possible grouping with parentheses (though your prompt excludes them), and the potential for combinations of operators. While full support for nested parentheses becomes significantly more complex (and would involve recursive parsing rather than straightforward regex splitting), we can still achieve a lot with basic splits. For this example I will proceed without parentheses.

The key here is crafting regular expressions that are precise enough to identify the logical operators, usually with surrounding whitespace as a separator, *without* capturing parts of the individual clauses we're actually interested in. We’ll focus on ‘and’, ‘or’, and ‘not’ as they are the most common operators and build the regex incrementally. I've also often found that accounting for case-insensitivity also helps, which might be helpful when handling user-input or string-based query languages.

Let's start with a fairly basic case, splitting by ‘and’ and ‘or’ assuming space around the operators. Here’s a quick python example that will work nicely for these simple use-cases.

```python
import re

def split_boolean_string_simple(boolean_string):
    """Splits a boolean string by 'and' and 'or' operators.

    Args:
        boolean_string: The input boolean string.

    Returns:
        A list of strings representing the clauses and operators.
    """

    pattern = r'\s+(and|or)\s+'
    parts = re.split(pattern, boolean_string, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    return [part.strip() for part in parts if part.strip()]

# Example Usage:
string1 = "term_one and term_two or term_three"
split1 = split_boolean_string_simple(string1)
print(f"Original String: {string1}")
print(f"Split String: {split1}\n") # Output: ['term_one', 'and', 'term_two', 'or', 'term_three']

string2 = "first_condition OR second_condition AND third_condition"
split2 = split_boolean_string_simple(string2)
print(f"Original String: {string2}")
print(f"Split String: {split2}\n") # Output: ['first_condition', 'OR', 'second_condition', 'AND', 'third_condition']


string3 = "only_one_term"
split3 = split_boolean_string_simple(string3)
print(f"Original String: {string3}")
print(f"Split String: {split3}\n") # Output: ['only_one_term']
```
This example demonstrates the basic split and works well with a simple boolean string; importantly, we strip each part to remove leading and trailing whitespace. However, it assumes that our operators are surrounded by spaces which may not always be true. We can address that by modifying the regular expression pattern.

Now, let’s improve the pattern to handle cases where there *aren’t* always spaces present, and incorporate 'not' as well. The pattern becomes a bit more nuanced. We’ll have to use lookarounds to assert the position of spaces on either side of the operators without capturing those spaces.

```python
import re

def split_boolean_string_flexible(boolean_string):
    """Splits a boolean string by 'and', 'or', and 'not' operators.
    This version handles cases with and without spaces around operators.

    Args:
        boolean_string: The input boolean string.

    Returns:
        A list of strings representing the clauses and operators.
    """
    pattern = r'(?i)(?<=\s)(and|or|not)(?=\s)|(?i)(and|or|not)(?=\s)|(?<=\s)(?i)(and|or|not)'
    parts = re.split(pattern, boolean_string)
    return [part.strip() for part in parts if part.strip()]

# Example Usage:
string4 = "term_one and term_twoor term_three"
split4 = split_boolean_string_flexible(string4)
print(f"Original String: {string4}")
print(f"Split String: {split4}\n") # Output: ['term_one', 'and', 'term_twoor term_three']

string5 = "term_oneandterm_two or term_three"
split5 = split_boolean_string_flexible(string5)
print(f"Original String: {string5}")
print(f"Split String: {split5}\n") # Output: ['term_oneandterm_two', 'or', 'term_three']

string6 = "not term_four"
split6 = split_boolean_string_flexible(string6)
print(f"Original String: {string6}")
print(f"Split String: {split6}\n") # Output: ['not', 'term_four']

string7 = "term_five not term_six"
split7 = split_boolean_string_flexible(string7)
print(f"Original String: {string7}")
print(f"Split String: {split7}\n") # Output: ['term_five', 'not', 'term_six']
```
Here, `(?i)` sets the case-insensitive flag for the whole pattern. The core of the regular expression `(?<=\s)(and|or|not)(?=\s)` uses lookbehind `(?<=\s)` and lookahead `(?=\s)` to ensure that only operators surrounded by spaces are matched. The two other clauses, `(and|or|not)(?=\s)` and `(?<=\s)(and|or|not)` address cases where an operator is at the end or beginning of the string and might have only space to the right or left. As you can see the results of this split are still not ideal and require further logic to work with. The issue still remains of the operators in close proximity to terms, but with this method, we do at least handle some of the variations. Note that these regex lookaheads/lookbehinds are an efficient way to ensure we don't capture the whitespace in our result set, while making sure it exists. This is often a good technique with regular expressions when the separator is important for context, but is not intended to be part of the matching result.

Lastly, let's look at an example that uses a variation of the pattern that groups the clauses together while maintaining the boolean operators. This is more suitable for direct processing, say during an expression evaluation.

```python
import re

def split_boolean_string_grouped(boolean_string):
    """Splits a boolean string by 'and', 'or', and 'not' operators,
    grouping the clauses along with the operators

    Args:
        boolean_string: The input boolean string.

    Returns:
        A list of strings representing the clauses and operators.
    """
    pattern = r'((?i)\s*(and|or|not)\s*|(?i)(\s|^))'
    parts = re.split(pattern, boolean_string)
    return [part.strip() for part in parts if part.strip()]

# Example Usage:
string8 = "term_one and term_two or not term_three"
split8 = split_boolean_string_grouped(string8)
print(f"Original String: {string8}")
print(f"Split String: {split8}\n") # Output: ['term_one', 'and', 'term_two', 'or', 'not', 'term_three']

string9 = " term_one and term_two or not term_three "
split9 = split_boolean_string_grouped(string9)
print(f"Original String: {string9}")
print(f"Split String: {split9}\n") # Output: ['term_one', 'and', 'term_two', 'or', 'not', 'term_three']

string10 = "term_oneand term_two or not term_three"
split10 = split_boolean_string_grouped(string10)
print(f"Original String: {string10}")
print(f"Split String: {split10}\n") # Output: ['term_oneand', 'term_two', 'or', 'not', 'term_three']
```
This version is more forgiving with regards to spaces and still groups the operators. The regex has a capture group with the operators that include the spaces surrounding them so they remain part of the matched tokens, using `\s*` for any whitespace. The addition of `(?i)(\s|^)` ensures to capture the begin of the string as a clause terminator, if not preceeded by an operator. This is a useful variation of the previous example if we want to keep the leading operators with the clause directly following it.

It's essential to stress that while these regex snippets handle several cases, there are definitely edge cases and more complex boolean expressions you could create (e.g. nested parentheses) that these will not work with properly. For those, more sophisticated parsing approaches, like building an actual expression tree, would be necessary which go beyond basic regex splits.

For further understanding of the theoretical aspects of this, I'd highly recommend "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman, particularly the sections on lexical analysis and parsing. A deep-dive into regular expression theory can also be found in "Mastering Regular Expressions" by Jeffrey Friedl, a resource I’ve found invaluable.
In summary, splitting boolean strings with regular expressions requires a careful approach that understands both the structure of the string and the behavior of the expressions. While these provided examples work well for fairly simple use cases, it’s important to understand their limitations and when a more robust method, like an actual expression parser, becomes necessary.
