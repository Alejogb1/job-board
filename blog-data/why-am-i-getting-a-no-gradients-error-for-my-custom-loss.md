Alright, let's unpack this 'no gradients' issue. It's a frustratingly common problem, and I've certainly spent my fair share of evenings chasing it down. From my experience, especially when working on those convoluted object detection models a few years back, custom loss functions can be a real breeding ground for this specific error. It usually boils down to one of a few core problems, and it's less often a fault of the framework itself and more often an issue with how we're defining the loss computation or how we're handling the tensors within that process.

The fundamental issue with a 'no gradients' error in a deep learning context is that the automatic differentiation engine, the mechanism that computes derivatives so your model can learn, can't find a path to propagate the gradient signal back through your custom loss function. In effect, it means some operation or series of operations within your custom loss has broken the computational graph required for backpropagation. This effectively stops any learning from happening. So, here's a breakdown of the usual suspects and what we can do to catch them.

First and foremost, a frequent culprit is incorrect handling of tensor detachments. Sometimes, when you’re trying to perform calculations not explicitly part of the training graph, you might inadvertently detach a tensor that should be connected to the gradient flow. This typically happens when we’re moving tensors across devices (cpu to gpu or vice versa) or converting tensors to other data types using methods that create detached copies. Consider this simplified, albeit hypothetical scenario: let’s say you have a custom loss that involves calculating a ratio between two components of your model’s prediction:

```python
import torch

def custom_loss_example_1(predictions, targets):
    component_a = predictions[:, 0]
    component_b = predictions[:, 1]

    # Incorrectly detach component_b
    component_b_detached = component_b.detach()

    ratio = component_a / component_b_detached
    loss = torch.mean((ratio - targets) ** 2)
    return loss

# Example usage
predictions = torch.tensor([[2.0, 1.0], [4.0, 2.0], [6.0, 3.0]], requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.tensor([1.8, 2.1, 1.9])

loss = custom_loss_example_1(predictions, targets)
loss.backward()

# Check gradients
print(predictions.grad) # You'd likely get None or all zeros, signifying the no gradient issue
```

In the above example, using `.detach()` on `component_b` breaks the gradient flow back to `predictions`. The division operation then operates on a tensor that is not part of the computational graph, resulting in `predictions.grad` being `None` or filled with zeros. The correct way is to avoid the unnecessary detachment of the tensor that is connected to the gradient flow.

Another common issue arises from using non-differentiable functions or operations within your custom loss function. Some mathematical operations, by their very nature, are not designed to allow the passing of gradients. Operations like `torch.round()`, converting to an integer, explicit indexing with lists or numpy arrays, or any non-continuous logical operations would block the flow of gradients. You might use these for intermediary calculations, but they need careful handling within custom loss functions. Here’s an example to show how explicitly using an index without tensors will kill the gradients:

```python
import torch

def custom_loss_example_2(predictions, targets):

    # Let’s assume targets are integer class labels for classification

    predicted_class = torch.argmax(predictions, dim=1)

    # Incorrectly use list indexing
    loss_values = []
    for i in range(len(predicted_class)):
         if predicted_class[i] != targets[i]:
             loss_values.append((predicted_class[i] - targets[i])**2 )
    loss = torch.mean(torch.tensor(loss_values))
    return loss

predictions = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.9], [0.8, 0.2], [0.3, 0.7]], requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.tensor([1, 0, 0])

loss = custom_loss_example_2(predictions, targets)
loss.backward()
print(predictions.grad) # You would observe no gradients.
```

In this case, `torch.argmax`, while differentiable by itself, returns a tensor containing integer indices. The for loop and `if` condition followed by manual append operation is not differentiable. Therefore, gradients are blocked from flowing back to the predictions tensor. To correctly do this, one would normally use an existing loss function such as `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` which handles differentiable tensor operations well.

Finally, it's essential to be very careful about any in-place operations performed on tensors that are part of the computational graph, especially when these operations modify a tensor during the loss calculation. The autograd engine relies on maintaining a record of operations performed on tensors to calculate gradients, and in-place operations can disrupt this. While there are scenarios where they are efficient and needed, these need to be used judiciously in combination with the framework's tools for managing in-place operations such as `torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True)`. The use of such in place operations is particularly dangerous when building custom loss. For a practical illustration, assume you have a custom loss that is doing some scaling before calculation and you are doing that in-place:

```python
import torch

def custom_loss_example_3(predictions, targets):
    scaled_predictions = predictions.clone()

    # Incorrect in place modification
    scaled_predictions.mul_(2.0) # This would modify the tensor in place

    loss = torch.mean((scaled_predictions - targets)**2)
    return loss

predictions = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.tensor([[3.0, 5.0], [7.0, 9.0]])

loss = custom_loss_example_3(predictions, targets)
loss.backward()
print(predictions.grad)  # You might expect gradients, but potentially receive None.
```

In the example, the in-place modification (`mul_()`) breaks the graph. The tensor we're doing the in-place operation on was meant to be used to track the gradient, but its values are being directly changed, thus stopping the autograd mechanism to track the changes for gradient calculations. Instead of performing in-place operations, it is better to utilize operations that return a new tensor as shown below.

```python
    scaled_predictions = predictions*2.0 #Correct operation
```

Debugging these issues can be difficult initially, but the error messages can be helpful if understood well. The 'no gradients' error is essentially the framework informing you that it could not trace back through your custom loss to calculate the gradient.

To really dive deeper into the mechanics, I would highly recommend reviewing the following: the PyTorch documentation for autograd is essential (look specifically at the sections covering `torch.autograd` and the computational graph). Also, I’d suggest the book “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, especially the chapter on backpropagation and automatic differentiation. And finally, a thorough read of the original paper on backpropagation will provide a foundational understanding. These should help demystify the intricacies behind these errors and how to avoid them. They have certainly helped me in the past when dealing with similar issues. Often, I’ve found that meticulous review of tensor handling and meticulous attention to differentiability within the custom loss function are the key to eliminating these ‘no gradients’ errors.
