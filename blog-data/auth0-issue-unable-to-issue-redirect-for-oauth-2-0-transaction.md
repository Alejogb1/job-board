 so you're banging your head against the wall with Auth0's OAuth 2.0 redirect issues I've been there man like seriously been there It's like you think it's all smooth sailing with their docs and boom you're stuck in redirect limbo let me tell you about my adventures with this specific flavor of hell

First off let's get this straight auth0 redirect issues usually boil down to a few core problems it's not often magic or some bug in their system it's often a misconfiguration or a lack of understanding of how the oAuth 2.0 flow actually works specifically the redirect_uri and its nuances

Let's talk about `redirect_uri` The single most crucial thing you need to nail is that `redirect_uri` This is the URL where Auth0 will send the user back after successful or failed authentication It must match exactly including the protocol http vs https any trailing slashes and even parameters that might be present on your application’s callback path I’ve spent hours debugging this one specific part just to find a stray slash at the end of the redirect_uri configured on auth0 dashboard and not on my app like its the small things that get you

One time I was working on a small project for a client a simple web app needing user authentication I swear I configured everything right but kept getting that dreaded "invalid redirect_uri" error I triple checked my Auth0 application settings I looked at the logs the code I even looked at the network tab and the browser console I was about to throw my laptop out the window and it turned out I copy pasted the redirect_uri from a text editor that somehow added a hidden character at the end. Yes you read it right a hidden character. Invisible stuff like these are the worst to debug believe me

Also make sure you’re using the correct URL encoded format for your `redirect_uri` because special chars might be a source of headaches later on

Now let's dive into code examples I'm assuming you're using a library because nobody likes to code oAuth2 by hand like ever

Here's an example in Python using the `auth0-python` library this is a pretty common setup

```python
from auth0.authentication.token_verifier import TokenVerifier
from auth0.authentication import Authentication
from auth0.management import Auth0
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

AUTH0_DOMAIN = os.getenv("AUTH0_DOMAIN")
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID = os.getenv("AUTH0_CLIENT_ID")
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv("AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET")
AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI = os.getenv("AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI")
AUTH0_AUDIENCE = os.getenv("AUTH0_AUDIENCE")
AUTH0_SCOPE = os.getenv("AUTH0_SCOPE", "openid profile email")
# Example
auth = Authentication(AUTH0_DOMAIN, AUTH0_CLIENT_ID)


def get_authorization_url():
    return auth.authorize_url(
        AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI, AUTH0_AUDIENCE, scope=AUTH0_SCOPE
    )

def get_token_data(code):
    token = auth.get_token(
        code,
        AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI,
    )
    return token
```

Make sure to set your `AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable or whatever config method you use so it mirrors what you set in your Auth0 dashboard.

In the function `get_token_data` double-check you are using the same `redirect_uri` from the authorization step and most importantly the one from your auth0 application dashboard configuration because these small things make the whole thing crash

Here is a basic Nodejs example using `express` and `auth0-js`

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const Auth0 = require('auth0-js');
const dotenv = require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();
const port = 3000;


const auth0 = new Auth0.WebAuth({
  domain: process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN,
  clientID: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
  redirectUri: process.env.AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI,
  responseType: 'code',
  scope: 'openid profile email'
});

app.get('/login', (req, res) => {
    const url = auth0.authorizeUrl()
    res.redirect(url);
  });


app.get('/callback', (req, res) => {
    auth0.parseHash(window.location.hash, (err, authResult) => {
        if (authResult && authResult.accessToken && authResult.idToken) {
            // Access token and Id Token will be available
            // You can save them to browser local storage for future usage

          console.log('Access Token:', authResult.accessToken);
          console.log('Id Token:', authResult.idToken);

          res.send('logged in');
        } else if (err) {
            console.log(err)
            res.send('error');
        }

    });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});

```

Again pay very close attention to `redirectUri` it must match what's on your Auth0 configuration. It's a common pitfall even for seasoned devs because these little pieces of configs are hard to track down

For a React frontend example assuming you use `auth0-react` the code should look like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config()


const Auth0ProviderWithHistory = ({ children }) => {
    const config = {
      domain: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN,
      clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
      authorizationParams: {
        redirect_uri: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI,
        audience: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE,
      }
    }

  return (
      <Auth0Provider {...config}>
          {children}
      </Auth0Provider>
    );
}

function LoginButton() {
  const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();
  return <button onClick={() => loginWithRedirect()}>Log In</button>;
}

function LogoutButton() {
    const { logout } = useAuth0();
    return <button onClick={() => logout()}>Log Out</button>;
  }

function Profile() {
    const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth0();

    return (
        isAuthenticated && (
            <div>
            {JSON.stringify(user)}
            <LogoutButton/>
          </div>)
    )
}

function App() {

    return (

        <Router>
            <Auth0ProviderWithHistory>
            <nav>
            <Link to="/profile">Profile</Link>
            </nav>
            <Routes>
            <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
            <Route path="/" element={<LoginButton />} />
            </Routes>
            </Auth0ProviderWithHistory>
        </Router>

    );
}

export default App;
```

Here too the `redirect_uri` must be in sync with your Auth0 application dashboard configuration. Check twice and check again I once had a space at the end and my application was acting like it was possessed

Besides the `redirect_uri` another gotcha is the scope and audience settings in your app and Auth0. They should match what you expect your API or application needs otherwise the authentication flow will fail. Also ensure the application type you selected on auth0 dashboard is the correct one like single page application or regular web app this makes a difference

Debugging these issues isn't easy sometimes the Auth0 logs can be a bit vague if you're not sure what to look for. But trust me the network tab is your best friend. Check the actual requests and responses especially those going to `your-auth0-domain.com/authorize` and `/oauth/token` Look at the parameters being sent and make sure they are what you expect them to be. When you debug this make sure you have enough caffeine in your bloodstream or else you may fall asleep

I know I know debugging oAuth2 is like being in a bad movie plot with twist ending no one understands. But at least you don't have to debug javascript's async calls in the old days. One day it just stopped working and you don't know why. Maybe a node version upgrade or a dependency update. Good times good times

If you want to delve deeper into understanding oAuth2 then you should check "OAuth 2 in Action" by Justin Richer it's a good resource to start. And for a more general knowledge on web security "Web Security for Developers" by Malcolm McDonald is a good option too. Also always refer to the official Auth0 documentation they are usually good and updated

Remember small things matter and when oAuth2 is involved it is even more so because this involves security and your user access. One mistake is the difference between being secure and being hacked. So, always be careful out there happy debugging.
