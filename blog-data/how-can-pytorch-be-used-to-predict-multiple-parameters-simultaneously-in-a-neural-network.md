Let’s tackle this; the challenge of predicting multiple parameters with a single neural network in PyTorch is a staple of complex machine learning tasks. I’ve personally encountered this quite a few times, for instance, when I was working on a robotics project where we needed to simultaneously estimate the pose (position and orientation) of an object. It's a fairly common scenario, and it’s certainly achievable with careful network design and loss function configuration.

The core idea is to modify the output layer of your neural network so that it produces a vector of predictions, where each element corresponds to a specific parameter. This means instead of having a single output neuron, you’ll have *n* neurons if you're predicting *n* parameters. Let's consider a situation where you want to predict two parameters – say, the center coordinates (x, y) of an object – with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The first hurdle is modifying the output layer so it can produce both x and y simultaneously. This involves creating an output layer with two neurons, and then shaping the network's loss function to optimize for both predictions.

One of the most critical choices here is the loss function. When predicting multiple parameters, you often won't be using the typical binary or categorical cross-entropy loss. Instead, you’ll be utilizing a loss function that can handle multi-dimensional outputs. Mean Squared Error (MSE), or variations like mean absolute error (MAE), are frequently used for regression tasks where you're trying to predict continuous values. In such cases, each output neuron corresponds to a parameter that can be directly compared to its corresponding ground truth value. However, there can be scenarios where parameters have varying scales; in this case, you might want to normalize your data or even consider different loss function components.

Let's look at a practical example. Suppose I have an image of a car, and I want my neural network to predict both the position (x,y) of the car’s center and its bounding box width (w) and height (h). That’s four parameters simultaneously. I will now provide a functional example using pytorch, including model and loss.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class ParameterPredictor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ParameterPredictor, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 7 * 7, 128) # Assuming input images are 28x28
        self.relu3 = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 4)  # Output layer: x, y, w, h


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool1(self.relu1(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool2(self.relu2(self.conv2(x)))
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.relu3(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x


#Dummy training data
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 28, 28) # Single batch, 3 channels, 28x28 image
dummy_labels = torch.tensor([[10.0, 12.0, 5.0, 8.0]], dtype=torch.float32) # Dummy labels x, y, w, h

model = ParameterPredictor()
criterion = nn.MSELoss() # Using mean squared error loss
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)


# Training loop (example, one step)
optimizer.zero_grad()
outputs = model(dummy_input)
loss = criterion(outputs, dummy_labels)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

print(f"Loss: {loss.item()}")
print(f"Predicted outputs: {outputs}")
```

In this snippet, the output of the network produces four values. The `nn.MSELoss()` computes the squared difference between each predicted value and its target. The training loop is similar to standard PyTorch training. Here, you can see the core principle of predicting multiple parameters: the last fully connected layer produces as many outputs as the number of parameters. The loss is aggregated into a single value for optimization. In my experience, adjusting the learning rate can be beneficial in scenarios like this where different parameters may converge at different rates, especially when the value ranges differ greatly.

Let’s consider a slightly more complex case, where we might want to use a different loss for each parameter. This isn't something that's commonly needed, but it’s definitely something to consider for specialized problems. Let’s assume we want to predict angle (in radians) as well as a distance. We’ll use Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for distance and MSE for the angle. This allows us to penalize errors based on parameter sensitivity.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F

class MultiLossPredictor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MultiLossPredictor, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 2)  # One output for angle and one for distance

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

#Dummy Data
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
dummy_targets = torch.tensor([[0.5, 2.3]], dtype=torch.float32)  # Angle(radians), distance

model = MultiLossPredictor()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

def custom_loss(outputs, targets):
    angle_pred = outputs[:, 0]
    distance_pred = outputs[:, 1]
    angle_target = targets[:, 0]
    distance_target = targets[:, 1]

    angle_loss = nn.MSELoss()(angle_pred, angle_target) #MSE for angle
    distance_loss = nn.L1Loss()(distance_pred, distance_target) #MAE for distance
    total_loss = angle_loss + distance_loss
    return total_loss

# Training loop (example, one step)
optimizer.zero_grad()
outputs = model(dummy_input)
loss = custom_loss(outputs, dummy_targets)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

print(f"Loss: {loss.item()}")
print(f"Predicted outputs: {outputs}")
```

In this second snippet, we see a user-defined loss function. Here, `custom_loss` separates the outputs, applies `nn.MSELoss` and `nn.L1Loss` and then sums them to achieve the desired behaviour. There may be cases where combining multiple loss functions is not ideal, so you could consider using a loss weighting system to address different parameter importance.

Another technique I have found helpful is using a multi-headed architecture, where each head specializes in predicting a specific set of parameters. This can lead to better performance by reducing the chance that the network's representation becomes too general. Here is a simple example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F


class MultiHeadedModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MultiHeadedModel, self).__init__()
        self.shared_fc = nn.Linear(10, 64)

        # Head 1 for parameter 1 (angle)
        self.head1_fc = nn.Linear(64, 1)

        # Head 2 for parameter 2 (distance) and parameter 3 (area)
        self.head2_fc = nn.Linear(64, 2)


    def forward(self, x):
      x = F.relu(self.shared_fc(x))
      angle = self.head1_fc(x)
      distance_area = self.head2_fc(x)
      return torch.cat((angle, distance_area), dim=1) # Concatenate predictions


# Dummy data
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
dummy_targets = torch.tensor([[0.5, 2.3, 5.0]], dtype=torch.float32)  # Angle, distance, area

model = MultiHeadedModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

def combined_loss(outputs, targets):
  angle_pred = outputs[:, 0]
  distance_pred = outputs[:, 1]
  area_pred = outputs[:, 2]
  angle_target = targets[:, 0]
  distance_target = targets[:, 1]
  area_target = targets[:, 2]


  angle_loss = nn.MSELoss()(angle_pred, angle_target)
  distance_loss = nn.L1Loss()(distance_pred, distance_target)
  area_loss = nn.MSELoss()(area_pred, area_target)
  total_loss = angle_loss + distance_loss + area_loss
  return total_loss


# Training Loop (single step)
optimizer.zero_grad()
outputs = model(dummy_input)
loss = combined_loss(outputs, dummy_targets)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

print(f"Loss: {loss.item()}")
print(f"Predicted outputs: {outputs}")
```

Here, both heads can focus on different information, with a shared feature extraction stage. This architecture, while slightly more complex, can be particularly helpful in situations where the parameters are less related or have different levels of abstraction.

For further reading on multi-task learning and loss function design, I recommend the book “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Also, for more in depth examples of loss functions, papers on multi-task learning in specific domains, such as computer vision or natural language processing, are very useful, including papers by people like Sebastian Ruder and Rich Caruana. These will provide both a theoretical background and practical examples that can be applied directly to PyTorch.
