Alright, let's tackle this one. It's a question that often pops up when new developers, or those moving from other languages, begin working with Swift command-line tools. The short answer is that Swift's module system, particularly how it interacts with the entry point for executables, prevents the direct inclusion of top-level code in a CLI module. But, as is often the case, the devil is in the details. My own experience, developing a cross-platform command-line utility for processing large datasets several years back, forced me to confront this issue head-on and really understand the mechanics at play.

The core issue stems from how Swift handles the execution lifecycle of an application, be it a gui app or a command-line tool. Every Swift executable needs an entry point – typically the `main` function in languages like C and C++. Swift doesn't *require* an explicit `main` function when we're building executables, particularly in the case of single-file scripts; in these scenarios, the Swift compiler implicitly provides a suitable entry point. However, when we're talking about more structured projects, especially those employing a modular architecture, things become less straightforward.

With modules, especially those we create for specific tasks, such as handling command-line arguments or parsing data, the concept of a single top-level execution context doesn't translate very well. Swift modules are designed to be reusable units of code that can be imported by different executables and other modules. Imagine the chaos if every module could spontaneously execute code at load time. It would be unpredictable and would violate the principle of separation of concerns. This is fundamentally about maintaining a predictable and controlled initialization process. So, a module is not an executable unit in and of itself; it's a unit of reusable code.

The Swift compiler enforces this modularity strictly. When you attempt to put top-level code outside of any function or method in a module, it will generate an error. Swift expects a clear entry point, a place where the execution of the program begins within an executable target, and that entry point cannot reside within a module which is designed for re-use. Think of modules as libraries that need to be explicitly invoked, not as mini-programs that run independently.

Let's illustrate this with some examples, starting with a common mistake and then showing the proper approach.

**Example 1: The Incorrect Approach (Will cause a compile error)**

Let's create a module called `ArgParser` intended to handle the extraction of arguments for a hypothetical tool:

```swift
// ArgParser.swift (this is a module, NOT an executable)
import Foundation

let arguments = CommandLine.arguments // Top-level code, ERROR!
print("Arguments: \(arguments)") // Top-level code, ERROR!

func parseArguments() -> [String] {
    return CommandLine.arguments
}
```

If you tried to build this, the swift compiler will complain immediately. This module has top-level code, including the initialization of the `arguments` variable and the print statement, directly in the module scope. This is not permitted.

**Example 2: The Correct Approach: Executable with module import**

Now let's show the right way to structure this:

```swift
// ArgParser.swift (module file)
import Foundation

public func parseArguments() -> [String] {
    return CommandLine.arguments
}
```

This is our module. It only contains a public function intended to be called from an executable context. And now, for our executable's main entry point:

```swift
// main.swift (executable file)
import Foundation
import ArgParser // Import the module

let args = parseArguments() // Execute a function from the module
print("Arguments: \(args)")
```

Here, `main.swift` is the actual entry point. It imports the `ArgParser` module and calls the `parseArguments()` function to get the command-line arguments. This allows the functionality to be reused while maintaining the defined entry point in the executable.

**Example 3: Using a struct/class in a module to perform operations**

Let's say we want to encapsulate the argument processing functionality even more:

```swift
// ArgParser.swift (module file)
import Foundation

public struct ArgumentProcessor {
    public func process() -> [String] {
         return CommandLine.arguments
    }
}
```
Here, we've defined a `struct` (or a class would work too) within our module to perform the operation. And, again the executable code:

```swift
// main.swift (executable file)
import Foundation
import ArgParser

let processor = ArgumentProcessor()
let args = processor.process()

print("Arguments: \(args)")
```

Here, we instantiate an `ArgumentProcessor` object and use its methods. This allows for a more structured way to organize our modules.

So, the principle is that the entry point is in the *executable file*, not in the modules being imported by it. In `main.swift`, we have the entry point of our application, and we import the `ArgParser` module to perform operations within that entry point. We don't mix those two worlds, and this structure provides for both reusability and clarity.

As for deeper reading on Swift's module system, I'd strongly suggest delving into *The Swift Programming Language* book by Apple. The language guide sections on modules and access control will clarify how these work on a more technical level. Furthermore, looking at the Swift Evolution proposals (you can find these on the Swift GitHub repository) surrounding modules and package management (specifically, SwiftPM, the Swift Package Manager) provides additional insight into the reasoning behind this behavior, as well as future directions that may influence these kinds of scenarios.

Understanding these concepts is not just about avoiding compiler errors, it's about writing code that's maintainable, reusable, and follows best practices for software design. This separation of executable code and module code helps to enforce clarity, modularity, and predictability in your code. Through my own experiences with several complex projects, I’ve found that it is crucial to embrace this structure for building scalable and manageable Swift applications, whether they be command-line interfaces or otherwise.
