Okay, let's unpack this curious situation. It's not uncommon to see code signing behaving differently across environments, and GitHub Actions, despite its convenience, often throws up these specific types of challenges. Having spent a fair few years troubleshooting CI/CD pipelines, particularly those dealing with macOS builds, I've run into similar issues more than once, and it usually boils down to a handful of core discrepancies in how the environments handle code signing identities and entitlements. Let me explain.

First, the fundamental problem isn't that code signing *fails* per se, but rather that *the context in which the signing process occurs is drastically different across environments.* On a local macOS terminal, you're typically working with a keychain that's accessible through your user session, usually the same one you're logged into. This keychain holds your signing certificates and private keys. Similarly, Jenkins, being a more persistent environment, is frequently configured with a dedicated keychain or a more managed approach to certificates, where the necessary signing identities are either explicitly imported into the Jenkins keychain or accessible through environment variables.

GitHub Actions, on the other hand, operates in a more ephemeral and isolated manner. Each job runs in a fresh, virtualized environment. This means, by default, your signing identities are not automatically available. It's not like GitHub Actions is actively *rejecting* your signing setup, rather, it simply lacks the context in which these certificates exist and are understood by the security framework. Moreover, even if you attempt to import your certificates into the GitHub Actions runner, subtle differences in the secure enclave behavior or the way the keychain service functions can trigger code signing failures.

Let’s get concrete. Code signing in macOS uses `codesign`, a command-line utility that expects specific information, most critically, the "identity" which refers to the certificate you are using. Here's the most basic `codesign` usage:

```bash
codesign -s "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" YourApp.app
```

This command, when executed on your local macOS machine or on a correctly configured Jenkins agent, would likely succeed if “Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)” represents a valid certificate stored within the accessible keychain. However, trying this directly on a GitHub Actions runner, without first ensuring the necessary certificates are correctly imported and available, will lead to errors. These typically manifest in the form of “code signing failed” messages which don't always explicitly specify *why.* They’re usually more generic, pointing to a lack of a matching certificate or a failure to access the security service. This failure is not an issue with the `codesign` tool itself, but the lack of credentials within the scope of GitHub Actions environment.

Now, let's illustrate the practical differences with a few code snippets, simulating how you might set up code signing in these different environments. Keep in mind that these are illustrative simplifications and that you would use more sophisticated techniques in a production environment.

**Snippet 1: Local macOS Terminal (Simulated Success)**

This pseudo-code represents the steps performed when running directly from your terminal where keychain access is already established.
```bash
# This represents the process already setup on your local computer
echo "Keychain access already established, certificate exists"
echo "Signing application with existing certificate"

# Assumes codesign can access the "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
codesign -s "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" YourApp.app

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Code signing successful on local macOS"
else
  echo "Code signing failed on local macOS (unlikely with established setup)"
fi
```
The above snippet would typically succeed because your local keychain context is already available. The certificate is there, and `codesign` can access it.

**Snippet 2: Jenkins with Explicit Keychain Configuration (Simulated Success)**

Here, we simulate Jenkins being setup with keychain access. This requires upfront configuration and specific actions in your Jenkins jobs which are not shown in this simplified example:

```bash
# In real Jenkins setups, you would have a keychain already configured
echo "Jenkins using configured keychain"
# Assume the required keychain has been set up correctly
# Assume the required certificates have been imported to that keychain

# Assume codesign can access the "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
codesign -s "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" YourApp.app

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Code signing successful on Jenkins"
else
  echo "Code signing failed on Jenkins (unlikely if keychain setup correct)"
fi
```
This simulates the successful outcome when Jenkins is configured correctly. The keychain has been setup and the certificates have been imported beforehand, enabling the `codesign` utility to access them. The specific implementation of setting up the Jenkins keychain can be done a number of ways, typically involving credentials plugins and shell scripts to handle the keychain and password.

**Snippet 3: GitHub Actions (Simulated Failure Without Proper Setup)**

This snippet represents what would likely happen without proper pre-configuration in GitHub Actions, which highlights how different it is from the first two snippets.

```bash
# Attempt to sign the application directly with assumed certificate
echo "Attempting to codesign in GitHub Actions without configuration"

# This will likely fail without having imported the certificate
codesign -s "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" YourApp.app

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Code signing successful (unexpected in GitHub Actions without proper config)"
else
  echo "Code signing failed in GitHub Actions (as expected)"
fi
```
As you can see, without proper setup, you would likely receive an exit code different from 0. This is because of the missing keychain access and certificates. GitHub Actions needs to have the correct keychain and certificates installed beforehand which would require additional steps and handling different from the other two environments.

The solution in GitHub Actions typically involves using a specialized action or custom scripting to import your signing certificates into the GitHub Actions runner's keychain, usually by utilizing password-protected `.p12` or `.pfx` files. You’ll then need to unlock this imported keychain within the Actions workflow to allow code signing to function. Environment variables and GitHub Secrets are usually involved here to manage the certificate and keychain password securely. The *real* difference lies not in the `codesign` tool itself, but in the security and environmental context it is provided with.

For resources to delve deeper, I'd recommend checking out Apple's official developer documentation regarding code signing, specifically the sections on identity management and keychain services. The *"Security Overview" and "Code Signing Guide"* available from Apple are essential reads. If you’re looking for something more hands-on, the *"macOS Deployment Reference"*, which sometimes has sections related to security and keychain access, can also provide practical insights. Moreover, exploring documentation about how GitHub Actions security features interact with secure credential storage would be beneficial in order to effectively handle signing certificates. Also research on *p12 and pfx* file types and how to utilize them in combination with `security` command line tool will be beneficial when moving the credentials into GitHub Actions virtual environments.

In closing, the key takeaway is that environment context matters a lot when dealing with code signing on macOS. GitHub Actions, due to its ephemeral nature, requires careful setup and security management of your code signing identities which differ from the established contexts you have on your macOS machine or on a Jenkins server. It's not a failure in the tool itself, but a mismatch in how the environment provides the necessary security context for code signing operations. This often manifests in code signing failures that, while frustrating, can be resolved by implementing the correct procedures for securely managing credentials in a CI/CD environment.
