Alright, let’s tackle this. It's an issue I've personally bumped into a few times, particularly when experimenting with non-standard network architectures and optimization targets. It’s a good question because the apparent simplicity of Adam often masks its potential shortcomings in specific contexts like dictionary learning with neural networks. The short answer is, Adam, despite its widespread popularity, isn't a silver bullet, especially when the loss landscape is complex and non-convex, which is frequently the case in the scenario you've described.

First, let's dissect what dictionary learning, within the framework of a neural network, typically entails. Usually, you're aiming to learn a set of basis vectors (the dictionary) that can sparsely represent your input data. In a standard autoencoder setup, the encoder is implicitly learning a non-linear feature transformation, and the bottleneck layer could be considered the sparse representation, acting in part as our dictionary. In a more explicit dictionary-learning setup, you might have a distinct layer that projects the input data onto a learnable dictionary, possibly with some explicit sparsity constraint. Crucially, this learned dictionary is intertwined with the neural network weights. This interdependence is where we start to encounter problems when using Adam.

The core issue isn’t necessarily a bug in Adam’s implementation; rather, it's the way Adam adapts learning rates per parameter. Adam maintains separate estimates for the first moment (mean) and the second moment (uncentered variance) of the gradients. These are used to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter during the optimization. While beneficial in many scenarios, it can become problematic in dictionary learning for several reasons.

One major contributing factor is the interplay between the network weights and the dictionary elements. When the dictionary elements themselves are being optimized using Adam, the adaptive learning rates can lead to instability. Essentially, the dictionary elements might be ‘moving’ too much in each update, causing them to overfit to certain training data. This can result in the network learning a less generalizable, less effective set of basis vectors. You may have some dictionary elements taking on very large values, while others shrink to insignificant levels. The very adaptive nature that allows Adam to converge quickly elsewhere causes chaos here. In contrast, standard gradient descent, with a fixed learning rate, might provide a more stable but slower convergence to a reasonable solution.

Another significant problem I’ve encountered is that dictionary learning problems often involve non-convex cost functions. Adam’s adaptive learning rate doesn't guarantee convergence to a global minimum. It’s designed more for speed than for robustness against local minima, particularly when there are many parameters to optimize. In this setting, Adam is prone to get stuck in unfavorable local minima, often resulting in a suboptimal dictionary. This is different from a simple classification task where the objective is, in most instances, less complex to navigate.

A third contributing factor stems from the fact that we're often dealing with sparsity constraints in dictionary learning. The goal is to find a dictionary such that many coefficients are zero for any given data sample. These constraints often introduce further complexity into the optimization landscape, and the adaptive nature of Adam doesn't always play well with them.

Let me demonstrate these issues with a few simplified examples in PyTorch. First, a toy setup:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleDictionaryNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, dict_size, hidden_size):
        super(SimpleDictionaryNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.dictionary = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(dict_size, hidden_size))
        self.decoder = nn.Linear(dict_size, input_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        encoded = torch.relu(self.encoder(x))
        # Projection onto the dictionary (simplified for this example)
        projected = torch.matmul(encoded, self.dictionary.T)
        reconstructed = self.decoder(projected)
        return reconstructed

# Example usage
input_size = 10
dict_size = 5
hidden_size = 8
model = SimpleDictionaryNetwork(input_size, dict_size, hidden_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Toy data
inputs = torch.randn(100, input_size)
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, inputs)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This simple example, while not implementing any sparsity constraint, can show how unstable the learning process with Adam can be. The loss may initially decrease rapidly, but then it can often stall or even start increasing due to the over-adjustment of the dictionary parameters. This exemplifies how the adaptive learning rates can become problematic even without explicitly enforcing sparsity.

Now let’s introduce a basic sparsity constraint via L1 regularization:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SparseDictionaryNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, dict_size, hidden_size, sparsity_lambda=0.01):
        super(SparseDictionaryNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.dictionary = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(dict_size, hidden_size))
        self.decoder = nn.Linear(dict_size, input_size)
        self.sparsity_lambda = sparsity_lambda

    def forward(self, x):
      encoded = torch.relu(self.encoder(x))
      projected = torch.matmul(encoded, self.dictionary.T)
      reconstructed = self.decoder(projected)
      return reconstructed, projected

    def loss_function(self, reconstructed, original, projected):
        mse_loss = nn.MSELoss()(reconstructed, original)
        sparsity_loss = self.sparsity_lambda * torch.sum(torch.abs(projected))
        return mse_loss + sparsity_loss

# Example usage
input_size = 10
dict_size = 5
hidden_size = 8
sparsity_lambda = 0.01
model = SparseDictionaryNetwork(input_size, dict_size, hidden_size, sparsity_lambda)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Toy data
inputs = torch.randn(100, input_size)
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs, projected = model(inputs)
    loss = model.loss_function(outputs, inputs, projected)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Here, I’ve added a very rudimentary sparsity constraint through an L1 norm on the projection coefficients (which directly represent the sparse coding on the dictionary). You will likely still observe convergence issues due to the instability introduced by Adam. The sparsity term, while intended to improve the dictionary’s quality, can actually exacerbate the optimization difficulties with Adam’s adaptive learning rates.

Finally, let's see how a basic alternative to Adam (SGD) compares. We keep the same sparse network as above, but just change the optimizer:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SparseDictionaryNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, dict_size, hidden_size, sparsity_lambda=0.01):
        super(SparseDictionaryNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.dictionary = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(dict_size, hidden_size))
        self.decoder = nn.Linear(dict_size, input_size)
        self.sparsity_lambda = sparsity_lambda

    def forward(self, x):
      encoded = torch.relu(self.encoder(x))
      projected = torch.matmul(encoded, self.dictionary.T)
      reconstructed = self.decoder(projected)
      return reconstructed, projected

    def loss_function(self, reconstructed, original, projected):
        mse_loss = nn.MSELoss()(reconstructed, original)
        sparsity_loss = self.sparsity_lambda * torch.sum(torch.abs(projected))
        return mse_loss + sparsity_loss

# Example usage
input_size = 10
dict_size = 5
hidden_size = 8
sparsity_lambda = 0.01
model = SparseDictionaryNetwork(input_size, dict_size, hidden_size, sparsity_lambda)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) #SGD
# Toy data
inputs = torch.randn(100, input_size)
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs, projected = model(inputs)
    loss = model.loss_function(outputs, inputs, projected)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Switching to SGD demonstrates more stable (although perhaps slower) convergence. While it might not reach the same low loss value as Adam initially, it’s less prone to getting stuck in a local minima or to wildly fluctuating dictionary elements.

In terms of resources, I recommend diving into the literature on sparse coding and dictionary learning. Specifically, look at papers related to optimization of these models, often found in the signal processing or machine learning communities. For example, ‘Online Learning for Matrix Factorization and Sparse Coding’ by Matthew Brand, is a good starting point. For a deep dive on general optimization techniques, ‘Numerical Optimization’ by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen Wright is an indispensable resource. In addition, research papers that focus on different initialization schemes and adaptive learning rate alternatives that are more suitable for such structured optimization problems can also be insightful. Avoid blindly trusting the default learning rate of these optimizers; often, hyperparameter tuning for this specific task is key.

In conclusion, while Adam can be a powerful optimizer, its adaptive nature can become a hindrance in scenarios like dictionary learning with neural networks where you're optimizing many interdependent parameters and dealing with non-convex and sparsity-constrained objective functions. A more carefully considered approach that might involve alternatives like SGD, or Adam with a modified learning rate scheme for dictionary parameters, is often necessary. The key is to understand the intricacies of the problem and not just blindly use the default tools, as this kind of deep, practical understanding is what separates a good engineer from a great one.
