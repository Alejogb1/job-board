Alright, let's tackle this. Having spent years wrestling, no… processing, various forms of data in web applications, I've seen this particular challenge arise countless times. The requirement is simple: allow users to modify data via a user-friendly interface, a standard form. But the underlying mechanics of how to do this effectively and robustly are far from trivial.

The core of the issue centers around translating user input from the form into changes in the underlying data store, whether it's a database, file system, or another system. We need to consider not just the mechanics of updating the data, but also important considerations like data validation, error handling, and preventing common security vulnerabilities.

My initial inclination, from experience with projects involving user-managed data, is to strongly advocate for a robust approach that separates concerns. The presentation layer (the html form itself) shouldn't be directly manipulating the data layer. Instead, there should be an intermediate layer—a data handling service or controller—that validates and processes the form input, ensuring data integrity before it’s persisted.

Let's start with the basic principle: We must map form fields to data attributes. Let's assume we're working with some user data, such as their name, email, and age. An html form for this might look something like this:

```html
<form id="userForm">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required><br><br>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required><br><br>
  <label for="age">Age:</label>
  <input type="number" id="age" name="age" min="0"><br><br>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

This form, when submitted, sends a request to our server (or whichever processing point we designate), usually through a `POST` method.

Now, the crucial part: processing this data on the server-side (or equivalent data handling component). Using JavaScript (Node.js example with Express), a basic controller might look like this:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(bodyParser.json()); // for handling json data

app.post('/updateUser', (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, age } = req.body;

  // Basic input validation
  if (!name || !email) {
    return res.status(400).send('Name and email are required.');
  }

  if (age && isNaN(parseInt(age)))
     return res.status(400).send('Age must be a number.');

  // Data processing logic (placeholder for DB update etc.)
  const updatedUserData = {
    name: name,
    email: email,
    age: age ? parseInt(age) : null // Convert age to a number or keep null
  };

  // In a real app, you would update a db here. For this example:
  console.log('Updated data:', updatedUserData);
  res.status(200).send('User data updated.');

});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

This code snippet illustrates several key concepts. First, the `body-parser` middleware allows us to easily extract the submitted form data (`req.body`). Then, I’ve included a basic input validation step to check if required fields are present and if the age is indeed a valid number. The processing logic (here just console logging) is where you would connect to your data storage, update the specific record, and handle database related errors.

Here, the validation is fairly minimal, and in a production environment, I'd implement more comprehensive checks. This might include verifying email format using regular expressions or validating the length of a text input. We would also add data sanitization techniques to prevent injection vulnerabilities like sql injection or cross-site scripting (xss).

Now let's look at another scenario where you might have to deal with structured data. Imagine you have a form to edit the list of skills a user possesses. The html form could use dynamic elements and an array of values to represent the skill list:

```html
<form id="skillsForm">
  <div id="skillsContainer">
    <div class="skillInput">
      <label>Skill 1: </label>
      <input type="text" name="skills[]" value="Java">
      <button type="button" class="removeSkill">Remove</button><br><br>
    </div>
    <div class="skillInput">
      <label>Skill 2: </label>
      <input type="text" name="skills[]" value="Python">
      <button type="button" class="removeSkill">Remove</button><br><br>
    </div>
  </div>
  <button type="button" id="addSkill">Add Skill</button>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

And using Javascript (in the browser), we can easily manage the dynamically adding of skill inputs:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const skillsContainer = document.getElementById('skillsContainer');
  const addSkillButton = document.getElementById('addSkill');

  addSkillButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
     const newSkillInput = document.createElement('div');
     newSkillInput.className = 'skillInput';
     newSkillInput.innerHTML = `<label>Skill ${skillsContainer.children.length + 1}:</label>
                              <input type="text" name="skills[]">
                              <button type="button" class="removeSkill">Remove</button><br><br>`;
     skillsContainer.appendChild(newSkillInput);
     setupRemoveButtons();
  });

  function setupRemoveButtons() {
      document.querySelectorAll('.removeSkill').forEach(button => {
         button.addEventListener('click', function(){
              this.parentNode.remove();
          })
      });
  }

  setupRemoveButtons(); //initial setup

});
```

On server side, we could then process it (using nodeJS express again):

```javascript
app.post('/updateSkills', (req, res) => {
  const skills = req.body.skills; // skills will be an array

    if(!skills || !Array.isArray(skills) || skills.length == 0){
       return res.status(400).send("At least one skill is required");
    }

    const cleanedSkills = skills.map(skill => skill.trim()).filter(skill => skill !== '');

    console.log("Updated Skills:", cleanedSkills); //Placeholder for DB Update
    res.status(200).send("Skills updated successfully.");
});
```

Here, we see how the `name="skills[]"` attribute automatically creates an array of values in the `req.body` and we can perform processing on the array. I also added some trimming and filtering to ensure no empty values are saved.

In practical applications, the process often involves multiple steps. Data might need sanitization using libraries like ‘DOMPurify’ or ‘validator.js’ for Javascript or relevant packages in other backend languages. You might also have a dedicated ‘data access layer’ to interact with the database. The controller would be the intermediate layer between UI and your data-storage layer.

For deeper understanding of form handling and web security, I would highly recommend consulting resources such as "Web Application Hacker's Handbook" by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto, as well as the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) guidelines. These resources provide detailed explanations of common vulnerabilities and best practices in web development, particularly in relation to handling user input. Additionally, exploring the documentation for your chosen backend framework or libraries will prove immensely useful. The goal is always to create a system that is both user-friendly and secure, and this requires a comprehensive approach, not just slapping a form together. The examples here are simplifications to illustrate the core concepts but the details are where real systems become robust and resilient.
