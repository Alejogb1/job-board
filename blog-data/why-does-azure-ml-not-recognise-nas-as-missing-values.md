Let’s dive into this. It's a point of frustration I've certainly encountered in the field, and honestly, it stems from the way Azure Machine Learning, at its core, processes data during its data ingestion phases, particularly when interfacing with common formats like csv or pandas dataframes. It’s not so much that it *can’t* recognize them, but rather, it doesn't inherently *interpret* "na," “nan,” or other string variants of missingness as true null values during the initial import. Instead, they are treated as standard string literals unless explicitly converted before feeding into the machine learning pipeline.

The root of this lies within the underlying data types and the transformation mechanisms Azure ML employs. Many data science tasks lean heavily on pandas dataframes within python. When you read a csv file into pandas, missing values represented as strings like 'na', 'n/a', etc., are often loaded as that: strings, not numeric nulls. Azure ML's data ingestion mechanisms, often working with this pre-processed data, typically inherit this characteristic. Because of this, algorithms that rely on numeric features are blind to the fact that 'na' isn't a category of data but actually represents a missing value. This is where the problem starts to compound.

I recall a project from a few years back involving predictive maintenance for industrial equipment. We had sensor data coming in, and about 10% of our readings were missing for various mechanical reasons, encoded as ‘n/a’ in the csv files. Feeding this directly into an Azure ML pipeline, we were met with unexpected results. The machine learning algorithms were training as if "n/a" was a legitimate sensor reading, which skewed the entire model. Instead of dealing with missing values, the model tried to find signal in noise, and obviously, this ended very badly. We had to take a step back, re-engineer our data cleaning process, and essentially enforce a conversion to proper NaN or null values *before* sending data to Azure ML.

To illustrate, let's consider a few common scenarios and how we can address them using Python in combination with pandas.

**Example 1: Basic String Replacements in Pandas**

Imagine you have a dataframe where missing values are represented by a string 'na'. This first snippet demonstrates how to programmatically substitute them with a genuine `numpy.nan` value, which many ML libraries interpret as an actual missing value.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Simulate a dataframe with string representation of missing values
data = {'feature1': [1, 2, 'na', 4],
        'feature2': ['n/a', 6, 7, 8]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Original dataframe:")
print(df)

# Identify and replace 'na' and 'n/a' with numpy.nan
df = df.replace(['na', 'n/a'], np.nan)
print("\nModified dataframe with np.nan:")
print(df)

# Check data types
print("\nData types after replacement:")
print(df.dtypes)
```
This initial code block focuses on a basic string substitution scenario, demonstrating how to swap out those troublesome string representations for values which numerical operations or models can handle. Notice, that pandas now treats the replaced values as floats and not objects/strings. This is a critical step.

**Example 2: Pandas' Built-in `read_csv` Function with `na_values` Parameter**

A more efficient method, especially for data loading, involves utilizing pandas' built-in `read_csv` function and its `na_values` parameter. This allows us to specify a list of strings that should be recognized as missing values at the point of loading.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from io import StringIO

# Simulate a csv string with various representations of missing values
csv_data = """feature1,feature2
1,na
2,N/A
,4
5,null
"""

# Load the csv string directly, specifying the 'na_values'
df_from_csv = pd.read_csv(StringIO(csv_data), na_values=['na', 'N/A', 'null', ''])
print("Dataframe loaded from CSV with na_values:")
print(df_from_csv)
print("\nData types from csv import:")
print(df_from_csv.dtypes)
```

This example demonstrates a much cleaner approach. Rather than manually transforming a preloaded dataframe, we perform the conversion at the source. `read_csv`, when combined with the `na_values` argument, does the heavy lifting for you, converting them directly into `np.nan` values.

**Example 3: Automated Missing Value Handling in a Pipeline**

Lastly, if we were moving from data exploration to machine learning, we could automate and standardize this process within a data transformation pipeline. Here we introduce Scikit-learn's `SimpleImputer` to also fill the resulting missing values.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from io import StringIO
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Simulate a csv string with various representations of missing values
csv_data = """feature1,feature2
1,na
2,N/A
,4
5,null
"""

# Load the csv string directly, specifying the 'na_values'
df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(csv_data), na_values=['na', 'N/A', 'null', ''])
print("Dataframe before imputation:")
print(df)
# Instantiate the SimpleImputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')  # Fill with mean, can use median, most_frequent, or a constant

# Fit and transform
imputed_data = imputer.fit_transform(df)
imputed_df = pd.DataFrame(imputed_data, columns=df.columns)
print("\nDataframe after imputation:")
print(imputed_df)
print("\nData types after imputation:")
print(imputed_df.dtypes)
```

Here, beyond the conversion to `np.nan`, we are also imputing those values, for instance with the mean of the column. This example demonstrates how to streamline the data preparation for machine learning by including data cleaning and imputation at an early stage of data pre-processing.

In summary, Azure ML doesn’t inherently recognize “na” as a missing value because of the way it processes imported data, especially from files with string representations. It’s critical, therefore, to treat and process data for missing values properly during the initial stages of a data processing pipeline. Whether that's directly during the import, with the use of `na_values`, or after, by using pandas to replace values manually.

For more in-depth exploration of data wrangling with pandas, I'd strongly recommend Wes McKinney's book, "Python for Data Analysis," which goes over these topics in significant detail. Similarly, the Scikit-learn documentation provides ample information on the various imputation strategies, which we used above with `SimpleImputer`. For understanding the various data types within python and numpy, the official numpy documentation is always an invaluable source of information. Understanding these basic data handling mechanics is absolutely crucial for successful machine learning workflows.
