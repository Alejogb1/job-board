Let's tackle this. Ah, the familiar frustration of a contract function seemingly vanishing into thin air, particularly when MetaMask is involved. I’ve been down this rabbit hole a few times myself, so I understand the head-scratching. Typically, when a function like `addNewOrg` isn’t accessible, preventing MetaMask from properly interacting with your contract and pulling data, there's a handful of culprits, and it's rarely just one simple switch. Let me walk you through what I've seen in my own experience and how to methodically approach this kind of problem.

First off, it's crucial to remember that smart contracts exist within the context of a blockchain environment. This means we have several layers to consider: the solidity code itself, its compilation and deployment, and how the interacting application—in this case, your MetaMask-enabled front-end—is structured. I’ve found that most problems tend to fall into one of these categories, and sometimes it's a combination of them.

The most common issue, in my experience, stems from function visibility and access control within the solidity contract. A seemingly simple oversight here can have a dramatic impact. Solidity offers several visibility modifiers: `public`, `private`, `internal`, and `external`. If `addNewOrg` is declared as anything other than `public` or, in rare circumstances, `external` (more on that later), MetaMask and your JavaScript code cannot directly call it. This can be easily overlooked during the initial contract construction, particularly when you're dealing with complex logic. So the first step is always to double-check the visibility modifier in your solidity code.

Another frequent culprit is incorrect function signature handling. Even if the function is marked as public, any discrepancy between the function signature in the smart contract and how you are calling it in your JavaScript code will cause the Ethereum virtual machine (evm) to throw an error. This includes the correct data types of the parameters and return values. For instance, if you're passing a `string` to a function that expects an `address`, or vice versa, the function call will simply fail. This becomes even more complex if you're dealing with arrays or structs in your function's parameters.

Finally, the deployment step itself can introduce subtle issues. The contract address might be incorrect within your front-end code, or you might be attempting to interact with an older version of the contract without realizing it. We also need to consider if your node provider is stable, especially when using an RPC provider like Infura or Alchemy. Connectivity issues there can mimic issues within the contract itself.

Let’s look at some examples of contract code and how they relate to this situation.

**Example 1: Visibility Issue**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract OrganizationManager {
    // Incorrect - internal visibility
    function addNewOrgInternal(string memory _name) internal {
       // ... internal logic to add the organization ...
    }

    // Correct - public visibility, accessible from outside
    function addNewOrg(string memory _name) public {
        // ... logic to add the organization ...
    }

    function getOrgCount() public view returns (uint) {
        // ... returns the number of organizations...
    }
}

```

In this first example, we have two functions: `addNewOrgInternal` and `addNewOrg`. The `internal` modifier on `addNewOrgInternal` means it cannot be called directly from outside the contract. If you attempted to call it using MetaMask, it would fail because it’s not exposed publicly. The correctly defined `addNewOrg` function, however, is accessible. Pay close attention to these visibility modifiers, they are key to proper functionality.

**Example 2: Incorrect Function Signature**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract OrganizationManager {

    // Contract function
    function addNewOrg(string memory _name, uint256 _creationTime) public {
        // ... logic to add the organization with name and timestamp ...
    }

    function getOrgDetails(uint256 _index) public view returns (string memory, uint256) {
         // ... returns the details of the organization at index _index...
    }
}

```
```javascript
// Javascript calling function
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// Incorrect call: only 1 argument
// contract.methods.addNewOrg("testOrg").send({from: account});

// Correct call, passing both string name and timestamp
const timestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
contract.methods.addNewOrg("testOrg", timestamp).send({from: account});
```

Here, we demonstrate how a mismatch in the JavaScript calling code and the solidity contract’s expected function signature leads to issues. The solidity contract's `addNewOrg` function requires both a string name and a timestamp (uint256). If the javascript code calls the function with just a name, it will fail. It must provide the correct number of parameters of the right type.

**Example 3: Incorrect Contract Address & Deployment Issues**

```javascript
const contractAddress = "0x1234...invalidAddress"; // INcorrect address
// const contractAddress = "0xCorrectContractAddress"; //Correct address, not for posting here
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// Attempt to call addNewOrg
contract.methods.addNewOrg("anotherOrg").send({from: account});

```
In this example, the code attempts to connect to a contract using a placeholder address "0x1234…invalidAddress". Obviously, this will fail because there's no contract at this address, or it's not the contract you expect. Ensure that `contractAddress` is updated to point to your deployed instance of the contract. Always cross-reference the contract address in your code with the address returned by your deployment tool. Additionally, if you redeploy the contract, the address will change, and your frontend needs to be updated.

To effectively diagnose this, I usually start with the following methodical approach:

1.  **Contract Code Review:** Thoroughly examine the `addNewOrg` function in your solidity code. Pay particular attention to visibility modifiers and function signature. Ensure the function is `public` (or `external` if that fits your use case) and that the parameters match how you’re calling it from your javascript environment.

2.  **ABI Verification:** Verify that the contract's Application Binary Interface (ABI) in your JavaScript code matches the compiled ABI from your deployed solidity contract. The ABI acts as a translator between javascript calls and the evm. If the abi is outdated, function calls will not reach the contract.

3.  **Address Check:** Confirm that the contract address used in your javascript code matches the address of the deployed contract on the blockchain you are using.

4.  **Network Stability:** Make sure that your node provider, like Infura or Alchemy, is working correctly and that your MetaMask wallet is configured correctly.

5.  **Transaction Tracking:** Examine the MetaMask transaction history and any relevant logs from your RPC provider. Look for error messages, which can sometimes give a very precise indication of what went wrong.

For further study, I recommend looking at "Mastering Ethereum" by Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood, it gives a great overview of the EVM and the solidity language. Also, the official Solidity documentation is an invaluable resource. For detailed information on interacting with ethereum via javascript, the web3.js documentation is crucial. Furthermore, you can dig into the Ethereum yellow paper, while heavy, it clarifies core concepts.

In conclusion, the problem you’re facing with the `addNewOrg` function is rarely about a single isolated issue. It requires an investigation at multiple layers, and the careful examination of your Solidity code, ABI, addressing, and network configurations. Approach it step-by-step and methodically, and you’ll uncover the cause. Remember that even the smallest error in your setup will prevent MetaMask from communicating with the contract and will prevent data retrieval. I hope this detailed explanation and practical examples assist you in debugging the issue, and remember: persistent investigation is the key in this field.
