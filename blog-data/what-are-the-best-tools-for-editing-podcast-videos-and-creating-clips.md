Hey so you wanna edit podcast vids and make clips huh cool beans

First off lemme tell ya theres a ton of options out there its kinda overwhelming but dont sweat it we'll get through this together  I'm a pretty big fan of video editing so I've messed around with a lot of different software  

For basic stuff like trimming clips and adding some simple text overlays even just your phone's built in editor might be enough depending on your needs  Seriously I've made some pretty decent clips using just the default editor on my iphone its amazing what's possible these days  But if you're looking for more advanced features  well that's where things get fun

Lets talk about some legit contenders  Adobe Premiere Pro is a monster of an app its industry standard  pro level stuff  its got every bell and whistle you can imagine  color correction audio mixing transitions special effects its the whole shebang  if you're serious about video editing and willing to pay the premium  this is the way to go  Think of it as the Ferrari of video editors  powerful insanely capable but maybe a bit overkill if you're just starting out or dont need all that extra horsepower.  To learn this one properly search for "Adobe Premiere Pro tutorials for beginners" lots of vids and courses out there  theres even a fantastic book called "Adobe Premiere Pro CC Classroom in a Book"

Then there's DaVinci Resolve  this ones a free option yeah you heard me right free  and its surprisingly powerful  It's got a super intuitive interface  its basically a stripped down version of Premiere Pro but still packs a mean punch  You can do color grading audio sweetening  all the essentials  but its free so you wont break the bank trying to learn it  If you're on a budget or want to explore pro tools without shelling out a ton of cash start here  Check out "DaVinci Resolve 18 for Beginners" on YouTube theres a ton of resources

And finally theres Final Cut Pro  This is a Mac exclusive app  and its another great option if you're in the Apple ecosystem  it's got a really sleek and user friendly interface which I personally dig  Its performance is awesome especially if you're working with high res footage  Its in a sweet spot between power and ease of use  not as overwhelming as Premiere Pro but more powerful than many simpler options  "Final Cut Pro X: The Complete Guide" is a good book if you want a thorough manual

Now  lets get into the coding aspect which is really only relevant if you're doing some automation or more advanced stuff  most editors have built in tools to clip and stitch together videos so you can get pretty far without writing any code at all

But if you're into that kinda stuff here are a few examples using Python with a library called moviepy

**Example 1: Basic Trimming**

```python
from moviepy.editor import *

clip = VideoFileClip("podcast.mp4")
trimmed_clip = clip.subclip(10, 20) # extracts seconds 10-20
trimmed_clip.write_videofile("trimmed_podcast.mp4")
```

This snippet uses moviepy  to load a video file trim a portion of it and save the trimmed version  pretty straightforward right  If you're new to Python check out  "Python Crash Course"  its a great book for learning the fundamentals   This type of basic editing  you can also achieve with virtually any video editing software

**Example 2: Concatenating Clips**

```python
from moviepy.editor import *

clip1 = VideoFileClip("clip1.mp4")
clip2 = VideoFileClip("clip2.mp4")
final_clip = concatenate_videoclips([clip1, clip2])
final_clip.write_videofile("combined_clip.mp4")
```

This one shows how to easily combine multiple video clips into one longer clip  useful for putting together highlights or creating a compilation  Its similar to how you would use the "join" function in almost any video editing software


**Example 3: Adding Text Overlay**

```python
from moviepy.editor import *
from moviepy.text import TextClip

clip = VideoFileClip("podcast.mp4")
text = TextClip("Awesome Podcast", fontsize=70, color='white')
text = text.set_position(('center','bottom')).set_duration(5)  #Set position and duration
final_clip = CompositeVideoClip([clip, text])
final_clip.write_videofile("podcast_with_text.mp4")
```

This adds a text overlay to a video clip  You can customize things like font size color position and duration.  For more advanced text effects or animations you'll need to look into more advanced libraries or potentially even use after effects  again this is  easier to do with built in software but shows you the power of scripting

For learning more about moviepy check out their documentation  its pretty well written and has lots of examples  you can usually find this stuff on google.  there are tons of tutorials online too and remember you can do many of these simple edits in most any video editor

So yeah thats the gist of it  choose your tool based on your needs and budget  if you're just starting out  a free tool like DaVinci Resolve is a great place to start  if you're a pro or need advanced features  Premiere Pro is the way to go  Final Cut Pro sits nicely in the middle and is excellent if you're using Apple products   And remember  for automating tasks or doing more complex stuff you can use libraries like moviepy in python but often the built in tools of your video editor will be enough  happy editing  hope this helped  let me know if you have any other questions
