hey there, i see you're having a bit of a pickle with your svm classifier, and let me tell you, that confusion matrix is screaming loud and clear. a 70% accuracy sounds decent on paper but with a matrix like that, it's a classic case of misleading stats. that thing is practically yelling at us. i've been there, and i mean *really* there, so let me break this down from a tech perspective, based on my own experiences.

first off, that confusion matrix. let's dissect it: `[[81 0] [35 0]]`. this means that out of all the actual 'positive' cases (let's assume 'positive' is the first class), your model correctly predicted 81 of them and missed none of them. that's good but notice something, out of all the negative ones, your classifier predicted 0 positives when 35 are negatives (which is bad, it misses all of them). what’s happening is that your classifier is predicting all your data as one class, which is the first one. it's effectively saying "everything is positive". this isn't what we want; we want the model to distinguish between classes. we need the model to understand the different features that make the distinction and make good predictions across all classes.

i remember a similar case i had back in the day working on a fraud detection system. the training set was terribly skewed – 99% legitimate transactions and 1% fraudulent. i trained an svm without handling class imbalance, and the model, well, it was an expert at predicting legitimate transactions (obviously). it was like giving a student a test where all the answers were 'a'. they get 100%, but they learn nothing. the confusion matrix looked suspiciously similar to yours. i had to go back and put it again in the oven, i felt like those guys working in the early days of the web because everything was new and there was no documentation.

the issue here is likely class imbalance. it seems that one of your classes has a significantly larger number of samples compared to the other. in the case of your problem the positives are a lot more than the negatives. this causes the classifier to be biased to predict the majority class because it’s easier for it to be right (if all the examples in the training set are 'a', the classifier can predict 'a' for all the cases). svm models, by their default setup, are sensitive to these skews in the dataset. in addition, there could also be some specific features making the model predict all the examples as positives, but i think in your case is mostly due to class imbalance.

so, how do we fix this? i think i've got a couple of tricks up my sleeve that i've picked up along the way, let's start by the most common one.

1.  **class weights in your svm:** most svm implementations allow for class weighting. this means assigning a higher penalty to misclassifying examples from the minority class, forcing the model to pay more attention to those examples. here's a snippet showing how to implement this using python's `scikit-learn`:

```python
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import numpy as np

# assume you have your data loaded into x (features) and y (labels)
# example data
x = np.random.rand(150, 10)
y = np.array([0]*116 + [1]*34)  # skewed dataset for demo purposes

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# create the svm with class weights
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='rbf', class_weight='balanced')

# train the classifier
clf.fit(x_train, y_train)

# make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(x_test)

# evaluate
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

```

`class_weight='balanced'` automatically computes weights inversely proportional to class frequencies. this can often improve classification performance dramatically with skewed data. of course, you might need to tweak the kernel or regularization parameters like 'c' and 'gamma'. it's not always a one-size-fits-all solution.

2.  **oversampling/undersampling**: another technique is to balance out your dataset before feeding it to the svm. oversampling adds copies of minority class examples (e.g., using smote), or undersampling removes examples from the majority class. there are dedicated libraries like `imblearn` for this. here's a quick way using oversampling via smote:

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import smote
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import numpy as np

# same data as before
x = np.random.rand(150, 10)
y = np.array([0]*116 + [1]*34) # skewed dataset

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# apply smote oversampling
smote = smote(random_state=42)
x_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(x_train, y_train)

# train svm on resampled data
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='rbf')
clf.fit(x_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)

# make predictions on the original test data
y_pred = clf.predict(x_test)

# evaluate
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

```

oversampling creates synthetic examples based on existing ones. it can help when your minority class has too few samples. undersampling reduces the number of examples but can lose valuable data so it should be avoided most of the time.

3.  **cost-sensitive learning:** some svm algorithms allow to specify directly the cost associated to different errors. this is a more fine-grained approach compared to class weighting, that allows to treat differently each different misclassification. for example, a false positive (predict a positive when it is actually negative) could be more dangerous compared to a false negative, and different costs would allow to reflect this in the model. different frameworks or libraries might have different ways of handling this parameter. for python, with sklearn, the class_weights are usually enough.

```python
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import numpy as np

# same data as before
x = np.random.rand(150, 10)
y = np.array([0]*116 + [1]*34)  # skewed dataset

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# create the svm with different penalties to different classes (e.g. class 1 costs 2 times more than class 0)
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='rbf', class_weight={0:1, 1:2})

# train the classifier
clf.fit(x_train, y_train)

# make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(x_test)

# evaluate
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

in practice, i've seen class weighting and oversampling work well in combination. remember to always validate the performance on a separate test set (like you did), or even better, using cross-validation techniques. it might sound like overkill but trust me it's worth it.

finally, it's never a bad idea to look into the theory behind these techniques. check out books like "the elements of statistical learning" by hastie, tibshirani, and friedman (or just the second edition, "statistical learning with sparsity"), it is a hard read but invaluable for understanding these issues better, or if you're looking for something more specific about svm i recommend "support vector machines" by cristianini and shawe-taylor, those are my go-to classics for in-depth understanding.

just to inject a little humor: i once spent three days trying to figure out why my model was only predicting the number ‘42’. it turns out i was accidentally feeding it the same ‘42’ labeled example repeatedly. don’t be like that me.

hope this helps. i’ve been in those frustrating situations and i understand how it feels, but you'll get this sorted, just follow a systematic approach. don't forget to explore the hyperparameters to find the sweet spot for your specific problem.
