,  It's a common scenario, and I've seen it play out countless times in projects, each with its nuances. I remember a particularly frustrating instance a few years back when a client wanted real-time data updates on a dashboard; it highlighted just how crucial a well-structured data fetching system is. Here, we're looking at triggering a data retrieval from a backend upon a button click in a React frontend, facilitated by a Node.js/Express.js backend. The key is to understand the asynchronous nature of this interaction and handle it effectively.

Essentially, the process involves several steps: First, we need a button in our React component that triggers a function. Second, this function should make an HTTP request to our Express server. Third, the Express server should process the request, fetch the data (whether from a database, another service, or statically), and send it back. Finally, the React component receives the data and updates the UI to display it. It's simpler in concept than it sometimes feels in practice, I assure you.

Let's break down the components individually, starting with React:

```javascript
// React Component (Frontend)
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  const handleClick = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    setError(null); // Reset error state on new request

    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/data'); // Make request to the Express server endpoint
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        const json = await response.json();
        setData(json);
      } catch (e) {
        setError(e.message);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick} disabled={loading}>
        {loading ? "Fetching..." : "Fetch Data"}
      </button>
      {error && <p style={{color: 'red'}}>Error: {error}</p>}
      {data && <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default DataFetcher;
```

Here, we're using `useState` hooks to manage the fetched data, loading state, and any errors. `handleClick` is an asynchronous function using the `async/await` syntax for better readability, which makes the asynchronous request look synchronous. We use `fetch` to send a GET request to `/api/data`. Crucially, we manage the `loading` state, displaying "Fetching..." while the request is in progress, and we handle any errors that may occur gracefully. Displaying the received JSON within a `pre` tag is a simple way to present the data.

Moving to the server-side, here's how you might set up your Node.js and Express.js backend:

```javascript
// Node.js/Express.js Server (Backend)
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 5000;

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept');
  next();
});

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  // Simulating data fetching, replace with actual data retrieval logic.
  const data = {
    message: 'Data fetched successfully!',
    items: [
        { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }
    ]
  };
  res.json(data);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

This is a basic Express server that handles the `/api/data` endpoint. We simulate data retrieval within this route's handler. In a real-world application, you'd interact with a database or other services here. The key thing to note is that we're sending the data back as a JSON response using `res.json()`. Furthermore, and this is absolutely essential, I included the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header middleware. If you don't handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) correctly, the browser will block the request and your React application will not be able to communicate with the server when they are on different ports.

A more complex scenario often involves sending parameters from your frontend, let's consider adding parameters:

```javascript
// React Component (Frontend) - Example with params
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ParametrizedDataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [itemId, setItemId] = useState('');

  const handleClick = async () => {
      setLoading(true);
      setError(null);

      try {
          const response = await fetch(`/api/data?itemId=${itemId}`);
          if(!response.ok){
             throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
          }
        const json = await response.json();
        setData(json);
      } catch (e) {
        setError(e.message);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
  };
    const handleInputChange = (e) => {
      setItemId(e.target.value);
  };
  return (
    <div>
        <input type="text" value={itemId} onChange={handleInputChange} placeholder="Enter Item ID"/>
      <button onClick={handleClick} disabled={loading}>
        {loading ? "Fetching..." : "Fetch Data"}
      </button>
        {error && <p style={{color: 'red'}}>Error: {error}</p>}
      {data && <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ParametrizedDataFetcher;
```
Here we've added an input field for the user to specify an `itemId`. We're then using this to create a query parameter in the URL.

And here's an update to the server-side logic that would respond to these query parameters:

```javascript
// Node.js/Express.js Server (Backend) - Example with params
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 5000;

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept');
  next();
});

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  const itemId = req.query.itemId;
  let data;
  if(itemId){
    // Simulate fetching data based on itemId
    data = { message: `Data for item ${itemId} fetched!`, item: { id: itemId, name: `Item ${itemId}`}};
  }else{
    data = { message: 'No itemId provided' };
  }

  res.json(data);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```
Here, the server extracts the `itemId` from the query string and uses this to conditionally respond. In real-world code you would be doing some form of database query, etc.

For further reading, Iâ€™d highly recommend exploring "HTTP: The Definitive Guide" by David Gourley and Brian Totty for a deep understanding of the underlying HTTP protocols involved, and "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann, which is a valuable resource for structuring your data fetching processes, especially when dealing with more complex backends. Also, be sure to check the official React documentation regarding data fetching and the Express.js documentation regarding request handling. This, coupled with the code examples here, should give you a solid foundation. Remember to always keep error handling and security in mind, especially when dealing with sensitive data.
