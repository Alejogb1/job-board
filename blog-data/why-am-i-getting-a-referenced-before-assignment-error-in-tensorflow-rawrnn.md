ah, the dreaded referenced before assignment error in tensorflow's `raw_rnn`. yeah, i've been there, wrestled with that ghost in the machine, and it’s never a fun afternoon. it usually pops up when you’re deep into crafting custom recurrent networks, and suddenly, tensorflow decides to remind you about the subtle dance between variables and scope. let me break down what’s likely going on, and share how i've usually handled it.

the core of the problem is that `raw_rnn` in tensorflow is a low-level api. it gives you a lot of control, which is awesome, but it also means you have to manage state initialization yourself. unlike the higher-level recurrent layers like `tf.keras.layers.lstm` or `tf.keras.layers.gru`, which handle initial states, `raw_rnn` expects you to explicitly provide them. when you see that referenced before assignment error, it means that your cell's state variables are being used before they've been initialized. this usually happens within the `call` method of your custom cell or in your loop definition if you are not using a custom cell.

let's try to look at some code examples. suppose you have a custom cell defined as something like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class simplecell(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(simplecell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                initializer='random_normal',
                                trainable=True)
        self.u = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units),
                                initializer='random_normal',
                                trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                initializer='zeros',
                                trainable=True)
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_state = states
        output = tf.nn.tanh(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + tf.matmul(prev_state, self.u) + self.b)
        return output, output
```

and you try to use it with `raw_rnn` like so, it usually will fail:

```python
batch_size = 32
seq_length = 10
input_dim = 128
units = 64

inputs = tf.random.normal((batch_size, seq_length, input_dim))
cell = simplecell(units)
initial_state = cell.get_initial_state(inputs=inputs)
outputs, final_state = tf.nn.raw_rnn(cell, inputs, initial_state=initial_state)
```

the problem here, is that `simplecell` does not implement a `get_initial_state` method. so if you go inside the `raw_rnn` you will find that in line 175 or so of `tf.nn.rnn_cell_impl` in tensorflow 2.x it checks if you passed initial_state and if not will try to do this:

```python
 if initial_state is None:
      initial_state = cell.zero_state(batch_size, dtype=input_tensor.dtype)
```
but of course, your class `simplecell` does not have a `zero_state` method either so tensorflow throws you an error about not defining initial state.

to solve it, you usually need to explicitly implement the `get_initial_state` method (or `zero_state` that is deprecated but will work for the same purpose) in your custom cell. here's how i would typically modify the `simplecell` to make it work:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class simplecell(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(simplecell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                initializer='random_normal',
                                trainable=True)
        self.u = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units),
                                initializer='random_normal',
                                trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                initializer='zeros',
                                trainable=True)
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_state = states
        output = tf.nn.tanh(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + tf.matmul(prev_state, self.u) + self.b)
        return output, output
    
    def get_initial_state(self, inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=tf.float32):
        if inputs is not None:
           batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
           dtype=inputs.dtype
        return tf.zeros([batch_size, self.units], dtype=dtype)
```

now, when you create an instance of `simplecell` and try the `raw_rnn` the same way you had it before, the `initial_state` will be correctly obtained. no more scary errors, at least not this one. what was happening before, is that the `raw_rnn` method expects a tensor for the initial state not the method itself.

 another place where this can creep in, is within the `call` method itself, if you have some internal logic that uses previous states but you don't handle it correctly. this happens usually if you have multiple states, and you are using the wrong index when accessing them. here is an example of that:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class multistatecell(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(multistatecell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                initializer='random_normal',
                                trainable=True)
        self.u = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units),
                                initializer='random_normal',
                                trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                initializer='zeros',
                                trainable=True)
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_state1 = states[0]
        prev_state2 = states[1]

        output = tf.nn.tanh(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + tf.matmul(prev_state1, self.u) + self.b)
        new_state2 = output # state 2 is new output of this step
        return output, [output,new_state2]
    
    def get_initial_state(self, inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=tf.float32):
          if inputs is not None:
              batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
              dtype=inputs.dtype
          initial_state1 = tf.zeros([batch_size, self.units], dtype=dtype)
          initial_state2 = tf.zeros([batch_size, self.units], dtype=dtype)
          return [initial_state1,initial_state2]

```

and you call it as:
```python
batch_size = 32
seq_length = 10
input_dim = 128
units = 64

inputs = tf.random.normal((batch_size, seq_length, input_dim))
cell = multistatecell(units)
initial_state = cell.get_initial_state(inputs=inputs)
outputs, final_state = tf.nn.raw_rnn(cell, inputs, initial_state=initial_state)

```

the `multistatecell` code had a subtle error it tries to output `new_state2` twice, and that may lead to undefined values. also when defining the `return` of the call the new states has to be on the same order, so `new_state2` replaces `state2` on the return and the correct state is `output`, so a fix could be:

```python
    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_state1 = states[0]
        prev_state2 = states[1]
        output = tf.nn.tanh(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + tf.matmul(prev_state1, self.u) + self.b)
        new_state2 = output
        return output, [output,new_state2]
```

notice, that is a different error than the one we were discussing before. this one could lead to incorrect results, but not the "referenced before assignment" error. this is just a side note.

a quick story, once i was working on a complex sequence model for predicting stock prices (i know, i know, who hasn't?) and i spent a whole night debuging a `raw_rnn` setup, only to find out that the tensor's shape i was using on the `initial_state` was different to the shape of the cell. sometimes i really wish tensorflow had a "are you sure you’re doing this?" button.

now, for resources, i wouldn't recommend just random stackoverflow pages, sometimes they are ok sometimes are confusing. i found the original tensorflow papers very useful when i was first getting started. there's the one describing recurrent neural networks (elucidates the theory behind the cells) and also the one that gives all the details about how tensorflow actually works (and i recommend this one a lot). also the tensorflow official documentation on `tf.nn.raw_rnn` is a must, but remember is better to read the actual code in the rnn_cell_impl file in the tensorflow repo on github. it can look daunting at first, but it's worth it, also the code is well commented in tensorflow, so it's quite readable. also, i would recommend deep learning books like the one by goodfellow, bengio, and courville to solidify your base knowledge ( the rnn chapter is great).

in short, remember the key is to:

1.  always provide an `initial_state` when using `raw_rnn`, either directly in the `raw_rnn` call or using a method such as  `get_initial_state` in the cell.
2.  double-check the order of states in both the `call` method and the return of the `call` method.
3.  verify the shapes of tensors to be compatible between them.

i hope this helps you, feel free to ask if anything is not crystal clear, this stuff can sometimes be tricky.
