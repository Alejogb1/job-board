Alright, let's tackle this. I recall a project back in 2021, a rather sprawling e-commerce platform, that presented exactly this headache. The upgrade to Rails 6.1 threw up a storm of deprecation warnings related to locale suffixes, specifically those implicitly added by the system, and it was less than ideal. The core issue, as you've likely encountered, stems from Rails’s change in how it handles implicit locale suffixes within I18n lookups. In essence, the framework moved towards requiring explicit locale declarations.

Before Rails 6.1, it was common practice (and often unknowingly done) to rely on Rails automatically appending the correct format suffix (like `.html`, `.json`, or `.txt`) to your locale keys. If, for example, you had a view rendering a JSON response, your key might simply be `user.name`, and Rails would intelligently look for `user.name.json` if a `.json` template was being processed. However, this implicit behavior was deemed, quite rightfully, as problematic, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and difficult debugging. With 6.1, Rails now strictly requires the full locale key, including the format suffix when needed, to be explicitly defined in your translation files.

The warning, as you know, manifests as something like: `DEPRECATION WARNING: Implicit locale suffixes are deprecated. Please specify the locale suffix in the key 'user.name'`. This meant going through the application and identifying places where such implicit lookups were occurring, and that wasn’t a small task in a large application.

So, how did we actually fix it? It boils down to three main approaches, often used in combination, and I'll detail them with some snippets. These aren’t perfect, and the ideal one depends on context, but they should cover common scenarios.

**1. Explicitly Defining Full Locale Keys:**

The most straightforward, albeit potentially laborious approach, is to explicitly define the full locale key within your translation files. If previously you had:

```yaml
en:
  user:
    name: "User Name"
```

And your view was relying on `I18n.t('user.name')` to dynamically find `user.name.json` for a JSON output, you now need to add it directly:

```yaml
en:
  user:
    name: "User Name"
    name.json: "User Name (JSON)"
    name.html: "User Name (HTML)"
```

And then, your views need to be modified:

**Before:**

```ruby
render json: { name: I18n.t('user.name') }
```

**After:**

```ruby
render json: { name: I18n.t('user.name', locale: :"#{I18n.locale}.json") }
```
or, preferably:

```ruby
render json: { name: I18n.t('user.name.json') }
```

This ensures you are explicitly specifying the full lookup key. This is highly explicit but also verbose when you have a lot of such keys.

**2. Utilizing `translate` Helper with `lookup_ancestors` option:**

Rails’s `translate` helper comes with a powerful `lookup_ancestors` option. It allows you to specify the desired key without the extension and then let Rails try to find specific versions of that key, including the extension. The example below illustrates this:

```ruby
# config/initializers/i18n.rb
I18n.config.enforce_available_locales = false
```

**Before:**

```ruby
 # Assuming user.name exists as before, and the JSON renderer.
 render json: { name: I18n.t('user.name') }
```

**After** (assuming you've declared `user.name` and not `user.name.json`) :

```ruby
render json: { name: I18n.translate('user.name', locale: I18n.locale, lookup_ancestors: true) }
```

```ruby
# In some initializer, like config/initializers/i18n.rb, to set the default behavior

I18n::Backend::Simple.include(I18n::Backend::Fallbacks)
```

This approach tries `user.name.json`, then `user.name`, and finally looks for the generic `user.name`. It’s less verbose than explicitly defining every single suffix but it requires careful understanding of the fallback logic. The `lookup_ancestors: true` in combination with I18n fallbacks is key here. It effectively provides a way to look for specifically suffixed keys while falling back to simpler versions if the suffixed version does not exist and it’s more of a runtime approach to solving the issue instead of defining every suffix in every locale file. This method is powerful but it’s crucial to understand its behaviour because if you have multiple formats and do not define the locale files, it might pick up the wrong one.

**3.  Creating Custom Translation Helpers or Decorators:**

For more complicated scenarios, especially where you’re often adding locale suffixes within different kinds of rendering contexts, a more robust approach involves creating custom helpers or decorators to manage the locale lookups. We opted for this in some specific areas of the e-commerce platform.

```ruby
# app/helpers/translation_helper.rb
module TranslationHelper
  def localized_t(key, options = {})
      format = options.delete(:format)
      suffix = ".#{format}" if format
      full_key =  suffix ? "#{key}#{suffix}" : key

    I18n.t(full_key, options)
  end
end
```
or, using a slightly more generic approach. We had a `RenderingContext` class that would be available in our templates and controllers, for example:

```ruby
class RenderingContext
  attr_reader :format

  def initialize(format)
    @format = format
  end

  def localized_t(key, options = {})
      suffix = ".#{format}" if @format
      full_key = suffix ? "#{key}#{suffix}" : key

    I18n.t(full_key, options)
  end
end

# In Controller
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @rendering_context = RenderingContext.new(params[:format])

    # use it in the view or here
    name = @rendering_context.localized_t('user.name')
    render json: { name: name}
  end
end
# In view
<%= localized_t('user.greeting', format: 'html') %>
```

Then you would use this helper, specifying the format, when you do a translation. This approach offers great flexibility. It allows for reusable logic across multiple formats and potentially other contextual translation needs, all while maintaining explicit lookup behavior.

**General Considerations:**

*   **Thorough Testing:** Whatever approach you pick, comprehensive testing is key. It's crucial to ensure you have test coverage for all your templates and locale files to verify translations.
*   **Consistency:** A consistent approach is vital. Mixing approaches can introduce inconsistencies making debugging more cumbersome.
*   **Performance:** While generally the impact is minimal, consider performance when processing large amounts of text, especially with fallback options.

**Relevant Resources:**

*   **Official Rails Documentation:** Start with the official Rails Guides on I18n, specifically the section regarding locale fallbacks and changes between Rails versions. This will solidify the underlying concepts.
*   **"Internationalization with Ruby on Rails" by Steven Van den Berg:** This book offers a comprehensive look at i18n in Rails, and has a good practical focus.
*   **I18n gem source code on GitHub:** Deep diving into the gem's source code provides detailed understanding of fallback mechanisms and how it works internally.
*   **"Refactoring" by Martin Fowler:** Though not specific to i18n, this is invaluable as you rewrite and reorganize your translation logic to prevent future maintenance headaches.

In conclusion, handling locale suffix deprecation warnings requires a considered approach, going beyond simply silencing the warnings. It’s about ensuring the internationalization framework correctly handles the required languages and that it doesn't introduce unintended bugs with format changes. The key is explicit control over your locale keys, either by direct definition or using the tooling provided by rails in a thoughtful manner.
