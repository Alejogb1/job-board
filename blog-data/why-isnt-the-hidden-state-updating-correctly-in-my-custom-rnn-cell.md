Alright, let's talk about those persistent hidden state update issues in custom recurrent neural network (rnn) cells. I've spent more than a few late nights debugging these, so I understand the frustration. It's a common pitfall, and quite often, the culprit isn't immediately apparent. In my experience, the problem usually boils down to one of a few core areas: incorrect initial state management, improper handling of the cell's forward pass logic, or misunderstandings about how gradients flow through the unrolled network. Let's dive into these with some concrete examples.

First, regarding initial state management, this is where many implementations falter. When you're creating a custom rnn cell, you're responsible for defining how the initial hidden state should be handled. Typically, you would either initialize the state with zeros or, in some more advanced scenarios, pass in an initial state as an argument. The crucial point here is consistency. If the initial state isn't correctly fed into the network, the subsequent updates will naturally be skewed. I recall one project where we were working on a sequence-to-sequence model for speech recognition. We had a bug where we weren't properly clearing the hidden state between utterances during testing and this caused the predictions to gradually drift over time leading to completely inaccurate results.

Here's a simplified code example in Python using PyTorch to illustrate how an incorrect initial hidden state can cause problems:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleRNNCell(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(SimpleRNNCell, self).__init__()
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.W_ih = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.W_hh = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, input, hidden):
        combined = self.W_ih(input) + self.W_hh(hidden)
        new_hidden = torch.tanh(combined)
        return new_hidden

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
seq_len = 5
batch_size = 3

cell = SimpleRNNCell(input_size, hidden_size)

# Incorrect: Passing the same initial state each time
inputs = torch.randn(seq_len, batch_size, input_size)
hidden_state = torch.zeros(batch_size, hidden_size)

for t in range(seq_len):
    hidden_state = cell(inputs[t], hidden_state)
    print(f"Hidden state at time {t}: {hidden_state[0, 0].item()}")
```

In this example, the *same* `hidden_state` tensor is being used across the entire sequence. What we want is to update the hidden state on every time step, and make sure it gets passed to next step correctly. Therefore, although this will produce output, the hidden state is not being updated effectively.

Here is a corrected example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleRNNCell(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(SimpleRNNCell, self).__init__()
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.W_ih = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.W_hh = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, input, hidden):
        combined = self.W_ih(input) + self.W_hh(hidden)
        new_hidden = torch.tanh(combined)
        return new_hidden

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
seq_len = 5
batch_size = 3

cell = SimpleRNNCell(input_size, hidden_size)

inputs = torch.randn(seq_len, batch_size, input_size)

# Correct:  Initialize a new hidden state each time or handle state correctly across batch
hidden_states = []
hidden_state = torch.zeros(batch_size, hidden_size)

for t in range(seq_len):
    hidden_state = cell(inputs[t], hidden_state)
    hidden_states.append(hidden_state)
    print(f"Hidden state at time {t}: {hidden_state[0, 0].item()}")

```

Here, the `hidden_state` gets updated with the result of the current timestep's calculation and this is passed to the next loop.

Next, let's consider the forward pass logic. The forward method within your custom cell is where the actual transformation of the input and previous hidden state takes place. It’s imperative that this logic correctly implements the mathematical formulation of your recurrent operation. If there are errors in this transformation or you're not including all the relevant terms, the hidden state updates will be incorrect. I remember a case where a colleague mistakenly applied a non-linearity twice in a row during a text classification model where it should've been just one activation layer resulting in severely reduced network performance. This highlights the importance of carefully translating the equations into code.

Here is another example that shows an incorrect implementation:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F


class IncorrectRNNCell(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(IncorrectRNNCell, self).__init__()
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.W_ih = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.W_hh = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, input, hidden):
        # Incorrect logic: Missing the weight of the previous hidden state.
        combined = self.W_ih(input)
        new_hidden = F.relu(combined) # only the input is considered.
        return new_hidden

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
seq_len = 5
batch_size = 3

cell = IncorrectRNNCell(input_size, hidden_size)
inputs = torch.randn(seq_len, batch_size, input_size)
hidden_state = torch.zeros(batch_size, hidden_size)

for t in range(seq_len):
    hidden_state = cell(inputs[t], hidden_state)
    print(f"Hidden state at time {t}: {hidden_state[0, 0].item()}")
```

Here, the previous hidden state is completely ignored. The current hidden state only depends on the input, and the information from previous step is lost, rendering it ineffective.

Finally, a less obvious but equally crucial point is the flow of gradients. You might have implemented the forward pass correctly, and handled initial states as you should. However, the way you have defined the cell in the context of the broader network can cause issues. If you're not backpropagating through time (bptt) correctly, the gradients will not properly update the weights of your cell. This is particularly important if you're implementing a more complex unrolling operation, or making use of the outputs of your RNN to generate predictions or compute loss. I once spent days trying to figure out why a recurrent autoencoder wouldn't learn properly only to realise that we weren’t backpropagating all the way through the unrolled sequence causing a severe case of vanishing gradient.

For a deeper theoretical understanding of recurrent networks, I recommend consulting *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. This text offers a comprehensive treatment of rnns and associated training challenges. Additionally, papers on the backpropagation through time (bptt) algorithm, such as "Learning Long-Term Dependencies with Gradient Descent is Difficult" by Sepp Hochreiter, are extremely informative, providing deeper insights into the practical challenges of training recurrent networks. It might also be beneficial to review the source code implementation of standard rnn layers in libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow to understand the practical mechanics, not only to understand *how* to code them, but more importantly, *why* they are coded as they are. For example, diving into the PyTorch source code for `torch.nn.RNN` can be particularly illuminating.

In conclusion, when debugging incorrect hidden state updates, start with the initial state management. Ensure that you are passing in the correct initial hidden state. Next, verify the correctness of the forward pass equations against your specific rnn architecture, and pay very careful attention to gradient flow as these all may be the source of error. By methodically checking these areas, you will likely isolate the root cause of the problem. These issues are very common in practice and debugging these carefully will allow you to develop more robust and correct models, which I've found, is key for delivering reliable solutions.
