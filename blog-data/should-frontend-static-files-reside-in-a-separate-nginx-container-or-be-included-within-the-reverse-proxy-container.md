Let’s unpack this; it’s a question I've encountered more times than I care to count, and the “correct” answer often depends heavily on the specific needs and scale of your application. I’ve personally seen both approaches implemented successfully (and, truth be told, unsuccessfully as well). The choice isn’t inherently one being better than the other, but rather, it's about understanding the tradeoffs involved.

First, let's examine the scenario where your frontend static files are served from a separate Nginx container. The primary advantage here revolves around separation of concerns. You have a dedicated container that does one job, and it does it well: it serves static assets—html, css, javascript, images, and the like. This isolation provides a few benefits. One is that the reverse proxy, often itself another Nginx instance, becomes solely responsible for routing requests to the backend services and handling other proxy-related tasks like SSL termination, load balancing, and request transformations. The other is that deploying a new version of your frontend becomes less likely to impact the reverse proxy setup. When rolling out updates, a failed deployment of a reverse proxy carries significantly more risk than a failed deployment of a static asset server. They have different scaling needs and different fault tolerance requirements, separating them physically reflects this reality.

Now, let's flip the coin and look at embedding the static assets within the reverse proxy container. A major allure of this setup is its simplicity. You have fewer moving parts, less inter-container communication, and consequently, often a reduced cognitive load for deployment and maintenance. In many smaller projects, or in situations where performance is not a primary concern, this might be the most pragmatic option. You can use directives within the reverse proxy's Nginx configuration to serve static files directly, which minimizes the need for network hops. However, this conflation of roles does introduce some potential complications. If your frontend scales significantly, you might find the reverse proxy container stretched too thin as it juggles serving both static assets and proxy requests to the backend. Further, you can introduce unwanted dependencies and coupling between your frontend and proxy configuration. It makes for a more complex maintenance cycle, where changes to your frontend impact your reverse proxy container configuration.

Let's delve into some code snippets to make these points more concrete. First, consider a typical setup where static files are served from a separate Nginx container:

```nginx
# Dockerfile for static asset container
FROM nginx:latest
COPY ./dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

This Dockerfile is concise. It takes the `nginx:latest` base image, copies your built frontend files from the `dist` directory (a common output directory after building your frontend project) into the default nginx html directory and exposes port 80. The nginx configuration within this image serves these static files using its default configuration.

Now, lets examine a reverse proxy configuration that is configured to use this asset container:

```nginx
# nginx.conf for reverse proxy container
upstream backend {
  server your-backend-service:8080;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://frontend-container:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
    location /api/ {
      proxy_pass http://backend;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

In this reverse proxy configuration, requests to the root `/` are proxied to another container called `frontend-container` on port `80`. Any requests beginning with `/api/` are routed to our backend server. This setup clearly separates the function of serving static assets from the task of reverse proxying.

Finally, let's illustrate an example of serving static assets directly within the reverse proxy container:

```nginx
# nginx.conf for reverse proxy and static assets
upstream backend {
  server your-backend-service:8080;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
    location /api/ {
      proxy_pass http://backend;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

In this scenario, we've added the `root` directive, pointing to where our static assets reside *within* the reverse proxy container, typically at `/usr/share/nginx/html`. The key point here is that Nginx now serves the files directly. The `try_files` directive ensures that if a requested file isn't found (such as `/about` in a single-page application), it falls back to serving `index.html`, which is common practice for frontend routing. This example simplifies the deployment process, since static files are now copied into the reverse proxy's image.

In terms of best practices, the decision leans more towards segregating your static files for production applications, especially where scalability is a key concern. As your project grows in traffic and complexity, the ability to scale your frontend independently is often a huge benefit. Think about a situation where you're experiencing a sudden spike in traffic to your frontend. If it's decoupled, scaling your frontend server is trivial, and won’t require scaling your proxy. Similarly, a bug in your static assets can be rolled back without affecting the reverse proxy. While the simplicity of serving from within the proxy is appealing, it tends to create future technical debt down the line.

If you’re dealing with a smaller, less trafficked application, or are actively prototyping, keeping everything in one place is simpler. But, it's worth planning your deployment strategy ahead of time and making an informed decision based on your long-term needs.

For further technical understanding, I would highly recommend delving into the following resources. For a deeper dive into Nginx configurations, the official Nginx documentation is an invaluable resource. Similarly, the book "High Performance Browser Networking" by Ilya Grigorik provides a fantastic technical explanation of HTTP, which are key concepts that you will need to implement these systems correctly. Finally, for understanding architectural considerations when using containerisation, "Kubernetes in Action" by Marko Luksa will provide you a good foundational understanding and will help you understand the tradeoffs in these system design choices. All are resources I've returned to time and time again. The key to making the “right” decision comes down to understanding the tradeoffs and the long term architecture that you're building.
