Okay, let’s tackle this one. I've actually grappled with this exact scenario quite a few times over the years, particularly back when I was maintaining some older data pipelines that relied heavily on flat files. It’s a surprisingly common issue, and there isn't always a readily available, shiny new tool that neatly solves it. Sometimes, you just need to get down to basics and manipulate text files directly. The core problem, deleting rows based on text in sequential files, essentially boils down to selective filtering. You're reading each line of the file, evaluating if it matches a deletion criteria, and then either writing it to a new file (if it shouldn’t be deleted) or skipping it. Let’s look at how we might achieve this using different approaches, along with some gotchas I've encountered.

First and foremost, let’s clarify "sequential files." We’re talking about files where data is structured line by line, often with each line representing a single record. This encompasses things like csv files, log files, and any file where records are separated by newline characters, not complex formats like json or xml. When we speak of “text”, we’re referring to string data within these lines which you’re trying to pattern match against.

One of the simplest solutions is to use scripting with basic text processing tools. Python, due to its straightforward syntax and comprehensive string handling capabilities, is often my go-to. Below is a Python implementation that demonstrates how to delete rows containing a specific string.

```python
def filter_file(input_file, output_file, delete_string):
    """Filters a file, removing lines containing the specified string.

    Args:
        input_file (str): The path to the input file.
        output_file (str): The path to the output file.
        delete_string (str): The string to match for deletion.
    """
    with open(input_file, 'r') as infile, open(output_file, 'w') as outfile:
        for line in infile:
            if delete_string not in line:
                outfile.write(line)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_file = "input.txt"
    output_file = "output.txt"
    delete_string = "removeme"
    filter_file(input_file, output_file, delete_string)
    print(f"Lines containing '{delete_string}' removed from '{input_file}' and written to '{output_file}'.")

```

In this example, the function `filter_file` opens both the input and output files. It then iterates through each line of the input file. The `if delete_string not in line:` condition checks if the line does *not* contain the `delete_string`. If it does not, the line is written to the output file. This approach is generally effective for simple string-based filtering.

A crucial point here is the performance implications. For truly massive files, this simple read-and-write approach can be slow. The entire input file is read line by line which creates some overhead. For performance on large data, using libraries like `pandas` in python or other data processing tools could prove beneficial, albeit involving a slightly more complex setup.

Now, let’s consider cases with more sophisticated requirements. Suppose you needed to delete based on a regular expression rather than a simple substring. The above code wouldn't cut it anymore. Here is an amended version, still using python, showcasing this.

```python
import re

def filter_file_regex(input_file, output_file, delete_regex):
    """Filters a file, removing lines matching the specified regular expression.

    Args:
        input_file (str): The path to the input file.
        output_file (str): The path to the output file.
        delete_regex (str): The regular expression to match for deletion.
    """
    with open(input_file, 'r') as infile, open(output_file, 'w') as outfile:
        for line in infile:
            if not re.search(delete_regex, line):
                outfile.write(line)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_file = "input.txt"
    output_file = "output.txt"
    delete_regex = r"^error\s+\d+"  #Example Regex: "starts with 'error' followed by one or more spaces and one or more digits"
    filter_file_regex(input_file, output_file, delete_regex)
    print(f"Lines matching regex '{delete_regex}' removed from '{input_file}' and written to '{output_file}'.")

```

In this version, I've imported the `re` module and utilized `re.search` to determine if a line matches the provided regular expression. The `delete_regex` variable here could hold complex patterns, for example deleting all lines starting with the word error followed by one or more spaces then one or more digits. This approach enables more nuanced pattern-based filtering.

Another approach I’ve used in the past, especially when operating in a Unix environment, is combining `grep` with some file redirection. While not a “code” snippet in the same sense as python, it's an indispensable method when speed is a priority. Here is the equivalent using a terminal command.

```bash
grep -v "delete_string" input.txt > output.txt
```

This single line accomplishes the same task as our first python script, but by leveraging the `grep` utility directly at the shell level. The `-v` flag inverts the match, meaning it outputs lines that *do not* contain "delete_string". The output is then redirected to a new file “output.txt”. This is particularly advantageous because `grep` is highly optimized and can often outperform basic python scripts, especially on substantial datasets.

For very large datasets, that don't fit into memory, you would want to investigate tools like `awk` or dedicated data processing pipelines. Techniques like memory mapped files could be used to process data without loading everything into RAM. You also would want to examine batch processing strategies. These are often more complex to setup but necessary if you are working with gigabytes or terabytes of data.

In terms of further learning, a deep understanding of regular expressions is paramount. Jeffrey Friedl’s "Mastering Regular Expressions" remains a gold standard. For general text processing and Unix utilities, the classic "The Unix Programming Environment" by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike is a must. Finally, understanding the performance considerations of reading and writing files from disk is also essential, and for that I suggest looking into operating system textbooks that delve into file I/O systems.

To summarize, while deleting rows based on text in sequential files might seem straightforward, the specifics of each implementation will vary widely based on the volume of data and complexity of your requirements. Choosing the right tool for the job, be it python, `grep` or something else entirely, is critical. This is something I have seen time and again and have learned by trying various options.
