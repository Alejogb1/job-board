Alright, let's tackle this `nan` output issue you're experiencing with your TensorFlow Keras model. It's a frustrating problem, and I've certainly spent my share of late nights debugging similar situations. It's not uncommon, especially when dealing with complex networks and datasets. Typically, `nan`s propagate when numerical instability creeps into your calculations. Let's break down the common culprits and how to address them, drawing from my experience dealing with similar problems in a large-scale recommender system back in '18, where precision was absolutely critical to avoid showing users completely irrelevant suggestions, which was, in fact, a business impacting event.

The root of the problem usually boils down to one or more of these issues: vanishing or exploding gradients, numerical overflow or underflow, incorrect data preprocessing, or issues within custom layers or loss functions. Let’s explore each of these in detail, along with specific code examples to clarify potential solutions.

**1. Vanishing and Exploding Gradients:**

This is perhaps the most frequent reason you'll encounter `nan` outputs. During backpropagation, gradients can become incredibly small (vanishing) or extraordinarily large (exploding). When gradients vanish, the network's weights effectively stop updating, and you may start to see `nan` values when you divide by close-to-zero gradient values during the optimization step. Conversely, exploding gradients can lead to numerical overflow, resulting in `nan`s as well. The backpropagation algorithm can introduce very unstable behavior in deep neural networks.

*   **Solution:**
    *   **Activation Functions:** Avoid activation functions like sigmoid or tanh in deeper networks. These tend to saturate, leading to vanishing gradients. ReLU and its variations (Leaky ReLU, ELU) are usually safer choices because they are less prone to saturation.
    *   **Weight Initialization:** Improper initialization can exacerbate vanishing or exploding gradients. Use initialization methods like Glorot (Xavier) or He initialization, which are designed to maintain more stable gradients.
    *   **Batch Normalization:** Batch normalization layers normalize the activations of a layer, which helps in stabilizing the training process by addressing internal covariate shifts and mitigate vanishing or exploding gradients.
    *   **Gradient Clipping:** If exploding gradients persist, try gradient clipping to limit the maximum magnitude of gradients.

    Here’s a snippet illustrating how to implement proper weight initialization and a basic ReLU activation with batch normalization:

    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, BatchNormalization, ReLU
    from tensorflow.keras.initializers import he_normal

    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        Dense(128, kernel_initializer=he_normal(), use_bias=False),
        BatchNormalization(),
        ReLU(),
        Dense(64, kernel_initializer=he_normal(), use_bias=False),
        BatchNormalization(),
        ReLU(),
        Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    ```

**2. Numerical Overflow and Underflow:**

Computers have finite precision in representing floating-point numbers. Operations involving very large or very small numbers can result in overflow (number too large to represent) or underflow (number too small to represent and being rounded to zero), leading to the appearance of `nan`s. Some common scenarios for this is when dividing by very small numbers or using exponentials of large values.

*   **Solution:**
    *   **Scaling Input Data:** Normalize or standardize your input data to ensure values are within a reasonable range (e.g., between -1 and 1 or having a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1). This can prevent numerical instability when dealing with large input values.
    *   **Adjusting Learning Rate:** An extremely large learning rate can lead to instability, causing weights to change too much in each update and resulting in overflows and `nan`s. Adjust your learning rate.
    *   **Using `tf.keras.backend.epsilon()`:** When dealing with division operations, add a small epsilon value to the denominator using `tf.keras.backend.epsilon()` to avoid division by zero issues which leads to numerical overflow.
    *   **Using `tf.clip_by_value`**: when dealing with inputs to logarithms or exponential functions, limit the range of values using `tf.clip_by_value` to avoid `nan` outputs.

    Here is an example of implementing data scaling and adding an epsilon for numerical stability:

    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    import numpy as np

    def scale_data(data):
      mean = np.mean(data, axis=0)
      std = np.std(data, axis=0)
      return (data - mean) / (std + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())


    def loss_function(y_true, y_pred):
        # Example of adding epsilon to prevent numerical instability when using logarithm
        y_pred = tf.clip_by_value(y_pred, tf.keras.backend.epsilon(), 1 - tf.keras.backend.epsilon()) # clip the values in the range [epsilon, 1-epsilon]
        cross_entropy = -tf.reduce_mean(y_true * tf.math.log(y_pred) + (1-y_true) * tf.math.log(1-y_pred))
        return cross_entropy

    # Example usage (assuming you have loaded your input data as 'input_data' and labels as 'labels')
    #scaled_input_data = scale_data(input_data)
    #model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=loss_function)
    #model.fit(scaled_input_data, labels, epochs=10)

    ```

**3. Data Preprocessing Errors:**

Incorrect preprocessing can also lead to `nan` outputs, such as using non-normalized data or having missing values that were not accounted for. If you are working with datasets with many missing values or with values outside a normal range, make sure that you handle those situations correctly during data preprocessing.

*   **Solution:**
    *   **Inspect your Data:** Always thoroughly inspect your input data. Make sure you are handling missing values correctly before feeding the data into the model. Standardize or normalize it as needed.
    *   **Handle Infinite or Undefined Values:** Data might sometimes include infinite or not-a-number values which can lead to issues further down in your model. Preprocess these correctly before feeding the data into the model.
    *   **Verify Label Encoding:** Verify that label encoding is correct and aligned with the shape of your data.

    This is less of a code example and more of a reminder to use visualization tools, and ensure sanity check to identify potential issues before they become problematic `nan`s within your TensorFlow model.

**4. Issues in Custom Layers or Loss Functions:**

If you have implemented custom layers or loss functions, these can be sources of errors leading to `nan`s. Double-check these for potential numerical stability issues. This was actually the problem I found in my recommender system, the custom loss function included a complex division without checking if the denominator was zero, which was causing numerical instability and leading to nan outputs.

*   **Solution:**
    *   **Thoroughly Test:** Test your custom layers and loss functions rigorously with various inputs to identify numerical instability problems.
    *   **Isolate Issues:** Temporarily remove custom layers or loss functions to pinpoint whether they are the root cause.
    *   **Use Symbolic Debugging:** Utilize TensorFlow’s eager execution mode to step through your custom code and identify numerical issues.

   Here is an example of a custom loss function that can lead to numerical instability:
     ```python
        import tensorflow as tf
        def bad_custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
            # the problem here is that y_pred can have values equal to zero or very close to zero
            # which can lead to nan values due to division by zero
           return tf.reduce_mean(tf.math.divide(y_true, y_pred))

        def good_custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
            # We add a very small epsilon value to the denominator
            epsilon = tf.keras.backend.epsilon()
            return tf.reduce_mean(tf.math.divide(y_true, y_pred + epsilon))

    # Example usage (assuming you have loaded your input data as 'input_data' and labels as 'labels')
    #model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=bad_custom_loss)
    #model.fit(scaled_input_data, labels, epochs=10)
    #model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=good_custom_loss)
    #model.fit(scaled_input_data, labels, epochs=10)
     ```
In general, I’ve found that the debugging process for `nan`s can be iterative. Start by addressing the most common issues like gradient problems and data preprocessing, moving onto more specific ones as needed. I recommend looking into resources such as the original paper "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift" by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy, to understand more on batch normalization and its effect on vanishing and exploding gradients. Also, "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville offers a thorough theoretical background that would improve your overall understanding of this topic.

Remember, a systematic approach and patience are key. Good luck, and let me know if any of these steps get you closer to resolving the issue.
