Right then, let's tackle this "ValueError: No gradients provided" issue, a classic headache when venturing into custom loss functions. I've seen this particular error rear its ugly head more times than i care to recall, often in situations where we're pushing the boundaries of standard machine learning models. It’s usually a sign that the gradient calculation, the very engine of backpropagation, is either missing or incorrectly defined. When building your own loss functions, especially in deep learning frameworks like tensorflow or pytorch, a seemingly small oversight in the gradient definition can bring the training process to a screeching halt.

Essentially, the error message is your framework saying, "Hey, i know you defined a way to measure how well the model is doing (your loss), but you haven’t told me how to adjust the model’s parameters to improve." Backpropagation needs a gradient, which is a vector of partial derivatives indicating the direction and magnitude of change needed for each parameter. Without it, it's like trying to drive a car without a steering wheel; you have a destination but no mechanism to get there.

Let’s break down why this happens, and then illustrate solutions with some code. I recall a particular project involving a custom image segmentation task. We needed a loss function that penalized specific misclassifications more severely than others. The standard cross-entropy just wasn’t cutting it. This is where things started to get a bit complicated and where i ran into this exact problem.

The core of the issue almost always revolves around how you're defining the gradient calculation for your custom loss. Frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch often handle gradient computations automatically for pre-built loss functions through their autograd features. But, when you write your own from the ground up, you're responsible for ensuring these gradients are correctly specified. One common culprit is forgetting to include operations within the gradient calculation which are differentiable with respect to the model’s parameters. This is where the explicit differentiation comes in, often involving the usage of `tensorflow.GradientTape` or the `torch.autograd.Function` in PyTorch. These constructs allow you to track and automatically compute the gradients of your custom functions.

Let's dive into a few scenarios to illustrate this better.

**Scenario 1: TensorFlow with a custom loss and no gradient tracking**

This is the most frequent mistake I’ve encountered. Let's assume we want a custom loss that calculates the mean absolute error with a small quadratic penalty on large errors to avoid outliers impacting training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_mae_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    abs_diff = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
    quadratic_penalty = tf.where(abs_diff > 1, 0.5 * (abs_diff - 1)**2, 0.0)
    return tf.reduce_mean(abs_diff + quadratic_penalty)

# Dummy data for demonstration
y_true = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y_pred = tf.constant([1.2, 1.8, 3.3])

# trying to compute the gradient without explicitly using GradientTape
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss = custom_mae_loss(y_true, y_pred)

# the problem: no trainable variables to compute gradient with respect to.
# this line would cause the "No gradients provided" error during real model training
# gradients = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_variables) # this will cause the value error
```
In this initial example, if you attempt to calculate the gradients of the loss with respect to any trainable variables (for example, weights of a model) you would encounter the "No gradients provided" error. The problem here is that the `y_pred` tensor needs to have been derived from some trainable variable through operations that tf's `GradientTape` can track. It's not enough just to write the function; you need to embed it into the gradient computation pipeline.

**Scenario 2: TensorFlow with GradientTape and trainable variables**

Let's correct the above error by explicitly tracking the model variables and their derivatives. Here we will use a very simple linear model for demonstration.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_mae_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    abs_diff = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
    quadratic_penalty = tf.where(abs_diff > 1, 0.5 * (abs_diff - 1)**2, 0.0)
    return tf.reduce_mean(abs_diff + quadratic_penalty)

# Dummy data for demonstration
y_true = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
# Initialize trainable variables
w = tf.Variable(1.0, dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.Variable(0.0, dtype=tf.float32)
x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32) # dummy input data

# Comput gradients of the loss with GradientTape
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = w*x + b # model prediction
    loss = custom_mae_loss(y_true, y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [w,b])
print(gradients) # will print the gradients correctly now
```

In this corrected example, we've defined a simple linear model, `y_pred = w*x + b`, where `w` and `b` are tensorflow variables that the `GradientTape` tracks. We are now able to compute gradients, using `tape.gradient`, with respect to `w` and `b` successfully. This approach ensures that all the necessary operations are within the scope of the `GradientTape`, making it possible to trace gradients back through the loss function to the trainable model parameters.

**Scenario 3: PyTorch using `torch.autograd.Function`**

In PyTorch, if we are dealing with operations that PyTorch cannot automatically differentiate we can define a custom autograd function to provide the gradients. Let's illustrate with the same custom mean-absolute-error with a quadratic penalty:

```python
import torch

class CustomMAELoss(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, y_true, y_pred):
        abs_diff = torch.abs(y_true - y_pred)
        quadratic_penalty = torch.where(abs_diff > 1, 0.5 * (abs_diff - 1)**2, torch.zeros_like(abs_diff))
        loss = torch.mean(abs_diff + quadratic_penalty)
        ctx.save_for_backward(y_true, y_pred, abs_diff)
        return loss

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        y_true, y_pred, abs_diff = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_abs_diff = torch.where(abs_diff > 1, abs_diff-1, torch.sign(y_pred - y_true))
        grad_input = grad_output * grad_abs_diff
        return -grad_input, grad_input


# Dummy data for demonstration
y_true = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=False)
# Initialize trainable variables
w = torch.tensor(1.0, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor(0.0, requires_grad=True)
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) # dummy input data

# Apply the custom loss function
y_pred = w * x + b
custom_loss = CustomMAELoss.apply(y_true, y_pred)

#Compute the gradients of the custom loss
custom_loss.backward()

print(w.grad, b.grad) # Prints the gradients

```

Here, the `forward` method computes the loss. In the `backward` method, we calculate the gradients by hand and propagate it. This function needs to be used when the custom logic can’t be differentiated by pytorch directly. The explicit calculation of the gradient inside the `backward` method solves the "no gradient provided" error in this scenario.

To summarize, when you encounter "ValueError: No gradients provided" with a custom loss function, the problem lies in the fact that the model variables don't have any gradient information. Therefore, the key is to ensure that your computations involve operations that are tracked by frameworks through mechanisms such as `tf.GradientTape` or the `torch.autograd.Function`, which will allows the automatic differentiation to propagate the gradients correctly through your custom loss.

For further study, I’d highly recommend reviewing the official documentation for TensorFlow and PyTorch focusing on the gradient tracking mechanisms (`GradientTape` and `torch.autograd`) and the underlying mathematics of automatic differentiation. The book "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville provides a great theoretical base to understand these issues. Also, explore the research papers related to custom loss functions in different contexts, such as "A Survey of Loss Functions for Image Classification" which will illustrate more specific approaches in specific problem domains. Understanding these resources should give you the solid foundation to work with custom loss functions, and sidestep the 'No gradients provided' error effectively.
