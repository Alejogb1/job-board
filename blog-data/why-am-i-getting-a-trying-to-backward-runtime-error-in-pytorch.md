Alright, let's tackle this 'Trying to backward' error in PyTorch. I’ve bumped into this one a few times myself, and it often stems from a subtle misunderstanding of how PyTorch’s automatic differentiation engine works. It's not always immediately clear what’s going wrong because the error message, while precise, can be a bit cryptic without the right context. Let’s break it down.

The core issue revolves around attempting to compute gradients on tensors that are not part of the computational graph that PyTorch is tracking. In essence, PyTorch needs to know how each tensor was derived from others to compute gradients correctly. When you invoke `.backward()` on a loss tensor, it traces backward through the operations that led to that loss, calculating gradients with respect to the tensors that require them along the way. If it encounters a tensor that’s not part of this tracked lineage, you’re going to see this error.

Often, the root cause is inadvertently detaching tensors from the computational graph or performing operations that don’t allow for gradient propagation. It also shows up when trying to backpropagate through tensors that weren't explicitly created within the `requires_grad=True` context or that had their gradient tracking disabled after being created that way. Let's look at some typical scenarios based on my past projects.

In my early days working on a neural style transfer project, I made the classic mistake of pre-computing a part of the loss outside the main computational graph. Imagine I had a pre-processed image tensor and tried to use it directly during the loss calculation. I was getting this error because the input image manipulation, for efficiency’s sake, had been done independently without the intention of backpropagating through it. Here's a simplified, illustrative code snippet:

```python
import torch

# Assume pre_processed_image is a result of some offline processing, not part of the model.
pre_processed_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256) # No requires_grad specified, therefore it defaults to False

# Model definition (simplified for illustration)
class SimpleModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)
        self.fc = torch.nn.Linear(16 * 254 * 254, 10) # 256-3+1 = 254

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModel()

input_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256, requires_grad=True) # This tensor requires grad
output = model(input_image)
# Incorrect loss calculation - using the detached pre-processed image.
loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(output, pre_processed_image) # This will trigger "Trying to backward"
loss.backward() # Error here
```

In this case, `pre_processed_image` has `requires_grad=False` implicitly, and the mse_loss calculation attempts to compute gradients using it in the backward step, hence the error. PyTorch doesn't have the graph information for tensors without `requires_grad=True`.

Another scenario I often see, especially with more complex custom layers or data loading pipelines, is the usage of operations that detach tensors from the computational graph implicitly. Consider a common scenario in image processing: if you’re performing some image manipulation within a custom `Dataset` class or in a transformation function, you might inadvertently cut off the gradients if these operations aren't done using PyTorch-native functions. Here’s a simplified illustration:

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

def my_custom_transformation(image_tensor):
    #Assume this is a numpy operation that is converted back into torch tensor

    numpy_image = image_tensor.detach().numpy() # We detached here
    transformed_numpy = np.clip(numpy_image*2,0,255)
    transformed_tensor = torch.from_numpy(transformed_numpy).float()

    return transformed_tensor # Requires_grad will be false automatically

input_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256, requires_grad=True)
transformed_image = my_custom_transformation(input_image)

model = torch.nn.Linear(256*256*3, 10)
output = model(transformed_image.view(1,-1))
loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(output, torch.randn(1, 10))
loss.backward() # Error Here
```

Here, `.detach()` creates a tensor that is not part of the computation graph, and thus gradients can't flow back past it. The issue is that the transformation function was designed without considering gradient propagation.

Finally, a subtler case involves in-place operations. These operations modify tensors directly and can, in some scenarios, interfere with the backward pass. While PyTorch handles some in-place operations gracefully, using them carelessly can also lead to the 'Trying to backward' error, especially when a tensor’s history is overwritten. Generally, avoiding in-place operations during gradient calculation is best practice.

```python
import torch

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256, requires_grad=True)
temp_tensor = input_tensor * 2
# In-place modification
temp_tensor += 1 # In-place addition

model = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)
output = model(temp_tensor)
loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(output, torch.randn_like(output))
loss.backward() # This is likely to work in this example, but it is a good practice not to perform in-place operations during back propagation
```

While this specific example might work due to PyTorch’s implementation, the in-place modification after creating the tensor is risky. The history of `temp_tensor` could be lost or overwritten in scenarios that involve more complex computations, and this could cause gradient calculation errors down the line.

So, how do we fix this? Firstly, ensuring that all relevant computations are done with PyTorch tensors that have `requires_grad=True`, and using PyTorch functions whenever possible will automatically include all operations in the computation graph. In the cases where you have to process tensors outside the computation graph, make sure that the tensors you then use in the gradient calculation have the `requires_grad=True` flag set to ensure that they have a computational history. Avoid in-place operations as much as possible during training. If you must perform them, carefully test that it's not disrupting the gradient flow.

For a deeper understanding, I would recommend diving into "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann. It gives a very clear explanation of PyTorch's autograd engine. Also, explore the official PyTorch documentation on automatic differentiation, which contains detailed descriptions of the underlying principles. It's also insightful to review the research papers that pioneered automatic differentiation frameworks to understand its theoretical background. A good starting point would be those discussing reverse-mode automatic differentiation as implemented in PyTorch.

Ultimately, this error arises from PyTorch’s inability to track the gradient information it requires, often due to a misunderstanding of how tensors interact within the autograd engine. Carefully planning your computations to ensure all operations are tracked correctly using tensors that require gradients will avoid this error and lead to more robust code. It takes some getting used to, but it’s fundamental to effectively using PyTorch.
