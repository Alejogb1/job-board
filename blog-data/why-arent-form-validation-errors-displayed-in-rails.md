Okay, let's tackle this. It's a situation I've seen far too many times – that frustrating moment when your Rails form stubbornly refuses to show those validation errors, leaving the user (and you) completely in the dark. From my experience working on legacy systems to greenfield projects, this issue tends to stem from a handful of common culprits, each solvable with a little understanding of Rails' inner workings.

The core of the problem usually isn't a bug in Rails itself, but rather a misunderstanding of how it handles errors and communicates them back to the view. Think of it this way: when you submit a form in Rails, the process involves several steps: parameters are collected, a model instance is created (or updated), validations are executed, and finally, the view is rendered. Errors accumulate primarily during the validation phase. If these errors aren't properly captured and passed back to the view, or if the view isn't configured to display them, you’re left with that frustrating silence.

The most common reason errors vanish into the ether is that you're dealing with a `redirect_to` instead of a `render`. Let's say you have a simple `create` action in a controller. If your model fails validation, and your code looks something like this:

```ruby
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    if @user.save
      redirect_to user_path(@user), notice: 'User created successfully.'
    else
      redirect_to new_user_path, alert: 'Failed to create user.'
    end
  end
```

This seems logical, *but* redirects do exactly that: they issue an http redirect. The crucial detail here is that redirects *do not carry over* instance variables (`@user` in this case) and, importantly, they *do not carry over the model's errors*. The view rendered after a redirect effectively has no idea about those errors that happened during the `create` action. The correct approach here is to use `render` instead of redirect if you want errors to be displayed on that same form view:

```ruby
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    if @user.save
      redirect_to user_path(@user), notice: 'User created successfully.'
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
```

Here, when validations fail, I'm rendering the `new.html.erb` template and crucially, since the same request cycle isn't restarted, the `@user` instance with all its errors are passed to the view. The `status: :unprocessable_entity` is not strictly needed, but good practice to correctly reflect the HTTP response code.

The next piece of this puzzle involves properly displaying these errors in the view itself. You can't just render a form and expect Rails to magically sprinkle errors onto the page. You need to actively query the model's errors and display them. Here's an example of how this is generally done using the standard form helper in Rails:

```erb
  <%= form_with(model: @user, url: users_path, method: :post) do |form| %>
      <% if @user.errors.any? %>
        <div id="error_explanation">
          <h2><%= pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this user from being saved:</h2>
          <ul>
          <% @user.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
            <li><%= message %></li>
          <% end %>
          </ul>
        </div>
      <% end %>

      <div>
        <%= form.label :name %><br>
        <%= form.text_field :name %>
      </div>

      <div>
         <%= form.label :email %><br>
         <%= form.text_field :email %>
      </div>

      <div>
        <%= form.submit %>
      </div>
    <% end %>
```

In this snippet, I’m first checking if `@user.errors.any?` returns true – which means validation errors exist. If so, I iterate through `@user.errors.full_messages`, displaying each error message in a list. Note the use of `full_messages` which give you formatted error messages like "Name can't be blank" instead of just "blank." You’ll likely want to tweak this with your own styles or use something more sophisticated like component partials, but this provides the core logic.

Lastly, a subtle but common trap revolves around the lifecycle of model instances. Imagine you have an `update` action, but the `form_with` tag is creating an entirely *new* model instance instead of using the one that failed validation. This happens when, for example, you use `@user = User.new` within the `update` action again. The *new* model won't have any of the errors from the previous submission, which is usually confusing.

Let’s make this clearer with an example. Here’s a faulty `update` action:

```ruby
  def update
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
    @user.assign_attributes(user_params) #instead of updating model
    if @user.save
      redirect_to user_path(@user), notice: 'User updated successfully.'
    else
        @user = User.new(user_params) #<- this is where it goes wrong
      render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
```

Here's the issue: If `save` fails, *I'm creating a brand new User instance* using the form params and assigning it to `@user` before rendering the `edit` template. The errors that were actually generated when I tried to update the original user are lost. To correct this, I should instead maintain the same instance that failed validation. A corrected version of this looks like this:

```ruby
  def update
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
    if @user.update(user_params)
        redirect_to user_path(@user), notice: 'User updated successfully.'
    else
      render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
```
Here I am using `@user.update()` instead of assigning the parameters to the record and then calling `save`, this method updates the model parameters and attempts to save if they change, otherwise it will simply return false and trigger the render path.

So in summary: ensure you use `render` instead of `redirect` after failed validations, display the model's errors in your views correctly, and make sure you are not accidentally creating a new model instance which is effectively losing the original model with its validation errors. These three considerations usually cover the vast majority of cases where you’ll encounter seemingly missing validation errors. For a more thorough exploration of form handling, I recommend reading the Rails Guides section on Action Controller Overview and the Active Record Validations section – they are incredibly detailed and provide context which goes beyond the basic documentation. Also, you might want to delve into the “Refactoring to Patterns” book by Joshua Kerievsky for a deeper understanding of proper design principles which avoid these common mistakes in the first place. Finally, "Eloquent Ruby" by Russ Olsen is a good source to understand how Ruby works under the hood and the various ways it can interact with rails and its abstractions.
