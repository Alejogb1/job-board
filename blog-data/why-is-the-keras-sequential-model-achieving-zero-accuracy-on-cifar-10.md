,  I've seen this particular issue with Keras' Sequential model and CIFAR-10 more times than I care to recall. It's usually not a single catastrophic error, but rather a confluence of subtle misconfigurations. It's infuriating, I know, but let's break it down step-by-step.

From my experience, the most common reason a Keras Sequential model hits zero accuracy on CIFAR-10, especially in the initial stages of experimentation, stems from issues related to data preprocessing, network architecture suitability, and insufficient training procedures. It's rarely a bug in the Keras library itself, but rather how we're configuring and utilizing it. Let's delve deeper into those categories.

First, let's address the data preprocessing. CIFAR-10 images are essentially 32x32 color images, represented as integers ranging from 0 to 255 for each color channel (red, green, blue). The neural network, however, generally operates more effectively when these values are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 or have a zero mean and unit variance. When you feed the model raw pixel values without this normalization, the gradients during backpropagation can become unstable, leading to vanishing or exploding gradient issues. The model effectively cannot learn anything. Furthermore, the labels provided in cifar-10 are numerical (0 to 9) and will need to be one-hot encoded for better compatibility with common loss functions used in multiclass classification. Neglecting to do this also leads to near-zero accuracy.

Here’s a straightforward code snippet illustrating the correct data preprocessing steps:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

# 1. Normalize pixel values to the range 0-1
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.0

# 2. One-hot encode the labels
num_classes = 10
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)

print(f"Train data shape: {x_train.shape}, Train labels shape: {y_train.shape}")
print(f"Test data shape: {x_test.shape}, Test labels shape: {y_test.shape}")
```

This piece of code retrieves the CIFAR-10 data, converts the pixel values to float32, scales them between 0 and 1, and applies one-hot encoding to the labels. The `to_categorical` function from `tensorflow.keras.utils` does the necessary transformation from class integers to binary matrices. Neglecting either of these will likely lead to the model not learning and achieving 0% accuracy.

Secondly, let's consider the network architecture. If your model is too shallow, or lacks proper convolutional layers, it will fail to learn even with perfectly preprocessed data. A basic fully connected network, for instance, will usually not cut it for image classification tasks like CIFAR-10 due to their inherent spatial structure. Convolutional layers are instrumental in learning local patterns within the image. A suitable model would also need an adequate number of filters and depth to capture enough features from the dataset. Using an architecture that is simply too shallow or uses incorrect layer types for the kind of data will be a large hurdle to overcome.

Let me give you an example of a relatively simple convolutional network that generally does well with CIFAR-10:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Dropout(0.25),

    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu'),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Dropout(0.25),

    Flatten(),
    Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax') # 10 classes in CIFAR-10
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```
This model uses convolution, pooling, and dropout layers to extract and learn meaningful features from the input. The model starts with 32 filters and increases to 64 in the next set of convolutional layers. We use a dropout rate of 25% after each set of convolutions and before fully connected layers. The output layer uses a softmax activation to perform multiclass classification. If a model is far less complex than this, chances are that it might also struggle.

Finally, the training procedure itself is a frequent culprit. Insufficient epochs, a bad learning rate, or an unsuitable optimizer can prevent the model from converging. Starting with a slightly higher learning rate and adjusting it with decay or using an adaptive optimizer such as Adam or RMSprop can significantly impact performance. When I see this issue, usually the model is under-trained or trained using a basic optimizer that can't navigate the loss landscape effectively for such a complex dataset. Here is a small example showing training the previous model:
```python
batch_size = 64 # commonly a power of 2
epochs = 20 # adjust this based on your need

history = model.fit(x_train, y_train,
          batch_size=batch_size,
          epochs=epochs,
          validation_data=(x_test, y_test),
          shuffle=True)
```

Here, `model.fit` is used to train the model on the training data. I've set the `batch_size` to 64, and I am training for 20 epochs with validation data. Using an appropriate batch size and a reasonable number of epochs are also important to get your model to learn effectively. Typically it is a good idea to increase the number of epochs until your validation loss plateaus.

In terms of further reading and references, I would recommend taking a good look at the following: “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville; it’s a thorough exploration of all the underlying theory. Then, to get a better practical understanding, the tensorflow documentation ([https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/)), is invaluable. Also, the original paper for the Adam optimizer ("Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization" by Diederik P. Kingma and Jimmy Ba) provides a deep dive into the inner workings of a great optimization algorithm.

In summary, zero accuracy on CIFAR-10 with a Keras Sequential model is almost always a consequence of not properly processing your data, using an unsuitable network architecture, or under-training your model. Correcting those three points usually solves the issue. Remember to normalize your input, use convolutional layers for image data, and monitor training with validation data. Debugging issues like this is a part of the learning process, and I've certainly been through my fair share of them to understand these specific gotchas.
