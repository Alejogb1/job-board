Let's tackle this head-on. I recall an old project involving satellite imagery analysis back in '18; we had a trove of high-res images, but the feature extraction part was a total bottleneck. We didn't want to pre-train on some generic dataset; the features needed to be specific to our target. Training a model with untrained feature extraction layers, while common in some scenarios, does indeed present its own set of challenges. Let’s break down how to achieve this in PyTorch, covering not just the 'how' but also a bit of the 'why'.

Essentially, the crux of the matter lies in configuring your model architecture and the training loop such that both the feature extraction part, typically convolutional layers, and the classification part are optimized simultaneously. We're not freezing any pre-trained layers here; it's an end-to-end training scenario from random initializations. This can lead to more task-specific features but can also demand more data and careful tuning.

The first point to address is the model itself. A common approach is to use `torch.nn.Sequential` or create a custom class inheriting from `torch.nn.Module`. Within this model, you will define your feature extraction layers (e.g., convolutions, pooling, etc.) followed by the classification layers (e.g., fully connected layers, softmax). It’s vital to initialize these layers correctly; PyTorch defaults to Kaiming initialization, which works well in many situations, but it's worth experimenting with other initializations, particularly Xavier initialization, depending on your specific needs. If your problem is similar to mine was, where data is highly complex, experimenting with the activation functions such as elu, or gelu, alongside batch normalization could become necessary.

Here’s a basic code snippet illustrating this:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class CustomModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(CustomModel, self).__init__()
        self.feature_extractor = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        )
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(32 * 7 * 7, 128),  # Adjust size based on image dimensions and prev layers
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, num_classes)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.feature_extractor(x)
        x = self.classifier(x)
        return x

# Example usage
model = CustomModel(num_classes=10) # Example with 10 classes
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
```

In this example, `CustomModel` contains a `feature_extractor` section made of convolutional and pooling layers followed by a `classifier` section comprising fully connected layers. Note that the output size of the last pooling layer is calculated manually (in this case, it is `32*7*7`, this would change depending on your own input image size). It is vital that these are calculated correctly, as they will determine the input size for your first fully connected layer. The `forward` method defines how data flows through this network. The `Adam` optimizer is used here, alongside `CrossEntropyLoss` which is commonly used for multi-class classification, but may not be ideal for other applications.

Next, the training process. A standard training loop in PyTorch involves iterating through your dataset, feeding batches into your model, calculating a loss, and then backpropagating this loss to update the weights. The crucial point here is that *all* parameters, those from both the feature extractor and classifier, are updated during each iteration. That's precisely what we want.

Consider this training loop snippet, assuming you have a `train_loader` for your data:

```python
def train_model(model, train_loader, optimizer, criterion, epochs=5):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        model.train()
        running_loss = 0.0
        for i, data in enumerate(train_loader, 0):
            inputs, labels = data
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            running_loss += loss.item()
            if i % 100 == 99:    # Print every 100 mini-batches
                print(f'[{epoch + 1}, {i + 1:5d}] loss: {running_loss / 100:.3f}')
                running_loss = 0.0
    print('Finished Training')

# Example of calling the function
# Assuming you have train_loader, optimizer, criterion defined
# train_model(model, train_loader, optimizer, criterion, epochs=10)
```

This function encapsulates a typical training process. In each epoch, it iterates through each batch of data, calculates the loss and updates the model’s parameters. The key here is the use of `optimizer.step()` which will backpropagate gradients through *all* layers of the network. It is critical here to check how the model performs on the validation or test set, to ensure it is learning the features you intended it to, instead of over-fitting.

A third, and equally important aspect is data augmentation. Since we are training the feature extractor from scratch, the model needs a lot of examples to adequately learn features. Data augmentation is essential for this, as it will help your model generalize better to new data, by adding random transformations to your existing dataset. PyTorch provides transformations using `torchvision.transforms`. Consider adding random rotations, crops, flips, and brightness changes. This can dramatically improve performance if you are using limited data.

Here's an example incorporating data augmentation in your data loading process:

```python
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Assuming you have your training data as tensors (train_images, train_labels)

# Define augmentations
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToPILImage(), # Needed for random transformations
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.RandomRotation(10),
    transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])

class AugmentedDataset(TensorDataset):
    def __init__(self, images, labels, transform=None):
        self.transform = transform
        super().__init__(images, labels)

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        image, label = super().__getitem__(index)
        if self.transform:
            image = self.transform(image)
        return image, label


# Create the augmented datasets
augmented_train_dataset = AugmentedDataset(train_images, train_labels, transform=transform)
train_loader = DataLoader(augmented_train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Then pass this train_loader to the training function
# train_model(model, train_loader, optimizer, criterion, epochs=10)
```

Here the data augmentation functions are composed together via `transforms.Compose`, and then applied to each image during dataset initialization. It is critical that the inputs here are PIL images, so a transformation from tensors to PIL images is used, and back to tensors, once transformations have been applied. This is common practice, and other transformations can be added. The augmented dataset can then be used to train the model.

In summary, training a model with untrained feature extraction layers in PyTorch requires you to carefully construct your model, define your forward pass, implement a training loop that updates all the layers of your model, and augment the data. There is no need to freeze the layers here, since all of them are randomly initialized. For further exploration of feature learning, I'd suggest delving into the "Deep Learning" book by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville; it provides a thorough understanding of the theory behind neural networks. In addition, the original papers on ResNets or Inception architectures are great references for how specific network structures can lead to improved performance. And don't underestimate experimenting with different optimizer algorithms, such as AdamW, as well as learning rate schedulers. The key here is careful setup and diligent experimentation. This has worked well for me in past projects, and I am confident that it will work well for you.
