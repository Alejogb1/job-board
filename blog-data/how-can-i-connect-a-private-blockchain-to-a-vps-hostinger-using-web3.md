Alright, let’s tackle this. I've seen this particular challenge pop up a few times over the years, specifically the part about bridging a private blockchain – which, let's be honest, often means something you've spun up yourself – to a commercially available vps. It's not always as straightforward as hooking up to a public network. The core issue here is establishing a secure communication channel between your private blockchain nodes and your hostinger vps using web3.js or a similar library, while accounting for the typical firewall restrictions you'll encounter.

The most critical aspect is the network configuration, which we'll explore in detail. Your private blockchain's network ID, genesis block, and node connection information aren’t magically known to the outside world. Essentially, you are creating a closed system, and the vps needs the equivalent of an invitation to join.

Before we jump into specifics, let's talk conceptually about what we’re trying to achieve. You have a blockchain network operating on a local machine or cluster of machines, and you want your application, which resides on the vps, to interact with it using web3. This interaction often involves sending transactions, querying the blockchain state, and potentially subscribing to events. The connection therefore needs to be bidirectional, secure and robust.

The first layer involves setting up your private blockchain nodes to be accessible. This typically means configuring them to listen on an ip address accessible to the vps. If your blockchain nodes are on your local network, you’ll need to use port forwarding through your router or utilize a tunneling service like ssh port forwarding, if your vps provides you with an external address you can connect to. This port, usually something like 8545, needs to be exposed. **However**, directly exposing it without any form of security is a *very bad idea*. Therefore, we'll consider secure tunneling or using a vpn instead to mitigate this. This allows for interaction but also protects your node's rpc endpoint from unauthorized access.

Let's move to the code. Let's consider the scenario that the private blockchain is indeed listening, and the port is reachable through a secure method. For simplicity, we will assume that this secure method of access is through an ssh tunnel, with the local port being forwarded to localhost. I am using javascript and the web3.js library because of its prevalence in this context:

**Snippet 1: Basic Web3 Connection**
```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');

// Replace with your local forwarded port, if the tunnel is used
const providerUrl = "http://localhost:8545"; 

const web3 = new Web3(providerUrl);

async function checkConnection() {
  try {
    const isConnected = await web3.eth.net.isListening();
    if(isConnected) {
        console.log("Successfully connected to the blockchain node.");
        const chainId = await web3.eth.net.getId();
        console.log(`Chain Id: ${chainId}`);
    } else {
        console.log("Failed to connect to the blockchain node.");
    }
  } catch(error) {
    console.error("Error during connection check:", error);
  }
}

checkConnection();

```

This snippet is the most basic setup. It establishes a web3 instance pointing to the defined provider, which in this case points to a local port. This is generally where folks start. The important part is ensuring that `providerUrl` correctly points to a reachable node. It uses `web3.eth.net.isListening()` to confirm the node responds, and if it does it proceeds to query for the network id.

Now let's assume you need to send a transaction to your private chain from your vps. You’ll need an account key in order to do so. This is a slightly more involved operation:

**Snippet 2: Sending a Transaction**
```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const providerUrl = "http://localhost:8545"; // Assume tunneled access
const web3 = new Web3(providerUrl);

// Replace with your private key
const privateKey = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY';

const fromAddress = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey).address;


async function sendTransaction() {
    try {
      const nonce = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(fromAddress, "pending");
        const tx = {
            from: fromAddress,
            to: 'YOUR_TO_ADDRESS', // Replace with the recipient address
            value: web3.utils.toWei('0.001', 'ether'), // Example value
            gas: 21000, // Minimum gas limit
            nonce: nonce,
        };
        const signedTx = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(tx, privateKey);
        const receipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signedTx.rawTransaction);
        console.log('Transaction Receipt:', receipt);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error sending transaction:', error);
    }
}

sendTransaction();
```

This snippet illustrates how to send a transaction. It loads a private key, constructs the transaction object, signs it, and sends it to the network. Key things to note here include the `nonce` which is important to prevent replay attacks, and the `gas` which is the computational effort needed by the blockchain to process this transaction. This will typically require you have an unlocked account on your blockchain instance, or have access to the private keys of an account. The `from` address is extracted from the private key, meaning the account does not need to be managed by the RPC itself. In this example the transaction is sent to an address and a trivial amount of ether is sent along with it.

Finally, let’s consider a simple example of subscribing to events, which is another common interaction point between an application and a blockchain:

**Snippet 3: Subscribing to Events**
```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const providerUrl = "ws://localhost:8546"; // Usually ws for subscriptions. Assuming tunneled access.
const web3 = new Web3(providerUrl);


async function subscribeToEvents() {
  try {
      const subscription = web3.eth.subscribe('newBlockHeaders', (error, result) => {
        if (error) {
          console.error('Error in event subscription:', error);
        } else {
          console.log('New block header:', result);
        }
      });

      subscription.on("connected", subscriptionId => {
          console.log(`Subscription connected: ${subscriptionId}`);
      })
      subscription.on('error', error => {
          console.error('Subscription error:', error);
      });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error subscribing to events:', error);
    }

}

subscribeToEvents();

```

This example demonstrates how to subscribe to `newBlockHeaders` events, which are emitted each time a new block is appended to the chain. It establishes a websocket connection (notice `ws://` instead of `http://`) and listens for these events.

Moving beyond these basic code examples, you should also consider security best practices. First and foremost, never expose your private keys directly in your code. Use secure key management practices or environment variables, and limit the scope of these keys to the bare minimum permissions.

For more in-depth learning, I highly recommend the book "Mastering Ethereum" by Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood. It provides excellent coverage of ethereum architecture and web3 interactions. Additionally, the documentation on the web3.js library itself is invaluable, and you can find that on github. Finally, explore the different approaches to securing the connection. There are other methods beyond basic ssh port forwarding which are often more appropriate for production scenarios; techniques like using a vpn to create a private network, or using a message queue such as rabbitmq to relay messages between the nodes and your vps application are beneficial to look into.

In short, connecting a private blockchain to a vps isn’t terribly complicated, provided you understand the fundamental networking issues and how to approach them correctly. The examples here should give you a basic understanding on how to do so. As always, start small, understand each part, and progressively build your solution.
