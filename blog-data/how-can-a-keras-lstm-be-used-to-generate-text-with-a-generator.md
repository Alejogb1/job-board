Let's unpack this. Text generation with a Keras LSTM, particularly when employing a generator, involves a series of carefully orchestrated steps to effectively train the model and manage the vastness of textual data. I've personally encountered scenarios where naively loading entire text corpora into memory led to crippling performance bottlenecks; adopting a generator-based approach proved invaluable in scaling those systems.

The core principle is that, instead of feeding the entire dataset into the LSTM all at once, a generator produces batches of training data on demand. This is crucial when dealing with text, as even relatively small datasets can quickly consume significant memory resources. Think of it as a pipeline: the generator prepares the data, the LSTM consumes it, and this process repeats. This approach mitigates the memory pressure and allows you to work with arbitrarily large text datasets.

The process primarily involves several key stages: data preparation, model definition, generator implementation, training loop, and text generation. I'll outline each phase with code examples.

**Data Preparation:**

First, you'll need to convert your text into numerical sequences. This typically involves creating a vocabulary of unique words (or characters, depending on your approach) and then mapping each word/character to an integer. For our example, let's assume we're operating at the character level because it’s simpler to illustrate, though it’s typically less efficient for real-world tasks where words or subwords are often better units.

Here's a simplified Python code snippet to get started. Assume ‘text’ holds our string corpus:

```python
import numpy as np

text = "This is a test string. This string is for testing purposes."
chars = sorted(list(set(text)))
char_indices = dict((c, i) for i, c in enumerate(chars))
indices_char = dict((i, c) for i, c in enumerate(chars))

maxlen = 40  # Maximum sequence length
step = 3 # Skip some characters to get more diverse samples
sentences = []
next_chars = []
for i in range(0, len(text) - maxlen, step):
  sentences.append(text[i : i + maxlen])
  next_chars.append(text[i + maxlen])

print(f"Number of sequences: {len(sentences)}")
```

This code extracts sequences of length `maxlen` and stores them with the next character in `sentences` and `next_chars` respectively, and creates mappings between characters and integers.

**Model Definition:**

Next, we define the LSTM model. A simple architecture can suffice for illustrative purposes. This could incorporate more advanced techniques like bidirectional LSTMs or attention mechanisms, which are found in advanced resources, but we stick to basics for clarity.

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Embedding
from keras.models import Sequential

vocab_size = len(chars)
embedding_dim = 128

model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=maxlen)) #embedding for sequences
model.add(LSTM(256)) # basic lstm layer
model.add(Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')) # output layer

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
model.summary()

```

Here, we define an embedding layer to translate our integer input into vectors, an LSTM layer to model sequence dependence, and a fully connected output layer to generate probabilities for each character in the vocabulary.

**Generator Implementation:**

The heart of this approach lies within the data generator. This generator is a Python function (technically, a generator function using the `yield` keyword) that produces data batches on the fly. This keeps data loading memory-efficient.

```python
def data_generator(sentences, next_chars, batch_size, char_indices, maxlen, vocab_size):
    i = 0
    while True:
        encoder_input_data = np.zeros((batch_size, maxlen), dtype='int32')
        decoder_target_data = np.zeros((batch_size, vocab_size), dtype='int32')

        for b in range(batch_size):
            if i == len(sentences):
              i = 0 #reset counter
            sequence = sentences[i]
            target_char = next_chars[i]
            for t, char in enumerate(sequence):
                encoder_input_data[b, t] = char_indices[char]
            decoder_target_data[b, char_indices[target_char]] = 1.0

            i+=1
        yield encoder_input_data, decoder_target_data
```

This `data_generator` yields tuples of encoded input sequences and their one-hot encoded target characters, in batches. Note how it cycles through the sentences with an infinite loop, thus making it usable with the `model.fit` function.

**Training Loop and Text Generation:**

The training loop utilizes this generator. Note that `model.fit` will use a step parameter instead of epochs to avoid stopping.

```python
batch_size = 64
steps_per_epoch = len(sentences) // batch_size if len(sentences) > batch_size else 1
num_epochs = 5
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    gen = data_generator(sentences, next_chars, batch_size, char_indices, maxlen, vocab_size)
    model.fit(gen, steps_per_epoch=steps_per_epoch, verbose = 1)

# Text generation
def sample(preds, temperature=1.0):
    preds = np.asarray(preds).astype('float64')
    preds = np.log(preds) / temperature
    exp_preds = np.exp(preds)
    preds = exp_preds / np.sum(exp_preds)
    probas = np.random.multinomial(1, preds, 1)
    return np.argmax(probas)

def generate_text(model, seed_text, max_length, char_indices, indices_char, maxlen, temperature=0.5):
    generated = seed_text
    for _ in range(max_length):
        encoded = np.zeros((1, maxlen), dtype='int32')
        for t, char in enumerate(seed_text):
            encoded[0, t] = char_indices[char]

        preds = model.predict(encoded, verbose = 0)[0]
        next_index = sample(preds, temperature)
        next_char = indices_char[next_index]
        generated += next_char
        seed_text = seed_text[1:] + next_char #shift window one character
    return generated


seed = "This is"
print(generate_text(model, seed, 100, char_indices, indices_char, maxlen, temperature=0.8))

```

The `generate_text` function takes a seed text, encodes it, uses the model to predict a probability distribution, samples from the distribution using a `temperature` parameter to add variability, and then appends the sampled character to the generated text. The `sample` function implements the sampling from categorical distributions, which is common in generating probabilistic sequences.

**Further Exploration and Considerations:**

This explanation is a starting point. Text generation is an area with continuous research. For deepening your knowledge, the following resources are invaluable:

*   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Text Classification**: This research paper by Sundermeyer, Schlüter, and Ney, discusses the foundational concepts of RNNs, which includes LSTMs and GRUs, with application in the area of text. This is a good starting point for the theory.
*   **Deep Learning** by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville: A comprehensive deep learning textbook that delves into the theory and applications of neural networks, including recurrent models. This book provides the necessary mathematical foundations.
*   **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** by Aurélien Géron: A practical guide that not only covers model architecture but also provides hands-on examples of building and training neural networks using Keras. Useful for understanding the implementation aspects.

Remember that the training of complex models is resource-intensive. Adjust batch sizes, model architectures, and training parameters as needed to suit your available hardware and dataset size. For large-scale datasets, consider distributed training and techniques for memory optimization. Experiment with the `temperature` parameter for varied outputs. Lower temperatures will yield predictable outputs, whereas higher ones produce surprising, sometimes nonsensical results.
Generating coherent and contextually relevant text is an evolving problem; however, with these techniques and a thorough understanding of the underlying principles, you can build robust text generation systems.
