Let's tackle this image preview issue – it's a surprisingly common problem, and I've navigated it a few times, once in a rather memory-constrained embedded system, believe it or not. The key here is managing resources efficiently, especially when dealing with potentially large images, and delivering a smooth user experience. Forget any complex framework wizardry; this is about understanding the fundamentals and applying them judiciously.

The core challenge revolves around two primary components: efficiently loading images without overwhelming memory and providing a seamless transition between the thumbnail and the preview. Loading the full-size image every time a thumbnail is clicked is a recipe for disaster, leading to slow response times and potential out-of-memory errors. We need a smarter approach.

Firstly, it's crucial to maintain a cache of loaded images, ensuring we're not repeatedly decoding the same resource. My preference is for a two-tiered caching system: an in-memory cache for readily available images (particularly previews) and a disk-based cache for those not currently in memory. The `LruCache` class in Android is excellent for memory caching, using a least-recently-used eviction policy. For disk caching, you can use the built-in Android file system; however, I often recommend a dedicated library like `DiskLruCache`, detailed by Jake Wharton in his Android I/O talk years ago. It offers better control over storage management and avoids pitfalls related to file access permissions.

Now, let's address the preview itself. We want a smooth transition between the thumbnail and the full image preview. Instead of abruptly replacing one with the other, use animation. The `ImageView` in Android supports various transformations, including scaling and translation. We can use an `ObjectAnimator` (or a `ViewPropertyAnimator`, which is somewhat simpler) to animate the change in the `ImageView`'s dimensions and position to create a fluid zooming or expanding effect. The beauty here is that you don't need to reload the same image or create a copy; you're merely manipulating the view that’s displaying it.

Here's some sample code to give you an overview. Remember that this is simplified; in a real-world application, you'd want error handling and proper lifecycle management.

```java
// Sample for LruCache implementation.
// Consider using a separate class for cache management.
public class ImageCache {
    private LruCache<String, Bitmap> memoryCache;

    public ImageCache(int maxMemory) {
        final int cacheSize = maxMemory / 8; // Using a fraction for memory cache
        memoryCache = new LruCache<String, Bitmap>(cacheSize) {
            @Override
            protected int sizeOf(String key, Bitmap bitmap) {
                return bitmap.getByteCount();
            }
        };
    }

    public void addBitmapToMemoryCache(String key, Bitmap bitmap) {
        if (getBitmapFromMemoryCache(key) == null) {
            memoryCache.put(key, bitmap);
        }
    }

    public Bitmap getBitmapFromMemoryCache(String key) {
        return memoryCache.get(key);
    }

    // Disk cache handling would go here, but I'll leave it out for this example's clarity
}

// Usage
ImageCache cache = new ImageCache(1024 * 1024 * 10); // 10MB max size.
Bitmap thumbnailBitmap = loadThumbnailBitmap(thumbnailPath);
cache.addBitmapToMemoryCache(thumbnailPath, thumbnailBitmap);
```

This snippet demonstrates a basic in-memory cache. Note that `loadThumbnailBitmap` would use `BitmapFactory.decodeFile` with appropriate sampling to reduce memory consumption. Disk caching implementation depends heavily on file system access control and how aggressively you’re caching, I've not included disk caching here in the interest of space.

Now let’s look at animating the preview transition:

```java
// Sample Animation code on thumbnail click.
private void showImagePreview(ImageView thumbnailView, String fullImagePath) {
    ImageView previewImageView = findViewById(R.id.previewImageView);
    previewImageView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);

    // Load full size image, ideally from cache if available
    Bitmap fullSizeBitmap = loadFullSizeBitmap(fullImagePath);
    if (fullSizeBitmap != null) {
        previewImageView.setImageBitmap(fullSizeBitmap);
    }

    // Initial states: previewImageView exactly where thumbnailView was
    previewImageView.setX(thumbnailView.getX());
    previewImageView.setY(thumbnailView.getY());
    previewImageView.setScaleX(thumbnailView.getScaleX());
    previewImageView.setScaleY(thumbnailView.getScaleY());

    // Calculate final location for preview
    int previewWidth = previewImageView.getLayoutParams().width;
    int previewHeight = previewImageView.getLayoutParams().height;
    float targetX = (float)(getWidth() - previewWidth)/2; // Center horizontally
    float targetY = (float)(getHeight() - previewHeight)/2;  // Center Vertically


    // Use ViewPropertyAnimator for smoother animation
    previewImageView.animate()
        .x(targetX)
        .y(targetY)
        .scaleX(1f)
        .scaleY(1f)
        .setDuration(300)
        .start();
}

// In your Activity or Fragment.
// ImageView thumbnail = findViewById(R.id.thumbnailImageView);
// thumbnail.setOnClickListener(view -> showImagePreview((ImageView)view, "path/to/full/image"));
```

This snippet illustrates a basic animated transition using `ViewPropertyAnimator`. It first positions the `previewImageView` at the same location as the clicked thumbnail and then animates its scale and position to make the preview image larger and centered.

For loading the actual full-size image efficiently:

```java
private Bitmap loadFullSizeBitmap(String imagePath) {
    Bitmap cachedBitmap = cache.getBitmapFromMemoryCache(imagePath); // Check in cache first.
    if (cachedBitmap != null) {
        return cachedBitmap;
    }

    BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
    options.inJustDecodeBounds = true;
    BitmapFactory.decodeFile(imagePath, options);

    int width = options.outWidth;
    int height = options.outHeight;
    int reqWidth = 1024; // Adjust according to your target preview size
    int reqHeight = 1024;

    int inSampleSize = 1; // Ensure that samplesize is a power of 2
    if(width > reqWidth || height > reqHeight){
        int halfWidth = width /2;
        int halfHeight = height/2;

        while((halfWidth / inSampleSize) >= reqWidth && (halfHeight / inSampleSize) >= reqHeight) {
            inSampleSize *= 2;
        }
    }

    options.inJustDecodeBounds = false;
    options.inSampleSize = inSampleSize;
    Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(imagePath, options);
    cache.addBitmapToMemoryCache(imagePath,bitmap);
    return bitmap;

}
```

Here, `loadFullSizeBitmap` demonstrates efficient image loading by determining the appropriate `inSampleSize` to resize the image to the desired preview size. This avoids loading an unnecessarily large image into memory. This function would also attempt loading from the memory cache first.

In a production application, this requires additional enhancements. You’ll likely want to load images asynchronously using `AsyncTask` or, better yet, `coroutines` for cleaner code and better cancellation management. Also consider using image loading libraries like Coil or Glide, which manage caching, image loading, and transformations efficiently.

For more detailed information on memory management, the official Android documentation on managing bitmaps is essential. Additionally, I strongly recommend "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch for its general best practices, which are highly relevant for developing robust and maintainable code. Understanding these fundamentals will equip you to implement image preview seamlessly. Always prioritize memory efficiency and smooth transitions, and you’ll deliver a delightful user experience.
