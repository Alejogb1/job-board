Alright, let's tackle this. Querying Tag Manager data, eh? It's something I've spent a fair bit of time on over the years, particularly when trying to nail down the specifics of data layer pushes or debugging complex tracking setups. It's definitely not always as straightforward as one might initially hope.

The primary challenge, I've found, isn't so much about the *what*—we're essentially trying to extract information about how our tags and triggers are behaving—but rather the *how*. Google Tag Manager, in its native environment, doesn't offer a direct querying interface like, say, a database. Instead, we’re largely working through its user interface, developer tools, and, for more sophisticated needs, leveraging the Tag Manager API. So, let me break down a few approaches that I've used successfully and some nuances you'll probably encounter.

Firstly, a common need is to inspect the data layer itself. In most real-world situations, the data layer is the foundational element upon which your Tag Manager configurations are built. It holds the information that triggers events and populates tag parameters. Within your browser, the developer console is your best friend here. Open the console (usually through F12 or right-click -> Inspect -> Console) and type `dataLayer`. The browser will then show you the current state of your data layer as a Javascript array of objects. As events are pushed into the dataLayer, they'll become visible here.

Now, the *real* challenge begins when you need to analyze data over time, or when you're dealing with a complicated system. The console is great for live debugging, but it’s not so useful when you're trying to understand historical behavior. That’s where custom javascript in Tag Manager itself comes in handy.

Here's a first snippet, specifically for capturing data layer pushes as they happen. I used this extensively during a particularly complex e-commerce tracking setup I worked on a few years back. We were dealing with several asynchronous calls, making standard debugging near impossible:

```javascript
// Custom HTML Tag (fired on 'All Pages' or a more specific trigger as needed)
<script>
    (function() {
        if (!window.dataLayer){
            window.dataLayer = [];
        }
    var originalPush = dataLayer.push;
    dataLayer.push = function() {
    console.log('Data Layer Push:', arguments);
      originalPush.apply(dataLayer, arguments);
    };
  })();
</script>
```

This script intercepts each `dataLayer.push` call and logs it to the console before the standard push operation occurs. This approach allows me to monitor and review every single push, making it much easier to understand the sequence of events and to spot any missing or malformed data. This particular implementation is crucial because by logging `arguments` we can capture multiple objects passed at once, or single objects and their values.

The real power of custom javascript in Tag Manager becomes apparent when you want to track specific data layer variables. Imagine you’re trying to analyze how a user's selection of a specific product category impacts their future browsing behavior. Here’s a custom JavaScript variable that I've often relied on, to extract information on a specific product category after a dataLayer event has triggered.

```javascript
// Custom JavaScript Variable in GTM
function() {
  var dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  if(dataLayer && dataLayer.length > 0){
    var lastEvent = dataLayer[dataLayer.length -1];
    if(lastEvent && lastEvent.event === 'productView'){
         if (lastEvent.productDetails && lastEvent.productDetails.category){
           return lastEvent.productDetails.category;
         }
    }

    }
    return undefined; // or an appropriate default value
}

```

This snippet accesses the last item in the `dataLayer` array. In other words, it accesses the data object that just triggered. If there is a `productView` event, and if this event has an object named `productDetails` which has the property `category`, then we capture this specific value from the last data layer push and we can pass it to a Google Analytics tag or a tag of our choice, enabling analysis in reporting interfaces. Crucially, I always default the return value to `undefined` to prevent issues where the `productDetails` or `category` might not exist. It's a small detail, but it prevents a lot of errors. The code also checks if dataLayer is not undefined or null to prevent errors. This type of dynamic tracking is invaluable for granular analysis and segmentation of audiences within analytics platforms.

Finally, let’s look at leveraging the Tag Manager API for more automated analysis. The API is where things get really interesting for large-scale analysis. While direct querying of data like historical dataLayer values isn't its core function, you can extract crucial information about container configurations, tag setups, variables and triggers. You must authenticate using OAuth 2.0. The Google APIs Client library for JavaScript is required for this, or whichever client library that is applicable for the language of your choice.

Here is an example of code using a Node.js and the Google APIs client library:

```javascript
//Node.js example
const {google} = require('googleapis');
const tagmanager = google.tagmanager('v2');

async function listTags(accountId, containerId) {
    const authClient = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
        keyFile: 'path/to/your/credentials.json', // Replace with path to your json key
        scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tagmanager.readonly'],
      });
   const auth = await authClient.getClient();

  const res = await tagmanager.accounts.containers.workspaces.tags.list({
    auth: auth,
      parent: `accounts/${accountId}/containers/${containerId}/workspaces/live`
  });

  if (res.data.tag) {
      console.log('Tags:');
    res.data.tag.forEach(tag => {
      console.log(` - ${tag.name}:  Type ${tag.type} `);
        });
      } else {
         console.log('No tags found.');
      }


}

// Replace with your account and container ID
const accountId = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID';
const containerId = 'YOUR_CONTAINER_ID';
listTags(accountId,containerId);
```

This node.js example lists all tags within the specified workspace using the `tagmanager.accounts.containers.workspaces.tags.list` API method and your service account authorization. You will need to have already enabled the API in your Google Cloud project and created your service account credentials. This is only a small snippet of the power of the API. You can filter using certain tag properties, update configurations and so on, which is highly useful in deployments and reporting.

For more in-depth understanding and practical guidance, I recommend reviewing Google’s official Tag Manager API documentation; the documentation is detailed and gives you good knowledge of the API's capabilities. I would also recommend the book "Google Tag Manager for Developers" by Jonathan Weber, as this gives valuable insight into the practical uses of the API as well as the fundamentals of GTM.

So, to wrap it up, querying Tag Manager data isn’t a one-size-fits-all process. It requires a mix of debugging skills, client-side scripting in Tag Manager itself, and more advanced use of the API, depending on your needs. The key is to understand your data layer, know how to use the browser console and Tag Manager's custom javascript capabilities, and when to lean on the Tag Manager API to automate the extraction process. Over the years, these approaches have consistently proven useful for diagnosing complex tracking behaviors. They will probably be helpful for you too.
