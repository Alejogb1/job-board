Let's unpack this common yet often perplexing issue – a neural network that's consistently outputting the average, rather than exhibiting learning behavior. I've seen this numerous times across different projects, from early image classification attempts to more complex time-series forecasting. It's frustrating, for sure, but typically solvable when approached systematically. The root cause generally falls into a few distinct, yet sometimes overlapping, categories: issues with data, problems in the network architecture, or flawed training procedures.

Firstly, the data. More often than not, a stagnant output points to issues in the data provided to the neural net. If the target variable – the value we're trying to predict – exhibits minimal variance, the simplest solution for the network is indeed to predict the mean. Think of it this way: the network is learning to minimize loss. If predicting the mean consistently results in a low loss, why would it bother learning anything more complex? It's essentially taking the path of least resistance. I recall a particular project where we were predicting daily website traffic based on various marketing spend metrics. We realized the target variable had been smoothed too aggressively during preprocessing. The variability we were looking for was gone; it was effectively a noisy constant. The network, predictably, output the average traffic level.

Let's talk code. Below is a simple demonstration, using python and numpy, of how insufficient target variable variance can produce this effect:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Create a dataset with minimal target variance
np.random.seed(42)
num_samples = 100
features = np.random.rand(num_samples, 5)
# Target variable with very little variance
target = np.ones(num_samples) * 5 + np.random.normal(0, 0.01, num_samples)
# Ensure the features are within a reasonable range
features_normalized = (features - np.mean(features, axis=0)) / np.std(features, axis=0)


# Define a simple neural network
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(features_normalized, target, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Get predictions
predictions = model.predict(features_normalized)

# Print mean of target and predictions
print(f"Mean of target: {np.mean(target)}")
print(f"Mean of predictions: {np.mean(predictions)}")
print(f"Variance of target: {np.var(target)}")
print(f"Variance of predictions: {np.var(predictions)}")
```
Run this, and you'll see both the predicted and actual values cluster around the mean. Pay close attention to the variance - it’s extremely low for both.

Beyond low target variance, feature scaling issues can also contribute. If your input features have significantly different scales, the network may favor the larger features, while effectively ignoring the smaller ones. This can impede proper learning, as the gradient descent algorithm will struggle to navigate the loss landscape effectively. For instance, in the website traffic case, if we fed the model marketing spend in dollars (ranging from, say, thousands to millions) directly alongside the number of website clicks (ranging from tens to thousands), the dollar spend would dominate. The fix is standardizing or normalizing features before they're passed into the model.

Moving on from data, we arrive at network architecture problems. If your network lacks sufficient complexity or is fundamentally inappropriate for the data, it can also get stuck predicting the average. A model that is too shallow, or that lacks appropriate non-linear activation functions, may not be able to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This is a case of underfitting: the model simply does not have the capacity to learn the relationships. I once spent far too long trying to get a linear model to recognize non-linear patterns. The model consistently predicted the average, despite our best efforts at data engineering.

Let's demonstrate a very basic case, creating a simple neural network, but with only linear activations:
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Create some sample data with non-linear relationship
np.random.seed(42)
num_samples = 100
features = np.random.rand(num_samples, 1) * 10
target = 2 * features**2 + 3 + np.random.normal(0, 5, (num_samples,1))

# Define a very simple neural network, but only using linear layers.
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(1, use_bias=False, input_shape=(1,))
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(features, target, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Get predictions
predictions = model.predict(features)

# Print mean of target and predictions
print(f"Mean of target: {np.mean(target)}")
print(f"Mean of predictions: {np.mean(predictions)}")
print(f"Variance of target: {np.var(target)}")
print(f"Variance of predictions: {np.var(predictions)}")
```

Here, you'll likely observe a similar output pattern. Although the data has variance, the network, being linear, can not adapt to the non-linearity of the data, and ends up predicting a flat line. This demonstrates that the network architecture must be appropriate for the data.

Finally, the training procedure itself can be the culprit. An improperly configured optimization process, such as setting a learning rate that is too high or too low, or failing to properly initialize weights, can lead to a non-learning model. Similarly, insufficient training epochs or a poor choice of loss function can also impair the model's ability to learn. I remember diagnosing an issue where we were using an inappropriately large batch size when working with a smaller dataset; this led to highly unstable gradients, causing the network to settle for the mean instead of converging to a good solution.

Below is an example of a case with an extremely high learning rate:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Create sample data
np.random.seed(42)
num_samples = 100
features = np.random.rand(num_samples, 5)
target = 2 * np.sum(features, axis=1) + np.random.normal(0, 1, num_samples)

# Define a simple neural network
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model with an extremely high learning rate
optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1.0)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(features, target, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Get predictions
predictions = model.predict(features)

# Print mean of target and predictions
print(f"Mean of target: {np.mean(target)}")
print(f"Mean of predictions: {np.mean(predictions)}")
print(f"Variance of target: {np.var(target)}")
print(f"Variance of predictions: {np.var(predictions)}")
```

The output here might be a bit different from the previous examples, but note how the network's predictions seem to be erratic and not properly converging to a solution. This often means that, if it is not completely diverging, it's settling for a safe mean-value.

To address this behavior, it is best practice to methodically review these areas. Start by carefully examining your target variable distribution, and make sure you have adequate variance, and also check for scaling issues across all features. Next, evaluate the complexity of your model, and test different architectures to ensure it has the necessary capacity. Finally, fine-tune your training parameters, using best practices for optimization. Resources such as "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, and papers on specific optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp), can provide thorough details on techniques for debugging and refining neural networks. Don't hesitate to implement iterative experimentation, as the path to a well-behaved network is often iterative and incremental.
