Let's tackle this shape mismatch issue – it’s a common headache, and I’ve seen it crop up in various projects over the years. Specifically, when TensorFlow throws a `ValueError` complaining about incompatible shapes like `(128, 100)` and `(128, 100, 139)`, it almost always boils down to a fundamental disagreement in how your tensors are structured as they flow through your model. The error message itself, while seemingly simple, points to a misalignment between expected input shapes and the actual shapes being fed into an operation, often a matrix multiplication or a similar tensor-based calculation.

In your specific instance, it looks like we're dealing with batches of size 128, and the confusion seems to revolve around the last dimension. The shape `(128, 100)` suggests a batch of 128 items, each of which is a vector of length 100. The shape `(128, 100, 139)`, conversely, indicates that you also have 128 items in the batch, but now each of these items is a matrix itself – specifically, a matrix with dimensions 100x139. Clearly, these two tensors can't directly interact in operations expecting a matching rank or compatible dimensions. I recall facing a similar dilemma back during a project where we were working with time-series data and mistakenly mixed sequence data with feature vectors, and it was similarly problematic.

The core issue here, therefore, is that somewhere in your TensorFlow computation graph, an operation is expecting an input tensor of rank 2 (i.e., two dimensions) but is receiving a tensor of rank 3. Or vice versa or a less common error might be the tensor rank being same, but dimension sizes do not match. There are multiple ways this can occur, and finding the root cause often involves methodically tracing through your code and verifying the shape of each tensor involved in the calculation that's failing. This issue often comes up while constructing complex models, especially with custom layers or intricate architectures with sequential and functional APIs mixed together. There isn't a single magic bullet; it's a matter of pinpointing where the mismatch happens.

Let’s consider how to address this. Usually, the resolution revolves around one of the following strategies: reshaping, reducing dimensionality, expanding dimensionality, or carefully re-evaluating the operation that’s causing the mismatch and adjusting the tensors’ shape or dimensions to meet the layer's needs. Often, a sequence of reshaping operations may be needed to bring the shapes into alignment.

Let’s examine some code examples to clarify.

**Scenario 1: Reshaping a Rank 3 Tensor to Rank 2**

Suppose your rank 3 tensor of shape `(128, 100, 139)` needs to be transformed into a rank 2 tensor to feed into a fully connected (dense) layer. In that case, you’d need to flatten or reshape the last two dimensions to one dimension while keeping the batch size constant. I have used `tf.reshape()` in the snippet.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume we have a tensor with shape (128, 100, 139)
tensor_3d = tf.random.normal(shape=(128, 100, 139))

# Reshape to (128, 100 * 139) or (128, 13900)
tensor_2d = tf.reshape(tensor_3d, (128, 100 * 139))

# Check the new shape
print(f"Original tensor shape: {tensor_3d.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped tensor shape: {tensor_2d.shape}")

# Now tensor_2d is compatible with a Dense layer having 13900 input units.
# The next line is to show how it may be used.
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=256)
output = dense_layer(tensor_2d)
print(f"Output tensor shape from Dense layer: {output.shape}")
```
This snippet demonstrates the flattening operation.

**Scenario 2: Expanding a Rank 2 Tensor to Rank 3**

Conversely, let's assume you need to expand a rank 2 tensor `(128, 100)` into a rank 3 tensor to interact with something that requires a sequence. This can be achieved by adding a singleton dimension using `tf.expand_dims()`

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume we have a tensor with shape (128, 100)
tensor_2d = tf.random.normal(shape=(128, 100))

# Expand dimensions to (128, 100, 1) at last axis
tensor_3d_expanded = tf.expand_dims(tensor_2d, axis=-1)

# Check the new shape
print(f"Original tensor shape: {tensor_2d.shape}")
print(f"Expanded tensor shape: {tensor_3d_expanded.shape}")

# Example usage where such expansion may be needed
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=128)
lstm_output = lstm_layer(tensor_3d_expanded)
print(f"LSTM Output tensor shape: {lstm_output.shape}")
```

Here the example demonstrates expanding dimensions.

**Scenario 3: Using Transpose if Dimensions Need to be Flipped**

Sometimes the issue isn’t about rank mismatch, but incorrect shape of the dimensions themselves, in those cases, `tf.transpose` comes handy. Let's say we intended (100, 139) within the batch, and we somehow ended up with (139, 100). I will show that using `tf.transpose()`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume we have a tensor with shape (128, 139, 100) instead of (128, 100, 139)
tensor_3d_mismatched = tf.random.normal(shape=(128, 139, 100))

# Transpose the last two dimensions
tensor_3d_corrected = tf.transpose(tensor_3d_mismatched, perm=[0, 2, 1])

# Check the new shape
print(f"Original (mismatched) tensor shape: {tensor_3d_mismatched.shape}")
print(f"Corrected tensor shape: {tensor_3d_corrected.shape}")

# Example Usage
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3)
conv_output = conv_layer(tensor_3d_corrected)
print(f"Conv1D Output shape: {conv_output.shape}")
```
Here, the code shows how to correctly align the dimensions using `tf.transpose()`

To debug this kind of error, I always recommend leveraging TensorFlow’s eager execution for step-by-step inspection. Printing the shapes of tensors at various points in your model using Python's `print()` function will allow you to pinpoint where things diverge, or alternatively use TensorBoard with graphs, which gives you a visual perspective of the tensor’s shapes and flow through the graph.

For further understanding of tensor operations and their impact on shapes, I’d recommend examining the TensorFlow documentation closely, particularly the sections on reshaping, expanding and squeezing dimensions. You should also consider exploring the “Deep Learning with Python” by François Chollet which presents a practical approach, and the “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron, as a comprehensive resource. These resources helped me immensely in earlier projects, and I believe you will find them useful as well.

In closing, resolving shape errors in TensorFlow is a common yet critical step in model development, and while the initial error message might seem cryptic, a systematic approach of understanding shape expectations, tensor flows, and judicious reshaping can help bring your code to a functional state. Don’t be disheartened by these kinds of issues, they’re a part of the learning curve, and as you gain experience, debugging them becomes second nature.
