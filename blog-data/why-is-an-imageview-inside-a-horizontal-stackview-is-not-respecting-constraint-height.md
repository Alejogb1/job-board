alright, so you've got an imageview tucked inside a horizontal stackview and it's acting up, ignoring its height constraints, huh? yeah, i've been there, done that, got the t-shirt, probably stained with coffee and a bit of frustration. this is a classic layout quirk, and it usually boils down to a few common suspects. let's break it down and figure out what's going on.

first off, stackviews are designed to manage the layout of their contained views, particularly when it comes to arranging them horizontally or vertically. when you use a horizontal stackview, it's primarily concerned with allocating space along the horizontal axis and its children's intrinsic content sizes, *not* so much with forcing specific heights. by default, the stackview wants to make all items the same height based on the tallest item. that's the core of the problem. it tries to take care of spacing and horizontal arrangement, and often, it's happy to stretch views to fit if they don't have defined height constraints.

now, let's get into the specifics. i've seen this pop up in a number of situations over the years, and each time it was a head-scratcher until i figured out the root cause. one time, i spent hours chasing this down in an app that displayed a grid of profile icons. i had the imageview within a horizontal stackview to have space for the username next to it. the height of the imageview was set in constraints, but the stackview was, for some reason, making it taller than expected. i was pulling my hair out, thinking it was a constraint priority issue or something, which, in some cases it can be, but not in this one, it was the view's content mode.

in other words, the problem isn’t the imageview’s height *constraints* per se, but how the stackview is *interpreting* those constraints in the context of its own sizing algorithm. to be precise, the stackview tries to make all the contained views the same height based on their content.

the most common reason this happens is because of the content hugging and compression resistance priorities. a view’s content hugging and compression resistance priorities affect how a view will shrink or grow inside of a stack view. the stack view tries to layout views that are flexible, and by default the imageview is a flexible view, even with height constraints. let's talk through the typical solutions i would try one by one, but first let's visualize it a little bit. this is the typical setup:

```swift
let stackView = UIStackView()
stackView.axis = .horizontal
stackView.spacing = 8 // or whatever spacing you need
stackView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false //always do this!

let imageView = UIImageView()
imageView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
imageView.image = UIImage(named: "some_image") // Replace with your image
imageView.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit // or whatever you need
imageView.backgroundColor = .gray
imageView.layer.cornerRadius = 8
imageView.clipsToBounds = true

stackView.addArrangedSubview(imageView)

// here goes the height constraints that are not respected:
imageView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 50).isActive = true
// the following does not work as expected:
//imageView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalTo: imageView.heightAnchor).isActive = true

view.addSubview(stackView)

//stackview constraints:
stackView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.topAnchor, constant: 20).isActive = true
stackView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.leadingAnchor, constant: 20).isActive = true
stackView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.trailingAnchor, constant: -20).isActive = true
```

in the above code example the imageview is not respecting the height constraint even though it has a `heightAnchor` constraint. the stackview will make the view as tall as its content. let's look at the solutions i would try, and i always follow this order as a matter of preference because is the one that usually works.

**solution 1: adjusting the imageview's content hugging priority**

the imageview probably has an horizontal hugging priority and that makes the imageview want to grow horizontally. that makes the stackview to grow as well, therefore increasing the height and not respecting its height constraint. to solve this problem you need to force the imageview to not hug the content. you can do this by setting the content hugging priority of the imageview to `required` on the vertical axis, which tells the stack view: "hey, this imageview really needs to keep its height, don't mess with it". the code would look like this:

```swift
let stackView = UIStackView()
stackView.axis = .horizontal
stackView.spacing = 8
stackView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false

let imageView = UIImageView()
imageView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
imageView.image = UIImage(named: "some_image")
imageView.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit
imageView.backgroundColor = .gray
imageView.layer.cornerRadius = 8
imageView.clipsToBounds = true

stackView.addArrangedSubview(imageView)

//here are the height constraints that are not respected:
imageView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 50).isActive = true
//the following does not work as expected:
//imageView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalTo: imageView.heightAnchor).isActive = true
imageView.setContentHuggingPriority(.required, for: .vertical) // add this line!

view.addSubview(stackView)

//stackview constraints:
stackView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.topAnchor, constant: 20).isActive = true
stackView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.leadingAnchor, constant: 20).isActive = true
stackView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.trailingAnchor, constant: -20).isActive = true
```

**solution 2: setting a fixed width and height for the imageview**

sometimes, the most straight forward approach is the one you should start with. the stackview works as expected if it knows the size of the view. so if you set both height and width constraints for the imageview, you can achieve the desired effect, also setting the hugging content priority. it is important to define the imageview's width to avoid any issues, that is my preference. this approach avoids any ambiguity in sizing and provides the stackview with concrete dimensions to work with. the code would look like this:

```swift
let stackView = UIStackView()
stackView.axis = .horizontal
stackView.spacing = 8
stackView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false

let imageView = UIImageView()
imageView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
imageView.image = UIImage(named: "some_image")
imageView.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit
imageView.backgroundColor = .gray
imageView.layer.cornerRadius = 8
imageView.clipsToBounds = true

stackView.addArrangedSubview(imageView)

//here are the height constraints that are now respected:
imageView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 50).isActive = true
imageView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 50).isActive = true // add this line
imageView.setContentHuggingPriority(.required, for: .vertical) // add this line!


view.addSubview(stackView)

//stackview constraints:
stackView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.topAnchor, constant: 20).isActive = true
stackView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.leadingAnchor, constant: 20).isActive = true
stackView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.trailingAnchor, constant: -20).isActive = true
```

**solution 3: setting the stackview's alignment**

sometimes the issue is not the imageview but the stackview’s alignment itself. by default stackviews align its content to the center. therefore, setting the stackview alignment to the `leading` will help to control the height, and is the last resort. i usually do not like this solution, because it makes the stackview less flexible.

```swift
let stackView = UIStackView()
stackView.axis = .horizontal
stackView.spacing = 8
stackView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
stackView.alignment = .leading  // add this line

let imageView = UIImageView()
imageView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
imageView.image = UIImage(named: "some_image")
imageView.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit
imageView.backgroundColor = .gray
imageView.layer.cornerRadius = 8
imageView.clipsToBounds = true

stackView.addArrangedSubview(imageView)

//here are the height constraints that are not respected:
imageView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 50).isActive = true
//the following does not work as expected:
//imageView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalTo: imageView.heightAnchor).isActive = true
imageView.setContentHuggingPriority(.required, for: .vertical) // add this line!

view.addSubview(stackView)

//stackview constraints:
stackView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.topAnchor, constant: 20).isActive = true
stackView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.leadingAnchor, constant: 20).isActive = true
stackView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.trailingAnchor, constant: -20).isActive = true
```

**content mode considerations**

also, make sure the imageview’s content mode is set appropriately. if you're using `.scaleaspectfit` or `.scaleaspectfill`, the imageview will try to preserve the image's aspect ratio, which can sometimes seem like it's ignoring the height constraints if the image has a very different aspect ratio. in my case, it was the image's aspect ratio which was forcing the imageview to be bigger. that's why i usually add a fixed width and height when an imageview has problems like this, to avoid any ambiguity.

i’ve had my share of head-scratching moments with this, so don't worry, it’s a very common issue. it's all about understanding how stackviews want to work with their contents and making your constraints explicit, and sometimes its not the imageview, it's the stackview alignment, therefore, we have to explore other ways to solve it.

if you want to dive deeper, i recommend checking out apple’s official documentation on uistackview (which is, sadly, not very specific in these cases). also, there are some great chapters in "auto layout by tutorials" that can be beneficial. although it won't directly explain the specific issue, it offers a solid understanding on how stackviews work.

that's my two cents, and i hope this helps! happy coding.
