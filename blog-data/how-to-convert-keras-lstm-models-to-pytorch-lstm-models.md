Let’s tackle this conversion challenge. I’ve had a few run-ins with this very task, often when inheriting projects where the initial model choice needed a shift due to framework-specific performance needs or deployment constraints. Specifically, I recall a project back in '18, involving a fairly complex time-series prediction system, originally crafted in Keras and needing to migrate to PyTorch for better GPU utilization. The transition, while feasible, is definitely not a simple copy-paste job, and it requires a detailed understanding of how the underlying concepts are implemented in each library.

The primary hurdle isn’t the LSTM unit itself – both Keras and PyTorch implement similar mathematical underpinnings of LSTMs. It’s in the architectural representation, the way layers are defined, the handling of initial states, and how parameters are initialized and subsequently loaded. Keras, as a high-level API, often handles a lot of these details implicitly, whereas PyTorch, by contrast, provides more granular control and expects you to handle certain aspects explicitly.

Let's first consider the layer structures. In Keras, an LSTM layer might be declared as something like:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

keras_model = Sequential([
    LSTM(units=128, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(None, 10)),
    LSTM(units=64),
])
```

Here, ‘units’ dictates the number of LSTM cells in the layer, ‘return_sequences’ defines whether the layer outputs the whole sequence or only the last step output, and ‘input_shape’ specifies the structure of the input data.

Now, the PyTorch equivalent requires a bit more verbosity:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class LSTMModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size_1, hidden_size_2):
        super(LSTMModel, self).__init__()
        self.lstm1 = nn.LSTM(input_size=input_size, hidden_size=hidden_size_1, batch_first=True)
        self.lstm2 = nn.LSTM(input_size=hidden_size_1, hidden_size=hidden_size_2, batch_first=True)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm1(x)
        out, _ = self.lstm2(out)
        return out

pytorch_model = LSTMModel(input_size=10, hidden_size_1=128, hidden_size_2=64)
```

In PyTorch, the `nn.LSTM` module requires an `input_size`, which is the dimension of each element in the input sequence, and the layers are defined explicitly within a class that inherits from `nn.Module`. Notice also the `batch_first=True` parameter, which makes data input consistent with Keras, as by default, PyTorch LSTM assumes the batch dimension to be the second.

One key difference that needs careful handling is the management of state. Keras handles initial hidden and cell states implicitly. However, PyTorch requires you to either manage them or allow them to default to zero. Furthermore, after the initial state is defined it can be returned or ignored. This can be done by including or excluding an extra parameter from the method call. We can see in our `forward` function above that the second return from the methods are explicitly ignored with an underscore.

The parameter transfer process is where things can get tricky. Keras models store parameters in a specific structure, often within numpy arrays. PyTorch stores parameters as tensors. The process involves iterating through the named parameters of the Keras model and then creating corresponding tensors for the PyTorch model. Consider this illustrative (and simplified) example of how to transfer the weights:

```python
import numpy as np

def transfer_weights(keras_model, pytorch_model):
  # Assume keras_model and pytorch_model are the models as defined in previous example.
  # Assume the input_shape in Keras is already correctly specified.

  keras_lstm_layers = [layer for layer in keras_model.layers if isinstance(layer, LSTM)]

  for i, (keras_layer, pytorch_layer) in enumerate(zip(keras_lstm_layers, pytorch_model.children())):
      # weights have shape (input_size + hidden_size, 4 * hidden_size)
      keras_weights = keras_layer.get_weights()

      # PyTorch LSTM layer has these weights:
      #  - weight_ih: (4*hidden_size, input_size)
      #  - weight_hh: (4*hidden_size, hidden_size)
      #  - bias_ih: (4*hidden_size)
      #  - bias_hh: (4*hidden_size)
      # So, we have to reshape Keras weights.

      w_i, w_f, w_c, w_o = np.split(keras_weights[0], 4, axis=1)
      u_i, u_f, u_c, u_o = np.split(keras_weights[1], 4, axis=1)

      b_i, b_f, b_c, b_o = np.split(keras_weights[2], 4, axis=0)


      pytorch_layer.weight_ih.data = torch.from_numpy(np.concatenate((w_i, w_f, w_c, w_o),axis=1).transpose()).float()
      pytorch_layer.weight_hh.data = torch.from_numpy(np.concatenate((u_i, u_f, u_c, u_o),axis=1).transpose()).float()
      pytorch_layer.bias_ih.data = torch.from_numpy(np.concatenate((b_i, b_f, b_c, b_o))).float()
      pytorch_layer.bias_hh.data = torch.from_numpy(np.concatenate((b_i, b_f, b_c, b_o))).float()
  return pytorch_model

transfer_weights(keras_model, pytorch_model)
```

This illustrative snippet, while functional, does not yet handle bidirectional layers or other advanced features. It serves to underscore the importance of understanding the tensor structures within each framework. Additionally, the code assumes single-layered LSTMs. A more robust solution should be able to map various configurations. This also doesn't include biases, which you also have to transpose.

For more sophisticated models, this parameter transfer will become significantly more involved. Things like batch normalization, dropout layers, and other elements present in the complete model must be mapped appropriately. I’ve found a meticulous layer-by-layer comparison, often aided by writing small debugging snippets on the side to check shape compatibility, is the most effective strategy here. This can involve printing the shapes of weight tensors within each framework and making sure they're aligned, then performing a custom transposition if necessary.

Beyond just the model structure, you need to think about the data pipeline. Keras data loaders are different from PyTorch's `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, and so you need to adapt your data preprocessing and feeding mechanisms to align with PyTorch. This also means validating the inputs are shaped correctly before and after the conversion.

To further refine your understanding, I strongly suggest looking at “Deep Learning with Python” by François Chollet (the creator of Keras) for a deeper dive into Keras' internals and PyTorch documentation, particularly the `nn` module, which provides granular insights on the framework’s core neural network operations. Additionally, “Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning” by Ian Pointer is excellent for practical PyTorch implementation details. Understanding their internals helps navigate complexities, particularly when dealing with nuances like dropout and layer normalizations.

In summary, converting Keras LSTM models to PyTorch is not straightforward, but it’s manageable with a thorough grasp of both libraries, an understanding of tensor manipulations, and a rigorous approach to parameter transfer and layer configuration. This often ends up being a process of iterative refinement and testing until both models produce similar results given the same input. It’s a process that definitely builds character (and skill), I will say that much.
