Alright, let’s tackle this one. I’ve spent more hours than I’d like to recall wrestling with Altair visualizations, and layering charts with custom annotations, including footnotes, definitely brings its own set of unique challenges. It’s not a direct built-in feature, and that's often the case with the more nuanced aspects of visualization libraries. But don't despair; we can achieve the desired outcome with a bit of creative layering and understanding of Altair's encoding system. It’s less about a dedicated footnote function, and more about cleverly repurposing what is readily available.

My experience with this came from a project a few years back involving complex financial data. We needed to display several time series on the same plot, and to ensure clarity, certain data points required associated explanations. These weren’t simple labels; they needed to feel distinct from the main chart elements and were best placed as classic footnotes. Now, Altair doesn’t offer a `footnote` parameter, so we have to build our own mechanism.

The key idea involves using text mark layers, placed strategically at the bottom of the chart, and carefully aligned to appear as footnotes below the layered visualization. The process breaks down into three main steps: creating the layered chart, preparing the data for the footnotes, and finally, overlaying the text marks in the correct position.

Let's begin with a basic layered chart as a starting point. Imagine we are displaying trends for stock prices across two companies. Here is a snippet:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {
    'date': pd.to_datetime(['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03', '2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03']),
    'company': ['Company A', 'Company A', 'Company A', 'Company B', 'Company B', 'Company B'],
    'price': [100, 110, 105, 120, 125, 130]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)


# Base layered chart
base_chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_line().encode(
    x='date:T',
    y='price:Q',
    color='company:N'
).properties(
    title='Stock Prices'
)

base_chart
```

This code generates a simple line chart comparing two series. Now, let's say we want to add a footnote referencing a specific event on 2023-01-02 affecting Company A. We can't simply attach this to the plot, we need to think about this as a separate visual layer.

The next step is crafting the footnote data and corresponding text mark layers. This is where we strategically position these annotations. Crucially, we'll make use of the data transformation capabilities of Altair to make sure this works predictably. Here is the second snippet:

```python
# Footnote data
footnote_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x_coord': [df['date'].min()],  # Start at the left margin of the chart
    'y_coord': [df['price'].min() - (df['price'].max() - df['price'].min()) * 0.1], # position just below the chart
    'text': ['Note: Company A experienced a significant event on 2023-01-02']
})


# Footnote layer
footnote_layer = alt.Chart(footnote_data).mark_text(
    align='left',
    baseline='top',
    fontSize=10,
    color='gray',
    
).encode(
    x=alt.X('x_coord:T', axis=None),  # Hide the axis
    y=alt.Y('y_coord:Q', axis=None),  # Hide the axis
    text='text:N'
)

footnote_layer
```
Here, we're creating a data frame where `x_coord` represents a location along the horizontal axis which aligns with the left edge of our primary chart by selecting the minimum date, and `y_coord` sets the vertical positioning; we deliberately place this at the bottom using some logic to ensure its clear separation. The `text` column holds the note we intend to display. We're also creating a `mark_text` layer to render text strings from our created dataframe at each corresponding x,y coordinate, specifying font size, alignment and color. We explicitly remove the axes to avoid them cluttering the display. It's important to note that the vertical position of footnotes may need adjustment based on the ranges of your data, but we've added a margin which should help.

Finally, we’ll layer these elements. Altair makes this easy through the `+` operator to combine chart layers:

```python
# Combining chart and footnote
final_chart = base_chart + footnote_layer

final_chart
```

This final snippet combines our base chart and our footnote layer using `+`. Altair takes care of ordering these correctly; in this case, it positions the text at the bottom as expected. The resulting `final_chart` will now include our annotation and, importantly, look like a standard footnote.

It is essential to remember that the positioning of these footnotes might need tweaking based on the range of values in your main chart. The approach I’ve provided is a general template. For extremely dynamic data or when you have many footnotes, you might need to employ more robust strategies. For instance, you could calculate footnote position based on the height of the base chart dynamically, instead of a hardcoded multiple.

To deepen your understanding of this, I recommend looking at a few resources. "Interactive Data Visualization for the Web" by Scott Murray provides a solid foundation in data visualization principles, which is invaluable when working with libraries like Altair. For more specific details on Altair, the official Altair documentation is your best friend. Furthermore, "The Grammar of Graphics" by Leland Wilkinson explains the underlying principles of graphical representations, which helps immensely with crafting custom visualizations.

While Altair might not provide a direct ‘footnote’ command, by understanding its composable nature and employing the strategies discussed, you can effectively layer these crucial annotations into your visualizations. This level of granular control allows for much more precise communication and a more insightful visual narrative. Keep this pattern in your back pocket, it's very handy.
