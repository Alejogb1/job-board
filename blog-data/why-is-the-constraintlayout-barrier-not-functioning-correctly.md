,  I’ve definitely been down this road before, and constraintlayout’s barrier, while incredibly useful, can sometimes feel like it's playing hard to get. It's usually not a bug with the library itself, but rather a nuance in how it interprets our intentions given the current layout. Let me break down the common culprits and what I've learned to watch out for.

From my experience, a barrier's primary job is to create a virtual boundary based on the positions of referenced views. This boundary then constrains other views. When it doesn't behave as expected, it often stems from a few key issues: incorrect referencing, unexpected view visibility, or conflicts with other constraints within the layout. It's crucial to understand the mechanics – a barrier isn't just a visual line; it’s a dynamic construct that recalculates based on the referenced views' dimensions and visibility states.

The first, and perhaps most frequent, error involves incorrect referencing of views. Double-check your `constraint_referenced_ids` attribute in the barrier definition. If you are using a comma-separated list, make absolutely sure that each id corresponds to a valid view within the layout and that there are no typos. Further, make sure that these referenced views have actually had their positions determined, and that they have valid constraints. If one of the referenced views does not have a defined position, or has a zero dimension, the barrier may misbehave or fail entirely. Imagine trying to draw a boundary using a non-existent point. That’s a surprisingly common issue to stumble into.

Also, keep a close watch on visibility settings. A barrier will include a view in its calculation only if that view is visible (i.e., `view.visibility == View.VISIBLE`). If a referenced view is set to `GONE` or `INVISIBLE`, the barrier will completely ignore it for its boundary calculation, which can lead to layout surprises if the visibility of these items changes programmatically.

Let's illustrate this with some basic Android code examples, focusing on XML layout snippets. Suppose we have a layout that is meant to display some text alongside an image, and we want a button to always appear to the right of that composite view. The intent here is to use a barrier. Let’s see the issues that could arise:

**Example 1: Incorrect Referencing**

```xml
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/myText"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Some long text here"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />

    <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/myImage"
        android:layout_width="50dp"
        android:layout_height="50dp"
        android:src="@drawable/my_image"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf="@id/myText"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />

   <androidx.constraintlayout.widget.Barrier
        android:id="@+id/myBarrier"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:barrierDirection="end"
        app:constraint_referenced_ids="myText,my_imge"/>

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/myButton"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Click Me"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf="@+id/myBarrier"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />


</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

In this example, `my_imge` is a typo; it should be `myImage`. The barrier will most likely ignore this erroneous id, resulting in unexpected placement of the button, and perhaps in the barrier just collapsing. This is a straightforward error, but remarkably easy to miss during rapid development. Always double-check the ids you’ve assigned and verify their accuracy.

**Example 2: Visibility Conflicts**

```xml
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/myText"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Another piece of long text."
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />

    <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/myImage"
        android:layout_width="50dp"
        android:layout_height="50dp"
        android:src="@drawable/my_image"
        android:visibility="gone"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf="@id/myText"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />


    <androidx.constraintlayout.widget.Barrier
        android:id="@+id/myBarrier"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:barrierDirection="end"
        app:constraint_referenced_ids="myText,myImage"/>

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/myButton"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Click Me"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf="@+id/myBarrier"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

Here, `myImage` is set to `gone`. The barrier will therefore only consider the bounding box of `myText`. The button will then be placed directly adjacent to the end of text rather than after the image’s allocated space. This might not be immediately obvious unless you're very aware of how the visibility state affects the barrier’s calculations. It's important to be careful, especially when the visibility changes are dynamic.

**Example 3: Constraint Conflicts and Layout Size**

```xml
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">


        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/myText"
            android:layout_width="200dp"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:text="A very, very long text"
            app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
            app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
            app:layout_constraintEnd_toStartOf="@id/myImage"

            />


        <ImageView
            android:id="@+id/myImage"
            android:layout_width="50dp"
            android:layout_height="50dp"
            android:src="@drawable/my_image"
            app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
            app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />

    <androidx.constraintlayout.widget.Barrier
        android:id="@+id/myBarrier"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:barrierDirection="end"
        app:constraint_referenced_ids="myText,myImage"/>

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/myButton"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Click Me"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf="@+id/myBarrier"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />


</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

In this third snippet, the `TextView` is constrained both to the start and end of the layout, but with an explicit width, which in some circumstances can lead to conflict as the text will always try to fill the defined space. Further, the text and the image are constrained to end up to the opposite sides of the layout. This setup can create a situation where the barrier will get its calculation from the defined fixed width of the text and not dynamically. This behavior can also change based on text length and the actual display size. This shows that we should always carefully think about how we want our view layout to actually happen, and which element we want to drive our barrier.

To dive deeper into the complexities of constraintlayout and especially the nuances of `barrier` behavior, I strongly suggest exploring the resources from the android developer documentation. The official documentation offers an in-depth explanation on the internals of constraintlayout. Additionally, a book such as "Programming Android" by Zigurd Mednieks et al. offers thorough explanations into how android layouts work, which could help in troubleshooting. Furthermore, for more advanced theoretical knowledge about layout systems and constraint solvers, you might find it useful to research papers on the Cassowary algorithm, which is commonly used in UI layout calculations. This algorithm, while not specific to android, is highly relevant for understanding the mechanics of how constraint layout solvers work.

In my experience, when facing layout misbehaviors, a good starting point is always to simplify, verify each view's constraint and visibility state, and understand the order of calculations. The barrier is a powerful tool, but like all such tools, it benefits from careful and deliberate use. Good luck.
