Okay, let's tackle this. It's a situation I've encountered numerous times, especially since the shift towards more modular javascript architectures in Rails applications. Back in the early days of adopting Turbo, Importmaps, and Stimulus together, I remember wrestling with this exact problem – how to gracefully load javascript functions specific to only certain pages. It's not enough to just dump all your javascript into one global file; that quickly becomes unmanageable. Here's how I've found works well, along with some crucial design decisions you’ll need to make.

The core challenge here is that Turbo doesn’t perform full page reloads. It replaces specific parts of the DOM, and because of this, traditionally loaded javascript files might not re-execute when those changes happen. So, instead of relying on something like `<script src="...">` tags embedded in your HTML which load at page render, you need a mechanism that's aware of Turbo’s navigation. Importmaps, coupled with Stimulus, offer a fantastic approach to this. Let’s break it down.

First off, importmaps provides the necessary link between your javascript module names and their file locations. Think of them as the mapping table that the browser uses to find the appropriate javascript code. It lets you refer to your modules with concise names instead of lengthy file paths. For instance, you might have an importmap that looks something like this (in your `config/importmap.rb`):

```ruby
pin "@rails/ujs", to: "https://ga.jspm.io/npm:@rails/ujs@7.0.6/lib/assets/compiled/rails-ujs.js"
pin "@hotwired/turbo-rails", to: "turbo.min.js"
pin "application", to: "application.js"
pin "controllers", to: "controllers/index.js"
pin "my_page_scripts", to: "my_page_scripts.js" # Example for specific page
```

This tells the browser that "my_page_scripts" points to `app/javascript/my_page_scripts.js`. It also defines where the other core rails libraries are. Crucially, you can add multiple such mappings, as needed, based on your app’s structure.

Now, the real work happens within Stimulus. It's here where we orchestrate the dynamic loading of javascript. We will leverage a concept I often call "page controllers." The idea is that each distinct page (or a section that requires unique behavior) has its own dedicated Stimulus controller. Within this controller, we can conditionally load the page-specific javascript modules we've defined in our importmap.

Here's a basic example of what your base `application.js` might look like:

```javascript
// app/javascript/application.js

import "@hotwired/turbo-rails"
import "./controllers"
```

Notice that we only import the controllers – this is a standard Stimulus setup. Now for the key part: how you actually load the page-specific code. I've found the best way to manage this is through a common controller that other more specific page controllers can inherit from. This approach makes the code cleaner. Let's first create a base controller:

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/base_controller.js

import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  async loadModule(moduleName) {
      try {
        const module = await import(moduleName);
        if(module && module.default){
          module.default.start(this.element); // This is our custom starter
        } else if (module){
          console.error(`Module ${moduleName} did not export a default object or was empty`);
        } else{
          console.error(`Could not import module ${moduleName}`);
        }

      } catch(error) {
         console.error(`Failed to load module ${moduleName}:`, error);
      }
  }
}
```

This `base_controller` provides a utility function to import and then start a module. Note the try/catch block – this is important for handling potential loading errors gracefully. The `module.default.start(this.element)` assumes you're using a class structure in your specific module with a `start()` method and pass it the context of the calling controller's element. This way we can scope elements using css selectors within the context of the controller's root element. Now for one of the page-specific controllers, extending this base controller:

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/my_page_controller.js

import BaseController from "./base_controller"

export default class extends BaseController {
  connect() {
     super.connect();
     this.loadModule("my_page_scripts");
  }
}
```

Here, in the `connect` method, after calling the parent's `connect` method, we use the `loadModule` function and tell it to load "my_page_scripts", which we previously defined in `importmap.rb`. This will, asynchronously, load `app/javascript/my_page_scripts.js`.

Finally, here's a basic example for `app/javascript/my_page_scripts.js`:

```javascript
// app/javascript/my_page_scripts.js
export default class MyPageScripts {
  static start(element) {
    console.log("My page scripts are now running!");
    const mySpecialElement = element.querySelector(".my-special-element")
    if(mySpecialElement){
      // Do something specific here, related to this page
      mySpecialElement.style.backgroundColor="red";
    }

  }
}
```
This module does not export anything directly, rather it has a static method called start that uses an element as the context.

Now, to make it all work, in your view, you need a wrapper element with your Stimulus controller definition. Assuming we are working in rails, this would look something like this:

```erb
<div data-controller="my-page">
  <p>This is my special page</p>
  <div class="my-special-element">This should turn red</div>
</div>
```

This sets up Stimulus to instantiate the `MyPageController` when the DOM is loaded, which will in turn trigger the asynchronous import of our module.

A few important things to consider:

*   **Error Handling:** As demonstrated, error handling is critical, especially when loading javascript modules asynchronously. Ensure you have proper `try...catch` blocks and log errors appropriately.
*   **Code Organization:** I’ve found it invaluable to use explicit naming conventions for controllers and modules. This makes your javascript structure much easier to navigate as the application scales. I typically follow a pattern similar to my examples, using a singular page name for each controller.
*   **Code Splitting:** Think about using more specific controllers or modules if you have a large page that does lots of things. This can increase performance on initial page loads.
*   **Turbo Events:** if you need more granular control, you can tap into Turbo's life cycle events, such as `turbo:before-render`, `turbo:load` etc. This might be helpful for more complex scenarios.
*   **Testing:** Unit testing each page specific module independently is ideal, while integration testing should make sure that each controller and module all work properly with Turbo.

For further exploration, I would highly recommend delving into:

*   "Agile Web Development with Rails 7" by Sam Ruby, David Bryant Copeland, and Dave Thomas. It provides an excellent overview of the modern Rails ecosystem and the integration of these technologies.
*   The official Turbo documentation by Hotwire. It will give you the authoritative overview on how turbo works.
*   The official Stimulus documentation by Hotwire. You'll find a plethora of information there on how to use controllers and make them more performant.
*   The ECMAScript specification, particularly on dynamic `import()` syntax for modules. It is important to understand the underlying technology and semantics of javascript modules.

This approach, in my experience, provides a robust and maintainable way to load page-specific Javascript functionality in a modern Rails application using Turbo, ImportMaps, and Stimulus. It keeps code modular and avoids the potential for conflicts or performance issues associated with global JavaScript. Remember to tailor it to the specific needs and complexity of your application.
