alright, let's break down why deploying a smart contract on a private ethereum blockchain still costs gas, even though calling its functions might not. i've been around the block a few times with this, so i'll try to give you the straight dope from my experience, with some code to make it clearer.

first off, think about what deployment actually is. you’re not just copying some text into the blockchain, you're executing code which creates a new contract address and saves the bytecode (the machine readable version of your contract) to the chain. this write operation involves all the validators on the network confirming that a new piece of code now exists and has a unique address, and every single node in the network needs to do this. this is resource intensive, similar to installing a program on every computer on a network.

now the contract invocation, or calling a function, that's a different ball game. you are using the already installed, the already deployed contract. you are sending a transaction that tells the nodes: hey, run this piece of code and change the value of a variable or call some methods. the code is there. it just needs to execute, this is a smaller task with less resource consumption on the blockchain.

let's use a very basic contract to illustrate, think of it like setting up a digital vending machine.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 public storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

when you deploy the `simplestorage` contract, you're actually doing something like this under the hood: all of the solidity code is being converted to bytecode and then sent to the ethereum virtual machine (evm). it's not human-readable, more like: "0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b5060f48061001f6000396000f3fe". you aren't actually seeing this, but this is what is on the blockchain, this operation consumes gas because it takes computation and storage. every node has to include this bytecode in its ledger.

calling the `set` or `get` function, it doesn't require all that, you're just sending a transaction with an address of where your contract is on the blockchain (which was already done in the deployment), the function to be executed and any parameters needed. it is much simpler, less resource intensive and therefore costs very little gas in comparison, and on a private chain if gas is free or near free, it can cost zero.

now, regarding your private network. even if you have it running on your own computer, the ethereum network is still operating on the rules of the evm. the evm has set resource limits for operations, and you still need to pay the gas, this keeps the chain stable, ensures fair resource usage and prevents any malicious or accidental overloading of the network. even if it's just you in the network, the gas limits are there to ensure proper operations. the gas pricing can be free or close to it though, as i mentioned, but the gas consumption still happens because the operation takes resources.

when i first started out, i recall having a private test network running, thinking that if there were just me the deployment of the contract should be instant and free. well, it wasn't. i kept getting these errors and confusing gas estimates that did not reflect free deployment, i eventually had to go back to the books to understand why. it is because under the hood, the nodes are still calculating and processing each instruction on the chain and that still needs a cost associated with it. it doesn't matter if the price is zero or almost zero, it still consumes gas units. and even if the price is zero, they need a price unit attached to them to be executed by the evm. the concept of gas is an integral part of how ethereum is built.

to hammer it home, let’s look at how transactions are structured on the chain.

```javascript
// example of a deployment transaction
{
    "from": "0x123abc...",
    "nonce": "0x0",
    "gas": "0x1412f",  // the maximum amount of gas we allow this transaction to consume
    "gasPrice": "0x4a817c800",  // the price per unit of gas
    "data": "0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b5060f48061001f6000396000f3fe..." // the compiled contract bytecode
}

// example of a function call
{
    "from": "0x123abc...",
    "nonce": "0x1",
    "to": "0x456def...", // contract address
    "gas": "0x1412f",
    "gasPrice": "0x4a817c800",
    "data": "0xa413682a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005" // function signature and params
}
```

notice that both have a `gas` and `gasPrice`. the transaction that calls the contract function is smaller and the evm can execute it quicker because the contract already exists, the deployment is a more complex process. it involves writing a larger data chunk and performing multiple complex operations on the network.

for example, i was once working on a smart contract for a simple auction system. deploying it the first time was costly in gas. but afterwards, the bid and withdraw functions were much cheaper, nearly free, to call on our private network. it really drove home the difference in effort the blockchain had to go through.

now for the resources you asked for, if you want to get a deeper understanding of the evm and gas mechanics, you should look for the ethereum yellow paper. it’s the go-to document for the technical details of how ethereum works, although it’s quite heavy. for a more approachable view, i suggest the book "mastering ethereum" by andreas m. antonopoulos and gavin wood. it covers these fundamentals in a much easier and more practical way. those were the go-to guides i used when figuring this stuff out and i still go back to them when things get confusing.

finally, just remember, even in your private little blockchain sandbox, the underlying mechanics of ethereum still operate. deployment has overhead and requires writing large chunks of data to the ledger and setting it up, invoking just tells the network to run the code, and is a simpler, faster process. it's like the difference between building a house and just walking through its front door.

i hope this is useful, feel free to ask if there is anything else that is not clear. oh, and how do programmers celebrate? they make a commit-ment.
