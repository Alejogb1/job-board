Alright, let’s tackle this. Encountering an object rendered as text in a Rails 7 application is a surprisingly common hiccup, and I've debugged more than a few of these situations over the years. It almost always boils down to how Rails is interpreting the data you're passing to your view. I can recall a particularly frustrating incident back in 2021 where a complex data structure was showing up on a user's profile page as just "[#<User:0x000000012345678>]". Not very user-friendly, to say the least!

The core issue stems from the default behavior of Rails when it encounters an object that it doesn't know how to explicitly handle during the rendering process. In essence, when Rails tries to display something in a view template (be it `.erb`, `.haml`, or any other view file), it needs to convert the data into a string. When it hits an object and the method `to_s` or a similar string coercion method hasn't been explicitly defined or overridden, Ruby's default object representation is used. That's the "[#<Class:MemoryAddress>]" output you're seeing—the object's class name and its memory location.

There are a few primary reasons why this happens. One common scenario is a simple misunderstanding of variable scope and what data is available within the view context. Another stems from a lack of explicit formatting of the data before passing it to the view, and sometimes it's down to trying to pass a complex object directly rather than a scalar or formatted value. And less frequently, there might be an underlying issue related to method overriding or custom helper methods. Let's consider each of these with examples to clarify.

**Scenario 1: Direct Object Passing and Incorrect View Rendering**

Let's imagine we've got a controller action that fetches a user:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

And the associated view, `app/views/users/show.html.erb` contains this:

```erb
<p>User Details: <%= @user %></p>
```

In this example, we're directly passing the `@user` object to the `<%= %>` block. Rails doesn't know *which* attributes of this `User` object you intend to display. As a result, it's likely to print something like the aforementioned `[#<User:0x000000012345678>]`. The correction is to explicitly access and display the attributes you want.

Here's the corrected view code that addresses the problem:

```erb
<p>User Name: <%= @user.name %></p>
<p>User Email: <%= @user.email %></p>
```

This directly uses the object's methods to produce formatted output for each relevant attribute.

**Scenario 2: Unformatted Data Structures**

Consider a scenario where your controller action attempts to pass a more complex data structure. Suppose you're dealing with an array of user objects from a database query:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @users = User.all
  end
end
```

And your view, `app/views/users/index.html.erb`, contains something like this:

```erb
<p>All Users: <%= @users %></p>
```

Again, we are encountering the same problem. We are attempting to render an array of objects in the view directly. Rails will default to calling `.to_s` on the array, which will provide you with a similar output to the single object example, not the actual list of user details.

Here is a correct version that uses looping and also illustrates more specific formatting:

```erb
<p>User List:</p>
<ul>
  <% @users.each do |user| %>
    <li><%= user.name %> (<%= user.email %>)</li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

Here, we iterate through the `@users` array, extracting and formatting the `name` and `email` attributes for each `User` object. This resolves the text rendering issue by providing a formatted output.

**Scenario 3: Custom Objects and Lack of Explicit String Conversion**

Finally, consider you have a custom Ruby object, not necessarily an ActiveRecord model:

```ruby
class CustomData
  attr_accessor :value_a, :value_b

  def initialize(value_a, value_b)
    @value_a = value_a
    @value_b = value_b
  end
end

# Controller code
def show
  @data = CustomData.new("Hello", "World")
end
```

And your view attempts to render it directly again:

```erb
<p>Custom Data: <%= @data %></p>
```

The view will once again produce the object's default string representation. To handle this correctly you need to either override the `to_s` method of the `CustomData` class or explicitly format the content in the view.

Here is the approach that modifies the class and also provides a helper method in a view helper for formatting:

```ruby
# app/models/custom_data.rb
class CustomData
  attr_accessor :value_a, :value_b

  def initialize(value_a, value_b)
    @value_a = value_a
    @value_b = value_b
  end

  def to_s
    "Value A: #{value_a}, Value B: #{value_b}"
  end
end

# app/helpers/application_helper.rb
module ApplicationHelper
  def format_custom_data(custom_data)
     "Formatted Value A: #{custom_data.value_a}, Formatted Value B: #{custom_data.value_b}"
  end
end

# Corresponding view
<p>Custom Data (Method on Class): <%= @data %></p>
<p>Custom Data (Helper Method): <%= format_custom_data(@data) %></p>
```
Here, we've added a `to_s` method to `CustomData`, defining a preferred string representation and also included the helper method in the ApplicationHelper to show multiple ways of handling complex object formatting. This resolves the issues with complex objects rendering as text.

**Recommendations for Further Study**

To improve your understanding and ability to debug these issues, I highly recommend exploring the following resources. Firstly, for a deep dive into the mechanics of view rendering in Rails, I would suggest referring to the official Rails Guides, specifically the sections on “Layouts and Rendering in Rails.” These documents detail the rendering pipeline and the various options available for handling data in views. Also, “Agile Web Development with Rails 7” by Sam Ruby et al. offers a comprehensive guide and includes practical solutions for formatting data and views.

Furthermore, if you want to dig deeper into the core concepts of object-oriented programming in Ruby, the book “Eloquent Ruby” by Russ Olsen is invaluable. It will strengthen your grasp of how Ruby objects behave, particularly the default `to_s` method and how to override it appropriately. Additionally, learning more about helper methods in Rails is beneficial, and there are plenty of useful articles and tutorials that will help.

In summary, seeing objects rendering as text in your Rails app often stems from the application not knowing *how* to display that particular object type. By understanding the implicit type conversion and ensuring that you are passing the correct data to the view formatted as strings, you can avoid a lot of these problems. The key is to be explicit with what you intend to display in the view and to ensure each object you pass can be rendered properly as strings, either using methods of the object, explicit formatting or Rails helper methods.
