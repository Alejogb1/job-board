, let's tackle this one. Retrieving added calendars using the Outlook Calendar API, or Microsoft Graph as it’s now predominantly known, is a task I've encountered countless times. It's not always as straightforward as one might initially think, particularly when dealing with shared calendars, resource calendars, or calendars that have been added through various methods. I recall a particularly intricate project a few years back where we were integrating our scheduling system with a client’s Outlook setup, and this was a core hurdle. The experience forced me to really understand the nuances of the API and different user scenarios.

At its heart, retrieving calendars involves querying the Graph API endpoints using appropriate permissions. The fundamental endpoint you’ll be working with is `/users/{id | userPrincipalName}/calendars`. The user ID or principal name is crucial here, as you’re retrieving calendars associated with a *specific* user. A common mistake is assuming the authenticated user’s calendars will be returned without explicitly specifying them. We've definitely seen that cause some confusion in the past.

Now, the 'added' part of the question implies not just the user’s primary calendar, but also any other calendars the user has subscribed to, or had shared with them. These calendars reside in different categories, and accessing them requires a careful understanding of the response structure and filters.

Firstly, let’s consider a straightforward scenario: retrieving all calendars belonging directly to a user. This usually involves a simple GET request. Here’s how that might look in Python using the Microsoft Graph SDK:

```python
from msgraph import GraphServiceClient
from requests import HTTPError

def get_user_calendars(user_id, client):
  """Retrieves all calendars for a given user using MS Graph API."""
  try:
      calendars_endpoint = f"/users/{user_id}/calendars"
      result = client.get(calendars_endpoint)
      if result and result.get("value"):
          return result["value"]
      else:
          return []  # No calendars found
  except HTTPError as e:
      print(f"Error retrieving calendars: {e}")
      return []

# Example Usage (replace with actual values)
# Assuming you have client as a GraphServiceClient object authenticated
# and user_principal_name is a string representing the user's email
# user_id = "some_user_id"
# calendars = get_user_calendars(user_id, client)
# if calendars:
#   for calendar in calendars:
#      print(f"Calendar Name: {calendar['name']}, ID: {calendar['id']}")

```

This snippet queries for all calendars directly associated with the given `user_id`. Notice the error handling implemented using a `try...except` block; this is crucial for production environments. The function returns a list of calendar dictionaries, each containing details like the calendar name, ID, and other properties.

However, simply querying `/users/{user_id}/calendars` might not return *every* calendar the user has access to. Shared calendars often require another approach. These calendars aren't directly owned by the user, but are accessible because they’ve been granted permissions. To get those, we generally need to utilize the `calendarView` or specific permission delegations that would enable the application to access events and calendars to which the user has access.

Here's a slightly more advanced snippet that attempts to retrieve *all* calendars visible to the user, including shared ones. To get the calendars for a user, you typically will need to use the `calendarView` of the user, which will also give the user access to shared calendars if they have delegated access:

```python
from msgraph import GraphServiceClient
from requests import HTTPError
import datetime

def get_all_visible_calendars(user_id, client):
  """Retrieves all visible calendars, including shared, for a given user using MS Graph API."""
  all_calendars = []
  try:
    today = datetime.date.today()
    start_date = today.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00Z")
    end_date = (today + datetime.timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00Z")

    calendars_endpoint = f"/users/{user_id}/calendarView?startDateTime={start_date}&endDateTime={end_date}"

    result = client.get(calendars_endpoint)
    if result and result.get("value"):
        # Extract unique calendar IDs from events
        calendar_ids = set()
        for event in result["value"]:
          if 'calendar' in event:
              calendar_id = event['calendar']['id']
              calendar_ids.add(calendar_id)

        # Fetch detailed calendar information
        for calendar_id in calendar_ids:
            calendar_details_endpoint = f"/users/{user_id}/calendars/{calendar_id}"
            calendar_result = client.get(calendar_details_endpoint)
            if calendar_result:
                all_calendars.append(calendar_result)

    return all_calendars

  except HTTPError as e:
      print(f"Error retrieving all calendars: {e}")
      return []

# Example Usage (replace with actual values)
# Assuming you have client as a GraphServiceClient object authenticated
# and user_principal_name is a string representing the user's email
# user_id = "some_user_id"
# all_calendars = get_all_visible_calendars(user_id, client)
# if all_calendars:
#   for calendar in all_calendars:
#       print(f"Calendar Name: {calendar['name']}, ID: {calendar['id']}")
```

In this revised snippet, we're retrieving all the events within a single day for the calendar view and extracting the unique calendar identifiers. We then use this to fetch the calendar details from the endpoint `/users/{user_id}/calendars/{calendar_id}`. The `calendarView` endpoint essentially provides a glimpse at events and the associated calendar; we can extrapolate the calendars from here. This handles the cases with the additional shared calendars that we initially struggled to get on that past project.

Finally, consider delegated permissions. When an application needs to access calendar data on behalf of a user, it needs the appropriate permissions. These permissions typically involve a scope such as `Calendars.Read` or `Calendars.ReadWrite`. The way you authenticate with the API will depend on your application's specific requirements and the desired level of access.

Here is a simplified example of how to add delegated permissions when authenticating:
```python
from msal import ConfidentialClientApplication

def get_graph_client_with_delegated_permissions(tenant_id, client_id, client_secret, scopes, username):

    authority = f"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}"
    app = ConfidentialClientApplication(
        client_id,
        authority=authority,
        client_credential=client_secret
    )
    result = app.acquire_token_by_username_password(username=username, password="your_password", scopes=scopes) # Ensure to add correct scopes
    if "access_token" in result:
        return GraphServiceClient(access_token=result["access_token"])
    else:
        print(result.get("error"))
        print(result.get("error_description"))
        print(result.get("correlation_id"))
        return None


# Example Usage (replace with actual values)
# Assuming that your values are already stored in your environment,
# you do not want to store them directly within your script.
# tenant_id = "your_tenant_id"
# client_id = "your_client_id"
# client_secret = "your_client_secret"
# scopes = ["Calendars.Read", "User.Read"]  # Delegated permissions scope
# username = "your_user_principal_name"
#
# graph_client = get_graph_client_with_delegated_permissions(tenant_id, client_id, client_secret, scopes, username)
#
# if graph_client:
#  # Your Graph API operations using graph_client
#  user_id = "some_user_id"
#  all_calendars = get_all_visible_calendars(user_id, graph_client)
#  if all_calendars:
#    for calendar in all_calendars:
#      print(f"Calendar Name: {calendar['name']}, ID: {calendar['id']}")
```

This example uses the `msal` library to handle authentication with delegated permissions. The scope `Calendars.Read` allows the application to read calendar data on behalf of the user. You can adapt this to other needed scopes.

For a deeper understanding of authentication, I highly recommend reviewing the official Microsoft Graph documentation and the Microsoft Identity Platform documentation. A good resource is "Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions" by Michael Collier, which covers many of these nuances. Additionally, "Microsoft Graph Fundamentals" by Maarten van Stam provides a comprehensive overview of the Graph API capabilities. The Microsoft documentation itself offers examples for many programming languages, and I strongly recommend starting there. It also covers other common scenarios, including filtering, expansion and pagination which is crucial when working with real-world data. Remember, working with the Outlook Calendar API or Microsoft Graph requires not just a technical understanding of API calls, but a clear grasp of the different authorization flows and permissions models. It is crucial that all users' data is handled securely and within the confines of their permission scopes. This ensures the protection of sensitive calendar information.

Navigating these complexities is part of the daily grind, and having practical experience with similar challenges provides valuable insights into real-world solutions. I hope this information and the examples help you along the way.
