Let’s unpack this. Connection resets within a Tokio `select!` block, especially when the peer initiates them, are a notoriously thorny issue. I've spent a good chunk of my career troubleshooting these, usually when pushing network services to their limits. It's rarely a single cause, but rather a convergence of subtle behaviors at various layers. Based on past debugging sessions, let me offer some key insights and common culprits, along with illustrative code.

First, understand that a ‘reset by peer’ usually indicates a TCP `RST` packet was received. This isn't a graceful shutdown; it’s an abrupt termination of the connection. When we’re talking about `select!` with Tokio, this typically manifests when one or more of the futures being polled by `select!` is dealing with network operations – reads, writes, accepts – and the external end of the connection decides to shut the connection down hard, for whatever reason.

The core of the problem when observed in a `select!` context often lies in how these different futures interact and, crucially, how we handle errors. A seemingly innocuous error in one branch might unknowingly propagate to trigger a cascade effect that leads to a reset.

Let's consider a common scenario: a server handling concurrent connections. Let's say we have a `select!` that waits on incoming data from several clients and, potentially, some internal signal. If one client disconnects unexpectedly, it's easy for an unchecked error on the read future to propagate and, as a side effect, interfere with other client connections. This is especially pronounced if you're not meticulously handling shutdown sequences and cancellation signals.

Here’s a simplified, but illustrative, code example:

```rust
use tokio::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream};
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};
use tokio::select;

async fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 1024];

    loop {
      select! {
        read_result = stream.read(&mut buffer) => {
          let bytes_read = read_result?;
            if bytes_read == 0 {
                println!("Client disconnected.");
                break;
            }
            println!("Received: {:?}", &buffer[..bytes_read]);
            //Process or echo data
            stream.write_all(&buffer[..bytes_read]).await?;

        },
        _ = tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(60)) => {
             println!("Connection timed out");
             break;
        }
      }
    }

  Ok(())
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;

    loop {
        let (stream, _) = listener.accept().await?;
        tokio::spawn(async move {
           if let Err(e) = handle_connection(stream).await {
                eprintln!("Error handling connection: {}", e);
           }
        });
    }
}
```

In this example, a client closing the connection cleanly (using a FIN packet) would result in the `stream.read` returning zero bytes, thus breaking the `loop` and cleanly exiting the `handle_connection` function. But what if the client suddenly disappears, or loses network connection? This is where we’ll see the `reset by peer`, resulting from a tcp `RST` packet. The `stream.read` operation will fail with an `std::io::Error`, which we would propagate (using the `?` operator). In this simplified snippet, we've opted to gracefully handle the error by logging it using `eprintln!` and not doing anything further (dropping the future, which will stop the spawned task). In a real-world scenario, this might cause cascading issues if there is some shared state between all tasks. Without explicitly handling it, this `io::Error` (caused by `RST`) would usually bubble up and become the reason the whole future returned with an `Err` variant.

The solution? Explicit error handling with a specific focus on handling `std::io::ErrorKind::ConnectionReset`. We need to check the error type and handle it accordingly without propagating it too high up the stack.

Let's modify the `handle_connection` function for an error handling improvement:

```rust
async fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 1024];

    loop {
      select! {
        read_result = stream.read(&mut buffer) => {
            match read_result {
              Ok(bytes_read) => {
                 if bytes_read == 0 {
                    println!("Client disconnected (cleanly).");
                    break;
                 }
                 println!("Received: {:?}", &buffer[..bytes_read]);
                  //Process or echo data
                 if let Err(e) = stream.write_all(&buffer[..bytes_read]).await {
                        eprintln!("Error writing data: {}", e);
                         break; // Or handle write errors differently
                   }
               },
               Err(e) => {
                    if e.kind() == std::io::ErrorKind::ConnectionReset {
                       println!("Client reset connection.");
                        break; // Handle RST gracefully
                    } else {
                        eprintln!("Read error: {}", e);
                        break;
                   }
              }
            }


        },
        _ = tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(60)) => {
            println!("Connection timed out");
            break;
       }
      }
    }
  Ok(())
}
```

Here we are explicitly checking the error kind of `stream.read` and if it is `std::io::ErrorKind::ConnectionReset`, we handle it explicitly without propagating the error. This avoids a cascading failure that could inadvertently trigger an issue with other concurrent futures. The write operation is also checked for failures and handled.

Another common cause of peer resets, specifically in the `select!` context, is the use of shared mutable state without proper synchronization. For instance, if a shared resource (like a global buffer) is being accessed by multiple futures concurrently, data races might lead to unexpected behavior, potentially leading to a server sending a `RST`. While less directly correlated with `select!` itself, the race condition might become visible due to the way multiple futures become scheduled.

Let's illustrate this with a contrived example, which highlights the problem but is not a recommended practice:

```rust
use tokio::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream};
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};
use std::sync::Mutex;
use tokio::select;

static SHARED_BUFFER: Mutex<Vec<u8>> = Mutex::new(Vec::new()); // BAD PRACTICE

async fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 1024];

    loop {
        select! {
            read_result = stream.read(&mut buffer) => {
                match read_result {
                   Ok(bytes_read) => {
                       if bytes_read == 0 {
                            println!("Client disconnected.");
                            break;
                        }
                         {
                            let mut shared_buffer = SHARED_BUFFER.lock().unwrap();
                            shared_buffer.extend_from_slice(&buffer[..bytes_read]);
                         }

                       //Process or echo data
                        if let Err(e) = stream.write_all(&buffer[..bytes_read]).await {
                            eprintln!("Error writing data: {}", e);
                            break; // Or handle write errors differently
                        }

                   },
                    Err(e) => {
                        if e.kind() == std::io::ErrorKind::ConnectionReset {
                            println!("Client reset connection.");
                            break; // Handle RST gracefully
                        } else {
                            eprintln!("Read error: {}", e);
                            break;
                        }
                   }
                }

            },
             _ = tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(60)) => {
                 println!("Connection timed out");
                  break;
            }
        }

    }
  Ok(())
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;

    loop {
        let (stream, _) = listener.accept().await?;
        tokio::spawn(async move {
           if let Err(e) = handle_connection(stream).await {
                eprintln!("Error handling connection: {}", e);
           }
        });
    }
}
```

In this overly-simplified example, multiple connections will be writing into the same `SHARED_BUFFER` which is protected by a `Mutex`. In a real-world server, this might be a database connection or a shared cache. While the `Mutex` does protect against data corruption, the overhead of blocking and unblocking might create a performance bottleneck. This performance degradation can sometimes trigger TCP timeouts leading to `RST` packets. A more robust solution would use channels or actors for message passing, thus eliminating the need for shared mutable state in the first place. The main problem we see here is the added latency when using shared mutable state, which might result in an application timeout at either end of the connection, and therefore a peer reset.

For in-depth understanding of these concepts, I would recommend looking into "Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API" by W. Richard Stevens for a thorough treatment of networking, focusing on the low-level details of tcp. For understanding concurrent programming and using Tokio specifically, "Zero to Production in Rust" by Luca Palmieri offers solid practical advice, including patterns to avoid common error scenarios. In addition, "Programming Rust" by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora F.S. Tindall also provides an in-depth explanation of Rust's error handling mechanisms and async programming which are crucial to properly diagnose these kinds of issues. Finally, the Tokio documentation itself, accessible at tokio.rs, is the ultimate source of truth for understanding the nuances of its async runtime. I hope this extended explanation helps clarify the challenges of peer resets in a `select!` context and provides a practical approach to debugging.
