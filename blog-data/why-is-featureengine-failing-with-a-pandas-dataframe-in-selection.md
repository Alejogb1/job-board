Okay, let's delve into why you might be encountering issues with `feature_engine` when selecting columns within a pandas dataframe. I've personally run into similar snags more than a few times, so I understand the frustration. Often, it's not a straightforward bug but rather a confluence of factors related to how `feature_engine` expects input data, and the way pandas dataframes behave, especially when dealing with nuanced selection mechanisms.

First, it’s crucial to understand that `feature_engine`'s transformers aren’t directly vectorized operations on the whole dataframe, like some pandas methods. Instead, they're generally designed to operate on specific columns at a time, or in some cases, groups of specified columns. When selection seems to fail, it often boils down to a mismatch between what the transformer expects and what you're providing as input.

One common issue stems from the way `feature_engine` validates column names within the `fit` method. Specifically, it does some sanity checks to make sure the columns used for fitting are present when you later call `transform`. This validation expects a very precise match, and inconsistencies here lead to problems. Let me elaborate by painting a picture from a past project, which hopefully will resonate with your scenario.

Imagine, I had a time-series dataset for a financial prediction model. The initial dataframe, let’s call it `df_original`, had columns with names like 'price_t-1', 'price_t-2', and so on, denoting lagged prices. After some preprocessing steps, like renaming operations or creating new columns, I tried fitting `feature_engine.imputation.MeanMedianImputer` using specific lagged columns. The code looked something like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
from feature_engine.imputation import MeanMedianImputer

# Simplified example DataFrame creation (original data)
data = {'price_t-1': [10, 20, None, 40],
        'price_t-2': [5, None, 15, 30],
        'some_other_feature': [1,2,3,4]}
df_original = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Selection of the columns for Imputation
columns_to_impute = ['price_t-1','price_t-2']

# Initiating and fitting the imputer
imputer = MeanMedianImputer(variables=columns_to_impute)
imputer.fit(df_original)

# Transformation of the original dataframe
df_transformed = imputer.transform(df_original)

print(df_transformed)
```

This code would, in most basic examples, work fine. But let’s say, for reasons I won't get into now, the dataframe I eventually pass to `transform` doesn't *exactly* match the structure of `df_original` passed to fit, or more specifically, has column names changed, even very subtly, due to an earlier part of the pipeline. For instance, if a separate function modifies `df_original` and passes it to `transform` with columns that become `price_t_minus_1`, `price_t_minus_2` instead,  `feature_engine` will raise an error during the `transform` stage, as the imputer would search for the original column names 'price_t-1' and 'price_t-2', which no longer exist.

```python
import pandas as pd
from feature_engine.imputation import MeanMedianImputer

# Simplified example DataFrame creation (original data)
data = {'price_t-1': [10, 20, None, 40],
        'price_t-2': [5, None, 15, 30],
        'some_other_feature': [1,2,3,4]}
df_original = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Selection of the columns for Imputation
columns_to_impute = ['price_t-1','price_t-2']

# Initiating and fitting the imputer
imputer = MeanMedianImputer(variables=columns_to_impute)
imputer.fit(df_original)


# Simulating modified data: slight column name change
data_modified = {'price_t_minus_1': [10, 20, None, 40],
        'price_t_minus_2': [5, None, 15, 30],
        'some_other_feature': [1,2,3,4]}
df_modified = pd.DataFrame(data_modified)

try:
    # Attempted Transformation of the modified dataframe, this will fail.
    df_transformed_error = imputer.transform(df_modified)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during transform: {e}")

```

You see the problem here; it's a subtle name change, but it is enough for `feature_engine` to fail. The issue isn't necessarily in the imputer's logic but in the strict validation of column names between the fit and transform phases. `feature_engine` expects that the columns specified as `variables` during `fit` are precisely present in the dataframe given to `transform`, in order to execute operations on the intended columns.

Another situation where selection fails is when dealing with column selection via indexes versus column names or a mix of both in the variables parameter. While pandas is flexible with integer indexing, `feature_engine` generally operates on column *names* directly. Using a mixture or only integer positions might cause a transformer to select the wrong set of columns, or error, particularly if they are not used consistently. This becomes especially pertinent when you perform operations that change the order of your dataframe's columns. Let me demonstrate this situation, keeping the financial prediction dataset in mind, but now imagine that in your particular use-case you’re not passing the columns to the imputer, but rather indices of the columns you wish to impute

```python
import pandas as pd
from feature_engine.imputation import MeanMedianImputer

# Simplified example DataFrame creation
data = {'price_t-1': [10, 20, None, 40],
        'price_t-2': [5, None, 15, 30],
        'some_other_feature': [1,2,3,4]}
df_original = pd.DataFrame(data)


# Selection of columns using a mixture of names and integers
# This is generally not recommended with feature_engine, which expects all names.
columns_to_impute_indices = [0,1]

# Initiating and fitting the imputer
imputer = MeanMedianImputer(variables=columns_to_impute_indices)
try:
  imputer.fit(df_original)

except Exception as e:
   print(f"Error during fit: {e}")
```

In this case, `feature_engine` raises an error right away, and highlights that it's not happy with mixed variable types when using `MeanMedianImputer`, as it is expecting a list of column names.

To address these kinds of issues, my recommendation is to **explicitly define** the column names you want to work with, and double-check that those column names remain consistent across your processing pipelines. Avoid implicit assumptions and integer based selection where possible, opting for specific string based column names. Always double-check that no operations in your pipelines alter column names, especially before the transform phase.

For deeper dives into best practices in feature engineering and transformation in pandas, I highly recommend consulting these resources. First, the “Python for Data Analysis” book by Wes McKinney provides an excellent foundation in pandas usage and data manipulation techniques, which is essential for troubleshooting these kinds of problems. Then, “Feature Engineering for Machine Learning” by Alice Zheng and Amanda Casari, offers a comprehensive overview of feature engineering methodologies, and touches upon issues of handling data type mismatches during feature selection. Finally, for a more direct approach regarding machine learning pipelines and best practices, consider reading "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, as it emphasizes clarity and precision, which is important for debugging and using tools like feature_engine effectively. It details on pipelines, and the need for careful handling of data during preparation phases.

In conclusion, while `feature_engine` is a potent tool for feature transformation, it’s crucial to be precise about column names and how they are handled within your pipeline to ensure a smooth and effective workflow.
