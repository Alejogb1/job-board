,  I’ve seen this scenario play out a few times, and it usually boils down to a handful of common culprits when you’ve got a docker-based setup that's supposed to be lockable but is stubbornly refusing to play ball. It’s not always obvious at first glance, and sometimes it feels like you're chasing ghosts in the machine. I've spent a fair share of late nights debugging similar issues, so let's break down why these lockable docker setups tend to stumble, focusing on practical realities I've encountered.

The core concept of a "lockable" docker setup, as I understand it, implies some mechanism to ensure exclusive access to a resource or set of operations within your containerized environment. This often means preventing concurrent execution or ensuring atomic updates, especially when dealing with shared resources like databases or file systems. If your locking is failing, the root cause typically falls into a few categories: misconfigured locking primitives, inappropriate lock scoping, or simply overlooking some key details about how containers interact within a broader orchestration context.

First, let's examine the locking primitives themselves. These are the foundational elements you're relying on. In many dockerized setups, you might be using file locks, database locks, or some distributed locking system, such as zookeeper or etcd. I recall one project where we tried using file-based locking, relying on `flock`. We'd set up a shared volume, thinking it would be foolproof. The problem? We didn’t fully consider that `flock` is advisory. If another process, even within the same container, doesn’t respect the lock, it's effectively useless.

Here's a simplified example of how you might initially attempt a file-based lock (and where it can fail):

```python
#file_lock_attempt.py
import fcntl
import time

lock_file_path = "/shared/my_lock.lock"

def acquire_lock():
    lock_file = open(lock_file_path, "w")
    try:
        fcntl.flock(lock_file.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX)
        return lock_file
    except IOError as e:
        lock_file.close()
        print(f"Failed to acquire lock: {e}")
        return None

def release_lock(lock_file):
  if lock_file:
      fcntl.flock(lock_file.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_UN)
      lock_file.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
  lock = acquire_lock()
  if lock:
    print("Lock acquired. Simulating work...")
    time.sleep(5)
    print("Releasing lock...")
    release_lock(lock)
  else:
      print("Could not acquire lock.")
```

In practice, this script will often appear to work correctly when executed serially. However, concurrently running multiple instances of this same script, or processes within different containers also accessing the same volume, can sometimes bypass it, revealing the 'advisory' nature of `flock`.

This leads to the second major issue: incorrect lock scoping. Locking has to encompass the correct scope of work that needs protection. If your lock only secures part of your operation, you're still vulnerable to race conditions. For instance, let’s consider a situation where we update a shared database.

Let’s say we have this naive process:

```python
#naive_db_update.py
import sqlite3
import time

db_path = "/shared/my_db.sqlite"

def update_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT value FROM my_table WHERE id = 1;")
    current_value = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    time.sleep(1) #Simulate some work
    new_value = current_value + 1
    cursor.execute("UPDATE my_table SET value = ? WHERE id = 1;", (new_value,))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    update_db()
```

If multiple containers, each executing this script concurrently, try to update the value in that shared database, we're in trouble even with a lock around the database connection. The issue here is that the lock, implicitly happening via database transaction mechanism, isn’t capturing the read before the write operation. We read, then wait (simulate work), then update, creating a race condition.

To fix this and actually lock around the entire update operation, we could implement proper isolation by utilizing an appropriate database transaction. An example of this, where proper isolation is achieved, could be as follows:

```python
#fixed_db_update.py
import sqlite3
import time

db_path = "/shared/my_db.sqlite"

def update_db_atomic():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    try:
      cursor.execute("BEGIN EXCLUSIVE;")
      cursor.execute("SELECT value FROM my_table WHERE id = 1;")
      current_value = cursor.fetchone()[0]
      time.sleep(1) #Simulate some work
      new_value = current_value + 1
      cursor.execute("UPDATE my_table SET value = ? WHERE id = 1;", (new_value,))
      conn.commit()
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
       conn.rollback()
       print(f"Error during update: {e}")
    finally:
       conn.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    update_db_atomic()
```
Here, we encapsulate the full operation within a database transaction. Note: we are using `BEGIN EXCLUSIVE`, which instructs sqlite to lock the database for exclusive access for this process. While this solves the isolation issue in the immediate example, it does have limitations and different database systems provide a range of options for handling concurrent access.

Finally, orchestration layer considerations are crucial, often overlooked. Docker containers might be running on different nodes in a cluster managed by Kubernetes or similar. If your locking mechanism is only local to a single container or node, it won't work reliably across the cluster. In the past, I've seen setups fail spectacularly because they assumed shared memory between containers was globally accessible, even though those containers were on different machines managed by k8s. Distributed locking, via something like Redis or Zookeeper, becomes essential in such scenarios. I recommend delving into papers on distributed consensus algorithms, like Paxos or Raft, to understand the theoretical foundations and practical implications when it comes to distributed locking systems. "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann provides a good overview of these concepts. Additionally, "Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design" by George Coulouris et al. offers deeper theoretical insights.

In short, when dealing with docker-based lockable setups, the failure is almost never a 'magic' issue but rather the interplay of a few core problems. It can arise from the locking primitives being improperly understood and implemented (advisory vs mandatory), from the locking scope not being broad enough to encompass all relevant operations (leading to race conditions), and overlooking the implications of orchestration where distributed locks become essential. Pay close attention to these details, and your lockable setup should hold up to the pressure, ensuring data integrity and correct behavior.
