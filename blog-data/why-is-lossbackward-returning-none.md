Alright, let's tackle this. I’ve seen this one pop up more times than I can count, and it's usually not as straightforward as it initially seems. The question of why `loss.backward()` might be returning `None` in PyTorch, or not doing what you expect, is a common stumbling block, and the core reason often revolves around misunderstandings regarding computational graphs and variable tracking. Let me walk you through the most frequent culprits, drawing from a few frustrating debugging sessions from projects past, where this same issue surfaced and gave me a good run for my money.

First and foremost, remember that `loss.backward()` isn't *supposed* to return anything. It’s an *in-place* operation that populates the `.grad` attributes of the tensors in your computational graph. So, if you are trying to assign the returned value of `loss.backward()` to a variable, then that variable will, by design, be `None`. What you *should* be inspecting are the `.grad` attributes of the parameters you’re optimizing. The real issue arises when those `.grad` attributes are `None` after calling `loss.backward()`, or when gradients are not calculated for what *should* be included in the gradient computation graph.

Now, let's get into the specifics of why gradients may not be computed. One of the primary reasons—and this has bitten me more than once—is detachment. Tensors can be detached from the computational graph, either explicitly with `.detach()` or implicitly by performing an operation that prevents gradient tracking (like converting a tensor to a NumPy array and then back). When a tensor is detached, it won't be included in the gradient calculation by `loss.backward()`, and any tensors that depend on this detached tensor will also have no gradients.

For instance, imagine I was working on a neural style transfer project a while back. I was generating some intermediate results using a CNN, converting them to numpy for visualization with matplotlib, and then, I needed to backpropagate the loss from the final stylised result to my feature extractors. I pulled out my tensor, converted it to an numpy array, did the rendering with matplotlib, converted it back, and then tried to compute the gradients. The gradient calculations kept producing None and I spent a good hour banging my head against the wall before realizing my `tensor.numpy()` was the problem.

Here's a code snippet that shows such detachment:

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x + 2
z = y.detach()  # Detach y from the computational graph
w = z * 3
loss = (w - 10)**2
loss.backward()

print(x.grad) # Expected, since x wasn't detached
print(y.grad) # None, since y's dependency on x was cut off when y was detached
print(z.grad) # None since z is detached
print(w.grad) # None since w's dependency on z was cut off when z was detached
```

In the above case, `y` is detached from the computational graph using `.detach()`. Consequently, gradients for `y`, `z` and `w` are not computed and, if we had a loss dependent on `w`, no gradients would propagate back to `x` which was supposed to be part of the backpropagation graph and have a gradient.

Another common cause stems from the fact that PyTorch only tracks operations for tensors that *explicitly* have `requires_grad=True`. If you forget to set this, or if you use an operation that doesn't preserve the gradient requirements, then those tensors will also have no gradients. An important thing to note here, if a tensor has `requires_grad=True` *all* operations on it will preserve this and have requires_grad set to true automatically. However, if we begin an operation on a `requires_grad=False` tensor, this will *not* propagate to new tensors.

I faced this scenario once while trying to build a custom layer for an NLP task. I had meticulously designed my layer's forward pass, but had completely missed setting `requires_grad=True` on my layer’s parameter during the creation of the layer. As a result, my loss was not propagating gradients to my weights, and my model was not learning anything.

Consider the following example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.weight = torch.randn(input_size, output_size) # requires_grad=False by default
        self.bias = torch.zeros(output_size)              # requires_grad=False by default
    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.matmul(x, self.weight) + self.bias

input_size = 5
output_size = 3
layer = CustomLayer(input_size, output_size)

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, input_size, requires_grad=True)
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)
loss = torch.mean(output_tensor**2)
loss.backward()
print(layer.weight.grad)  # None, since `requires_grad` was not set on `weight`
print(layer.bias.grad) # None for the same reason

```

To fix this I need to set `requires_grad=True` explicitly during the initialisation of the weights and biases in `__init__()` or use `nn.Parameter` instead of just creating raw tensors:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(input_size, output_size))  # Setting requires_grad=True automatically
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(output_size))               # Setting requires_grad=True automatically
    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.matmul(x, self.weight) + self.bias

input_size = 5
output_size = 3
layer = CustomLayer(input_size, output_size)

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, input_size, requires_grad=True)
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)
loss = torch.mean(output_tensor**2)
loss.backward()
print(layer.weight.grad) # Now contains gradients
print(layer.bias.grad) # Now contains gradients

```

There are a few other subtleties, too. Sometimes, inplace operations, especially those that modify tensors directly without an assignment, can cause issues as PyTorch's autograd engine might have difficulties tracking these operations. This is not that common nowadays, and PyTorch throws very descriptive warnings about it, but is still worth knowing about. Also, using operations that are not part of the PyTorch autograd system, like certain custom C or CUDA extensions, might not have proper gradient tracking mechanisms unless explicitly implemented.

For further and more in-depth understanding, I'd highly recommend the following. Firstly, *Deep Learning with PyTorch* by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann is a fantastic resource, going into great detail about the internals of the autograd system. Secondly, the official PyTorch documentation is invaluable. Pay particular attention to the sections regarding autograd and gradients. Finally, for a more theoretical underpinning of backpropagation, look into *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. The section on backpropagation algorithm will be incredibly informative.

In short, if you encounter a `loss.backward()` where gradients are `None`, systematically review the following:

1.  Are any tensors inadvertently detached from the computational graph via `.detach()`?
2.  Are all tensors that *should* have gradients created with `requires_grad=True` or using `nn.Parameter`?
3. Are you performing any operations that modify tensors in place in a way that breaks the backward computation graph?
4. Are you using any custom extensions that may not be fully integrated with PyTorch's autograd mechanism?

By carefully addressing these points, you'll generally identify and resolve the issue quickly. It all comes down to understanding how PyTorch's automatic differentiation works behind the scenes and how gradients are tracked within the computational graph. This is a fundamental aspect of deep learning, so taking the time to truly grasp it will pay dividends in the long run.
