Alright,  Shape mismatches, particularly the (none, 1) versus (none, 64) conundrum, are a frequent encounter when working with tensor operations in frameworks like tensorflow, pytorch, or jax. I've definitely debugged my share of these, especially back when I was building a custom recurrent network for time-series analysis. The problem essentially boils down to incompatible dimensions during a mathematical operation, often during element-wise operations or matrix multiplication. The 'none' you see represents a variable batch size, which is quite common in deep learning, meaning the issue isn’t necessarily about a static size incompatibility but rather about how these potentially variable-sized batches are being combined across different dimensions.

The crux of the matter is this: you've got a tensor that, for each instance in your batch (represented by the 'none'), has a single dimension with a size of 1. And you’re attempting to combine or operate this on a tensor where each instance has a dimension of 64. This direct operation is not mathematically defined without modification, because we are essentially trying to combine incompatible vectors or matrices. The system rightly throws a shape mismatch error because it doesn't know how to perform an element-wise operation or a matrix multiplication across these mismatched dimensions.

Let's break down a few common scenarios where this happens and how to rectify them. The usual suspects are:

1. **Incorrect Feature Mapping:** The (none, 1) tensor often represents a single feature or a scalar value associated with each item in the batch, perhaps a label or a single activation. Whereas the (none, 64) tensor might represent, say, 64 different features extracted from some layer in your network. Trying to directly add these two would result in this specific shape mismatch. The solution here lies in either broadcasting or mapping your (none, 1) feature into the same space as your (none, 64) feature or vice-versa, depending on the logic of your operation.

2. **Loss Function Mismatch:** In certain situations, your final output before being passed into a loss function has the (none, 1) shape where your true labels may be in a different, (none, 64), format depending on the model architecture. Here you might have one hot-encoded labels or categorical data having 64 categories which you need to compare the model's logits against using your preferred metric. The solution is to transform either the model's output or the labels to align their shapes before passing into your loss function.

3. **Data Preparation Issues:** In other cases, the issue can stem from your data loader or data preparation stage. Maybe you incorrectly reshaped some tensor during loading or during data transformations. The solution here involves reviewing your entire data pipeline to make sure that, before they enter the model, all tensors that eventually are supposed to be combined have appropriate and compatible dimensions.

Now, let's look at some code examples. I'll use a python-esque pseudo-code since I don't have all the contextual dependencies and packages available here, but the principle would be the same with TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX.

**Example 1: Broadcasting a Single Feature**

Let's say you have a single scalar value that you want to add to each feature vector, which is a common operation when performing per-example normalization.

```python
# Example tensors with shape (None, 1) and (None, 64)

batch_size = 10 # For example, would be None in a real setting.
scalar_feature =  [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10]] # Simulating a tensor of shape (batch_size, 1)
feature_vector_tensor =  [[i for i in range(64)], [i+64 for i in range(64)], [i+128 for i in range(64)], [i+192 for i in range(64)], [i+256 for i in range(64)], [i+320 for i in range(64)], [i+384 for i in range(64)], [i+448 for i in range(64)], [i+512 for i in range(64)], [i+576 for i in range(64)]] # Simulating a tensor of shape (batch_size, 64)

# Incorrect operation, leads to the shape mismatch.
#  result = scalar_feature + feature_vector_tensor # This won’t work

# Correct operation using broadcasting

broadcasted_scalar = [[scalar_feature[j][0] for i in range(64)] for j in range(batch_size) ] # Creating a tensor of (batch_size, 64)

result = [[broadcasted_scalar[j][i] + feature_vector_tensor[j][i] for i in range(64) ] for j in range(batch_size) ] # element-wise additon which will work.
print(result)

```

In this example, instead of attempting a direct addition, we 'broadcasted' the (none, 1) tensor to match the (none, 64) tensor. In actual libraries this functionality would be implemented much more efficiently using library-specific functions like `tf.broadcast_to` or `torch.expand`, but the essential idea is the same, to make the dimension sizes match by replicating the vector across the required number of columns.

**Example 2: Transforming the Model's output for Loss Function**

Here's an example of how to transform the model's output to match label's dimensionality, particularly when using cross-entropy loss, where labels may be provided in one-hot format or categorical format with an index.

```python
# Simulating a model's output tensor of shape (None, 1) - logits or output of some layer.
model_output =  [[0.2], [0.8], [0.9], [0.3], [0.6], [0.1], [0.7], [0.5], [0.4], [0.3]] # shape (batch_size, 1)


# Simulating the ground truth labels of shape (None, 64) using one hot encoding.

ground_truth_labels =  [[0 if i != 10 else 1 for i in range(64)], [0 if i != 5 else 1 for i in range(64)], [0 if i != 12 else 1 for i in range(64)], [0 if i != 20 else 1 for i in range(64)], [0 if i != 32 else 1 for i in range(64)], [0 if i != 1 else 1 for i in range(64)], [0 if i != 4 else 1 for i in range(64)], [0 if i != 60 else 1 for i in range(64)], [0 if i != 12 else 1 for i in range(64)], [0 if i != 50 else 1 for i in range(64)]] # shape (batch_size, 64)

# Incorrect attempt to use cross-entropy loss
# loss = some_cross_entropy_loss(model_output, ground_truth_labels) # This will throw shape error

# Correct way is to apply a linear transform or a mapping such as a fully connected layer
# Let's assume we mapped it to a vector of size 64
# For this simulation we will just copy the value across 64 positions.

transformed_output = [[model_output[j][0] for i in range(64)] for j in range(batch_size)] # shape (batch_size, 64)
loss = [[transformed_output[j][i] - ground_truth_labels[j][i] for i in range(64)] for j in range(batch_size)] # Just for the sake of simulation. In reality you will compute an actual loss using cross entropy loss.

print (loss)
```

In this case, the key is to transform the model output to have the same dimensionality as the ground truth labels, before using the appropriate loss function. I used a linear transformation but, in reality, depending on how your model is setup, you will have to use a transformation layer to ensure the model's logits match the labels.

**Example 3: Reshaping Data Before Processing**

Let's consider an example where your data loader is producing incorrectly shaped tensors.

```python
# Example of incorrectly shaped tensor from data loader, usually as a tensor of shape (None, 1) rather than (None, N_FEATURES)
# Simulated tensor.
batch_data = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]] # Shape: (batch_size, 1)


# If we want to use 64 features and have the input shape be (None, 64) instead.
# We will have to transform our tensor into shape (None, 64) before feeding into model.

reshaped_batch = [[batch_data[j][0] for i in range(64)] for j in range(batch_size)] # Using the same broadcasting logic as above to create shape (batch_size, 64)

print(reshaped_batch)

```

Here, the initial tensor had the wrong shape. Before processing the data within the model you would need to reshape it to be a tensor of shape (none, 64). In this simulation I just replicated the single value to the tensor of shape (batch_size, 64), but in a more realistic setting, this is the step where you will be doing feature extraction using pre-trained embeddings or your own custom feature transformations, depending on the requirements of your model.

**Resources:**

To deepen your understanding of tensors and their manipulation, I'd recommend exploring the following:

*   **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This book provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning, including a thorough explanation of tensor operations. It covers the theoretical background, which will help you understand why certain operations work with specific shapes.

*   **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron:** A more practical book focused on implementing machine learning models, including how to manage tensors effectively with TensorFlow or Keras and other tools. Great for debugging practices related to shape mismatches in deep learning models.

*   **TensorFlow or PyTorch Official Documentation:** Both TensorFlow and PyTorch provide very well-written documentation with lots of examples, which can be quite helpful when dealing with tensor manipulations. Understanding the specific functions available for broadcasting, reshaping, or transforming tensors is critical.

In conclusion, a (none, 1) vs. (none, 64) shape mismatch is a common but manageable issue. By understanding the underlying data representations, the intended operations, and using tools such as broadcasting and reshaping, you can effectively resolve such errors, ensuring your model runs smoothly. The critical thing is to always double-check your data transformations and input shapes to avoid such common pitfalls.
