Let's consider this from the ground up, shall we? The question of whether to retrain a whole model when you have new data isn't a simple yes or no; it's a balancing act involving computational cost, potential benefits, and the specifics of your existing model and data. In my experience, having worked extensively with deep learning models for various large-scale image processing applications, I've seen this dilemma arise many times, and the 'best' approach can vary significantly depending on the context.

One key factor is the *amount* of new data relative to the data the model was originally trained on. If you've got a massive model trained on, let’s say, billions of images, and now you've added a few thousand more, retraining the entire thing is typically overkill. The gains would likely be minimal and the computation time prohibitive. In these cases, techniques like fine-tuning or continual learning become much more appealing. Fine-tuning involves taking the pre-trained model and updating only the later layers (e.g., the classifier layers) or using a very low learning rate on the earlier layers while training on the new data. This leverages the features the model has already learned and adjusts them to fit the new information without forgetting everything it has previously acquired.

Let’s illustrate this with a simple, though fictional, case. Imagine we have a convolutional neural network (cnn) trained to classify images of cats and dogs. We’ll assume this model, which we’ll call `animal_classifier`, has already reached good performance. Now we want to add images of hamsters. We don’t want to start completely from scratch, so we'll use fine-tuning. Here's a snippet using a hypothetical deep learning library to demonstrate this:

```python
# Hypothetical library syntax for demonstration purposes only

import my_deeplearning_lib as mdl

# Load the existing model
animal_classifier = mdl.load_model('animal_classifier.h5')

# Freeze the convolutional layers
for layer in animal_classifier.layers[:-2]: # assuming last two layers are classifier layers
    layer.trainable = False

# Add new fully connected layer specific to the 'hamster' category
new_output_layer = mdl.layers.dense(num_neurons=3, activation='softmax')
new_classifier = mdl.model.sequential([
    *animal_classifier.layers[:-1], # all layers except original output layer
    new_output_layer
])

# Compile and train on our hamster data.
new_classifier.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
hamster_data, hamster_labels = mdl.data.load_hamster_data()
new_classifier.fit(hamster_data, hamster_labels, epochs=10)

# now the new_classifier can classify all three
```

Notice how we kept most of the existing layers frozen. This allows the model to adapt to hamsters while retaining its expertise in cats and dogs. If we had retrained everything from scratch, the model could potentially ‘forget’ some of what it learned about cats and dogs.

On the flip side, if the new data introduces significant changes to the underlying data distribution or if the initial model was trained with limited data, a full retraining might be more beneficial. If, for example, our original cat/dog classifier was trained on low-resolution images and now we have a large set of high-resolution images, fine-tuning might not be enough. The model's learned features might be too specific to the low-resolution space, and retraining can help it adapt better to higher fidelity images.

Here’s another fictional, simplified example:

```python
# Still fictional library, but demonstrating full retrain
import my_deeplearning_lib as mdl

# Load the existing model but discard trained weights
animal_classifier_base = mdl.load_model('animal_classifier_base_architecture.h5')
animal_classifier = animal_classifier_base # discard previous weights

# Load the new training data
new_cat_dog_data, new_cat_dog_labels = mdl.data.load_high_resolution_cat_dog_data()

#Compile and retrain from scratch
animal_classifier.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
animal_classifier.fit(new_cat_dog_data, new_cat_dog_labels, epochs=20)

# Our original model is overridden with this fully retrained one
```

Here we loaded the *base architecture* which kept the layers the same but discarded the learned weights. Then we simply re-trained on new data. We would need to consider whether this model now performs as well or better on the original low res data or whether we should now also use the original data for a full retrain alongside the new data.

There’s a third scenario to consider: the case of catastrophic forgetting. This occurs when the model learns new information but drastically loses the ability to perform its original task. This is more likely when fine-tuning or when doing incremental learning if not implemented properly. Strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting often involve regularizing the training process to penalize large changes to the original network parameters, or using techniques like rehearsal where we keep a small subset of the original training data alongside the new data. Or, in more advanced cases, we can use methods like elastic weight consolidation.

To illustrate a basic regularization technique within a hypothetical library context:

```python
# Fictional library demonstrating regularization via L2 weight decay
import my_deeplearning_lib as mdl

# Load existing model
animal_classifier = mdl.load_model('animal_classifier.h5')

# Freeze early layers (fine-tuning)
for layer in animal_classifier.layers[:-2]:
    layer.trainable = False

# Compile with L2 regularization (weight decay)
animal_classifier.compile(optimizer=mdl.optimizers.adam(l2_lambda=0.001), loss='categorical_crossentropy') # l2 lambda regularizes the weights
new_dog_data, new_dog_labels = mdl.data.load_new_dog_breeds_data()
animal_classifier.fit(new_dog_data, new_dog_labels, epochs=10)

# The regularized fine-tuning should reduce the impact on old learned parameters
```

Here we have introduced a weight decay parameter which will add a penalty for large changes in the existing weight values, which can lead to more stable learning without forgetting previous data.

In summary, the decision depends heavily on the characteristics of your new data, the scale of the model, and the potential for catastrophic forgetting. For a deeper dive, I'd highly recommend consulting papers on *continual learning*, particularly the work by Kirkpatric et al., on “Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks" (you'll often find it referenced as *EWC*). The book "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville also offers an invaluable foundation on these concepts. Furthermore, research into *transfer learning* and *domain adaptation* often deals with similar questions, and looking at papers in those domains will provide a broader perspective on this issue.

The best approach often involves experimentation. Start with fine-tuning; if that doesn't meet your needs, move to strategies involving full retraining while being mindful of avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Always track performance metrics both on the old data and the new to ensure you're not degrading the quality of your overall model. It’s an iterative process, so be ready to adjust as needed.
