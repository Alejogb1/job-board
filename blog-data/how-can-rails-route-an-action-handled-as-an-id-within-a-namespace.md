Alright, let’s dive into namespaced routing with ids in rails. It's a pattern I’ve tackled quite a few times over the years, often finding myself adjusting configurations to handle more complex url structures. I recall one particular project—a rather large e-commerce platform—where we needed very specific routes for nested resources within admin sections. This experience ingrained a thorough understanding of how Rails handles these particular cases, and I'll break it down as clearly as possible.

When you're dealing with nested resources in Rails, especially those within namespaces, things can become a bit more intricate than your typical `resources :items` declaration. The key is understanding the interplay between namespaces, resources, and their corresponding identifiers. Rails routing, at its heart, is a pattern-matching system. It looks at incoming urls and tries to match them to defined patterns within your `config/routes.rb` file. When you add namespaces into the mix, you're essentially creating a kind of prefix for those patterns.

The core problem we're addressing is: how do we ensure a request like `admin/products/123/edit` correctly calls the `edit` action on the product with the id 123, within the `admin` namespace? The straightforward resource declaration doesn't always cover this specific case without further specification.

First, let's establish a basic scenario. Say, we have a `Product` model and want to manage it from an `admin` namespace. Our initial attempt in `config/routes.rb` might look like this:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :admin do
    resources :products
  end
end
```

This code works adequately for basic CRUD operations. It generates routes for index, create, show, edit, update, and destroy actions, all within the `/admin/products` path prefix. However, consider wanting to handle a custom action called `publish` for each product. A first naive attempt might look something like this:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :admin do
    resources :products do
       member do
         post :publish
       end
     end
  end
end
```

This works well, and the route created looks like `/admin/products/:id/publish`, and directs to the `publish` method within your `Admin::ProductsController`. However, the crux of the question revolves around situations where the `id` part is an important element and needs to be understood. Let's consider a case where you would rather not use the `/publish` part and instead have the action directly related to the id of the object, for a better more RESTful endpoint.

To accurately handle actions directly with the id in the namespace and avoiding extra action segments of the url, we must utilize the `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` methods directly, rather than relying solely on the convenience of `resources`. Here's the refined approach:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :admin do
    get 'products/:id/publish', to: 'products#publish', as: :publish_product
    resources :products
  end
end
```
Here, we've explicitly created a route for `/admin/products/:id/publish`, specifying that it should map to the `publish` action in the `Admin::ProductsController`. The `as: :publish_product` generates a handy helper method called `publish_product_path`, making it easier to link to the route in our views. This approach maintains a clear mapping between URL segments and controller actions. It explicitly defines the behavior rather than relying solely on conventional resource mapping, which for more complex needs, will not always be enough.

Sometimes you will want to perform specific actions only available from within the context of a resource, but without a designated action. For instance, you could have an API endpoint that updates the product's visibility using a `PATCH` request directly to `/admin/products/123`. In this case, the `id` itself dictates the update:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :admin do
      patch 'products/:id', to: 'products#update_visibility' ,as: :update_visibility_product
      resources :products
  end
end
```

Here, the path `/admin/products/:id` with a `PATCH` request is routed to `update_visibility`, and a `update_visibility_product_path` method is created. If you were to make a request using a `PUT` request to `/admin/products/123` it will still map to the default update action in the controller, as that is covered by `resources :products`.

Now, a few insights that come from years of actually doing this:

* **Clarity is key:** Always prioritize routes that are easily readable and understandable both by developers and perhaps your API consumers. Avoid overly cryptic route definitions. Naming your routes with the `as:` option is critical, and something often overlooked.
* **RESTful principles:** While flexibility is important, sticking to RESTful conventions wherever possible maintains consistency and makes your API easier to reason about. These techniques are especially critical when dealing with complex APIs or microservices.
* **Resourcefulness:** The `resources` method is incredibly useful, but it's not always the best answer. Learning to combine it with direct route declarations like `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, and `delete` gives you more precise control.
* **Testing:** Ensure to write tests for all of your routes, including these less conventional ones. This will catch regressions before they make it to production.

For further reading, I highly recommend two resources. Firstly, examine the documentation of Rails guide specifically on Routing from the official Rails documentation—it provides comprehensive coverage on all the ins and outs of Rails' routing engine. This will always be a great starting point. Secondly, read "Crafting Rails Applications" by José Valim, it dives much deeper into the philosophy of routing in Rails, exploring some of the more complex usage patterns you're likely to encounter.

In conclusion, routing within a namespace using ids involves a combination of conventional resource routing and targeted path definitions. By understanding how Rails interprets these declarations, you gain more control over your application's url structure. The examples illustrate how to move beyond basic resource declarations to achieve more tailored, and often, more RESTful, url mappings. It's all about understanding the mechanics behind the curtain, and that allows you to make informed decisions when crafting your own application’s routes.
