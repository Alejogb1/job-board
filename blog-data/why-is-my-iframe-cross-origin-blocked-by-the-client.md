Okay, let's tackle this. It’s a common headache, and I've certainly spent my fair share of time debugging similar scenarios back in the day. The core issue, when you’re seeing an iframe blocked due to cross-origin concerns, is fundamentally rooted in web security—specifically, the browser's same-origin policy. It's not a bug, but rather a feature, a crucial mechanism to safeguard user data and prevent malicious scripts from intermingling on the web. Let's delve into why this happens and what you can do to rectify it.

Essentially, the same-origin policy states that a script running on one domain (including subdomain and protocol) is only allowed to access data from other scripts, documents, or resources residing on the exact same origin. Consider the 'origin' as a tuple: (protocol, hostname, port). If any of these components differ between the page containing the iframe and the page loaded inside the iframe, the browser treats them as distinct origins. When it does, the cross-origin restriction kicks in, preventing direct access to the iframe's document object model (DOM) and JavaScript variables from the parent window, or vice-versa. The browser doesn't just arbitrarily block things; it's actively preventing a potential security breach. Think of it this way: Without this policy, a malicious website could load another website in an iframe and then freely manipulate the contained content, potentially stealing information or triggering actions the user didn’t intend.

Now, you might be thinking, “Okay, I understand the security concerns but I still need these things to communicate.” Absolutely, there are structured, secure ways to bridge the cross-origin gap. That's where cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and `postMessage` come into play, both crucial technologies for web developers. CORS is essentially a mechanism where the server, on which the iframe content is hosted, can explicitly specify which origins are allowed to access its resources through a set of HTTP headers. If the server doesn't explicitly allow the origin of the parent page via CORS headers, then a cross-origin block will occur. This applies even when the iframes are on subdomains, or have different protocols (http vs https).

The second, `postMessage` API, allows for more nuanced inter-frame communication. Instead of direct DOM access, `postMessage` enables sending messages between frames, regardless of the origin. Both sides must actively listen for these messages and then respond appropriately. This approach is safer because it only permits controlled data exchange.

Let’s get into some code examples to make this clear. Assume we have a parent HTML document on `http://example.com` with an iframe loading content from `http://api.anotherdomain.com`.

**Example 1: No CORS setup leads to block.**

Let's say the iframe content at `http://api.anotherdomain.com/iframe_content.html` is quite simple:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Iframe Content</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is iframe content.</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

And the parent document at `http://example.com/index.html` attempts to access its content:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Parent Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <iframe id="myIframe" src="http://api.anotherdomain.com/iframe_content.html"></iframe>
    <script>
        window.onload = function() {
            try{
            let iframe = document.getElementById("myIframe");
            console.log(iframe.contentDocument); // Attempting to access contentDocument
            } catch(error)
            {
            console.log("Error:", error);
             //This error will be shown
            }
        };
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
In this scenario, the console would log an error because the `contentDocument` or accessing `contentWindow` is restricted since the iframe's origin is `http://api.anotherdomain.com`, different from the parent’s origin. CORS is not defined to allow this access.

**Example 2: CORS enabling access.**

To fix the above, we need to implement CORS on the server hosting the iframe content. On `http://api.anotherdomain.com`, we would need to configure the web server to add the following header to the response for `iframe_content.html`:
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com`

If you can't control the backend because it's an external resource, it can be problematic. However if you can: For example, using Python (Flask):
```python
from flask import Flask, send_file
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app, resources={r"/*": {"origins": "http://example.com"}})  # specific origin

@app.route('/iframe_content.html')
def serve_iframe_content():
    return send_file('iframe_content.html') # Assume you have a file in the current directory

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```
In this case the response to the iframe content would include the header allowing `http://example.com` to access it. Now the parent's JavaScript will not throw the error and you will be able to see `contentDocument`. Please note that `*` as an allow origin should be used sparingly and when you have absolute certainty, as it allows access from any source. Usually it's better to specify the origins needed.

**Example 3: Using `postMessage` for Inter-Frame Communication.**

If you need a more structured way to send data back and forth, particularly when direct access isn’t desired or possible, use `postMessage`.
First, let’s modify the parent page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Parent Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <iframe id="myIframe" src="http://api.anotherdomain.com/iframe_content_message.html"></iframe>
    <script>
        const iframe = document.getElementById("myIframe");

        iframe.onload = () => {
            iframe.contentWindow.postMessage('Hello from parent', 'http://api.anotherdomain.com');
        };

        window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
            if (event.origin !== 'http://api.anotherdomain.com') return; //origin check!
            console.log('Message from iframe:', event.data);
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, let's also modify the iframe content (`http://api.anotherdomain.com/iframe_content_message.html`):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Iframe Content</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is iframe content.</h1>
    <script>
    window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    if (event.origin !== 'http://example.com') return; //origin check!
        console.log('Message from parent:', event.data);
        event.source.postMessage('Hello back from iframe', 'http://example.com')
    });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Here, the parent sends a message to the iframe upon loading, and the iframe sends a reply back. Notice that both sides are verifying the origin of the message and are being explicit about the target origin of the `postMessage`. This ensures data is only exchanged with expected origins.

This is a highly simplified illustration. In practice, you may need to implement more complex messaging protocols, error handling, and data serialization when using `postMessage`.

For further reading, I would recommend referring to the Mozilla Developer Network documentation for both CORS and `postMessage`. Specifically, the sections detailing the same-origin policy, CORS headers, and how to utilize the `postMessage` API are crucial. Also, I found “High Performance Browser Networking” by Ilya Grigorik incredibly insightful for understanding the underpinnings of web security and protocols. Lastly for CORS more broadly, “Web Security: The Definitive Guide” by Andrew Hoffman provides detailed analysis. These resources should provide the needed background.

In summary, cross-origin blocking is a safety mechanism designed to protect user data. Understanding the same-origin policy, implementing CORS appropriately, and utilizing `postMessage` for cross-frame communication are essential skills for any front-end developer. If you keep these principles in mind, debugging your iframe cross-origin challenges should become significantly easier.
