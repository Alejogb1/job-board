Okay, let’s tackle the topic of how BERT manages to produce outputs of different dimensions; it's a common point of confusion, and I've definitely spent my fair share of time debugging models that behaved unexpectedly in this regard. My first real encounter with this issue was when I was building a classification model using BERT for document categorization. It initially threw me for a loop because the output seemed inconsistent until I delved deeper into the architecture. Let me break it down, hopefully clearing the fog.

The core mechanism behind BERT's ability to generate outputs of varying dimensions stems from its flexibility in leveraging the contextualized representations it produces. Unlike simpler models that might have a fixed output dimension tied directly to the input length, BERT generates a sequence of hidden states for each input token. It's not about squeezing everything into a fixed size box; instead, it's about generating a dynamic representation that downstream tasks can then tailor to their specific requirements.

The key thing to understand is that BERT, at its heart, is a transformer encoder. It doesn't directly output a single vector suitable for, say, classification, or summarization. Instead, it gives you a sequence of hidden state vectors. Each vector in this sequence corresponds to an input token (after the initial tokenization), and each is the result of processing that token's contextual understanding. This understanding comes from the attention mechanism, which allows each token to “see” and be influenced by all other tokens in the input. Think of each hidden state vector as a snapshot of a token's meaning *in that specific context*.

The dimensional variation comes into play in how we *use* those sequence of hidden states, not from BERT itself. Here’s where the flexibility lies. If your task is sequence classification – for example, sentiment analysis of a sentence – we typically aggregate all the token representations, using techniques like the vector at the `[CLS]` token position (or averaging) to get a fixed-size vector which we then pass to our classification layers. That single output vector could have a dimension of 768 (for base BERT) or 1024 (for large BERT). This single output is what allows a classifier to make its decision across the entire input.

Now, consider a task that requires token-level decisions, such as named entity recognition or part-of-speech tagging. In such cases, we utilize the entire sequence of hidden states. We don't compress it into a single vector. Each token gets its own representation from the sequence, and those representations are then fed into a task-specific layer to output labels for each token independently. This is the key difference leading to variations in output dimensions: we have multiple vectors output in the sequence for each word. The size of the sequence is equal to the length of your tokenized input.

Let's solidify this with code examples. These are in python using `transformers` library, which is very commonly used.

**Example 1: Sentence Classification**

Here's how you’d typically grab the vector for a sentence classification task:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

inputs = tokenizer("This is an example sentence.", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Get the hidden state of the [CLS] token
cls_output = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]

print("Shape of CLS token output:", cls_output.shape) # Expected output: torch.Size([1, 768])
```

In this example, the output `cls_output` has the shape `torch.Size([1, 768])`. The `1` represents the batch size (we only passed one sentence), and the `768` represents the dimensionality of the vector associated with the `[CLS]` token, a single vector that can now be used for classification in our example. We've effectively condensed the sequence into a single fixed-sized vector.

**Example 2: Token-level classification (Using each word representation)**

Now, let's look at how you can access all of the token representations. This will allow you to create output with a size corresponding to the input token length:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

inputs = tokenizer("This is an example sentence.", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)


token_outputs = outputs.last_hidden_state

print("Shape of token outputs:", token_outputs.shape) # Expected output: torch.Size([1, 7, 768])
```

Here, `token_outputs` has the shape `torch.Size([1, 7, 768])`. `1` is still our batch size, `7` corresponds to the number of tokens in the input ("this", "is", "an", "example", "sentence", ".", "[SEP]"), and `768` is the hidden state dimension per token. Note that the `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens are also represented here and can be removed based on the application. We haven't reduced it to a single vector; instead, we have retained the vector representations for every single token.

**Example 3: Pooling operation for fixed-sized output**

We can average the outputs of all words, instead of grabbing just the `[CLS]` vector, to obtain a single output vector. This is another common approach in practical scenarios:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

inputs = tokenizer("This is an example sentence.", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Pool over sequence dimension for a single fixed-sized vector
pooled_output = torch.mean(outputs.last_hidden_state, dim=1)
print("Shape of Pooled output:", pooled_output.shape)  # Expected output: torch.Size([1, 768])

```

Here, we are computing a mean over the second dimension (the token sequence), resulting in a single vector of shape `torch.Size([1, 768])`. This approach offers a single representation of the sentence as a whole, and can be used for sentence-level tasks instead of just the `[CLS]` output.

So, to put it simply, BERT isn't actually outputting varying dimensions by itself, but rather, it’s producing a sequence of contextualized representations that we, the developers, then decide how to combine. By either leveraging the `[CLS]` token, averaging token representations, or utilizing all token representations, we can tailor our application to task specific dimensions, such as sentence-level classifications, or token-level classifications, respectively. The underlying BERT model provides the raw material, and the application logic defines the final shape.

For a deeper dive, I'd strongly recommend checking out the original BERT paper, "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" by Devlin et al. It's a foundational paper and will give you a rigorous understanding of the model. Also, "Attention is All You Need," by Vaswani et al., provides a great explanation of the transformer architecture. Another resource I've found useful is the book "Natural Language Processing with Transformers," which details how to apply transformers effectively to downstream tasks. These sources have been my guiding light through many model design problems. They should prove beneficial to you as well. This flexibility, once mastered, makes BERT a powerful and very adaptable tool for a multitude of nlp tasks.
