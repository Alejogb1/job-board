Alright, let's tackle this. I've seen this come up quite a bit over the years, and while it might seem straightforward, there are nuances to handling queries across different models from within a model function in Rails that you’ll want to get a firm grip on. Specifically, you're asking how to query one model from inside a function defined within another model. This isn't necessarily bad practice, but the *how* and *why* are essential to get *right*.

The general idea is that your model code, like any other code in your application, can invoke methods that interact with your database. And within a model, you might need to access data that’s represented by a different model. However, this can quickly become unwieldy if not managed properly. We want our models to remain focused on their primary responsibilities, while still allowing them to access related data. I've personally seen applications where this pattern is abused, creating spaghetti code that’s a nightmare to maintain. My old team even spent weeks refactoring a system that had this kind of inter-model query proliferation.

Let’s clarify how to do this effectively. The basic pattern usually involves using Active Record's querying interface, but the key is deciding *where* and *how* these queries are executed. We must also avoid making the first model overly reliant on the implementation details of the second.

Essentially, you can perform queries on another model in a model function just as you would in a controller or service object, but the context makes all the difference.

Consider this scenario: I'm working on an e-commerce platform. We have `Order` and `Customer` models. Let's assume a need to determine if a customer has placed a significant order amount, based on the number of items ordered, *within* an `Order` instance method.

Here's the first example of how you might initially implement this:

```ruby
# app/models/order.rb
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :customer
  has_many :line_items

  def significant_order?
     total_items = line_items.sum(:quantity)
     customer.significant_customer?(total_items)
  end
end
```

And now the `Customer` model code:

```ruby
# app/models/customer.rb
class Customer < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :orders

  def significant_customer?(total_items)
    total_items > 100 # this is purely for illustration
  end
end
```

In this first example, the `Order` model is calling a method `significant_customer?` in the `Customer` model, and passing a parameter (number of items). While this is one implementation of the feature, you can see that the order calculation logic is present in the `Order` model which does not make sense. Also, this approach has tight coupling. The `Order` model now depends directly on the presence and implementation details of the `significant_customer?` method in the customer model.

Now, let’s explore a better approach. We can improve separation of concerns by having the `Customer` model retrieve all of the customer's orders, then perform the calculation within itself. This makes a lot more sense because the `Customer` knows about all its orders.

Here's the modified `Customer` model:

```ruby
# app/models/customer.rb
class Customer < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :orders
  has_many :line_items, through: :orders

  def significant_customer?
    total_items = line_items.sum(:quantity)
    total_items > 100 # this is purely for illustration
  end
end
```

And the `Order` model now becomes much simpler:

```ruby
# app/models/order.rb
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :customer
  has_many :line_items

  def is_significant_order?
    customer.significant_customer?
  end
end
```

Here we’ve improved the design. Now the `Order` model simply checks if the customer is significant, leaving the details on *what* constitutes a significant customer to that specific model. The logic relating to determining total item counts is now located within the `Customer` model.

Finally, you might encounter situations where accessing associated records from another model directly within a loop in the first model leads to performance issues, most specifically the dreaded N+1 query problem. This is a well-known issue. I’ve personally spent considerable time debugging queries and seeing them perform horribly. When you have thousands of rows, it can grind your application to a halt.

For this, you need to use eager loading. Here's a simple example, if you need to process a collection of orders:

```ruby
# app/models/order.rb

class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :customer
  has_many :line_items

  def self.process_orders
     Order.includes(:customer, :line_items).find_each do |order|
       if order.customer.significant_customer?
        puts "This order belongs to a significant customer ID: #{order.customer.id}"
       end
     end
  end
end
```

Here, the `includes(:customer, :line_items)` part is key. It ensures that the associated `customer` and `line_items` records are fetched in as few queries as possible, rather than making a query for each order's customer and line items. The performance impact is incredibly significant when you're dealing with anything beyond trivial datasets.

To be clear, the examples above aren’t the only way to approach this issue, but they provide good foundations to build on. The best approaches generally involve delegation, such as using service objects, as the complexity of your application grows. However, a lot of the time the direct querying works well enough, as long as it is managed properly.

For further study, I recommend delving into Martin Fowler's "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture", specifically the sections on domain models and data access objects, as well as Active Record patterns discussed in the Rails documentation. Also, the "Refactoring" by Martin Fowler will provide lots of strategies to clean up existing code. Understanding these principles and how they’re applied in practice is key to building robust, maintainable, and scalable Rails applications. You will find lots of discussion about these topics on Stack Overflow, which will also aid your understanding.

In summary, accessing another model from within a rails model function is achievable via direct querying and associations. Consider the location of the query and ensure it is appropriate given the relationship of the models. Be mindful of performance and eager loading to avoid common issues like N+1 queries, and that you will need to evolve these patterns as the application grows in complexity.
