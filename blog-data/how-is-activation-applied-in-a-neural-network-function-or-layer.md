, let’s unpack this. It’s a question I’ve seen trip up folks new to neural networks, and honestly, even a few seasoned practitioners now and then. The ambiguity often stems from how libraries tend to abstract things away, but the core concept is fairly straightforward once you peel back the layers.

The short, technical answer is that activation functions are *functions*, not layers, although they’re often discussed and implemented in the context of layers. I've seen the misconception that they're a standalone 'layer' lead to some convoluted network designs early in my career. The best way to approach this is to understand their purpose first and then look at where they fit within the bigger picture of neural network computations.

An activation function’s fundamental job is to introduce non-linearity into the neural network. Think about it: a neural network without activation functions is simply performing a series of linear transformations (weighted sums and biases), and multiple stacked linear transformations collapse into a single linear transformation. Not particularly useful if you are seeking to model anything beyond linear data relationships. We need these non-linearities to learn complex patterns – to model things that aren't simply straight lines or planes. The activation function is applied *after* the linear transformation within a given layer, thus injecting the necessary non-linearity.

Here’s how it typically plays out. Inside each neuron (in a layer), we perform a weighted sum of the inputs, add a bias, and then, *before* passing this result along to the next layer, we apply the activation function. This output of the activation function then becomes the input to the neurons in the next layer.

Now, let me give a few concrete examples using python-like pseudocode to solidify this.

**Example 1: A Single Neuron's Calculation**

Imagine a neuron in a fully connected layer. Let's say we have inputs `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` with corresponding weights `w1`, `w2`, and `w3`, and a bias `b`. Let's assume we’re using the sigmoid activation function (this isn't optimal for most deep networks now, but it's good for illustration).

```python
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + exp(-x))

def neuron_calculation(x1, x2, x3, w1, w2, w3, b):
    z = (x1 * w1) + (x2 * w2) + (x3 * w3) + b  # Linear transformation
    a = sigmoid(z) # Activation function is applied here
    return a

# Example Usage:
input_values = [0.5, -0.2, 0.8]
weights = [0.1, 0.3, -0.4]
bias = 0.2
neuron_output = neuron_calculation(input_values[0], input_values[1], input_values[2], weights[0], weights[1], weights[2], bias)
print(neuron_output)

```
In this example `sigmoid` is clearly a function being used and not a separate layer.

**Example 2: Activation within a simple layer**

Let’s illustrate the process on a very simple fully connected layer. We’ll apply a rectified linear unit (relu), another popular activation, after the linear operation.

```python
def relu(x):
  return max(0, x)

def fully_connected_layer(inputs, weights, biases):
    outputs = []
    for i in range(len(weights)):
        z = sum([inputs[j] * weights[i][j] for j in range(len(inputs))]) + biases[i]
        a = relu(z)
        outputs.append(a)
    return outputs

# Example Usage:
inputs = [0.4, -0.2, 0.7]
weights = [[0.1, 0.2, -0.3], [-0.2, 0.4, 0.1]]  # Two neurons in the layer
biases = [0.1, -0.2]
layer_outputs = fully_connected_layer(inputs, weights, biases)
print(layer_outputs)
```

Here again `relu` is just a function applied within each neuron of our `fully_connected_layer` function. The layer does the linear combinations, but it's the application of the activation function to each neuron's result that introduces the non-linearity.

**Example 3: Activation within a Convolutional Layer**

The idea is similar even in convolutional layers. After the convolution operation (dot product between the kernel and the corresponding input patch), you apply the activation to the output.

```python
def relu(x):
  return max(0, x)

def convolution_output(input_patch, kernel, bias):
    z = sum([input_patch[i] * kernel[i] for i in range(len(input_patch))]) + bias
    a = relu(z)
    return a

# Example Usage:
input_patch = [0.1, 0.2, -0.3, 0.4] # Simplified patch from an image
kernel = [0.2, 0.3, -0.1, 0.2]
bias = 0.1
output = convolution_output(input_patch, kernel, bias)
print(output)
```

Again, the pattern is consistent, the activation (in this case, `relu`) is applied as a final step within a particular processing unit within a layer. In each of these examples the activation function *modifies* the output of the linear transformation but is not itself a transformation that involves weights and biases or an independent layer.

You’ll notice, especially in deep learning libraries, that activation functions are often specified as an argument *within* the layer definition or added as an operation following a layer (for example in TensorFlow's Keras) . This is mostly for convenient implementation, but it shouldn't obscure their conceptual nature; they are functions.

I’ve observed over the years that thinking of activation functions as a layer creates unnecessary complexity. Instead, envision them as a processing step that introduces non-linearity within the computational pipeline of a neural network, operating element-wise on the output of a linear operation within a layer.

For a deeper dive into this, I strongly recommend reading "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. The chapter on neural networks and activation functions provides an authoritative and thorough explanation. Also, “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning” by Christopher Bishop offers a detailed exploration of linear models and non-linear mappings within the broader context of machine learning, and although not solely on neural networks, its insights into non-linearities and transformations are invaluable. Understanding the mathematical underpinnings behind the computations helps to solidify the role and application of activation functions and prevent the common confusion between functions and layers in neural network architectures. Don’t get hung up on the specific library’s implementation; focus on the core concepts, and everything will fall into place more clearly.
