Okay so you're hitting that "failed to resolve xposed module api" wall huh Been there done that got the t-shirt and a few stress-induced gray hairs Let me tell you it's a right of passage for anyone dabbling in Xposed module development I've spent way too much time staring at logcat wondering what fresh hell I've unleashed on my poor test device

First off let's get the basic stuff out of the way This error basically means your module can't find the necessary Xposed API classes when the Xposed framework is trying to load it It's like trying to build a Lego castle without the instruction manual and half the bricks are missing

Now there are a few usual suspects that cause this annoying situation and I'm not talking about some random kernel panic or your toddler messing with your phone settings again These usually boil down to incorrect setup on your build configuration or simple dependency issues

Let's break it down step by step and go through some of the stuff that have tripped me in the past

First thing you wanna double check is your `build.gradle` file yeah that's a shocker it's never the gradle file is it Always is. Specifically the dependencies section in the module's `build.gradle` should always have the Xposed API library included If it's not there well that's your problem solved for you I can’t believe you never checked that the first time… I am just joking I can believe it we all have been there trust me. Here's a standard example of how it should look:

```gradle
dependencies {
    compileOnly 'de.robv.android.xposed:api:82' // Use the correct version of API
}
```

See that `de.robv.android.xposed:api:82` part? That's key And `82` it is only an example you'll want to replace with the correct API level of your Xposed framework version Make sure it matches the Xposed version you installed in the device If you are trying to target api level 90 and you got version 82 that won’t work friend. Remember that one time when I spent 4 hours debugging it only to realize I was pointing to 82 instead of 84? Don’t make the same mistake as me.

I had another occasion when I forgot to use `compileOnly` instead of `implementation` Now what happens with implementation is that it adds the xposed api library to the package which you do not want because you only want to link with it not pack it.

So you can see that if you mess with the gradle configuration like that you can introduce all kind of issues. This also applies to your local xposed framework setup too make sure it’s the right version and it is installed properly.

Another common cause is that you are targeting the wrong SDK version in your android manifest. And this is where we start digging a bit deeper It's crucial your module's `AndroidManifest.xml` declares the correct target API level

You see if your module is designed for an older version of Android and you attempt to use it on a newer one you may encounter this error because Xposed might have been changed in a way that’s not compatible anymore.

Here's a snippet of how you should declare it:

```xml
<uses-sdk
    android:minSdkVersion="15"
    android:targetSdkVersion="33" /> <!--adjust accordingly-->
```

Adjust `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` to match the intended Android versions your module should support Again double check that you did not use the wrong target api level because of a typo or copy paste error It happens to all of us especially when we are working on multiple modules at the same time

Now if all that is correct then the last suspect is your Xposed Module Entry Point. You know that class that you define on the manifest… that one that extends `IXposedHookLoadPackage` or implements it.

The main issue I see here is that some people either forget to define the class on the manifest or that they defined the wrong one.

Here is how it should look like in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="xposedmodule"
    android:value="true" />
<meta-data
    android:name="xposedminversion"
    android:value="82" />
<meta-data
    android:name="xposeddescription"
    android:value="My Awesome module description" />
```

You see that you need to have the correct `xposedminversion` defined and it should match the version that you defined on your `build.gradle` file.

Additionally the main entry point of your module should implement `IXposedHookLoadPackage` It is very important to implement it this interface as a missing implementation will lead to errors.

```java
import de.robv.android.xposed.IXposedHookLoadPackage;
import de.robv.android.xposed.callbacks.XC_LoadPackage;

public class MyModule implements IXposedHookLoadPackage {
    @Override
    public void handleLoadPackage(XC_LoadPackage.LoadPackageParam lpparam) throws Throwable {
        // Your hook logic here
    }
}
```

If these are all in place there's also the chance that some other library you are using is conflicting with the Xposed one. It could happen although its not usual. You should also check your logs and make sure nothing is weird there.

One thing you should try is cleaning and rebuilding the project using your IDE’s build tools That process can help with cache inconsistencies with your build process I've seen weird bugs disappear just by a clean build you know I think there is some magic behind these commands sometimes.

And I’d recommend some resources that helped me with this over the years They’re not links cause this is not a forum after all but names of resources:
"Programming Android" by Zigurd Mednieks et al a good book about android internals that always helps when debugging things
Also the "Android SDK documentation" in general is always useful.

And if you have any further issues feel free to ask for more specific help you just have to give me all the details about your setup and what you are trying to do
