alright, so you're asking if there's a weird way to kill a child process to get specific output, right? i've definitely been down that rabbit hole a few times. it's usually not the *ideal* way to do things, but sometimes you're backed into a corner, or maybe you just want to see what happens. i get it.

let's talk about process termination and how it relates to outputs. typically, when a process ends normally, it closes all its file descriptors, which includes pipes connected to its parent. the parent process then reads what the child process wrote to these pipes. we are used to standard exit codes and signals, but when we want non standard stuff, that is where things become interesting. when a child exits abnormally, the normal closing and cleanup might not happen. this is where we can potentially get the ‘abnormal’ outputs you are asking about.

so the usual and most straightforward is the child process finishing its work and closing properly. usually, we'd use something like `subprocess.run` in python, or a similar call, which waits for the child to terminate normally and captures all its output in a controlled way:

```python
import subprocess

def normal_child_process():
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["python", "-c", "print('hello from child')"],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True,
        check=True
    )
    print(f"child output: {result.stdout.strip()}")
    print(f"child exit code: {result.returncode}")
normal_child_process()
```

this runs a simple python script as a child, prints "hello from child" to standard output, and terminates gracefully. `subprocess.run` collects the output, the exit code and prints all this in the parent process. no surprises here, everything works according to expected parameters.

now, let's get to the "abnormal" part. one common approach to force process termination is using signals. sending `sigkill` (signal 9) to a process, for example, kills it abruptly. it doesn't get to cleanup or close file descriptors nicely. the operating system just terminates the process, its memory and all related resources are immediately released. this means the output buffers in the child might not be fully flushed to the pipes before it gets killed.

i remember a project i was working on years ago, we had a data processing pipeline where one stage of the process was written in c and occasionally it would get stuck in an infinite loop. after a lot of debugging it turned out to be an edge case where the data contained null values. we didn't have the time to fix it back then, so as a quick temporary solution we were sending the `sigkill` signal to the process if it took longer than a set limit. the parent process would then read whatever was in the pipe from the child, which in many cases, contained partial output from the calculation. of course, the ideal way would have been to have properly handled the null data values in the c process but sometimes you just gotta move fast and break things as they say.

here's how you could do this in python, using a signal to kill a child process:

```python
import subprocess
import os
import signal
import time

def abnormal_termination_child_process():
    process = subprocess.Popen(
        ["python", "-c", "import time; print('start'); time.sleep(10); print('end')"],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
        text=True
    )

    time.sleep(1)  # give the child some time to start

    os.kill(process.pid, signal.SIGKILL)
    stdout, _ = process.communicate()
    print(f"child output: {stdout.strip()}")

abnormal_termination_child_process()
```

in this snippet, the child process tries to print 'start', waits for ten seconds and then prints 'end'. however, the parent process kills it after one second by sending `sigkill`, so the child never prints end. as you'll see, the output in the parent will usually have “start” but not “end”. sometimes you might get lucky and get “start” followed by more characters, or even partial words from future outputs. it is very unpredictable. this is because the operating system killed the child without giving it a chance to finalize its output fully. the pipes that connects the child and parent processes might still be containing unwritten buffered text from the child.

note that this example is quite platform specific. signal numbers and availability can vary between systems. on posix systems signal 9 is `sigkill`. on windows you may have different numbers or even different ways of forcibly killing a process. i suggest checking your platform specifics, the python documentation for `signal`, and maybe the documentation of your operating system to ensure you understand how signals work on that specific system.

another interesting thing you can do is send specific signals, not just `sigkill`. you can register signal handlers in your child process and have it do specific things when it receives them. for instance, you could have a child process that, when it receives a certain signal, writes some partial output to a pipe and exits. i did something similar to this when i had to gracefully shut down a complicated server i was developing. the server needed to dump some metrics to a file before it went down. i had an os signal to dump the statistics, close the file and then exit. you have to be careful with signal handlers in the child process as they can sometimes get into race conditions or deadlock if you are not careful with shared resources or other threads. this kind of behaviour can be particularly hard to debug sometimes.

here's a python example of this:

```python
import subprocess
import os
import signal
import time

def signal_handler_child():
   child_code="""
import signal
import sys
import time

def handler(signum, frame):
    print('signal received')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    print('cleanup...')
    time.sleep(1)
    print('exiting')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    sys.exit(123)

signal.signal(signal.SIGUSR1, handler)
print('waiting')
sys.stdout.flush()
time.sleep(20)
print('did not receive signal')
sys.stdout.flush()

"""

   process = subprocess.Popen(
        ["python", "-c", child_code],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
        text=True
    )

   time.sleep(1)
   os.kill(process.pid, signal.SIGUSR1)
   stdout, _ = process.communicate()
   print(f"child output: {stdout.strip()}")
   print(f"child returncode: {process.returncode}")

signal_handler_child()
```

in this example, when the parent process sends `sigusr1` to the child, it triggers a signal handler in the child, printing ‘signal received’, performing cleanup, and finally exiting with a code of 123 instead of the normal 0. the parent reads the standard output and it returns exit code from the child process. as you will see, you get a combination of outputs, both before and after the signal is sent.

be aware that these approaches are very much implementation-defined and might behave differently on different systems. and if you are sending signals to the process the results can be very difficult to reproduce across different operating systems. i would strongly advise against depending on this kind of behaviour for anything production critical. they're useful for debugging, getting into tricky corners, and experimenting, but not for reliable code. that's why it's often said that you should try to avoid these abnormal ways of killing processes unless you have a very specific reason to do so. the most important thing is to handle process exit in a predictable and clean way, specially in production systems. i also recall that on many older systems a `sigkill` could be ignored or have unpredictable consequences. so you want to be very careful with the signals you are sending to the child.

to get a deeper understanding of interprocess communication and signal handling, i highly recommend reading books on operating system concepts. specifically, "operating system concepts" by silberschatz, galvin, and gagne is a great resource. it covers these topics in a lot of detail and will help you understand the inner workings of process management. for system specific implementations, i recommend looking at man pages and official documentation of your operating system. don't forget the python library `subprocess` and `signal`, the documentation for those libraries are excellent. and a great bonus point, you’ll find tons of explanations from users that had similar situations in stackoverflow itself. you can look for posts regarding process management and signals in that webpage.

finally, and i’m not sure if i should mention this but once i accidentally sent a `sigstop` signal to my own shell session and thought i broke everything, haha. it was quite an embarrassing moment. always be careful what process you are sending signals to. that's it, good luck and happy debugging!
