Right, let’s tackle this. I remember a project back in 2018—a small indie game studio wanting to experiment with in-game assets. They’d heard about these nascent NFTs and wanted to see if they could tie virtual swords and shields to them. It wasn't exactly smooth sailing, but it gave me a solid, practical understanding of how non-fungible tokens can be linked to digital products. So, let me lay out the essentials and a few nuances I picked up along the way.

Essentially, NFTs act as a unique, verifiable proof of ownership for a digital item. Think of it like a digital certificate of authenticity, but instead of being issued by a central authority, it's recorded on a blockchain. This record isn't just for visual art, as many assume; it can be for any unique digital asset. This includes in-game items, digital music tracks, virtual real estate, and even access keys to premium online content.

The link isn't directly forged between the NFT and the digital product itself, but rather through the NFT’s metadata. This is crucial. An NFT, in its simplest form, is a record on a blockchain—a unique token ID along with some additional data. Most of that 'additional data' points towards another location – often a server, a decentralized storage solution (like IPFS), or even a simple URL – where the actual digital product resides. The metadata acts as a descriptor and also an identifier, directing anyone checking the NFT to the associated digital content.

Now, let’s dissect that process a little. When you mint an NFT, you're essentially creating this record, including a reference point to your digital product. This reference is typically a URL or a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) within the metadata, alongside potentially other info about the item, like its name, attributes, or owner history. It’s the interplay of the token’s unique identity on the blockchain and this reference that allows the link to function.

For instance, if we consider a digital art piece, the NFT doesn't contain the image data directly. It points to a location hosting that image – often on an IPFS node to guarantee persistence, avoiding link rot – and the blockchain record just certifies ownership of the token linked to that URL.

Here are three conceptual code snippets to illustrate these principles. Remember these are simplified examples to help grasp the core concepts and wouldn't represent a full-fledged implementation:

```python
# Example 1: Simple NFT metadata generation (Python-like pseudocode)
def generate_metadata(product_id, product_name, image_url):
    metadata = {
        "name": product_name,
        "description": f"Unique digital product {product_name} with id: {product_id}",
        "image": image_url,
        "attributes": [ {"trait_type": "id", "value": product_id} ]
    }
    return metadata

product_id = "a123b456"
product_name = "Legendary Sword"
image_url = "ipfs://hash-of-sword-image"  # hypothetical IPFS link

metadata = generate_metadata(product_id, product_name, image_url)
print(metadata)
# Output (simplified):
# {'name': 'Legendary Sword', 'description': 'Unique digital product Legendary Sword with id: a123b456', 'image': 'ipfs://hash-of-sword-image', 'attributes': [{'trait_type': 'id', 'value': 'a123b456'}]}

# In this example, we simulate the creation of metadata which includes a link to a hypothetical image location on IPFS. This is what gets associated with the NFT.
```

Here's another, a more practical example involving a simple smart contract function (using a Solidity-like syntax):

```solidity
// Example 2: Solidity-like contract function for minting NFT
contract SimpleNFT {
  mapping(uint256 => string) public tokenURIs;
  uint256 public nextTokenId = 0;

  function mintNFT(string memory _tokenURI) public returns (uint256) {
      uint256 newTokenId = nextTokenId++;
      tokenURIs[newTokenId] = _tokenURI;
      // (Further logic to assign the NFT ownership omitted)
      return newTokenId;
  }

  function getTokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns(string memory){
    return tokenURIs[_tokenId];
  }
}

// Usage (hypothetically via a web3 library interacting with the contract)

//  Let's say a smart contract exists and you want to create an NFT for a specific digital item.
//
// string tokenURI =  "https://my-digital-store/item-a123b456"; // Could be IPFS too

//  uint256 tokenId = contractInstance.mintNFT(tokenURI);  // This would call the function.

//   string retrievedTokenUri = contractInstance.getTokenURI(tokenId); // To retrieve the stored URI by ID
// In this example, we use a tokenURI variable to point to the product data. A contract function would store this.
// The critical part is that the smart contract associates the tokenId with a location, not the data.
```

Lastly, an example demonstrating how one might check for the existence of the digital product link via code:

```javascript
// Example 3: Fetching NFT metadata using javascript (Simplified)
async function fetchMetadata(nftTokenId, contractAddress, abi) {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_URL"); // Connect to blockchain node
  const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, provider);

  try {
    const tokenUri = await contract.getTokenURI(nftTokenId);  //Assume SimpleNFT contract as in the previous example
    console.log("Retrieved Token URI:", tokenUri);
    // Now use tokenUri (e.g. for display or other operations)
      const response = await fetch(tokenUri);
      const metadata = await response.json();
      console.log("Metadata:", metadata)
       return metadata;

  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching metadata:", error);
    return null;
  }
}
// Example call:
// const contractAddress = "0x....your_contract_address..."
// const abi = [...your contract's ABI...]
// fetchMetadata(1, contractAddress, abi) //Replace 1 with token ID to be checked

//Here, we use javascript with a web3 library to interact with the blockchain to fetch the metadata associated with the NFT.
//Then we retrieve the actual data, which might be stored as JSON or other structured data.
```
These are simplified, of course. Real-world systems would involve far more complex smart contracts, security considerations, and scalability challenges.

The core concept to grasp here is that the NFT itself isn't the digital product. It's the immutable and unique pointer or identifier to that product, verified on a blockchain. This system of ownership is what gives NFTs their value and applicability.

It's not a perfect system. The persistence of the linked content is not guaranteed. If a host shuts down or decides to remove the content linked in the metadata, the NFT becomes effectively worthless in a practical sense, although the ownership record persists. This is why decentralization of the storage via IPFS or similar systems has become so popular – the idea is to minimize the single point of failure in the link.

If you're looking to deepen your knowledge, I'd suggest you explore:

*   **"Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopoulos** – This book offers a strong foundation for understanding the blockchain underpinnings, which is essential for grasping how NFTs operate.
*   **Ethereum Documentation:** Read the documentation available from the Ethereum foundation (ethereum.org) – it's the definitive source for how Ethereum, where many NFTs are created, works.
*  **EIP-721 and EIP-1155 standard documents:** These Ethereum Improvement Proposals detail the core technical specs for creating NFTs, and are a must-read for developers working with the technology.

Understanding how NFTs reference digital products is key to appreciating their potential, and their limitations. It's a connection established through metadata and a unique blockchain identifier, not direct embedding. And as the technology evolves, I'm sure we will see even more complex and nuanced ways of linking them. It's a field to keep a very close eye on.
