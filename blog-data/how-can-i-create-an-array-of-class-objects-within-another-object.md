Alright,  It's a common scenario, and I’ve definitely seen it crop up in a few projects over the years – most notably a large-scale simulation engine I worked on back in my 'pre-cloud' days. We needed to model a system of interacting entities, and having an array of object instances within another object was crucial for managing that complexity. The trick isn't just about syntax, it's also about understanding resource management and object lifetimes.

You're asking about embedding an array of class objects within a containing object, and there are multiple ways to approach this, each with its own set of trade-offs. We're not just dealing with simple primitive types; we're dealing with the instantiation of classes, which means considering constructors, destructors, and memory allocation.

The most fundamental way is to use a statically-sized array within the containing object. This is straightforward, but less flexible. You declare the array as a member variable of the containing class, specifying the size directly. The upside here is simplicity; the memory for these objects is allocated along with the parent object. The downside is that you must know the exact size at compile time and cannot dynamically resize later on, which, in many cases, can be a problem.

Here’s a conceptual code example using C++, since it's quite explicit with memory management and demonstrates the underlying mechanics effectively:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class MyObject {
public:
    int id;
    std::string name;

    MyObject(int id, const std::string& name) : id(id), name(name) {
      std::cout << "MyObject constructor called for id: " << id << std::endl;
    }
    ~MyObject() {
      std::cout << "MyObject destructor called for id: " << id << std::endl;
    }
};


class ContainerObject {
public:
    MyObject objects[5]; // Static array of MyObject

    ContainerObject(){
        // Initializing each object in the array
        for (int i=0; i<5; ++i) {
            objects[i] = MyObject(i, "Object_" + std::to_string(i));
        }
    }
    ~ContainerObject() {
      std::cout << "ContainerObject destructor called." << std::endl;
    }
};


int main() {
    ContainerObject container;
    std::cout << "Container Object Created" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `ContainerObject` directly contains a fixed-size array of `MyObject`. When the `ContainerObject` is created, the constructor initializes each `MyObject` in the array. You'll notice that destructors are called implicitly. This approach is efficient in terms of memory layout but, as mentioned, lacks the ability to scale the size of the array at runtime. If you need dynamic resizing, you'd want to avoid this, unless there’s a known upper bound that is unlikely to be exceeded.

A more flexible approach involves dynamically allocating the array using raw pointers and the `new` keyword (or its equivalent in other languages). This provides the ability to set the size of the array at runtime, but you then have the responsibility of deallocating the memory when the `ContainerObject` goes out of scope to prevent memory leaks. This is where the idea of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) comes into play, and where smart pointers come into help, however to illustrate the core mechanism, I will use manual allocation and deallocation for clarity.

Here's an example of how dynamic allocation can be used, again in C++ for its clarity in memory management:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class MyObject {
public:
    int id;
    std::string name;

    MyObject(int id, const std::string& name) : id(id), name(name) {
        std::cout << "MyObject constructor called for id: " << id << std::endl;
    }
    ~MyObject() {
        std::cout << "MyObject destructor called for id: " << id << std::endl;
    }
};

class ContainerObject {
public:
    MyObject* objects;
    int arraySize;

    ContainerObject(int size) : arraySize(size) {
        objects = new MyObject[size];
        for (int i=0; i<size; ++i) {
            objects[i] = MyObject(i, "Dynamic_Object_" + std::to_string(i));
        }
    }

    ~ContainerObject() {
        std::cout << "ContainerObject destructor called." << std::endl;
        delete[] objects; // Deallocate the dynamic array
    }
};


int main() {
    ContainerObject container(7);
    std::cout << "Container Object Created with 7 elements" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the `objects` member is now a pointer, and memory for the array is allocated in the constructor of `ContainerObject` using `new MyObject[size]`. Crucially, the destructor deallocates the allocated memory using `delete[] objects` to prevent memory leaks. Without this, your program would gradually consume more and more memory over time, which is a serious problem for long running applications.

Lastly, the modern approach, and generally the preferred one in many languages, is to use collection classes, like `std::vector` in C++, `List<T>` in C#, or `ArrayList` in Java. These handle memory management for you and offer dynamic resizing, all while being type-safe. You get all the benefits of dynamic allocation without having to deal with raw pointers and the possibility of introducing memory leaks, and in most cases they come with convenience methods for common operations like sorting, searching, etc.

Here's an example with `std::vector`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

class MyObject {
public:
    int id;
    std::string name;

    MyObject(int id, const std::string& name) : id(id), name(name) {
        std::cout << "MyObject constructor called for id: " << id << std::endl;
    }
    ~MyObject() {
        std::cout << "MyObject destructor called for id: " << id << std::endl;
    }
};

class ContainerObject {
public:
    std::vector<MyObject> objects;

    ContainerObject(int size){
        objects.reserve(size); // Reserve the memory upfront
        for (int i = 0; i< size; i++) {
            objects.emplace_back(i, "Vector_Object_" + std::to_string(i));
        }
    }

    ~ContainerObject() {
      std::cout << "ContainerObject destructor called." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
  ContainerObject container(4);
  std::cout << "Container object created with vector." << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

The `std::vector` handles memory allocation and deallocation, and also allows you to add new elements on the fly. The `emplace_back` method constructs the object directly in place within the vector, which is generally more efficient than copy construction. In my experience, this approach is almost always the way to go unless you have extremely specific performance or memory requirements that necessitate working with raw pointers.

For learning about these practices and delving deeper into the complexities of memory management, I recommend looking at Scott Meyers' "Effective C++" series, and for a more theoretical foundation, the classic texts on algorithms and data structures, such as "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen et al. For Java, "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch is an exceptional resource. Understanding the underlying principles of how memory works and how to handle it efficiently is fundamental for robust software development, so don’t shy away from the more technically inclined sources.
