Alright, let’s unpack this. I’ve actually encountered this type of matrix manipulation a number of times, particularly when working with adjacency matrices in graph algorithms and certain image processing tasks. The challenge, as you've framed it, isn’t just about identifying similar elements—it's about merging them while guaranteeing no duplicates sneak in. It might seem straightforward, but depending on what ‘similarity’ means and the size of your N×N matrix, performance considerations become crucial pretty quickly.

The core issue here is defining what constitutes a ‘similar element’. For the sake of this explanation, I'm going to assume that "similarity" means identical values. But, let's also discuss a scenario where "similarity" can be extended to near-identical values within a certain tolerance. These are two quite distinct problems that require different approaches, even though the overarching goal – removing duplicates – is consistent.

First, let's tackle the case of strictly identical values. The most efficient method I've found often involves utilizing a set data structure. Sets inherently disallow duplicates and offer efficient membership testing. Our strategy is to iterate over the matrix, adding each element to a set. If an element is already in the set, we effectively ignore it, achieving the de-duplication implicitly. To maintain a clean matrix form after de-duplication, we need to create a new flattened list of unique elements which can then be restructured into a matrix or other data form if needed.

Here’s a python code snippet to demonstrate that process:

```python
import numpy as np

def deduplicate_matrix_identical(matrix):
  """
  Combines identical elements in an N x N matrix, removing duplicates.

  Args:
      matrix: A numpy N x N matrix.

  Returns:
      A flattened numpy array containing only unique elements from the input matrix.
  """
  unique_elements = set()
  for row in matrix:
      for element in row:
          unique_elements.add(element)
  return np.array(list(unique_elements))


# Example Usage:
matrix_example = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                          [4, 2, 5],
                          [1, 6, 3]])

unique_array = deduplicate_matrix_identical(matrix_example)
print(f"Original Matrix:\n{matrix_example}")
print(f"Unique Array:{unique_array}")
```

This code initializes an empty set called `unique_elements`. It then iterates through each element of the matrix, and attempts to add the element to the set. The `add` operation of set guarantees that only unique values are stored. Finally, we convert that set back to a list and then to a numpy array (because you mentioned wanting to keep that format) to return a flattened list of unique elements. This approach has a time complexity of *O(N<sup>2</sup>)*, where *N* is the dimension of the matrix. This is because we must touch every element in the worst-case scenario. But, the set operations (add, membership check) are done in average case *O(1)*. So in practice it is fast.

Now, let’s address the more nuanced case of "near-identical" elements. This is much trickier. We need to define a tolerance level and a similarity metric. For the purposes of this example, let's assume we define "similarity" as elements being within a certain *epsilon* value of each other. We cannot use sets directly since floating point comparisons can be tricky due to precision limitations. This would require more sophisticated clustering or proximity algorithms. One straightforward approach, though not optimal for massive datasets, is to create a list of ‘cluster representatives.’ For each matrix element we encounter, we check if it’s within the tolerance level of any existing representative. If it is, we don’t add it. If not, it becomes a new representative.

Here's a Python implementation using that methodology, taking the first unique encountered element within a neighborhood as representative:

```python
import numpy as np

def deduplicate_matrix_approximate(matrix, epsilon):
  """
  Combines near-identical elements in an N x N matrix, removing duplicates
  within a specified tolerance.

  Args:
      matrix: A numpy N x N matrix.
      epsilon: The tolerance value to determine similarity.

  Returns:
      A flattened numpy array containing unique representative elements.
  """
  representatives = []
  for row in matrix:
    for element in row:
      is_duplicate = False
      for rep in representatives:
        if abs(element - rep) <= epsilon:
          is_duplicate = True
          break
      if not is_duplicate:
        representatives.append(element)
  return np.array(representatives)

# Example Usage:
matrix_approx_example = np.array([[1.0, 1.1, 3.0],
                              [4.2, 2.9, 5.1],
                              [0.9, 6.1, 3.0]])
epsilon_value = 0.2
unique_approx_array = deduplicate_matrix_approximate(matrix_approx_example, epsilon_value)
print(f"Original Matrix:\n{matrix_approx_example}")
print(f"Unique Approximate Array:{unique_approx_array}")
```

This function, `deduplicate_matrix_approximate`, iterates over each element in the matrix. For each element, it compares its value against already identified representatives. If the element is within the specified `epsilon` range of any representative, the algorithm skips it. Otherwise, it adds this element to `representatives` list. It then returns those representatives in numpy array form. Notice, this algorithm has a nested loop which results in a time complexity of *O(M * N<sup>2</sup>)* in the worst case, where *M* is number of unique representative and *N* is the dimension of input matrix. This is less efficient compared to the first approach, especially if `M` is closer to *N<sup>2</sup>*.

A more sophisticated approach when dealing with "near identical" values is clustering algorithms like k-means, DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering. While their implementations are more involved, they can provide better clustering and grouping when elements have a more complex spatial distribution, rather than relying on just epsilon bounds. For very large matrices and very stringent performance requirements, considering parallel processing techniques, using libraries like Dask, can further speed-up execution.

Lastly, for some domain specific matrix de-duplication scenarios, the concept of ‘locality sensitive hashing’ (LSH) might be useful, especially when ‘similarity’ means more than just numerical proximity, as may happen when comparing vectors or feature sets stored in matrices. LSH is a set of techniques that map similar input items to the same ‘buckets’ with a high probability, allowing faster lookup and de-duplication of near-duplicate entries.

To understand more about these concepts, I recommend checking out *“Data Clustering: Algorithms and Applications”* by Charu C. Aggarwal and *“Mining of Massive Datasets”* by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman and Jeff Ullman for in-depth discussions on clustering and locality sensitive hashing. The *NumPy documentation* is also an essential resource for understanding data manipulation capabilities within the python ecosystem. I would also point you towards *“Introduction to Algorithms”* by Thomas H. Cormen et al. for more detail on time-complexity analysis, which is key when scaling up these kind of operations.

The key take away is that understanding the notion of 'similarity' is paramount. For simple identical matches, sets provide an elegant solution. When 'similarity' involves tolerances, you have to choose your solution based on the problem scale and the type of analysis that needs to be done. Knowing the time-complexity of algorithms also plays a key role in choosing the solution that best fits your scenario. Remember that performance is not just about getting something done, but doing it efficiently, especially when you're dealing with large-scale datasets.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

def deduplicate_matrix_kmeans(matrix, n_clusters):
  """
  Combines similar elements in an N x N matrix using k-means clustering.

  Args:
      matrix: A numpy N x N matrix.
      n_clusters: The number of clusters to find.

  Returns:
      A numpy array containing the centroids of each cluster.
  """
  flattened_matrix = matrix.flatten().reshape(-1, 1)
  kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=0, n_init=10)
  kmeans.fit(flattened_matrix)
  return kmeans.cluster_centers_.flatten()

# Example Usage:
matrix_kmeans_example = np.array([[1.0, 1.2, 3.1],
                          [4.2, 2.8, 5.0],
                          [0.8, 6.2, 3.2]])
n_clusters_val = 3
unique_kmeans_array = deduplicate_matrix_kmeans(matrix_kmeans_example, n_clusters_val)
print(f"Original Matrix:\n{matrix_kmeans_example}")
print(f"Unique Kmeans Array:{unique_kmeans_array}")
```

This last snippet, `deduplicate_matrix_kmeans`, provides a more advanced technique to handle near-duplicate cases. The code takes a matrix and the desired number of clusters as input. It first flattens the input matrix and then uses sklearn’s `KMeans` implementation to cluster elements into `n_clusters` groups. It returns the centroid values of those clusters. K-means is significantly more computationally intensive and has a worst case time complexity of *O(k * n * i)*, where *k* is the number of clusters, *n* is the number of input points and *i* is number of iterations. This approach needs careful selection of *k* and often requires some experimentation.
