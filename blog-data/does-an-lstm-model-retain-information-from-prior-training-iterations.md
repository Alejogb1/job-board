Okay, let's unpack this. You're asking a fundamentally important question about long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and how they handle sequential information across different training epochs or iterations. It’s not a simple yes or no answer, and the subtleties matter quite a bit in practice, particularly when you're trying to optimize your model’s performance and prevent things like catastrophic forgetting. I've grappled with this personally in several projects, notably one where I was building a real-time financial forecasting model. The initial results were… less than ideal, partly because I hadn’t fully grasped this nuance of LSTM behavior.

Essentially, LSTMs don’t inherently retain information *across* independent training runs or instances of model initialization. Each time you create a new instance of an LSTM model, whether it’s after changing a hyperparameter, or restarting a script, or loading from a saved architecture definition, it starts from a state of having learned absolutely nothing specific to your data. The model's weights, biases, and hidden states (which are crucial to the model's short-term memory capabilities) are generally initialized randomly or using some predefined method (like Xavier or He initialization), but that's *not* previously learned information; that's just a set of initial parameters.

However, *within* a single training session (that is, during the training epochs of a given instantiation of the model), the LSTM certainly remembers information from prior iterations, that's precisely how it learns. The key to understanding this lies in the internal mechanisms of the LSTM cell and how it processes sequential data.

The LSTM's memory mechanism isn’t a single monolithic thing; it’s a collection of gates and cell states that, at each step in the sequence, decide what information to retain, forget, or update. Specifically, the cell state serves as a kind of long-term memory that can carry relevant information across many time steps, and the hidden state acts as the current working memory, influenced by previous steps and current input. During training, the backpropagation algorithm adjusts the model’s weights based on the error signal at the output. These weights implicitly encode the information gleaned from the training data encountered *up to that point*, within a given training cycle.

When you're training the model, you typically process your data in batches across multiple epochs. Within a single epoch, the network iteratively updates its weights based on a gradient descent process. These weight updates adjust how the LSTM cell interacts with the input, hidden state, and cell state to minimize the defined loss function. Because the weights are adjusted with each batch within an epoch, and epochs are done sequentially, it retains the "memory" of learning from previous steps in the same training process.

Now, let’s delve into some specific cases using code examples (Python with TensorFlow/Keras because that's often what I reach for in practice). Let's start with a fairly simple case: character-level text generation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Embedding
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
import numpy as np


def create_data(text, seq_length=50):
    chars = sorted(list(set(text)))
    char_to_int = dict((c, i) for i, c in enumerate(chars))
    int_to_char = dict((i, c) for i, c in enumerate(chars))
    n_chars = len(text)
    n_vocab = len(chars)
    datax = []
    datay = []
    for i in range(0, n_chars - seq_length, 1):
        seq_in = text[i:i + seq_length]
        seq_out = text[i + seq_length]
        datax.append([char_to_int[char] for char in seq_in])
        datay.append(char_to_int[seq_out])
    return np.reshape(datax, (len(datax), seq_length, 1)), tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(datay), n_vocab, int_to_char

# Example text
text = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." * 200

seq_length = 50
data_x, data_y, vocab_size, int_to_char = create_data(text, seq_length)


model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, 32, input_length=seq_length),
    LSTM(256, return_sequences=False),
    Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
model.fit(data_x, data_y, epochs=5, batch_size=64, verbose=0) # Train within a single training cycle

# Now let's sample a generated sequence
seed = data_x[0].reshape(1, seq_length, 1)
output = ''
for _ in range(100):
  prediction = model.predict(seed, verbose=0)
  predicted_id = np.argmax(prediction)
  output += int_to_char[predicted_id]
  seed = np.concatenate((seed[:, 1:, :], np.reshape(predicted_id, (1, 1, 1))), axis=1)

print(output)
```

In this example, the model learns the patterns and transitions within the provided `text` and, over the course of the 5 epochs (within one run), improves in generating text resembling the training input. The weights and internal states are being updated based on each batch of data. If you re-run this script from scratch, or even just the `model.fit` call after re-initializing the model with a new `model = Sequential(...)` declaration, the model starts from the initial weights.

Here's an important point about *transfer learning*, a technique that *can* make use of information from prior training, but on a different dataset:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Embedding
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
import numpy as np

def create_data(text, seq_length=50):
    chars = sorted(list(set(text)))
    char_to_int = dict((c, i) for i, c in enumerate(chars))
    int_to_char = dict((i, c) for i, c in enumerate(chars))
    n_chars = len(text)
    n_vocab = len(chars)
    datax = []
    datay = []
    for i in range(0, n_chars - seq_length, 1):
        seq_in = text[i:i + seq_length]
        seq_out = text[i + seq_length]
        datax.append([char_to_int[char] for char in seq_in])
        datay.append(char_to_int[seq_out])
    return np.reshape(datax, (len(datax), seq_length, 1)), tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(datay), n_vocab, int_to_char


# Example text 1
text1 = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." * 200
seq_length = 50
data_x1, data_y1, vocab_size1, int_to_char1 = create_data(text1, seq_length)


# Build Model
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size1, 32, input_length=seq_length),
    LSTM(256, return_sequences=False),
    Dense(vocab_size1, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
model.fit(data_x1, data_y1, epochs=5, batch_size=64, verbose=0)

# Now, load a new dataset, the pre-trained model has knowledge about how words look like
# Example text 2
text2 = "a quick brown dog flew over a lazy fox" * 200
data_x2, data_y2, vocab_size2, int_to_char2 = create_data(text2, seq_length)

# Here we reuse the model from training on `text1`
# but we need to make sure the vocabulary size is correct for the new text data
# or the embedding layer won't work
if vocab_size1 != vocab_size2:
  print("Warning: vocabulary sizes differ. This might lead to unexpected results if the vocabularies don't overlap much!")
  # Here you would want to handle such situations more gracefully, maybe adding an UNK token to the vocabulary
# We avoid re-initializing the model
model.fit(data_x2, data_y2, epochs=5, batch_size=64, verbose=0)

# Now let's sample a generated sequence after training on the new text
seed = data_x2[0].reshape(1, seq_length, 1)
output = ''
for _ in range(100):
  prediction = model.predict(seed, verbose=0)
  predicted_id = np.argmax(prediction)
  output += int_to_char2[predicted_id]
  seed = np.concatenate((seed[:, 1:, :], np.reshape(predicted_id, (1, 1, 1))), axis=1)

print(output)
```

In this modified example, we first trained the model on `text1`, and then on `text2`. This demonstrates how, within a single run, you can leverage what the model has learned from one dataset to another, using transfer learning. The model’s weights have been adjusted from what was learned using the first text to adapt to the new text. But, the training is still within the *same* model instance across the two dataset uses.

Lastly, let's look at how you might load in pre-trained weights, another method to utilize prior information:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Embedding
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
import numpy as np

def create_data(text, seq_length=50):
    chars = sorted(list(set(text)))
    char_to_int = dict((c, i) for i, c in enumerate(chars))
    int_to_char = dict((i, c) for i, c in enumerate(chars))
    n_chars = len(text)
    n_vocab = len(chars)
    datax = []
    datay = []
    for i in range(0, n_chars - seq_length, 1):
        seq_in = text[i:i + seq_length]
        seq_out = text[i + seq_length]
        datax.append([char_to_int[char] for char in seq_in])
        datay.append(char_to_int[seq_out])
    return np.reshape(datax, (len(datax), seq_length, 1)), tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(datay), n_vocab, int_to_char

# Example text
text = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." * 200

seq_length = 50
data_x, data_y, vocab_size, int_to_char = create_data(text, seq_length)


# Build Model
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, 32, input_length=seq_length),
    LSTM(256, return_sequences=False),
    Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
model.fit(data_x, data_y, epochs=5, batch_size=64, verbose=0)


# Save the trained model's weights
model.save_weights('my_lstm_weights.h5')


# Create a new model with the same structure
new_model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, 32, input_length=seq_length),
    LSTM(256, return_sequences=False),
    Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
])

new_model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')

# Load the pre-trained weights into the new model
new_model.load_weights('my_lstm_weights.h5')


# Sample sequence using pre-trained model
seed = data_x[0].reshape(1, seq_length, 1)
output = ''
for _ in range(100):
  prediction = new_model.predict(seed, verbose=0)
  predicted_id = np.argmax(prediction)
  output += int_to_char[predicted_id]
  seed = np.concatenate((seed[:, 1:, :], np.reshape(predicted_id, (1, 1, 1))), axis=1)

print(output)

```
Here, we explicitly save weights from a trained model and then load those weights into a *new* instantiation of the model. This makes it so the new model uses weights derived from previous learning. This demonstrates that we can transfer the learned parameters from one trained instance to a different model instance.

If you’re interested in diving deeper into the specifics of how LSTMs work and how they are trained, I'd highly recommend "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, particularly the chapters on recurrent neural networks and sequence modeling. For more specific details on LSTM internals, consider the original paper on LSTMs by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). Also, “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron is a fantastic practical resource. These are the ones I’ve always found the most useful.

In short, an LSTM model doesn't intrinsically remember from previous training sessions if you start a new one. It does learn from previous steps within a given training cycle. And, as seen above, transfer learning and saving/loading weights are the mechanisms that allow for reuse of information from previous learning processes into new instances. These are critical for efficient learning in real-world applications.
