Let's tackle this, shall we? It's a problem I've bumped into more than once, especially when dealing with geospatial data and similar applications. Nested arrays of coordinates, representing polygons, paths, or other spatial constructs, can become a tangled mess if they’re not properly sorted. Ruby, thankfully, gives us the tools we need to manage this efficiently.

The core challenge isn't just sorting; it's defining *how* we sort those nested arrays. Do we want to sort by the x-coordinate first, then the y? Or perhaps we need to consider other factors entirely, depending on the context. In my experience, you’ll usually find that a specific sort order is required based on the application’s requirements. For example, I once had to implement a polygon simplification algorithm where the vertices needed to be in a particular clockwise order, a task that initially presented itself as a sorting problem.

Fundamentally, when we have a nested array like `[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ...]`, the default sort operation will compare the inner arrays based on their elements sequentially. For example, `[1, 2]` comes before `[1, 3]` in a default ascending sort. However, that doesn't necessarily mean we want to sort based purely on the 'x' or 'y' values alone.

Let's look at some specific scenarios with corresponding code examples.

**Scenario 1: Sorting Primarily by X-Coordinate, Then by Y-Coordinate**

This is the most basic scenario, mimicking the typical ‘left-to-right, then top-to-bottom’ approach. Here’s the Ruby implementation:

```ruby
def sort_by_x_then_y(coordinates)
  coordinates.sort_by { |coord| [coord[0], coord[1]] }
end

example_coords = [[3, 2], [1, 4], [1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 1]]
sorted_coords = sort_by_x_then_y(example_coords)
puts sorted_coords.inspect
# Output: [[1, 2], [1, 4], [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2]]
```

Here, the `sort_by` method uses a block to transform each coordinate `[x, y]` into an array `[x, y]` which is then used for comparison. This effectively sorts by 'x' first, and if two points share the same 'x' value, it compares their 'y' values. This approach is often what you would want when dealing with points intended to follow a left-to-right reading order.

**Scenario 2: Sorting by Y-Coordinate First, Then by X-Coordinate**

Now, consider cases where a vertical reading order is required, such as scanning the data in a raster from top to bottom in rows. Here's how we'd approach that:

```ruby
def sort_by_y_then_x(coordinates)
  coordinates.sort_by { |coord| [coord[1], coord[0]] }
end

example_coords = [[3, 2], [1, 4], [1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 1]]
sorted_coords = sort_by_y_then_x(example_coords)
puts sorted_coords.inspect
# Output: [[2, 1], [3, 1], [1, 2], [3, 2], [1, 4]]
```

We simply swapped the order of `coord[0]` and `coord[1]` within the block, ensuring that ‘y’ is considered first. Note how the output now lists the coordinates based on increasing ‘y’ and then increasing ‘x’ for points with the same ‘y’ value.

**Scenario 3: Sorting by Distance from a Reference Point**

This is where things get more interesting. Imagine needing to sort points based on their distance from a specific reference point, often required when processing spatial datasets that have a defined 'center'. We'll use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance.

```ruby
def sort_by_distance_from_point(coordinates, reference_point)
  coordinates.sort_by do |coord|
    x_diff = coord[0] - reference_point[0]
    y_diff = coord[1] - reference_point[1]
    Math.sqrt(x_diff**2 + y_diff**2)
  end
end

example_coords = [[3, 2], [1, 4], [1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 1]]
reference_point = [2, 2]
sorted_coords = sort_by_distance_from_point(example_coords, reference_point)
puts sorted_coords.inspect
# Output: [[2, 1], [3, 2], [1, 2], [3, 1], [1, 4]]
```

Here, we calculate the Euclidean distance from the `reference_point` for every coordinate. The `sort_by` method then orders the points based on these calculated distances. This is more application-specific, but it illustrates that we can implement complex sorting logic within the `sort_by` block, allowing for flexibility based on what our needs are.

**Further Considerations**

While the `sort_by` method is powerful, sometimes, if you're dealing with extremely large datasets, you might explore more specialized sorting algorithms for performance reasons. Ruby’s built-in sorting is often efficient enough for most situations, but being aware of alternatives for specific needs is helpful. In such cases, algorithms such as merge sort or quicksort might be worth investigating. You wouldn't necessarily implement these from scratch, but you’d choose an implementation or explore libraries that offer this if it becomes performance-critical.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper dive into sorting algorithms, I recommend reading "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen et al. It's a comprehensive textbook that covers sorting in detail. For more specific Ruby techniques, I've always found "The Ruby Programming Language" by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto to be invaluable, especially when needing to understand deeper mechanics of the language. Also, delving into resources that explore computational geometry could be really beneficial if you find yourself frequently dealing with spatial data; a good starting point is "Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications" by Mark de Berg, et al.

In closing, sorting nested arrays in Ruby is flexible. The `sort_by` method coupled with the right comparison criteria gives you considerable power. The key is to think clearly about what ordering makes sense for your data and to implement your logic within the `sort_by` block. The examples and resources I've suggested here should offer a sound foundation to handle the task at hand. Just remember to test your results and be specific with your sorting criteria; it will save you headaches in the long run.
