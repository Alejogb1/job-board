Okay so you're seeing "unnecessary stubbings" with Mockito right yeah I've been there brother let me tell you it's like that feeling when you think you've finally debugged everything and then bam compiler error out of nowhere I know that exact pain I've been wrestling with Mockito since like before it was cool back in the pre-annotation days trust me I've seen it all

So what's happening is Mockito's telling you that you've defined a mock behavior that your test never actually uses yeah it's like having a spare tire and never getting a flat you know feels pointless right and Mockito's smart it's trying to help you clean up your tests keep them lean mean and only mocking what's actually necessary

Let's be real this happens a lot especially when tests get complex or when you're refactoring I've personally spent hours staring at test suites just to find these pesky unnecessary stubs it's a rite of passage for any Mockito user honestly and I'm not even joking it's like the mandatory initiation for mockito gurus

Okay so before diving into code lets get some ground rules what does an unnecessary stubbing generally look like well its when you have this

```java
when(mockedObject.someMethod()).thenReturn("someValue");
// but your test never calls mockedObject.someMethod()
```

Or worse you might call the method with different arguments than those you've stubbed

```java
when(mockedObject.someMethod("arg1")).thenReturn("value1");
mockedObject.someMethod("arg2") // your test here calls it with arg2 not arg1
```
Mockito sees this and thinks hey you never used arg1 what's up so it throws that unnecessary stubbing exception

Now first thing first you want to make sure that mock is the actual culprit so verify your test code call this method this will also give you the correct context for the mocking and the arguments

Here are a few ways to tackle this problem its not always easy depends on the way you wrote your code before

**1 Double-check your test logic**

Often the simplest solution is the best re-examine your test's execution path carefully make sure that the methods you're stubbing are actually being invoked with the expected arguments sometimes it's just a logical error you know maybe you're branching somewhere or a conditional that's short circuiting before that method gets called. I've had those moments where I'm like "Why isn't this working" and then I realize I put the if statement on the wrong place oh boy the memories

**2  Use `any()` or `anyString()` judiciously**

Now sometimes you do not care about exact method arguments that’s ok If the method you are mocking accepts a String and it doesnt matter what the value is use `anyString()` or if it takes any object you can use `any()`. Let me show you a code snippet

```java
when(mockedObject.someMethod(anyString())).thenReturn("someValue");
```

Or

```java
when(mockedObject.someMethod(any())).thenReturn("someValue");
```

Using `any()` is okay for not needing to check the parameters however be careful with `any()` because it might hide real problems and makes your tests less readable you dont want to become the guy that uses any for everything right its bad for your code and you'll spend lots of time debugging later

**3  Verify your mocks**

Okay this is also a solid tip for you and this i think is my favorite verification is super helpful use `verify()` to confirm if a method was actually called you can verify number of calls times and parameters passed to it. For example if your stub expects to be called once you could have this:

```java
verify(mockedObject, times(1)).someMethod("expectedArg");
```
This helps a lot and most of the time this helped me discover errors in my tests instead of my mock configuration.

**4  Review your `setUp()` or `BeforeEach` or `BeforeAll` methods**

In these methods we usually set up the basic of the mocks which is good practice but most of the time we stub things that are not necessarily required by every test If you have stubs in a setup method that aren't used by all your tests consider moving them to specific test methods where they're needed This keeps the setup relevant to each individual test case its good for maintainability. Sometimes the tests change and we don’t remember to adjust the initial stubs.

**5  Be precise with argument matchers**

If you absolutely need specific arguments to be passed you can use argument matchers like `eq()` or `argThat()` or `startsWith()` these allow you to be more specific but the more precise you are the more you run the risk of having unnecessary stubs If your method takes an object as an argument you might even want to use `argThat()`

```java
when(mockedObject.someMethod(argThat(arg -> arg.getValue() > 10))).thenReturn("someValue");
```
or
```java
when(mockedObject.someMethod(eq("specificArg"))).thenReturn("specificValue");
```

**6 Sometimes it's the Mockito Version**

It's rare but I've seen some weird behavior with certain Mockito versions it's not common but it happens if you are running into a brick wall and nothing works you can always try downgrading or upgrading to a more stable version of Mockito maybe its a bug on the version you have. We never know.

**7  Be Aware of Interactions with Argument Captors**

Argument captors are great for verifying complex argument passing but they are a bit more complex to configure and if you are capturing something that was not called well you also get into unnecessary stubbings situations.

Okay so what about resources to learn more?

For the basics I recommend **"Unit Testing Principles Practices and Patterns" by Vladimir Khorikov** it has excellent sections about mocking principles and how to write good tests, the book is language agnostic but its a solid base for any programmer in general. For Mockito specific deep dive try the official documentation but is sometimes too specific, I remember when I was learning Mockito I got lots of understanding from testing blogs that give very practical and real use cases. There are great blog post on how to use Mockito that are not in the documentation. **"Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch** is also great to understand basic Java language and better ways to code in general. Another resource is **"xUnit Test Patterns Refactoring Test Code" by Gerard Meszaros** this gives you amazing patterns and antipatterns with unit tests its fantastic to understand common code smells in test code and how to avoid them in the future

And that's it basically you know its a common issue not something too strange i'm pretty sure with these you'll get that unnecessary stubbing sorted out. If it's still a problem maybe post the exact code you are having problems with. This always gives more context than just describing the problem I know this first hand i've been there. Good luck and happy mocking.
