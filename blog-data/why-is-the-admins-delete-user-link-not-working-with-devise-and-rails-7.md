Let's tackle this issue of the admin's delete user link failing in a Rails 7 application using Devise – it's a scenario I've certainly encountered more than once. When something like this goes sideways, it's rarely a single, obvious culprit. Usually, it's a subtle combination of factors related to how Devise handles resource authorization, routing, and, crucially, the http method used for the request.

From past experiences, a common pitfall lies within how we manage the deletion action itself, especially within the context of a Devise-controlled user. Devise, while powerful, isn't a complete system on its own; it often needs our careful guidance, particularly when deviating from its default assumptions. A basic `link_to` tag, especially without explicitly defining the http method, often defaults to a get request, which rails will interpret as an attempt to view the resource not delete it.

Here's where I often start: examining the route configuration. Devise typically establishes CRUD routes for user management, but we need to ensure the *delete* path is correctly associated with the destroy action in our controller and the correct http method. I’ve seen cases where developers assumed the default routes would automatically handle delete operations from a link and not a form, but this is not how devise operates.

Another, somewhat frequent source of headache arises from incorrect form handling. If the deletion is initiated through a form, the form must use the method `delete` and the correct CSRF protection. If it’s initiated by a link, it must be accompanied by the correct method using the `method` attribute. Failing to include this, or incorrectly applying the csrf token can lead to the deletion failing quietly, or appearing to fail.

Thirdly, there can be an issue with the way authorization is being handled. It’s not uncommon to implement custom logic for who is allowed to delete a user. A common issue is not properly checking if the current user has admin privileges before allowing the delete operation to proceed.

Let's get practical with some code examples. I'll illustrate three typical failure modes and how I would address them.

**Example 1: Incorrect Route Mapping**

Suppose your routes.rb looks something like this (which is, admittedly, simplified but illustrative of a common error):

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users
  resources :users, except: [:new, :create]  # Assume we also use a separate form for user creation
end
```

The issue here is subtle. While this *does* create CRUD paths for `users`, the default `link_to` in your view will render a get request for `/users/1`, which will trigger the `show` action, not the destroy action, which is associated with a `delete` request.

**Solution:** Explicitly define a delete method within your `link_to`.

```erb
  <!-- app/views/users/index.html.erb -->
  <%= link_to 'Delete User', user_path(user), method: :delete, data: {confirm: 'Are you sure?'} %>
```

Notice the addition of `method: :delete` and the inclusion of a `data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?'}` attribute, which provides a user with confirmation. This tells rails to create an appropriate `delete` request when the link is clicked. The use of `user_path(user)` automatically creates the full route, including the specific user id.

**Example 2: Incorrect Form Handling:**

Imagine the delete action is initiated from a form (this is less common, but it helps illustrate):

```erb
<!-- app/views/users/show.html.erb -->
<%= form_with(url: user_path(@user), method: :post) do |form| %>
  <%= form.submit 'Delete User', data: {confirm: 'Are you sure?'} %>
<% end %>
```
This code uses the `form_with` helper, which defaults to a post request when method is not defined, and creates a post request to the user path. This will not trigger the deletion action, which rails associates to a delete request.

**Solution:** We need to explicitly specify the method:

```erb
<!-- app/views/users/show.html.erb -->
<%= form_with(url: user_path(@user), method: :delete) do |form| %>
  <%= form.submit 'Delete User', data: {confirm: 'Are you sure?'} %>
<% end %>
```
By defining method `:delete`, the form now triggers the destroy action within the users controller, and the controller can process it.

**Example 3: Insufficient Authorization Check**

Let's say you have some kind of `User` model that includes an `admin?` method. And you may have the following inside of your users controller:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
 before_action :authenticate_user!
  def destroy
   @user = User.find(params[:id])
   @user.destroy
    redirect_to users_path, notice: 'User deleted successfully.'
 end
end
```

This code assumes any logged in user can delete another user. This is obviously not ideal, and may lead to unexpected behavior.

**Solution:** Explicitly check for administrative permissions before deletion.

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
 before_action :authenticate_user!

 def destroy
   @user = User.find(params[:id])
   if current_user.admin?
       @user.destroy
       redirect_to users_path, notice: 'User deleted successfully.'
   else
      redirect_to users_path, alert: 'Unauthorized to delete users.'
   end
 end
end
```

This implementation adds a check that the current user must be an admin to delete another user.

These are just some of the common pitfalls one might encounter when dealing with user deletion using Devise in Rails 7. It’s crucial to meticulously verify routes, properly handle the http method for your form or link, and implement robust authorization measures. For a deeper dive, I strongly recommend reviewing the official Rails documentation on routing and form helpers, along with the Devise gem documentation. The “Agile Web Development with Rails 7” book by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson also remains a solid resource for understanding the framework itself. The “Confident Ruby” book by Avdi Grimm is also helpful in understanding the way ruby itself behaves, which helps create well formed code in the context of rails. Finally, the “Crafting Rails 4 Applications” book by José Valim offers valuable insights into the underpinnings of Rails. This combination of practical application and theoretical understanding is essential for resolving issues like the one you've described efficiently.
