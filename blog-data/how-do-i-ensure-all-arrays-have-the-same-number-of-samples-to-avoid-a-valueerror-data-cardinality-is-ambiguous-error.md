Let’s tackle this. I've encountered this 'ValueError: Data cardinality is ambiguous' situation more times than I care to remember, especially when dealing with time series data or mismatched datasets for machine learning tasks. It usually boils down to one fundamental issue: inconsistency in the number of samples across your arrays or data structures, which many machine learning models and statistical functions simply can't tolerate. It's not a matter of just hoping for the best; you need to enforce a degree of uniformity.

The error, in essence, screams that your model or process doesn't know how to align the provided data because the dimensions don't match up. Imagine trying to perform element-wise addition on a list with five items and another with seven – chaos ensues. Similarly, many algorithms expect all inputs to have the same number of records, or, in your specific case, samples. Addressing it is all about proactively verifying and, when necessary, rectifying these discrepancies.

My approach, refined through many debugging sessions, generally centers around a three-pronged strategy: checking, conforming, and, if necessary, imputing or reducing. It’s more of a methodical data preparation procedure than a quick fix. I don't see it as a problem per se but rather a required step when working with real-world data, which is almost always not perfect.

First, checking: I always recommend a thorough examination of your data's structure before you try to feed it into any model. This involves explicitly verifying the shape or length of the arrays using methods native to whatever language or library you’re working with. For Python, and often involving numpy, that’s a simple `len()` or `.shape` check, often coupled with assertions or conditional logic for early detection of mismatches.

```python
import numpy as np

def check_array_lengths(*arrays):
    """Checks if all input arrays have the same length.
    Raises a ValueError if lengths differ.
    """
    if not arrays:
        return  # Handle case of no input arrays
    first_length = len(arrays[0])
    for i, arr in enumerate(arrays[1:]):
        if len(arr) != first_length:
            raise ValueError(f"Array at index {i+1} has length {len(arr)}, "
                             f"which differs from the first array's length {first_length}.")
    print("All arrays have the same length.")


# Example Usage
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
array2 = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
array3 = np.array([11, 12, 13, 14, 15,16])

try:
    check_array_lengths(array1, array2, array3)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error caught: {e}")


```

In the example above, `check_array_lengths` function ensures that all input arrays have the same length, raising a `ValueError` if not. This pre-emptive check is key to catching issues before they propagate into downstream processes. If you’re dealing with dataframes using pandas, the `.shape` attribute can do similar work.

Secondly, conforming: Once we’ve identified that lengths vary, we need to bring them into agreement. There are a couple of common approaches, depending on the use case. If one dataset represents something like labels and another features, we usually need to either drop samples from the feature dataset or reduce the labels dataset, so they are all aligned correctly. Another popular approach is resampling, to either upsample a short array or downsample the bigger array. In my experience, dropping or reducing data is sometimes the best route, especially when you are not interpolating values, where you may introduce noise. For example, if we have timeseries of different length, the best choice is often to trim the longer timeseries to match the length of the shorter ones.

```python
import numpy as np

def conform_array_lengths(arrays):
    """Conforms input arrays to have the same length by truncating to the shortest.
    Returns list of the conformed arrays.
    """
    if not arrays:
        return []  # Handle case of no input arrays
    min_length = min(len(arr) for arr in arrays)
    conformed_arrays = [arr[:min_length] for arr in arrays]
    return conformed_arrays

# Example Usage
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
array2 = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])
array3 = np.array([11, 12, 13])

conformed_arrays = conform_array_lengths([array1, array2, array3])

for arr in conformed_arrays:
    print(arr)

print(f"\n Conformed array lengths: {[len(arr) for arr in conformed_arrays]}")
```

Here, the function `conform_array_lengths` finds the minimum length among all input arrays and truncates all arrays to this length, effectively forcing all arrays to have the same number of samples. This method is often useful when we are sure there is an equivalent representation of each data point across arrays, and it also can help ensure alignment across time series data.

Lastly, imputation (or reduction) becomes relevant when dropping samples could lead to unacceptable loss of information or skewing the data. This is a much more complex topic, but it is worth a quick word. Imputation involves filling missing or non-existing values, which often requires an understanding of the data context. A simpler way can be to use resampling techniques from libraries such as `scipy` to increase the size of smaller array so that it matches a larger one. However, resampling can create synthetic data and must be done with care, as it can introduce artificial relationships in the data. The best choice will depend on the data and the machine learning model being used. Here’s a basic upsampling approach using `scipy.signal.resample` for demonstration purposes; though in a real setting, I would carefully evaluate the signal characteristics before applying this:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import signal

def resample_array(arr, target_length):
    """Resamples an array to a specified length using linear interpolation.
    Returns resampled array if arr is smaller than target length
    Otherwise truncates the array to the same length"""
    current_length = len(arr)

    if current_length < target_length:
        resampled_arr = signal.resample(arr, target_length)
    elif current_length > target_length:
      resampled_arr = arr[:target_length]
    else:
        resampled_arr = arr
    return resampled_arr

# Example Usage
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
target_length = 7

resampled_array = resample_array(array1, target_length)
print(resampled_array)
print(f"Resampled array length: {len(resampled_array)}")

array2 = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
target_length2 = 5
resampled_array = resample_array(array2, target_length2)
print(resampled_array)
print(f"Resampled array length: {len(resampled_array)}")

```

In this example, when the original array is smaller, the function resamples the array to match the target length using linear interpolation, preserving the overall shape of the data but scaling it up to the size of the target array. If the original array is larger, the array is truncated to match the target length. This is a simple example, and for real-world use case one should carefully select a resampling method that makes sense in that context.

For a deeper dive into data processing techniques, I would recommend “Data Wrangling with Python” by Jacqueline Nolis and Steven J. Miller. This book covers essential techniques for cleaning and preprocessing data, including many related to handling missing values and aligning datasets. For more on time series analysis, the classic “Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control” by George E. P. Box, Gwilym M. Jenkins, Gregory C. Reinsel, and Greta M. Ljung is an essential resource. Also the scikit-learn documentation, particularly for their preprocessing module, is invaluable for handling similar data issues. Specifically look into the `scipy.signal` for resampling functions and associated documentation.

In conclusion, the "ValueError: Data cardinality is ambiguous" error is a signal that requires a systematic approach. Always begin with checking, conform when possible (usually through truncation), and impute or resample with extreme caution. These practices, born from hard-won experience, will help you maintain the integrity of your data and avoid common pitfalls in data processing and machine learning tasks.
