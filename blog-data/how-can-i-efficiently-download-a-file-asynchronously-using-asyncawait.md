Okay, let's unpack this. You want to efficiently download a file asynchronously using async/await. I’ve dealt with similar challenges countless times, particularly back when I was working on a large-scale distributed system that heavily relied on file transfers. The key is to understand that asynchronous operations don’t just magically happen; we're leveraging the non-blocking nature of the I/O layer to keep our main thread free while waiting for the download to complete. It’s not simply a matter of throwing in an async and await and hoping for the best; we need to manage the process carefully.

First, let's clarify what “efficiently” means in this context. We want to avoid blocking the main thread, we want to handle potential errors gracefully, and ideally, we want to provide some form of progress indication to the user. The `async`/`await` syntax is the perfect tool for this, as it makes dealing with promises much more readable and manageable. We won't be getting bogged down in callback hell.

The core principle revolves around creating a promise that encapsulates the download process. This promise then becomes the target of our `async` function's `await` keyword. I've found that wrapping the native fetch api (or something similar if you're using node.js) to be quite effective, providing all the necessary infrastructure for HTTP requests.

Let's take a look at some code examples to demonstrate different approaches:

**Example 1: Basic Asynchronous File Download**

This example shows a minimal implementation focusing on the core download functionality. We make no claims about progress updates or sophisticated error handling. It’s a starting point.

```javascript
async function downloadFileBasic(url, filename) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);

        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }

        const blob = await response.blob();
        const downloadUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
        const a = document.createElement('a');
        a.href = downloadUrl;
        a.download = filename;
        document.body.appendChild(a);
        a.click();
        URL.revokeObjectURL(downloadUrl); // Clean up
        document.body.removeChild(a);
        return { success: true };

    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Download Failed:", error);
      return { success: false, error: error };
    }
}

// Example usage
downloadFileBasic('https://example.com/yourfile.txt', 'downloaded_file.txt')
  .then(result => {
      if (result.success) {
          console.log("File downloaded successfully!");
      } else {
          console.log("File download failed.");
      }
  });
```

This snippet demonstrates the use of `fetch` with `await` to get the response. We then convert the response to a `blob`, create a temporary download link, trigger the download, and clean up the resources. Note the basic error handling with the try/catch block which is essential. This will prevent failures from crashing your application.

**Example 2: Adding Progress Reporting**

Now, let's make it a bit more robust by adding progress reporting. This is particularly beneficial for large files where users need feedback on the download's progress.

```javascript
async function downloadFileWithProgress(url, filename, onProgress) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);

        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }

        const contentLength = response.headers.get('Content-Length');
        let receivedLength = 0;
        const reader = response.body.getReader();


        let chunks = [];
        while (true) {
            const { done, value } = await reader.read();
            if (done) {
                break;
            }
            chunks.push(value);
            receivedLength += value.length;

            if (contentLength && onProgress) {
                const progress = receivedLength / contentLength;
                onProgress(progress); // Report progress back
            }
        }

        const blob = new Blob(chunks, { type: response.headers.get('Content-Type') });


        const downloadUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
        const a = document.createElement('a');
        a.href = downloadUrl;
        a.download = filename;
        document.body.appendChild(a);
        a.click();
        URL.revokeObjectURL(downloadUrl);
        document.body.removeChild(a);
      return { success: true };

    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Download Failed:", error);
        return { success: false, error: error};
    }
}

// Example Usage:
downloadFileWithProgress('https://example.com/yourlargefile.zip', 'my_large_file.zip', (progress) => {
    console.log(`Download Progress: ${ (progress * 100).toFixed(2) }%`);
})
    .then(result => {
        if (result.success) {
            console.log("Large file downloaded successfully!");
        } else {
            console.log("Large file download failed.");
        }
    });
```

In this version, we grab the `Content-Length` header (if available) and use a `ReadableStream` reader to process the chunks of data as they come in. This allows us to compute and report progress back to the caller through a provided callback. This gives the user valuable information during long downloads.

**Example 3: Error Handling and Abortability**

Finally, let's add a mechanism to abort the download. This is extremely important for long-running operations, as you might need to give the user a cancel button. Error handling gets beefed up, too.

```javascript
async function downloadFileAbortable(url, filename, onProgress, abortSignal) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url, { signal: abortSignal });

        if (!response.ok) {
            let errorMsg = `HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`;
            if (response.status === 404) {
                errorMsg = "File not found."; // More descriptive error messages
            }
            throw new Error(errorMsg);
        }

       const contentLength = response.headers.get('Content-Length');
        let receivedLength = 0;
       const reader = response.body.getReader();

        let chunks = [];
         while (true) {
            const { done, value } = await reader.read();

             if(abortSignal && abortSignal.aborted) {
                 reader.releaseLock(); // Release the lock when aborting
                 throw new Error("Download aborted by user.");
             }
            if (done) {
                break;
            }
            chunks.push(value);
            receivedLength += value.length;


             if (contentLength && onProgress) {
                const progress = receivedLength / contentLength;
                onProgress(progress); // Report progress back
            }
        }


        const blob = new Blob(chunks, { type: response.headers.get('Content-Type') });
        const downloadUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
        const a = document.createElement('a');
        a.href = downloadUrl;
        a.download = filename;
        document.body.appendChild(a);
        a.click();
        URL.revokeObjectURL(downloadUrl);
        document.body.removeChild(a);
        return { success: true };


    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Download Failed:", error);
        return { success: false, error: error };
    }
}

// Example Usage:
const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;
downloadFileAbortable('https://example.com/yourlargefile.zip', 'my_large_file.zip',
    (progress) => {
        console.log(`Download Progress: ${ (progress * 100).toFixed(2) }%`);
    }, signal)
    .then(result => {
        if(result.success) {
            console.log("Abortable file download completed successfully");
        } else {
            console.log("Abortable file download failed.");
        }
    });

// To Abort the download
// controller.abort();
```

This example introduces `AbortController` and `AbortSignal`. The `fetch` function accepts a signal that will trigger an abort event. This allows us to break out of the download process, preventing the download from running forever. Note the additional error check for a 404. Furthermore, it’s important to release the stream's lock during an abort to free up resources.

For deeper insights into the intricacies of promises, I would recommend reading "You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance" by Kyle Simpson. It delves into the nuances of asynchronous JavaScript in a very readable and practical way. For specific details about the fetch api, the mdn documentation is an excellent resource, constantly maintained and up to date. Also, reading the "High Performance Browser Networking" book by Ilya Grigorik will prove very useful for understanding how HTTP works at a lower level and optimize downloads even more.

In summary, asynchronous file downloads are not as straightforward as they might seem. But, using the right techniques such as wrapping with async functions, the right error checking and leveraging `AbortController` enables the implementation of efficient, resilient and user friendly download functionality. Keep these principles in mind, and you’ll be able to tackle most file download scenarios without issue.
