so, you're hitting that frustrating ssh freeze when a docker container starts, right? been there, definitely. it's one of those things that can make you feel like you're losing your mind, especially when you're under pressure to get things deployed. i remember way back, when docker was still relatively new, i was trying to set up a complex microservices architecture on a cloud provider. i'd ssh in, start the containers, and bam, the console would just lock up randomly. i spent a solid week thinking i had network issues, constantly checking firewalls, and even the physical wiring in the server room. turns out, the problem was staring me in the face the whole time.

anyway, let’s get to the meat of it. intermittent ssh freezes when starting a docker container are usually because of a few common issues. i've seen this happen for various reasons so let me walk you through the main ones and what to do.

first, and this is a big one, resource contention on the host machine. when you fire up a container, especially one that uses a lot of cpu or memory, you're basically asking the host to give up some of its own resources. if the host is already close to its limits, starting that container can push it over the edge. the ssh daemon, which is what keeps your console connection alive, will also struggle if the system is overloaded. this isn't like a gradual slowdown, it's more like the system hits a wall and everything just stalls, including your console connection. i have seen this many times in development environments where folks try to run containers in their personal machine without limits. that's usually the first thing i check now.

second, container logging can sometimes be a culprit. if your container is producing a lot of output on its standard out or standard error streams, the docker daemon has to handle that. if it's writing to the console and the system is under load, the process of grabbing and relaying those logs can cause a noticeable lag, particularly with slow network connections. the problem is not even related to the container workload itself but with the container reporting logs, which is counter intuitive at first. that was one of the first issues i fixed when logging in kubernetes became a thing.

third, sometimes the problem is related to the container itself. if the container startup process takes a long time to initialize or is stuck in a loop of some kind, it might be blocking other system processes. this means ssh might get stuck waiting for resources or gets its requests ignored. you can actually see this happening using the command ‘docker stats’ to diagnose how much CPU and Memory a specific container is actually consuming.

finally, and this is less common, there are scenarios where network configuration inside the container or on the host machine can cause intermittent freezes. think about complex network configurations in docker-compose files. if the container network interfaces aren’t properly configured or if there's some weirdness with the docker network bridge, that can lead to unexpected stalls and freezes. i had a bad time where i was using specific dns names inside my docker-compose and the names were not properly resolved, causing several containers to wait indefinitely.

so, what can you do about it? well, let's tackle these issues step by step.

first off, check your host resources. use tools like `htop` or `top` on the host to see if you're running low on cpu, memory or disk i/o. something like this would be useful:
```bash
htop
```
if the system resources are very high, then your problem is solved. then, limit the cpu and memory usage of the containers you are creating. here is an example snippet of how to limit the resource allocation in a docker-compose file:
```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  my_app:
    image: my_app_image
    cpu_count: 2
    mem_limit: 2g
```
the `cpu_count` limits how many cpu cores the container can use, and `mem_limit` puts a cap on memory. this is not a silver bullet since you still need to know the requirements of your container. this is trial and error, but i have learned this the hard way in many different systems. the documentation of docker itself has a pretty complete explanation of the limits available.

next, let's tackle those logs. try redirecting the output of your containers to files rather than having them printed to the console, which can be slower. you can do that at the docker level using commands like `docker run --log-driver=json-file` or you can also do that from the application inside the container directly by pointing the output to files. a much better solution is to use a centralized logging solution where the application or container can send the logs. here is how to redirect logs of a docker container to a file, the file path should be inside the container filesystem.
```bash
docker run --log-driver=json-file --log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=3 my_app_image
```
the parameters after `--log-opt` limit how many file are created and the maximum size for each file. it's very useful for a quick fix in development environments. i remember one time in a past job when we had a container that was generating so much garbage that the host file system was starting to get full due to the container logs, creating a cascade of different issues. after some serious debugging, we learned that a logging config in the application was not set correctly and the container was spitting out debug messages in the standard out instead of log files.

about the container startup process, you need to check the container logs themselves. `docker logs <container_id>` can give you clues if the container is having trouble starting. if there is something blocking the container from finishing the startup process, then you need to fix the image itself. the image may contain a bug or some unhandled exception. the logs of the container will be more explicit about the nature of the error. for instance, if your image uses python and have an exception in the code it will show in the logs.

regarding networking, check your docker networks and try different network modes. sometimes, switching from the default bridge network to a host network or a custom user-defined network can solve some subtle network issues. the docker documentation has a good section that describes all the possibilities and limitations for networks. you can also use the command `docker network ls` to see what networks you have configured and `docker network inspect <network_id>` to see the details of each of them.

another less obvious factor to think about is that the ssh configuration itself might be related to the problem. ssh has different options for managing connections, and sometimes they can cause strange behavior when combined with heavy system loads. a good start is to review the sshd configuration file located in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. look for options like `tcpkeepalive` or `clientaliveinterval` and see if those options are commented or set to a high number. in some occasions the ssh connection is being closed by the server due to inactivity and that also looks like a freeze, even if it's not a real freeze in the server. if you have a keep-alive feature in your ssh client this might hide the issue. the correct values depend on the use case but it is good to have some knowledge about what those options do.

look, debugging this stuff isn't always straightforward, i know. it's kind of like trying to find a specific sock in a laundry pile after a very heavy weekend. it can feel endless. but by methodically checking each of these areas, you can narrow down the issue. start with resource monitoring, then move to logging, then check the container startup, and finally, look into network configurations. sometimes, it's a combination of factors, and sometimes, it’s just that one tiny config detail that you missed.

and please, don't get stuck chasing phantom problems. it's easy to get lost in complicated scenarios when the problem is very simple. i once spent a day chasing a memory leak issue because i was using a very old version of an image and the fix was just to update that image to the most recent one. that is when i learned to always check for the obvious first.

as for resources, i'd recommend looking into "container networking with docker" by stefan scherer for understanding docker network internals. for general systems performance and debugging, "performance analysis and tuning on linux" by david j. andresen is also a good book. the docker documentation itself has excellent sections dedicated to logging and resource limits.

hope this helps. let me know if you have any other questions or any additional detail that might help narrow down the problem. happy debugging!
