Let's unpack this. The rider's list evaluation you're encountering – the mechanism that typically determines, among other things, which code inspections, refactorings, or live templates are available within your IDE context – being disabled is often less a deliberate feature and more a consequence of how the IDE, specifically JetBrains Rider in our case, manages resources and optimizes performance. In my experience, and I’ve dealt with this situation on a number of occasions, especially with large, complex solutions, the core issue usually stems from an attempt to prevent resource overload and maintain a responsive user experience.

Think of it this way: every time Rider needs to evaluate the available features, it’s essentially performing a series of analysis passes over your codebase. With extensive projects, this evaluation process can become exceedingly resource-intensive, consuming significant cpu cycles and memory, often resulting in a noticeable performance slowdown or, in the worst case, unresponsiveness. Thus, to mitigate these risks, the IDE often employs heuristics and safeguards. These include automatic disabling of the rider's list evaluation under certain conditions.

Typically, these conditions center around project size, number of dependencies, or active files being analyzed at any given time. I remember one particularly challenging project with a massive microservices architecture. We had thousands of files, deeply nested dependency graphs, and the IDE would constantly stutter. After days of frustration, it became clear that the constant evaluations were the primary culprit. Rider's heuristics had correctly, though frustratingly, decided to pull back on certain intensive operations to maintain a minimal degree of usability.

The first, and generally most effective solution for re-enabling it involves manually adjusting the IDE’s memory allocation. The default memory settings are often too conservative for larger solutions. Specifically, you need to increase the xmx parameter, which sets the maximum heap size for the JVM that Rider runs on. This gives it more room to operate without throttling itself. Here's how you'd typically configure this within the ide configuration file (usually located in a `.vmoptions` file within your Rider configuration directory):

```
# Example .vmoptions configuration
-Xms256m
-Xmx4096m
-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m
-XX:+UseG1GC
-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=50
-ea
-Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false
-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
-Djdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes=""
-Djna.nosys=true
```
In this snippet, the `-Xmx4096m` setting allocates 4GB to Rider’s JVM. Note that these configurations will vary based on system specs. I usually recommend increasing in increments, observing performance, until you achieve the optimal balance between memory use and responsiveness. You should also look into other relevant JVM arguments such as `-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize` to further optimize performance.

Another key aspect to examine is Rider's "Power Save Mode". When active, this mode aggressively reduces IDE functionality to conserve system resources. To disable it, navigate through `File` -> `Power Save Mode`, and untick the checkbox. It might seem obvious, but you’d be surprised how often this can be a source of the disabled list evaluation. Additionally, consider disabling some of the less critical analysis features. By streamlining what the IDE needs to evaluate, we reduce the likelihood of the heuristics kicking in. Look for options under: `File` -> `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `Inspections`. You can selectively disable inspections that are less relevant to your day-to-day work. Disabling some of these background processes will, in turn, help alleviate the pressure and allow the rider’s list evaluation to work as expected.

Let's move on to a more granular level. Sometimes, the issue may be linked to the specific content of the files themselves. If Rider encounters an extremely long or overly complex code file, it may skip evaluation for that particular file. This is usually a safeguard to prevent the IDE from freezing while trying to analyze unmanageably complex pieces of code. In these cases, refactoring the problematic code to break it into smaller more manageable units can solve the problem. In my experience, one such issue that used to trigger this quite often was the presence of extremely long methods or classes that violated SOLID principles. Here's an extremely simple example of code that might cause an issue, followed by a better alternative:

```csharp
// Problematic Code Example - Long method
public class ComplexCalculation
{
    public double CalculateResult(double a, double b, double c, double d, double e)
    {
         // 1000 lines of math...
         double result = (a + b) * c - d/e;
         //... More calculations...
         return result;
    }
}

// Improved code, method decomposition

public class Calculator
{
    public double Add(double a, double b) => a + b;
    public double Subtract(double a, double b) => a - b;
    public double Multiply(double a, double b) => a * b;
    public double Divide(double a, double b) => a / b;
}


public class ComplexCalculation
{
    private readonly Calculator _calc = new Calculator();

    public double CalculateResult(double a, double b, double c, double d, double e)
    {
        double temp1 = _calc.Add(a, b);
        double temp2 = _calc.Multiply(temp1, c);
        double temp3 = _calc.Divide(d, e);
        return _calc.Subtract(temp2, temp3);

    }
}
```

In the first snippet, `CalculateResult` represents a long, convoluted function, which, in extreme cases, can throw Rider off. The refactored version breaks the logic down into smaller, distinct responsibilities, which Rider can manage with considerably less effort. This reduction in computational complexity usually gets the evaluations working again, with a noticeable performance improvement.

Finally, and this is probably the most commonly missed cause, make sure all your project dependencies are correctly configured and resolved. If Rider encounters errors during project load, due to unresolved packages or references, it can decide not to perform certain types of evaluations to avoid crashing and instead display limited functionality. I've frequently found that a simple "clean and rebuild" of your solution, coupled with a manual package restore, can resolve a host of similar issues. If the evaluation still remains disabled, pay attention to the Rider’s event log or console output. It will often display detailed error messages that specifically pinpoint any broken dependencies or project load errors. A simple example in the form of a corrupted or missing package that would require a restore:

```csharp

// Sample class that depends on a specific Nuget package

using Newtonsoft.Json;

public class User
{
   public string Name { get; set;}
   public int Id { get; set; }
}

public static class DataUtil
{
    public static string SerializeUser(User user)
    {
      return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(user);
    }
}
```

If the `Newtonsoft.Json` package is missing or its version is incompatible, this might prevent the evaluation lists from being generated for this project. A successful package restore or reinstallation will typically fix this.

To summarize, the disabled rider's list evaluation often boils down to the IDE prioritizing stability over full functionality in the face of high resource demands. Re-enabling it usually involves a multi-pronged approach: increasing memory allocation, disabling power save mode, carefully inspecting and refactoring unusually large code units, and ensuring dependency configurations are correct and up to date. For a more comprehensive understanding of JVM performance tuning, consult "Java Performance: The Definitive Guide" by Scott Oaks. To dig deeper into refactoring principles, "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler is an essential read. And lastly for in-depth information on dependency management, I highly suggest "Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation" by Jez Humble and David Farley. These resources, coupled with a mindful approach to codebase complexity, should help you consistently keep rider's evaluation features active, responsive, and available.
