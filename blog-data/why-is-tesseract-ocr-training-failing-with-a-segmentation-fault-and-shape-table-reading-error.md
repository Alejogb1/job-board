Alright, let's unpack this. Segmentation faults coupled with shape table reading errors during Tesseract training – that's a combination I've definitely seen a few times, and it almost always points to a few specific underlying issues. It's rarely just a simple configuration mistake; usually, something deeper in the data or the training process is going awry. I remember back in '17 working on a particularly thorny project for a document digitization service, we hit this exact wall, and it took a methodical approach to finally resolve it. Let me walk you through the likely culprits and how I've tackled them in the past.

The core problem, as you’ve likely surmised, isn't that Tesseract is “broken”; it's usually a combination of data issues interacting poorly with the training algorithms. When a segmentation fault occurs, it means the program is attempting to access a memory location it isn't permitted to, often due to a pointer gone rogue or an out-of-bounds access. The shape table error, specifically, points towards problems in how Tesseract is generating or accessing information about character shapes during the training process.

First, let's consider the data itself. Tesseract's training process relies heavily on accurate and consistent data, including the tiff images and associated box files. A common culprit is **corrupted or malformed image data**. This could mean images that are not valid tiff files, or have odd pixel formats. Another issue, more insidious, is with the associated box files – the bounding boxes. If these boxes don't correspond accurately to the characters, or if they overlap in unintended ways or contain spurious values (negative coordinates, for instance), Tesseract's internals can stumble badly, leading to the errors you're seeing. I’ve found that inconsistent line breaks in the box files is a common culprit for these kind of errors.

The `combine_tessdata` tool, used to bundle your training data, is also a frequent point of failure. If your training data is corrupted, then so too will be your language data output. Let's look at how to correctly prepare training data and perform training.

Here's an example of how you might prepare the training image (`example.tif`) and box files, assuming you're working with a set of characters. This is a snippet to help you understand how the box files ought to be formatted. I prefer to manually make these before the training process as an extra precaution.

```
# example.box
e 10 15 20 30 0
x 25 15 35 30 0
a 40 15 50 30 0
m 55 15 65 30 0
p 70 15 80 30 0
l 85 15 95 30 0
e 100 15 110 30 0
```
The first value is the character, and the following four values indicate the bounding box (left, bottom, right, top). The final `0` is the page number. I would write a simple script to generate these if you need to train on thousands of images. The values should be valid.

Once you've prepared your data, here's how I'd use `lstmtraining` to train, provided you're using Tesseract 4 or later. It's important to note that you must provide both the `tr` and `groundtruth` files to lstm training. This is often overlooked, especially if training on a new language or font.

```bash
lstmtraining --model_output training_output/model  \
            --continue_from training_output/base_model \
            --traineddata training_output/traineddata \
             --train_listfile training_output/training_files.txt \
             --eval_listfile training_output/eval_files.txt
```

where `training_output/training_files.txt` and `training_output/eval_files.txt` contain the paths to your training and eval data and where `training_output/base_model` and `training_output/traineddata` are the paths to your starting and output model. You should also ensure you have an associated `tr` file (text transcription) for each training image. You can generate these `tr` files with the command `text2image`. `text2image` can also be used to generate training images in various fonts. I've used this to augment training data when needed, particularly when encountering rare characters. For instance if we want to make images from the text "example", here's a python script I might use:

```python
import subprocess

text = "example"
font_name = "Arial" #or any valid font
output_base = "example"

cmd = ["text2image",
        "--text=" + text,
        "--font=" + font_name,
        "--outputbase=" + output_base,
         "--xsize=120",
         "--ysize=40"
         ]

subprocess.run(cmd)
```

This script would create an output with a base name of `example`. `example.tif` and `example.box` are then automatically generated from this, and `example.tr` contains the string `example`.  You should have one of these triplets of files for every image you want to train on.

The parameters I specify in the lstm training command are crucial. The `--model_output` specifies where the partially trained model is output to, the `--continue_from` allows you to begin with a pre-existing model, which is best practice if not training for a brand new language, and finally the `--traineddata` specifies the output file for the training, and the `--train_listfile` and `--eval_listfile` point to the lists of training and eval files respectively. I recommend a minimum of 10% of training data is set aside for evaluation, and that these files are held constant throughout the training process. I also recommend that you inspect all the training and eval images to check that the bounding boxes are correct, as an error here will cause problems for training.

Now, let's address why a segmentation fault may occur during the reading of the shape table. The shape table, in Tesseract's architecture, maps character shapes (not individual characters but groups of shapes that may appear in various fonts or styles) to specific classes. Errors here often arise from one of the following:

*   **Inconsistent Data:** If your training data doesn't present consistent ways of drawing characters, for example with varying line thickness or noisy images, it could lead to errors with shape table generation. Tesseract’s internal algorithms might get confused and attempt to build a contradictory table. This is the most likely cause of your error, and I would recommend re-evaluating your data preparation process.
*   **Corrupted Intermediate Files:** During training, Tesseract produces intermediate files, including those related to the shape table. Sometimes (though less often), these files might get corrupted due to a disk error or some other problem. If this is the case, try rebuilding them from scratch, starting again with an empty folder.
*   **Software Bug:** While Tesseract is generally robust, there might be edge cases where a bug is triggered, perhaps due to a very large or very specific kind of training dataset. This is less probable than data errors. If all data-related issues have been ruled out, this may be a possibility to consider and would likely require submitting a bug report to the Tesseract maintainers, which requires detailed information about your data and configuration.

Finally, be aware that the system's resource limits can sometimes lead to unexpected segmentation faults, especially during memory-intensive operations like training. If you're running the training on a server or a virtual machine, ensure you have adequate memory allocated. I once debugged a similar issue where the culprit was simply that the virtual machine ran out of ram!

To gain a deeper understanding of Tesseract's internal workings, I would suggest delving into the following resources:

*   **"Tesseract OCR" by Ray Smith:** This is a foundational text as it was written by the original author of Tesseract and offers insights into the inner workings of the engine. It is not easy to find but worth reading.
*   **The Tesseract GitHub repository:** Carefully examining the source code, specifically the parts related to training and shape table generation, can be helpful. Issues that other users have reported, along with the development team's responses, can provide crucial insights.
*   **Research papers on LSTM networks for OCR:** Understanding the underlying principles of LSTM networks, which Tesseract uses since version 4, can help diagnose issues. I recommend papers from the University of Toronto and Google Research as starting points.
*   **OpenCV documentation:** Tesseract is tightly coupled with OpenCV. Familiarity with OpenCV, particularly image processing, is essential to debugging more challenging problems with Tesseract.

In my experience, these errors with Tesseract training rarely have a single cause. They typically involve a combination of data preparation issues, improper configuration, or an unexpected interaction with Tesseract’s internal mechanisms. By methodically examining each aspect, especially focusing on data correctness and consistency, I've always managed to resolve even the most stubborn segmentation faults and shape table reading errors. Don't get discouraged; it's a common challenge, and with a systematic approach, you'll get past it. Remember to take care to prepare your box files carefully and to make sure you have correct text transcription (`tr` files) for each training image. Good luck!
