Okay, let's tackle this. I've certainly encountered this challenge more times than i'd care to remember, especially when dealing with datasets from various external sources or processing irregularly structured data. Iterating through a 2D array where the inner arrays have different lengths isn't as straightforward as a regular square matrix; however, with a few common approaches, it becomes very manageable. The key lies in not assuming all rows are equal in size.

My experience with this often stems from handling data coming in from, say, custom simulation environments. Think of it: you might simulate particles interacting in a space, and each simulation step outputs an array of particle positions, but the number of particles might change step by step. That's where you'd quickly run into needing to iterate across such structures. The naive nested loop method, where you assume equal row lengths, will invariably fall short and lead to out-of-bounds errors.

Instead, we need to dynamically access the length of each inner array during iteration. It’s a fundamental principle of dealing with variable-length structures, not just limited to arrays, and a concept well-covered in texts like "Algorithms" by Sedgewick and Wayne, which I often recommend to junior developers for its solid foundations in data structures. Let's get into some concrete examples.

**Example 1: The Classic 'For' Loop**

The most direct way is to use standard 'for' loops, explicitly getting the length of each inner array. Here is a snippet in javascript, which I’m fond of for its versatility:

```javascript
function iterateVariableLengthArray(arr2d) {
  if (!arr2d || !Array.isArray(arr2d)) {
    console.error("invalid input, not a 2D array")
    return;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < arr2d.length; i++) {
    const innerArray = arr2d[i];
      if (!Array.isArray(innerArray)) {
        console.error(`Invalid inner array at index ${i}: not an array`);
          continue; // Skip to the next outer array element
        }
    for (let j = 0; j < innerArray.length; j++) {
      console.log(`Element at [${i}][${j}]:`, innerArray[j]);
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const irregularArray = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8, 9],
  [10]
];

iterateVariableLengthArray(irregularArray);
```
This example first verifies that the input is indeed an array of arrays. Within the outer loop, it checks if each inner element is an array; this is defensive programming and important when working with potentially erratic data. It then utilizes `innerArray.length` to control the inner loop’s range, ensuring there are no access violations. The code will effectively iterate through the structure, regardless of each inner array’s size. This methodology applies broadly across languages, with the syntax of the looping construct adjusted as required.

**Example 2: Using 'forEach' (where applicable)**

Many modern languages offer high-level iteration methods, like `forEach` in javascript or similar iterators in python or java. These can streamline the code and are often more readable. While the core functionality remains the same, abstracting the loop control offers advantages.

```javascript
function iterateVariableLengthArrayForEach(arr2d) {
  if (!arr2d || !Array.isArray(arr2d)) {
    console.error("Invalid input, not a 2D array");
    return;
  }

  arr2d.forEach((innerArray, i) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(innerArray)) {
      console.error(`Invalid inner array at index ${i}: not an array`);
        return; // Skip to next outer element
      }
    innerArray.forEach((element, j) => {
      console.log(`Element at [${i}][${j}]:`, element);
    });
  });
}


const irregularArray2 = [
  [100, 200],
  [300],
  [400, 500, 600],
  [] // An empty inner array is valid too
];

iterateVariableLengthArrayForEach(irregularArray2);
```

This uses javascript's `forEach` method, which iterates through each element of an array, passing both the element and its index to a callback function. It has identical behavior to our previous example, the change being only stylistic. The explicit control over indexes (i, j) can be particularly useful if your processing logic needs access to the coordinates or row/column numbers for the operations it's performing. Choosing between `for` loops and iterators comes down often to personal coding preference and specific need. However, for readability, the `forEach` version can offer a more concise implementation.

**Example 3: Functional approach with `map` and `flatMap`**

In functional programming paradigms, we often avoid mutable state and explicit loops. We can tackle this problem using functional techniques provided by many languages, namely with `map` and sometimes `flatMap` to get the same effect:

```javascript
function iterateAndTransformVariableLengthArray(arr2d) {
    if (!arr2d || !Array.isArray(arr2d)) {
      console.error("Invalid input, not a 2D array");
        return [];
    }
  return arr2d.flatMap((innerArray, i) => {
        if (!Array.isArray(innerArray)) {
        console.error(`Invalid inner array at index ${i}: not an array`);
            return [];
      }
    return innerArray.map((element, j) => ({
        value: element,
        rowIndex: i,
        colIndex: j
      }));
  });
}

const irregularArray3 = [
  ["a", "b"],
  ["c", "d", "e"],
  ["f"]
];

const processedData = iterateAndTransformVariableLengthArray(irregularArray3);
console.log(processedData);
```

This function utilizes `flatMap` to flatten the resulting transformed elements into a one-dimensional array. The `map` within transforms each element to an object, containing its value, row, and column index. This approach is useful when we want to perform some kind of operation on each element and keep the result within a flattened structure rather than just processing for effects via console log.

While the functional approach might initially seem more complex, it lends itself well to transforming data into more complex structures or performing aggregations and is crucial for more advanced processing flows. When dealing with big data applications or large-scale data transformations, libraries like lodash often utilize these methods under the hood for better performance as well.

In practice, the optimal method frequently depends on the specific language you’re using, the nature of your processing logic and personal preference. There's no singular 'best' approach; all methods ensure that we correctly iterate over varying inner array lengths. If you find yourself needing more advanced control, like skipping elements based on their content during iteration, you can integrate conditional logic within any of these examples. What i’ve demonstrated here are the foundational structures and techniques, applicable across different scenarios and development needs.

For a deeper dive into functional programming concepts and how to utilize such techniques effectively, I'd recommend exploring "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Abelson and Sussman. It's a classic and still remarkably relevant text that covers these kinds of paradigms thoroughly. Likewise, if you want to dive even further into specific implementations for particular languages, the documentation is your best friend, always keeping you informed of language-specific methods and optimizations.
