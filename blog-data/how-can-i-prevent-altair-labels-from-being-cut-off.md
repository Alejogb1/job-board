Alright, let's tackle this. Altair label truncation, a familiar frustration indeed, particularly when working with complex visualizations or dynamically generated data. I recall a project a few years back involving sensor data from a network, where the labels were absolutely crucial for identifying specific data streams; truncated labels rendered the whole thing practically unusable. We ended up spending a fair bit of time ironing out these issues. It's not always straightforward, as various factors can contribute to the problem, but generally, the solutions fall into a few predictable categories.

The core issue stems from the interaction between the charting library, in this case Altair, and the rendering engine (usually vega-lite underneath) that determines how much space each element gets. Default settings frequently prioritize fitting the visualization within a predefined area, sometimes at the expense of complete text labels. Fortunately, Altair offers several mechanisms to mitigate this.

Firstly, and perhaps most commonly, adjusting the axis configuration can be incredibly effective. I've often found that the `labelAngle` property is the initial port of call. It’s often the case that long horizontal labels simply don’t fit, especially if there are many, and angling them provides essential breathing room. Similarly, tweaking the `labelPadding` can increase space around the text. Here’s a snippet demonstrating this:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['very_long_category_name_one', 'another_very_long_category_name_two', 'a_third_long_name'],
        'value': [10, 20, 15]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('category:N', axis=alt.Axis(labelAngle=-45, labelPadding=5)),
    y='value:Q'
).properties(width=400)

chart.show()
```

In this example, the `labelAngle` is set to -45 degrees, giving our long category labels the space they need. The added `labelPadding` prevents overlap between angled labels and the axis itself. Without this, you will often find text running into adjacent elements, looking quite messy. I strongly suggest testing with various angles to find what's visually optimal for your specific data set. The `labelAlign` property is another option, though I’ve found `labelAngle` more effective for lengthy names.

The second technique involves manipulating the chart’s overall size, or more specifically, the axis bounds. If the labels still get cut off despite angling, it could mean you simply don't have enough allocated width (or height, depending on which axis you’re working with). One frequent mistake I see is attempting to control label size indirectly through canvas dimensions, resulting in unwanted scaling effects. Instead, focus on setting the `width` and `height` explicitly within the chart properties. Additionally, if you're working with categorical data, you can define a `domain` for the x or y axis. This prevents the axis from automatically extending to accommodate new points, which often cause labels to shift and cut off.

Here's another example that incorporates this:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine', 'ten'],
        'value': [10, 20, 15, 25, 18, 22, 17, 28, 14, 21]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('category:N', axis=alt.Axis(labelAngle=-45, labelPadding=5, domain=['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine', 'ten'])),
    y='value:Q'
).properties(width=800)

chart.show()
```

Here, I've set a larger `width` property and explicitly defined the domain. Observe how the labels, although angled, are fully present and the axis won’t dynamically resize to accommodate data outside the domain. This approach is particularly relevant when the axis represents a defined or controlled set of items.

Thirdly, consider label truncation alternatives, though this is generally the least ideal and should be a last resort. There are cases where the label is simply too long, even after angling and adjusting the axis size. In those situations, you can utilize `labelLimit` to truncate excessively long labels, or employ `labelExpr` to modify how labels are generated. These techniques, however, come with tradeoffs, as truncating labels may reduce the amount of information available to the end-user. A better alternative would be to use a tooltip to provide the full label on hover, though this of course relies on interaction from the user. It’s very situational. I’ve seen situations where providing an interactive table below the chart also works to add complete context to specific points.

To illustrate `labelLimit`, let’s examine the following. This is not a solution I would typically recommend but is included for completeness:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['very_long_category_name_one', 'another_very_long_category_name_two', 'a_third_long_name_again_really'],
        'value': [10, 20, 15]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('category:N', axis=alt.Axis(labelLimit=10)),
    y='value:Q'
).properties(width=400)

chart.show()
```

In this snippet, `labelLimit` is used to restrict the maximum length of the category labels to 10 characters. Notice that longer labels are truncated, which is less desirable than the angling shown earlier; `labelLimit` should only be used as a solution if all other attempts to make labels visible have been exhausted.

For deeper learning, I highly recommend delving into the Vega-Lite documentation itself, as Altair effectively translates commands into Vega-Lite specifications. Understanding the underlying structure gives you significantly greater control over the visualization. Specifically, look into the sections describing axes, scales, and layouts. Additionally, the “Interactive Data Visualization for the Web” book by Scott Murray, provides a thorough introduction to visualization concepts that are applicable to altair. Finally, the official altair documentation itself is a good resource, although it is not as low-level as the vega-lite documentation.

In summary, addressing label truncation in Altair is often a question of manipulating the axis and chart properties rather than employing complex workarounds. Start by adjusting the label angles and padding, then experiment with chart sizing and domain configurations. Label truncation should be a last resort. Focusing on these core techniques should prevent most label cut-off issues and enable you to create more legible and effective visualizations.
