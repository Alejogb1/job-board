Alright, let's tackle this one. I remember distinctly a project back in my early days, a rather cumbersome data processing pipeline where we received daily transaction logs. These logs, formatted as sequential files, often contained irrelevant entries—rows littered with specific text patterns that needed to be purged before further analysis. The task, on the surface, seems trivial, but when dealing with gigabytes or even terabytes, efficiency becomes paramount.

The challenge, as with most real-world problems, isn't about *whether* you can do it, but *how efficiently* you can do it. A naive approach, loading the entire file into memory, would quickly become impractical. So, what options do we have? We need to read the file line by line, evaluate each line against our target text, and selectively write the valid lines to a new file. This approach limits the memory footprint and keeps the processing scalable.

Let’s break it down into a few strategies, each with code examples, explaining their advantages and potential pitfalls:

**Strategy 1: Basic String Matching with Python**

Python, with its ease of use and extensive library support, is a natural starting point. The core concept here is to use Python's built-in string operations to search for our target text within each line.

```python
def filter_lines(input_file, output_file, target_text):
    """
    Filters a sequential file, removing lines that contain a target text.

    Args:
        input_file (str): The path to the input sequential file.
        output_file (str): The path to the output file.
        target_text (str): The text to filter out.
    """
    try:
        with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as infile, open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as outfile:
            for line in infile:
                if target_text not in line:
                    outfile.write(line)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: Input file '{input_file}' not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


# Example usage:
filter_lines("input.txt", "output.txt", "invalid_entry")
```

This simple function reads the input file line by line. For each `line`, it checks if the `target_text` is *not* present. If the text is absent, that line is written to the output file. This basic string matching is efficient for simple cases. Notice the use of `utf-8` encoding; it’s crucial to handle files with various character sets correctly. Error handling, especially for `FileNotFoundError`, ensures robustness.

**Strategy 2: Leveraging Regular Expressions for Complex Patterns**

Sometimes, our filter criteria aren't as simple as searching for a fixed string. Perhaps we need to exclude lines containing specific patterns—email addresses, timestamps within a certain format, etc. This is where regular expressions shine. Python’s `re` module lets us define intricate search patterns.

```python
import re

def filter_lines_regex(input_file, output_file, regex_pattern):
    """
    Filters lines based on a regular expression pattern.

    Args:
        input_file (str): The path to the input sequential file.
        output_file (str): The path to the output file.
        regex_pattern (str): The regular expression pattern to filter out.
    """
    try:
        with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as infile, open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as outfile:
            for line in infile:
                if not re.search(regex_pattern, line):
                    outfile.write(line)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: Input file '{input_file}' not found.")
    except Exception as e:
         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage to exclude lines containing email addresses:
filter_lines_regex("input.txt", "output.txt", r"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}")
```

Here, `re.search` checks if the provided `regex_pattern` matches *anywhere* within the current `line`. If no match is found (that’s the `not` in the condition), the line is preserved. This pattern `r"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}"` is a typical (though simplified) regular expression for matching email addresses. The `r` before the string denotes a “raw string,” preventing backslashes from being interpreted as escape sequences. Regular expressions are powerful but can be performance bottlenecks if not carefully written. For more in-depth knowledge on optimization and writing robust regular expressions, I’d recommend “Mastering Regular Expressions” by Jeffrey Friedl.

**Strategy 3: Optimizing for Large Files with Generators**

Now, what if the input file is extremely large? The previous approaches would work, but for better memory management, we can use generators. Generators in Python create iterators, allowing us to process data lazily, i.e., not all at once in memory.

```python
import re

def line_generator(input_file, regex_pattern):
    """
    A generator that yields lines from a file that do not match a regex pattern.

    Args:
      input_file (str): The path to the input file.
      regex_pattern (str): The regex pattern to filter.

    Yields:
      str: Lines from the input file that do not match the pattern.
    """
    try:
        with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as infile:
            for line in infile:
                if not re.search(regex_pattern, line):
                    yield line
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: Input file '{input_file}' not found.")
    except Exception as e:
         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


def write_filtered_lines(input_file, output_file, regex_pattern):
  """
  Writes lines filtered by the generator to the output file.

  Args:
      input_file (str): The path to the input file.
      output_file (str): The path to the output file.
      regex_pattern (str): The regex pattern to filter out.
  """
  try:
        with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as outfile:
            for line in line_generator(input_file, regex_pattern):
                outfile.write(line)
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage:
write_filtered_lines("input.txt", "output.txt", r"Error:\s+\d+")
```

Here, the function `line_generator` is now a generator using the `yield` keyword. Instead of building a list of filtered lines, it produces each line when requested. `write_filtered_lines` then consumes those lines and writes them to the output file. This significantly reduces the memory footprint.  We are also handling exceptions at both levels now ensuring we don’t just fail silently. I encourage those interested in delving deeper into generator mechanics and efficient data processing in Python to explore "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho; it covers this topic in depth.

The choice of strategy depends greatly on the size of the file, complexity of filtering criteria, and the resources available. For smaller files with simple filters, basic string matching suffices. Regular expressions are crucial when dealing with complex patterns. And finally, generators are indispensable when memory usage is a significant constraint, especially for large sequential files. Remember to always consider encoding, handle file access exceptions, and test your code thoroughly before deploying it in a production environment. That's how I approached it in my past, and I've seen it work reliably.
