, let’s tackle this one. From my experience, dealing with inconsistent time across development environments and production servers is a recurring headache, and it usually stems from a few common culprits. It's not something isolated to rails, but the framework’s reliance on server time for various operations makes the issue particularly noticeable. Let's break down the why and how to address it.

First, understand that the time on your local workstation and a remote server are independent entities. They're driven by their own internal clocks and configurations. The most common causes for discrepancies revolve around how these clocks are set and maintained:

**1. Time Zone Settings:** This is usually the prime suspect. Your local machine might be set to your specific time zone (say, 'America/New_York'), whereas your server might be configured to UTC or another standard time zone (like 'Europe/London'). A mismatch here will cause all sorts of time-based issues. For instance, scheduled tasks might run at incorrect times, timestamps in databases might seem off, and any user-facing date/time displays will be wrong. I've spent hours debugging seemingly random failures, only to find out someone configured a server to UTC while using a local timezone. It's a simple fix but a major source of confusion.

**2. System Clock Drift:** Even when time zones are correctly configured, system clocks can drift over time. This happens because the quartz crystals used to keep time aren't perfect. They might slow down or speed up, resulting in inaccuracies. A few seconds of drift are not noticeable in everyday use, but in applications that rely on precise time for transaction tracking, session management, or anything time-sensitive, these tiny differences can compound, causing data integrity issues. This is why servers frequently use network time protocol (NTP) to synchronize with reliable time sources.

**3. NTP Configuration (or lack thereof):** The lack of, or improper, NTP configuration is another big contributor. If your workstation, or the server, isn’t regularly syncing time from reliable servers, its internal clock can become increasingly incorrect. A server drifting significantly over time is more difficult to catch than a timezone problem, since you might not notice the discrepancy unless you are carefully logging times, however, after a while, it can lead to serious problems. It's not just about being a few seconds off—it could even be minutes or hours over an extended period.

**4. Virtualization or Containerization Issues:** If your server is running in a virtual machine (VM) or container, time synchronization can become more complex. The VM’s clock might not synchronize with the host machine, or containers can start with incorrect times if not properly configured. This can create a situation where the virtual environment reports a different time than the host server and this different than your local workstation, adding layers of complexity to the issue. This is especially true if the container isn't correctly configured to use NTP within its environment.

, enough with the theory; let’s move on to practical solutions. Here are some code snippets that demonstrate how to address these points within a rails context, but these principles are applicable across many other development workflows.

**Snippet 1: Correcting Time Zone Issues in Rails**

Rails has built-in support for time zones via Active Support, so you don't have to wrestle with the underlying complexities of timezone handling. However, you should configure it correctly:

```ruby
# config/application.rb

module YourAppName
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.time_zone = 'UTC' # set the default time zone
    config.active_record.default_timezone = :utc # set the default timezone for database interactions

    #If you want to explicitly use a specific timezone in your app,
    #you can set up time zone awareness globally in your application.
    #config.time_zone = 'America/New_York'
    #config.active_record.default_timezone = :local # for local timezone

  end
end

#in any code, you can set a timezone like this:

Time.zone = "America/New_York"

Time.zone.now # this will be the current time in new york
```

In the `application.rb` file, I am setting both the application's time zone and ActiveRecord’s default time zone to UTC.  This ensures that date/time operations internally within rails are UTC based, while your application code can utilize `Time.zone` to convert to other zones. This approach simplifies reasoning about time, especially when working across different geographical regions. Furthermore, databases typically work in UTC for best practices, and ActiveRecord allows you to have consistency in how your data is handled in regards to time. I've seen situations where developers used different time zones for the application versus the database, which creates problems when trying to query records and compare time values. Ensuring both are aligned to the same timezone is crucial. Remember that for timezone aware columns in the database, the date/time is stored in UTC, but when the database displays the record in a client, it will convert it to the time zone configured.

**Snippet 2: Checking and Synchronizing Server Time with NTP**

While not strictly Rails code, here is the command line to check if NTP is working and how to manually run it.  This would apply to servers that host your Rails application:

```bash
# To check if ntpd is running (on linux systems)
sudo systemctl status ntpd
#To restart ntpd
sudo systemctl restart ntpd

# To check the status of NTP
ntpq -p

# To manually update time
sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org
```
These commands check the status of the NTP daemon (ntpd). If it's not running or if the output of `ntpq -p` indicates issues, such as all servers being unreachable (shown by a * before the address), then there is an issue. I always advise setting up NTP on servers. It’s essential for maintaining accurate time. The command `ntpdate pool.ntp.org` is useful for a one time manual synchronization if there appears to be a major time difference on your system. This is useful if the service is failing and to be a quick fix. Keep in mind that you should always try to have NTP running as a daemon, this one time update is for emergencies only.

**Snippet 3: Time Zone Aware Rails App**

This final example demonstrates how to handle user-specific timezones. We will be using the `ActiveSupport::TimeZone` object to manipulate time data in Rails.

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb

def show
  @user = User.find(params[:id])
  if @user.time_zone
    Time.zone = ActiveSupport::TimeZone.new(@user.time_zone)
    @user_created_at_in_user_timezone = @user.created_at.localtime
  else
    @user_created_at_in_user_timezone = @user.created_at # default UTC if no user time zone
  end

end

# app/views/users/show.html.erb
<p>User created at: <%= @user_created_at_in_user_timezone.to_s %></p>

#model example (assuming user has a time_zone string field)
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def set_time_zone
    Time.zone = ActiveSupport::TimeZone.new(self.time_zone) if self.time_zone.present?
  end

  before_action :set_time_zone, on: :create, on: :update
end
```
Here, we are setting the `Time.zone` for a user based on their selected time zone, enabling us to display times in the user's local time. It's important to save the user's chosen timezone so this functionality works as expected. We are also setting the `Time.zone` using a before action. A common user experience practice is to allow users to select their timezone, and store this in a database field. This then allows you to display times relative to the user, instead of in UTC.

To further your knowledge on this topic, I'd recommend delving into "Time Zones and Databases" by Markus Winand, it’s an invaluable resource on how time zones are handled in databases. Also, "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch, discusses the importance of working with time correctly and not relying on system time alone for reliable operations, although the examples are in java, the concepts are universally relevant. Furthermore, the official documentation for `ActiveSupport::TimeZone` and `Time` is also extremely helpful.

In summary, discrepancies between your workstation and server time usually stem from timezone configuration, clock drift, NTP issues, or problems in virtual environments. Proper time management isn't just about displaying the correct time; it's about maintaining data integrity, scheduling jobs accurately, and ensuring predictable system behavior. With careful configuration and a good understanding of the underlying concepts, you can avoid the headache of debugging time-related issues.
