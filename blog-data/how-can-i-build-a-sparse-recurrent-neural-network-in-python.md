, let's tackle sparse recurrent neural networks (rnn’s). The core concept here is to reduce the computational burden and memory footprint of traditional rnn’s by leveraging the sparsity within the weight matrices. Over my years, I’ve seen this become a necessity in edge computing and scenarios with limited resources, and I've had to implement it from scratch a few times – never fun, but always enlightening.

Typically, an rnn has dense, fully connected weight matrices connecting input to hidden state, hidden state to hidden state (recurrent), and hidden state to output. A sparse rnn, on the other hand, has many of these connections set to zero, which means fewer computations and parameters to store. Instead of using dense matrices everywhere, we leverage techniques to store and operate on the remaining non-zero elements efficiently. This can lead to significant performance gains, particularly with large networks. The underlying principle is similar to how sparse matrices are handled in linear algebra libraries, but we’re adapting it to the context of recurrent networks.

Implementing a sparse rnn in Python requires careful selection of libraries and techniques. We can broadly divide the process into a few key areas: sparse matrix representation, sparse matrix multiplication, and the recurrent loop adaptation. Let's break this down further with some working examples.

**Sparse Matrix Representation:**

For sparse matrices, libraries like scipy offer powerful `sparse` modules, which avoid storing zero elements. The choice of sparse format matters depending on the application; Coordinate (COO), Compressed Sparse Row (CSR), or Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) formats are common. For rnn’s where many weight matrices are relatively sparse, CSR/CSC are often preferred because they’re efficient for matrix-vector products, which is the most frequent operation in rnn calculations.

Here's a code snippet to illustrate creating a sparse matrix using scipy:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

def create_sparse_weight_matrix(rows, cols, sparsity_level):
    """Generates a sparse weight matrix using CSR format."""

    total_elements = rows * cols
    num_nonzero = int(total_elements * (1 - sparsity_level))
    
    # Randomly select indices for non-zero elements
    indices = np.random.choice(total_elements, size=num_nonzero, replace=False)
    rows_indices = indices // cols
    cols_indices = indices % cols

    data = np.random.rand(num_nonzero)

    sparse_matrix = csr_matrix((data, (rows_indices, cols_indices)), shape=(rows, cols))
    return sparse_matrix


rows = 100
cols = 50
sparsity = 0.9  # 90% sparsity
sparse_weights = create_sparse_weight_matrix(rows, cols, sparsity)
print(f"Shape: {sparse_weights.shape}")
print(f"Number of non-zero elements: {sparse_weights.nnz}")
print(f"Sparsity level: {(1 - sparse_weights.nnz / (rows*cols)):.2f}")
```

This code demonstrates generating a sparse weight matrix with a specified sparsity. The function randomly sets a given percentage of elements to non-zero. Notice the utilization of `csr_matrix` from `scipy.sparse`.

**Sparse Matrix Multiplication:**

The core challenge comes when performing matrix multiplications, particularly when handling recurrent state updates. The naive approach of multiplying the sparse matrix with a dense matrix or a vector would lead to wasted computations on many zero-valued elements. Fortunately, scipy's `sparse` matrices handle the multiplication using optimized algorithms that avoid unnecessary calculations.

Here’s an example showcasing the sparse matrix multiplication in an rnn setting:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

def sparse_rnn_step(prev_hidden, input_vector, weight_ih, weight_hh):
    """Performs one recurrent step using sparse matrices."""

    # Input to hidden state update
    hidden_update_1 = weight_ih.dot(input_vector)

    # Hidden to hidden state update (recurrent step)
    hidden_update_2 = weight_hh.dot(prev_hidden)

    # Combine updates and apply activation function (e.g., tanh)
    next_hidden = np.tanh(hidden_update_1 + hidden_update_2)
    return next_hidden

# Example:
input_size = 20
hidden_size = 50
sparsity_level_ih = 0.8
sparsity_level_hh = 0.7

weight_ih = create_sparse_weight_matrix(hidden_size, input_size, sparsity_level_ih)
weight_hh = create_sparse_weight_matrix(hidden_size, hidden_size, sparsity_level_hh)

input_vector = np.random.rand(input_size)
prev_hidden_state = np.random.rand(hidden_size)

next_hidden_state = sparse_rnn_step(prev_hidden_state, input_vector, weight_ih, weight_hh)

print("next hidden state shape:", next_hidden_state.shape)
```

In this code, I've defined `sparse_rnn_step` which takes previous hidden state, input vector, and sparse weights and calculates the next hidden state by performing sparse matrix multiplications. The multiplication `weight_ih.dot(input_vector)` and `weight_hh.dot(prev_hidden)` are handled using sparse matrix optimized multiplication in scipy.

**The Recurrent Loop Adaptation:**

Once we have the basic operations of creating and multiplying sparse matrices, adapting them to the recurrent loop is straightforward. We simply need to process the input sequence one element at a time, updating the hidden state accordingly.

Here's a modified example that simulates a complete sparse rnn loop across a sequence:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

def sparse_rnn(input_sequence, initial_hidden, weight_ih, weight_hh):
    """Executes a sparse RNN over a sequence."""

    hidden_states = []
    current_hidden = initial_hidden

    for input_vector in input_sequence:
      current_hidden = sparse_rnn_step(current_hidden, input_vector, weight_ih, weight_hh)
      hidden_states.append(current_hidden)

    return np.array(hidden_states)


# Sample input data
sequence_length = 10
input_size = 20
hidden_size = 50
sparsity_level_ih = 0.8
sparsity_level_hh = 0.7
input_sequence = np.random.rand(sequence_length, input_size)
initial_hidden_state = np.random.rand(hidden_size)


weight_ih = create_sparse_weight_matrix(hidden_size, input_size, sparsity_level_ih)
weight_hh = create_sparse_weight_matrix(hidden_size, hidden_size, sparsity_level_hh)
hidden_sequence = sparse_rnn(input_sequence,initial_hidden_state, weight_ih, weight_hh)

print("Hidden state sequence shape:", hidden_sequence.shape)
```

This code exemplifies the core idea; each step is executed using the sparse matrix multiplications within the function `sparse_rnn`. The output is an array containing hidden states for each time step.

**Concluding Remarks and Further Reading:**

While these examples provide a solid foundation, optimizing sparse rnn’s involves much more advanced techniques such as efficient hardware utilization (e.g. using optimized libraries like cuSPARSE on GPUs), dynamic sparsity, and incorporating pruning techniques.

For a more in-depth understanding of sparse matrices and related algorithms, I highly recommend delving into the following resources. First, *Matrix Computations* by Gene H. Golub and Charles F. Van Loan. It is a foundational text on the numerical linear algebra and includes a lot of information about sparse matrix representations and their algorithms. The scipy documentation for `sparse` is also crucial, as it goes deep on specific formats and operations. The paper "Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding" by Han et al. is an excellent read regarding techniques for sparsity and compression in deep learning. Finally, for a deeper understanding of the principles behind sparse RNNs and other advanced techniques for optimizing neural networks, I would point to papers from Yoshua Bengio's lab, specifically on efficient methods for training deep neural networks.

The implementation of a sparse recurrent neural network isn’t trivial, it requires careful attention to detail and some experience in handling linear algebra with sparse data structures, as highlighted above. Nevertheless, the benefits in terms of speed and resources make it a compelling alternative to dense counterparts in specific contexts. I hope this overview proves helpful.
