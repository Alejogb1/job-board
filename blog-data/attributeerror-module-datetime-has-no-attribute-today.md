 I see this one a lot let's unpack it because `datetime` not having `today` sounds like a newbie mistake but its often not it is actually a subtle misunderstanding of how Python’s datetime module operates and it gets even the most experienced people once in a while I've been there believe me so dont feel bad

So the `datetime` module in Python provides a bunch of classes and functions for dealing with dates and times The issue here is you are probably trying to use `datetime.today()` when it doesn't exist directly within the `datetime` module itself It's common I did it too I remember a particularly frustrating debugging session during a university project my team and I were working on an event scheduling app and I had implemented the time functions all wrong.

We were using it in a function like this I think something akin to

```python
import datetime

def get_current_date():
    return datetime.today()
```

I mean you look at that code and it just makes sense right? wrong and I wasted a whole afternoon on that code I learned that you need to approach datetime objects with precision.

Now the correct way is to get the current date is by using the `date` class inside the `datetime` module and using its static method `today()` specifically you use `datetime.date.today()` and not `datetime.today()` its a distinction with a difference So the correct way to implement the function above would be

```python
import datetime

def get_current_date():
    return datetime.date.today()
```

That will return a `date` object representing today's date

So why is that? well the `datetime` module has a bunch of classes like `date` `time` and `datetime` Each of these classes has its own functionalities and `today()` is a class method of `date` but the module itself is an organizational structure rather than a usable object when it comes to these functions it makes sense when you have had to use many classes in Python but it is a source of confusion for new and experienced programmers

So if you are using this `datetime.today()` in the wrong place it will lead to the infamous `AttributeError: module 'datetime' has no attribute 'today'` error message which makes sense and we can see why that would be the case now that we have reviewed the error

You might also be trying to get the current date and time not just the date In that case you would use `datetime.datetime.now()` instead of `datetime.date.today()` its a common mistake I have seen plenty of times even today and once again I myself have made that mistake

Let's say you need both date and time then you need to use something like this.

```python
import datetime

def get_current_datetime():
    return datetime.datetime.now()

current_date_time = get_current_datetime()
print(current_date_time) # Output something like: 2024-10-27 15:30:00.000000
print(current_date_time.date())  # Extracts the date part: Output: 2024-10-27
print(current_date_time.time())  # Extracts the time part: Output: 15:30:00.000000
```

In this example the `get_current_datetime()` gives a `datetime` object with date and time info that you can then break apart if needed

Now the interesting thing is when you need a specific date or when you need to compute dates that are in the past or future you can create specific date object or datetime objects

```python
import datetime

#Create a specific date object
specific_date = datetime.date(2024, 11, 5) #November 5 2024
print(specific_date)

#Create a specific datetime object
specific_datetime = datetime.datetime(2024, 11, 5, 10, 30, 0) #November 5th 2024 at 10:30AM
print(specific_datetime)

# Calculate time differences
today = datetime.date.today()
days_diff = specific_date - today
print(days_diff)
```

Now I have seen some situations where this error comes up when people try to import `datetime` from another module and the path is not what they think and that can cause errors if you import in a non-canonical way but this error is probably not a result of that.

Now to further your understanding there are a couple of resources that I can suggest

First you should check out the official Python documentation for the `datetime` module they do a really good job in describing how everything functions and it can sometimes be the most accurate place to get an answer and it is always up to date

Then I would suggest reading a book called “Fluent Python” by Luciano Ramalho. It goes into depth on Python's data model and it does a better job than I could to help you have a deeper understanding of the difference between modules and classes and how they interoperate.

Finally another one that helped me when starting to use the date and time functionalities was “Effective Python” by Brett Slatkin specifically the sections about built-in datatypes and libraries he gives good advice on how to write clean and effective python code and avoiding some common errors like the one in your question

Now I also remember once when i was writing a system that handled timezones my colleague tried to use `datetime.today()` thinking that it would return the current time in a particular timezone. Boy was he wrong That mistake generated a series of bugs that took a while to track down and that was because he hadn't spent the time to learn about `datetime.timezone`. So I told him that this whole ordeal was a *time consuming* exercise in patience and precision. Get it? Time consuming hehehe.

So in closing remember to use `datetime.date.today()` to get today’s date and `datetime.datetime.now()` to get today’s datetime also use the resources mentioned above they will be useful for any python programming that you would like to do in the future. And also always double check your code because these kinds of subtle errors can be a source of much frustration. Happy coding.
