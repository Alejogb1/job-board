Let's tackle this challenge head-on. I recall an incident, some years back, while working on a data migration project where we were pulling information from legacy systems. The data cleaning phase was… extensive, to say the least. One persistent issue was the inconsistent use of whitespace within string columns. We had to identify these spaces, count occurrences, and then, crucially, label or categorize them for proper handling. It wasn’t just about trimming leading or trailing spaces; there were multiple internal spaces, varying in numbers, and often adjacent to other special characters. So, I’ve got a pretty good grasp on this.

The initial problem isn’t that hard; it’s often the subsequent handling that makes or breaks data quality. The methods for identifying, counting, and labeling spaces in a column will often depend on the environment and toolset you have available. We can broadly break this down into steps that are applicable across most data processing frameworks, but the specific code will vary.

First, **identification**. We are, essentially, looking for the occurrence of the space character (' '). But the devil is in the details; should we treat consecutive spaces as one or multiple? And what about other types of whitespace, such as tabs or newlines? For simplicity, let’s initially focus on the standard space character. In a dataframe (let’s assume we're using something similar to pandas in Python for illustration), we can apply a regular expression or a simple string search operation to pinpoint cells containing these spaces.

Next, **counting**. Once the spaces are identified, we need to tally them. This typically involves string length analysis, often using built-in functions or iterating through the identified string to count each space occurrence. And, yes, you might need to accommodate edge cases, such as null or empty strings, which shouldn’t return a count of space characters.

Finally, **labeling**. This is where the context matters. Do you want to replace spaces with underscores, normalize multiple spaces into a single space, or flag the row if space-related issues are found? The labeling step depends entirely on the use case. This process might even lead to the creation of new columns indicating the count and category for quality control purposes, which we found extremely helpful.

Now, let's look at some examples, using Python with the pandas library.

**Example 1: Basic Space Identification and Counting**

```python
import pandas as pd
import re

data = {'text_column': ['hello world', 'no spaces', '  multiple   spaces  ', None, '']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def count_spaces(text):
    if pd.isna(text):
        return 0
    return len(re.findall(r' ', text)) #counts spaces, using regex

df['space_count'] = df['text_column'].apply(count_spaces)
print(df)
```

This first example uses a simple regular expression `r' '` to find all occurrences of a space. The function `count_spaces` ensures we return 0 if a value is `None` (NaN in pandas), and the `.apply` function iterates through the text column to count the spaces. We add this count to a new column named 'space_count.' Here, we treated multiple spaces as discrete, separate instances. For more complex scenarios or if you want to treat multiple spaces as one entity, you might need a regex like `r'\s+'` or replace the spaces before counting.

**Example 2: Identifying and Normalizing Multiple Spaces**

```python
import pandas as pd
import re

data = {'text_column': ['hello  world', 'no spaces', '   multiple   spaces  ', None, '']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def normalize_and_count_spaces(text):
    if pd.isna(text):
       return 0, ''
    normalized_text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip() #substitutes one or more spaces with a single space
    space_count = len(re.findall(r' ', normalized_text))
    return space_count, normalized_text #returns count and normalized text


df[['normalized_space_count', 'normalized_text']] = df['text_column'].apply(lambda x: pd.Series(normalize_and_count_spaces(x)))
print(df)

```

In the second example, we’ve introduced a normalization step using `re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip()`. `\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, etc.), and substitutes them with a single space, ` `. The `.strip()` method removes any leading or trailing spaces. The function now returns both the count of spaces in the *normalized* text and the normalized text itself, which is then added as a new column to our dataframe. Notice, we also split out the result, using a lambda and creating a pandas Series to make sure the function’s multiple returns are handled correctly when creating new columns. This normalization technique is quite common in data cleaning pipelines.

**Example 3: Flagging and Categorizing Rows with Spaces**

```python
import pandas as pd
import re

data = {'text_column': ['hello world', 'no spaces', '  multiple   spaces  ', None, 'complex,spaces   and,commas', '']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def categorize_spaces(text):
    if pd.isna(text) or not isinstance(text, str) or text.strip() == '':
        return 'empty/null'
    if re.search(r'\s+', text):
        if len(re.findall(r' ', text)) > 1:
           return 'multiple_spaces'
        return 'single_space'
    return 'no_spaces'

df['space_category'] = df['text_column'].apply(categorize_spaces)
print(df)
```
In our third example, the `categorize_spaces` function assigns a category based on the presence and number of spaces. This is a common requirement when you're not just counting, but understanding the state of the data. Here we look first for the 'empty/null' and then if it has spaces. It then provides a label such as 'multiple_spaces', 'single_space' or 'no_spaces'.  This sort of categorization is extremely useful when creating quality control reports or to apply targeted cleaning methods.

Regarding further learning, I’d recommend looking at **"Regular Expressions Cookbook" by Jan Goyvaerts and Steven Levithan** for a deeper understanding of regular expressions; they are indispensable for this sort of work. For data manipulation techniques with pandas, **"Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney** is a must-read. Finally, if you're dealing with very large datasets and need more robust or scalable techniques, it’s worth looking into more advanced data processing tools such as Spark or Dask. Their documentation is also essential when dealing with these kinds of problems on a scale.

In summary, while the core principle of identifying, counting, and labeling spaces is simple, the nuances come from the context and the specifics of the data. Careful application of regular expressions, string manipulation techniques, and strategic categorization can make your data cleaning processes far more effective. I've found that taking the time to understand the data's irregularities is an investment that pays off in the long run.
