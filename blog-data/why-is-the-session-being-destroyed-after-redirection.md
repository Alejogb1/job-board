,  I've seen this particular gremlin pop up more times than I care to remember, and it's always frustrating when a session seems to just evaporate after a redirect. It's usually not some grand mystery, but more often a subtle interplay of factors that can, at first glance, appear unrelated. From my experience, debugging this involves a systematic look at several key areas, so let's break it down.

The core problem, simply put, is that the server-side session data isn't being carried over to the subsequent request after the redirect. Sessions are typically maintained using a session identifier, often stored as a cookie on the client's browser. The server uses this identifier to retrieve the corresponding session data from its storage (which could be in memory, a database, or some other persistent mechanism). When the redirect occurs, the client is essentially making a new request to a different url. If, for any reason, the session identifier is not properly included in this new request, the server will treat it as a brand new user with an empty session, leading to the "destroyed session" effect.

Several factors can contribute to this. One very common one is improper cookie handling. Cookies, by their nature, have scoping rules. If the cookie storing the session identifier is not scoped correctly to the redirected url, or any relevant part of that url's domain, the browser will not send it with the new request. This can happen if the cookie’s `domain` attribute is too restrictive, or its `path` attribute doesn't cover the redirected endpoint. For example, if your application runs at `example.com/app` and your session cookie has a `path=/`, it should generally work for any subsequent page, even after a redirect to something like `example.com/app/dashboard`. But if the redirect went to `example.com/different-app`, and the cookie had a path that explicitly limited it to `/app`, the browser would not send the cookie for the `different-app` path. This is probably the most common cause I see.

Another frequent culprit is the use of http versus https. If your initial request is made over http and the redirect is to an https endpoint, the browser will not typically send cookies set during the http request, as a security measure. This can lead to immediate session loss after redirect. Similarly, migrating between different subdomains (e.g., `app.example.com` to `api.example.com`) might also require specific cookie settings.

Beyond cookie related issues, sometimes the problem lies within how redirects are handled in your application’s code. Are you making a server-side redirect with the appropriate session data included? If you’re doing a client-side redirect (with javascript, for example, or a meta refresh tag) there could be timing issues or issues with the way that javascript or the meta tag are executed. Some server-side frameworks might have automatic session management enabled, and if it is, and the mechanism is misconfigured, then that can also cause an issue.

Lastly, I’ve seen issues related to session storage mechanisms. If the backend is configured to use an ephemeral session store (like an in-memory store) in a multi-server environment without a mechanism for session replication, the session could be lost if the second request is routed to a different server that doesn't contain that session. These issues can be particularly tricky to identify, as you may observe inconsistencies in session availability.

Let’s look at some code examples to illustrate these issues. Consider a simple scenario using python with the flask framework:

```python
from flask import Flask, session, redirect, request

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = "super-secret" # Important for session encryption

@app.route("/")
def index():
    session["username"] = "user123"
    return redirect("/dashboard")

@app.route("/dashboard")
def dashboard():
    if "username" in session:
        return f"Hello, {session['username']}"
    else:
        return "No session found"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code works fine in many setups. When you navigate to `/`, you'll be redirected to `/dashboard`, and the session should persist, displaying "Hello, user123". However, If the `/dashboard` route were on an entirely different domain, or if the redirect were to a secure https version, that session cookie would not be passed over because it is scoped to the http version. The session cookie’s scope and security settings would need to be changed to accommodate that.

Now, let’s examine a scenario where a cookie is improperly scoped. Suppose we modify the `/` route slightly:

```python
from flask import Flask, session, redirect, make_response, request

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = "super-secret"

@app.route("/")
def index():
    resp = make_response(redirect("/dashboard"))
    resp.set_cookie("session_id", "some-session-id", path="/app") # Incorrect path
    return resp

@app.route("/dashboard")
def dashboard():
    if request.cookies.get("session_id"):
        return f"Session id is: {request.cookies['session_id']}"
    else:
        return "No session found"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

```

In this example, even though we are setting a cookie, the `path` attribute is set to `/app`, and the application is not running under a folder called `app`, the cookie won't be sent when accessing `/dashboard`. As a result, the session is effectively lost. To fix this, the path attribute should either be set to `/` or be omitted to default to the base path the application is served from. This shows that cookie scoping, regardless of whether you’re dealing with session identifiers or any other cookie is critical for persisting information across requests.

Finally, let's illustrate a server-side redirect issue. Suppose, instead of using flask's `redirect`, we try to do a simple 302 redirect with just a string:

```python
from flask import Flask, session, redirect, make_response, request

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = "super-secret"

@app.route("/")
def index():
    session["username"] = "user123"
    return "<html><head><meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=/dashboard\"></head><body></body></html>"

@app.route("/dashboard")
def dashboard():
    if "username" in session:
        return f"Hello, {session['username']}"
    else:
        return "No session found"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this case, although it looks like a redirect, the actual mechanism is client-side via a meta refresh tag, and it happens *after* the server has completed its original request. Because of this, there is no session identifier being automatically passed on the client’s next request, and a new session is generated when you visit `/dashboard`, leading to session loss. Here, using flask’s proper `redirect` function is essential for server side redirects with session management enabled to work correctly. This may vary from framework to framework, so you must understand how session data is handled in each framework.

For deeper understanding, I would recommend the following resources. "HTTP: The Definitive Guide" by David Gourley and Brian Totty provides a comprehensive explanation of http concepts, including cookies and redirects. For understanding session management patterns specifically, research "Secure Session Management" from OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) or refer to specific documentation for the web framework you are using (Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring, etc.), as each has its unique implementation details, which are often documented extensively. These resources will provide a stronger theoretical understanding, combined with the practical examples presented here, that should help you troubleshoot most scenarios where sessions seem to disappear after a redirect. Understanding the interactions between cookies, redirect headers, server-side framework implementations, and browser behavior is key to resolving this common issue.
