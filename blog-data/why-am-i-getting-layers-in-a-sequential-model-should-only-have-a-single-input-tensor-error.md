, let’s tackle this "Layers in a Sequential model should only have a single input tensor" error. It's a fairly common stumble, particularly when you're starting to explore more complex architectures in TensorFlow or Keras. I recall a project a few years back, involving a multi-modal input system, where I ran into this *exact* issue. The error message is, in essence, telling you that a layer within a sequential model is expecting to receive only one tensor as input, but, for some reason, it's receiving more. Let's delve into the reasons why this might be happening and, more importantly, how to fix it.

First, the `Sequential` model in Keras is designed for linear stacks of layers, meaning each layer feeds its output directly to the next. It works wonderfully for straightforward architectures like a simple image classifier where a single image is the input, but it starts to break down when you need to handle multiple inputs, skip connections, or any kind of branching. Essentially, it expects a single flow of data. If, for example, you're trying to pass two separate tensors into a layer within this model, Keras will throw this error because it interprets those as multiple inputs where it only expects one.

Let’s illustrate with some code snippets. Imagine you’re working with a model that takes both image and text data as input. Here's how a seemingly intuitive but *incorrect* approach might look using a sequential model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Incorrect approach with Sequential Model
image_input = layers.Input(shape=(128, 128, 3))
text_input = layers.Input(shape=(100,))

image_layer = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(image_input)
image_layer = layers.Flatten()(image_layer)

text_layer = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(text_input)

# Attempting to merge within Sequential, which leads to the error
combined_layer = layers.concatenate([image_layer, text_layer])

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  combined_layer,
  layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Error occurs during model compilation or training
# This is a conceptual example that would fail, not a runnable snippet
```

In the above code, we are attempting to concatenate `image_layer` and `text_layer`. The problem is we try to integrate the concatenated layer into `Sequential` model later on. This is where the error arises, because `combined_layer` has two input tensors and `Sequential` expects a single tensor input from previous layer. The `Sequential` model expects a *single* data stream; it cannot figure out how to deal with the fact that it’s not receiving input in this sequence.

The primary solution here is to abandon the `Sequential` model when handling multi-input data or non-linear connections. Instead, you should use the Keras Functional API, which provides much more flexibility for creating arbitrarily complex computational graphs. Think of the `Sequential` model like a train on a single track, whereas the Functional API allows you to build a network like a metro system with multiple lines, branches, and transfer points.

Here's a *corrected* implementation of the same concept using the Functional API:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Correct approach with Functional API
image_input = layers.Input(shape=(128, 128, 3))
text_input = layers.Input(shape=(100,))

image_layer = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(image_input)
image_layer = layers.Flatten()(image_layer)

text_layer = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(text_input)

combined_layer = layers.concatenate([image_layer, text_layer])

output_layer = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(combined_layer)

model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=[image_input, text_input], outputs=output_layer)

# This works correctly
```

Notice the key difference: we now define the `model` using `tf.keras.models.Model`, specifying the inputs and outputs directly. The layers are still interconnected, but we’re defining how the data flows from input to output *explicitly*. The functional API, unlike sequential model, allows for input layers to be fed as a list, such as `inputs=[image_input, text_input]`.

Another common reason for encountering this error, particularly for users relatively new to Keras or TensorFlow, comes from inadvertently misusing layers designed for specific inputs, especially in custom layer implementations. This usually happens when you might be trying to use a layer meant to take a single input, on an input that has multiple dimensions that it's not designed to handle. Let's consider this scenario: suppose you are implementing a custom layer for some reason, perhaps for some complex transformation of your data, and you define the `call` method to take in only a single tensor, but you pass multiple tensors to it within the `Sequential` model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class CustomLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.dense = layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
      # Expects single tensor input
        return self.dense(inputs)

# Incorrect Usage
input_tensor1 = layers.Input(shape=(10,))
input_tensor2 = layers.Input(shape=(10,))

merged_tensor = layers.concatenate([input_tensor1, input_tensor2])

# Try to add a custom layer that expects a single input
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  CustomLayer(64),
  layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# The error will occur here because CustomLayer receives multiple tensors
# during layer construction
```
In the above code, `CustomLayer` expects a single input tensor, which it passes to the dense layer. However, in the sequential model it receives multiple tensors during layer building resulting in an input tensor that is not of the correct format.

The fix again is to use Functional API to handle these kind of situations. Here’s how the code would look like:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class CustomLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.dense = layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
      # Expects single tensor input
        return self.dense(inputs)


input_tensor1 = layers.Input(shape=(10,))
input_tensor2 = layers.Input(shape=(10,))

merged_tensor = layers.concatenate([input_tensor1, input_tensor2])

custom_output = CustomLayer(64)(merged_tensor)
output_layer = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(custom_output)

model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=[input_tensor1, input_tensor2], outputs=output_layer)
```
Here, using functional API we directly specify the data flow. And the custom layer only receives a single input tensor, as was desired.

As a final note, If you’re looking to dive deeper, I’d recommend exploring “Deep Learning with Python” by François Chollet. It's excellent for understanding Keras concepts and provides solid coverage of both the Sequential and Functional API. For a more theoretical approach, "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville is a comprehensive reference. Additionally, the official TensorFlow documentation often provides detailed explanations and examples for common errors like this. The key takeaway here is to use the `Sequential` model for simple sequential networks and adopt the Functional API when handling multiple inputs, complex connections or custom layers. This way, you'll have more control and avoid this "single input tensor" error.
