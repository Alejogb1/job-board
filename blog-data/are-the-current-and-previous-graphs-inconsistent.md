Alright, let’s tackle this. Inconsistency between current and previous graphs, especially in data visualization, is a problem I've personally run into a fair few times. It's less about one graph being ‘wrong’ per se, and more about whether the underlying data, its interpretation, and the methodology used to generate those graphs are in sync. It's a deceptively complex issue.

From my experience, the inconsistency often stems from several key areas. Firstly, data changes—obviously. We might be comparing visualizations based on different datasets, perhaps acquired at different timestamps, with different selection criteria, or under different pre-processing steps. The most recent data might have undergone cleaning or feature engineering absent in the previous version. This alone can lead to quite noticeable discrepancies. Secondly, there are methodological changes. The very way we compute data transformations—think log scaling, outlier removal, moving averages, the specific type of algorithm applied—can shift the look of a graph substantially. Small tweaks, that in isolation might seem insignificant, can collectively produce graphs that appear completely disconnected if not carefully accounted for in the pipeline. Then, of course, there's the human element. Changes in data visualization libraries or tool settings, subtle alterations in color palettes, axis limits, or label formats can inadvertently give the impression of data inconsistencies when none exist fundamentally. It can be as simple as changing from a bar chart to a line chart for instance, without any real underlying data differences.

To address these inconsistencies, you really need to get down into the specifics, layer by layer. Let's delve into some practical scenarios with accompanying code, illustrating these points and their solutions.

**Scenario 1: Data Pre-processing Differences**

Imagine a situation where we were tracking website traffic. Last week's graph showed a relatively stable trend, but this week's shows a more volatile pattern. Upon inspection, we found that last week’s traffic data included aggregated sessions across all user types, while this week’s data specifically excluded bot traffic that had been detected and filtered out. This seemingly small change in data pre-processing caused a significant difference in the visual representation.

To address this issue, it's crucial to maintain consistency in our data pre-processing pipelines. Here’s a simplified Python example using `pandas` to illustrate.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Previous week data (including bot traffic)
data_prev = {
    'date': ['2024-05-10', '2024-05-11', '2024-05-12', '2024-05-13'],
    'traffic': [1200, 1250, 1300, 1280]
}
df_prev = pd.DataFrame(data_prev)

# Current week data (bot traffic filtered out)
data_current = {
    'date': ['2024-05-17', '2024-05-18', '2024-05-19', '2024-05-20'],
    'traffic': [1000, 1050, 1150, 1100]
}
df_current = pd.DataFrame(data_current)


# Correct processing: filtering bots on both
# assume `detect_bots()` function exists to identify bots
def detect_bots(df):
    # This is a dummy bot function for demonstration
    # In real-world use, you would have a sophisticated bot detection method
    # and apply the filtering here

    return df.assign(is_bot=[False, False, False, True])

df_prev_filtered = detect_bots(df_prev)
df_prev_filtered = df_prev_filtered[~df_prev_filtered['is_bot']]

df_current_filtered = detect_bots(df_current)
df_current_filtered = df_current_filtered[~df_current_filtered['is_bot']]

print("Filtered Previous Week Data:")
print(df_prev_filtered)
print("\nFiltered Current Week Data:")
print(df_current_filtered)
```

In this scenario, we implemented a filter that emulates bot traffic removal; in reality, we would apply the same bot identification process to both historical and current datasets. The key takeaway here is ensuring *identical* data pre-processing steps when comparing datasets. This might involve re-running pipelines against historical data if a bug or update in data pre-processing was identified.

**Scenario 2: Algorithm or Transformation Differences**

Consider a case where we were tracking the performance of a stock portfolio. The previous graph used a simple moving average to smooth out daily fluctuations. However, the current graph employed an exponentially weighted moving average. This resulted in different curves, giving a false impression of increased volatility when the real difference was in the smoothing algorithm.

Again, the solution isn’t that one algorithm is wrong, but that they're different. The visualization should match the method.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Previous week data (using simple moving average)
data_prev = {
    'date': pd.to_datetime(['2024-05-10', '2024-05-11', '2024-05-12', '2024-05-13', '2024-05-14']),
    'value': [100, 105, 110, 108, 112]
}
df_prev = pd.DataFrame(data_prev).set_index('date')
df_prev['smoothed'] = df_prev['value'].rolling(window=3).mean()

# Current week data (using exponentially weighted moving average)
data_current = {
     'date': pd.to_datetime(['2024-05-17', '2024-05-18', '2024-05-19', '2024-05-20', '2024-05-21']),
    'value': [115, 118, 122, 120, 125]
}
df_current = pd.DataFrame(data_current).set_index('date')
df_current['smoothed'] = df_current['value'].ewm(span=3).mean()

print("Simple Moving Average Data:")
print(df_prev)
print("\nExponential Moving Average Data:")
print(df_current)

```

The code above illustrates the difference in how these transformations operate, producing different smoothed curves. If you are comparing graphs from different sources, pay very close attention to the specific smoothing algorithms used if this kind of pre-processing is involved. Using different methods can mask true patterns.

**Scenario 3: Tool or Visualization Settings Differences**

Finally, imagine that our visualizations of server response times changed considerably over the last few reports, while server performance has remained the same. In this case, the discrepancy came down to a simple change in matplotlib’s plotting options. Specifically, the previous week’s charts had a y-axis limited to a range between 0 and 200 ms, which zoomed into the performance variations effectively. The current chart defaults, however, to 0 - 300 ms, flattening the line and hiding the finer details previously shown.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Sample response time data
data_prev = {
    'time': [100, 120, 110, 130, 115, 125, 135, 120],
    'response_ms': [105, 115, 108, 122, 110, 120, 130, 118]
}
df_prev = pd.DataFrame(data_prev)

data_current = {
    'time': [100, 120, 110, 130, 115, 125, 135, 120],
    'response_ms': [105, 115, 108, 122, 110, 120, 130, 118]
}
df_current = pd.DataFrame(data_current)

#plotting with different limits
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.plot(df_prev['time'], df_prev['response_ms'])
plt.ylim(0, 200)
plt.title("Previous Plot (Y-axis: 0-200ms)")

plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.plot(df_current['time'], df_current['response_ms'])
plt.ylim(0, 300) # different y-axis scale
plt.title("Current Plot (Y-axis: 0-300ms)")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
Here, the change in the y-axis limits affects the apparent volatility. It’s vital to document and review the visualization parameters, alongside the data processing, to avoid misinterpretation.

To effectively handle inconsistencies, thorough documentation of every step of the data processing, the algorithms used, and visualization settings is essential. Version control your data pre-processing pipelines, including visualization scripts. If you are serious about it, you should really be using something like DVC (Data Version Control). It will make such issues easier to diagnose and resolve. Furthermore, rigorously comparing the code and configuration that produced the previous and the current graphs will usually bring the discrepancies to light. For deep dive on graph data, I'd advise looking at 'Graph Theory and Its Applications' by Jonathan L. Gross and Jay Yellen. For best practices in data visualization, 'The Visual Display of Quantitative Information' by Edward Tufte is a must. Those are good reference points if you are getting deeper into the theory. I hope this detailed explanation helps you to systematically analyze and address such inconsistencies. It’s a complex problem that often requires a thorough and methodical approach.
