 so you're asking about how LassoCV handles parameter selection when you don't give it any specific values right yeah I've been there wrestled with that beast more times than I care to admit it's actually a pretty interesting under the hood situation lets dive in

So first off let's just get this straight LassoCV like a lot of these sklearn cross-validation things is all about finding the optimal regularization strength alpha right and if you don't tell it what alphas to check it's gotta figure it out on its own that's the crux of your question

From what I've seen and well frankly lived through when you skip the 'alphas' parameter LassoCV does not just randomly pull numbers from a hat it uses some kind of clever logic to generate a sequence that makes sense For a long time in my early days of doing data I thought it was magic but it's all based on some kind of reasonable heuristics that are actually pretty smart

Basically it starts off figuring out the max possible alpha value that would squish all the coefficients down to zero This is a super important starting point It does some kind of scaling and looks at the predictor variables to calculate that maximum alpha this is the upper bound of where regularization starts completely eliminating all predictive power which is a very helpful thing to know if you are working on a regression type of problem

Once it knows the upper limit of alpha the next part is to create a sequence of alphas that go down from that maximum to something close to zero This isn't just a simple evenly spaced sequence though It uses a logarithmic scale or similar which is cool because that way it tests the more subtle effect at lower regularization levels where small changes in alpha have bigger impacts on model complexity

Now how many alphas it generates it does depend on some default parameter within LassoCV and this will also depend on the Scikit learn version I think somewhere around 100 default which seems reasonable for most cases Its usually enough to get a good feel for the optimal regularization parameter However I've found on high dimensional data you may need to increase this amount to get the best parameter selected for your problem

So it generates the alphas right and then it performs a k-fold cross-validation to find the best value of alpha for your specific problem and dataset it is basically trying out each of these alphas on a subset of the data and scoring it against another hold out set It repeats it across all folds and selects the alpha that yields the best average performance over all those folds

And it's not just picking the very best it's usually looking for the simplest model that is within 1 standard deviation of that best performance the so called one standard error rule It's a good way to pick the most simple model that doesn't sacrifice a lot of predictive power a great feature if you're trying to understand the variables or avoid overly complex models

In my early project I made a mistake of not paying attention to this and ended up with a model that did well on training data but generalized really poorly I was trying to predict some equipment failure based on sensor data I though I found a super model turns out it was completely overfitting I should have listened to the one standard error rule

Now speaking from experience the automatic selection of alphas that LassoCV provides is handy when you dont have a clue where to start but sometimes it's a good idea to specify the alphas yourself you might have a much better intuition or understanding of the data and you want to explore a specific range of parameters or be more confident about the values that are being tested or you may have some prior knowledge about what alpha value may be appropriate for your task

For instance if you have a domain where your features are highly correlated or your goal is sparsity selecting a higher alpha or a range of them might be better than the default range selection that sklearn is doing for you

Here is an example of what I mean

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

# Generate some sample data
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=20, noise=0.1, random_state=42)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# LassoCV with default alpha selection
lasso_cv_default = LassoCV(cv=5, random_state=42)
lasso_cv_default.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Best alpha from default: {lasso_cv_default.alpha_}")

# LassoCV with custom alpha selection
alphas = np.logspace(-4, 1, 20)
lasso_cv_custom = LassoCV(alphas=alphas, cv=5, random_state=42)
lasso_cv_custom.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Best alpha from custom: {lasso_cv_custom.alpha_}")

```

In the first example we let LassoCV figure out the alpha range and select the optimal value on its own On the second I have defined my own alpha range and the LassoCV used only the values defined to test

And here is another example that shows how to access the alphas being tested and the mean error value

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

# Generate some sample data
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=20, noise=0.1, random_state=42)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# LassoCV with default alpha selection
lasso_cv = LassoCV(cv=5, random_state=42, verbose=True)
lasso_cv.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Best alpha is {lasso_cv.alpha_}")
print(f"Alphas tested are {lasso_cv.alphas_}")
print(f"Mean Squared Error per alpha {lasso_cv.mse_path_}")

```

In the above example I am showing how to access the values in the alpha tested by sklearn. It's always a good idea to print these to understand what's actually happening in the model and get a feel of what ranges work best for your data I find it super useful to manually inspect these intermediate values

Here is a more advanced example using a gridsearch to get the optimal alpha

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

# Generate some sample data
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=20, noise=0.1, random_state=42)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Lasso with gridsearch
param_grid = {'alpha': np.logspace(-4, 1, 20)}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(Lasso(random_state=42), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Best alpha from grid search: {grid_search.best_params_['alpha']}")

```

In this case I am showing an alternative approach using GridSearchCV if you wanted to optimize across a grid instead of using the default LassoCV path. I have found this to be very useful for projects where the regularization must be manually optimized or where multiple parameters need to be optimized jointly

Anyway for anyone who is into learning more about this stuff I really recommend reading "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie Tibshirani and Friedman this book is a treasure trove of information that will help you get the full picture of how all these models work It's the real deal

Also the original Lasso paper by Tibshirani is a good source if you want to go back to the original thinking behind it it's a foundational work for all things sparse linear regression Also make sure to check out some of the core sklearn source code it's a good way to get the real understanding of what's going on behind the scenes they sometimes include the exact math formulation in the comments and can be very useful for implementation ideas

Oh and by the way a programmer walks into a library asks for books about paranoia the librarian whispers "they're right behind you"

I think that should cover it let me know if you have any more questions I've seen my fair share of stuff related to Lasso and I might have some other tips or tricks that I can share
