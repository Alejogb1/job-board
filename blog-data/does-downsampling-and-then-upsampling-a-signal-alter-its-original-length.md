Let's tackle this one, shall we? It's a common source of confusion, especially when you’re diving into signal processing, and I’ve certainly seen my share of headaches caused by assumptions about length changes during resampling. The short answer is: yes, downsampling followed by upsampling can absolutely alter the original length, but it's more complex than a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ The specific outcome depends heavily on the *factors* involved in both processes and how they're implemented. This isn't always intuitive, so let's break it down.

From my own experiences, I recall a particularly frustrating project where I was analyzing sensor data in real-time. We needed to reduce the data rate for network transfer, so naturally, we downsampled. Then, for post-processing analysis, we upsampled back to a higher rate. We made a naive assumption that the final length would match the original. The resulting time domain analysis was… a mess. It didn’t match. It was during that debacle that I learned to pay incredibly close attention to the math involved, and since then, I've been meticulous about checking my work.

The fundamental issue isn't that each operation *inherently* alters the length, but that they *can* change it depending on how we structure them, especially with non-integer resampling factors. Downsampling discards samples, and without careful handling, this often leads to a different output length. Upsampling, on the other hand, introduces samples, and similarly, how these are inserted influences the final length, especially if we use interpolation instead of simply duplicating.

Here's the core concept: when you downsample by an integer factor *m*, you ideally keep 1 in *m* samples. If the original signal's length is not an integer multiple of *m*, you have a truncation problem. You end up with a shortened signal length. When you upsample by an integer factor *n*, the ideal case is to insert *n-1* new samples between existing samples. However, if done without any interpolation or filtering, this doesn't add new information, and effectively, you are just creating steps. Now, if you use a good interpolation filter, you get something smoother. The crucial part is what happens when you combine these with non-integer factors or non-perfect implementations. Let’s look at what happens mathematically, and how it plays out in code.

**Example 1: Integer Downsampling and Upsampling with Truncation**

Imagine we have a signal of 10 samples and we downsample it by a factor of 3. Ideally, we'd expect 10/3 = 3.33, but we're dealing with discrete samples so that will need a reduction to 3. Then, if we upsample this result by 3, we would expect a length of 9. This is obviously shorter than the original signal length. The fact that you can have lengths that result in remainder in the downsample or upsample process is what creates the overall effect in the final length.

Here is a Python code example using `numpy` to illustrate this point.

```python
import numpy as np

# Original signal
original_signal = np.arange(10)
print(f"Original Signal Length: {len(original_signal)}")

# Downsample by a factor of 3
downsample_factor = 3
downsampled_signal = original_signal[::downsample_factor]
print(f"Downsampled Signal Length: {len(downsampled_signal)}")

# Upsample by a factor of 3 (simplest repetition, not good)
upsample_factor = 3
upsampled_signal = np.repeat(downsampled_signal, upsample_factor)
print(f"Upsampled Signal Length: {len(upsampled_signal)}")
```

In this case, the initial 10-sample signal becomes a 3-sample signal, and the simple repetition upsampling process results in a 9-sample signal after upsampling. The downsample truncates the initial length, and the upsample expands it by the upsample factor.

**Example 2: Integer Downsampling followed by Integer Upsampling with a different factor**

Now let's consider a case where the upsample factor is different than the downsample factor. We can see this in the next example.

```python
import numpy as np

# Original signal
original_signal = np.arange(100)
print(f"Original Signal Length: {len(original_signal)}")

# Downsample by a factor of 4
downsample_factor = 4
downsampled_signal = original_signal[::downsample_factor]
print(f"Downsampled Signal Length: {len(downsampled_signal)}")

# Upsample by a factor of 2
upsample_factor = 2
upsampled_signal = np.repeat(downsampled_signal, upsample_factor)
print(f"Upsampled Signal Length: {len(upsampled_signal)}")

```
In this scenario, the 100-sample signal becomes a 25-sample signal after downsampling by a factor of 4. When we upsample that result by 2, we get a 50-sample signal. Thus it is easy to see how the downsample and the upsample factors interact to create the final length result.

**Example 3: Interpolated Upsampling**

The previous example showed a simple repetition during upsample. Let us consider what would happen with an interpolated upsample process.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

# Original signal
original_signal = np.arange(100)
original_length = len(original_signal)
print(f"Original Signal Length: {original_length}")

# Downsample by a factor of 4
downsample_factor = 4
downsampled_signal = original_signal[::downsample_factor]
downsampled_length = len(downsampled_signal)
print(f"Downsampled Signal Length: {downsampled_length}")

# Upsample by a factor of 2 using interpolation
upsample_factor = 2
x = np.arange(downsampled_length)
f = interp1d(x, downsampled_signal, kind='linear', fill_value="extrapolate")
new_x = np.linspace(0, downsampled_length -1 , num=downsampled_length * upsample_factor)
upsampled_signal = f(new_x)
upsampled_length = len(upsampled_signal)
print(f"Upsampled Signal Length: {upsampled_length}")

# Check if the length after downsample and upsample
# would have been the same
if (original_length/downsample_factor) * upsample_factor == upsampled_length:
    print("Downsample and Upsample length operations result in the same length")
else:
    print("Downsample and Upsample length operations DO NOT result in the same length")
```

Notice in this scenario that even with interpolation, the total length after a downsample and an upsample is not guaranteed to be the same as the original length. The fact that the downsampling truncation happened prior to the upsampling means that information from the original signal is lost.

The core takeaway here is that even with a reasonable and common set of operations, you will not get back to the initial length without careful consideration. If the length is crucial, you must precisely track these transformations.

**Recommendations for Further Study:**

For a deeper understanding, I'd recommend diving into a few resources. First, *Digital Signal Processing* by John G. Proakis and Dimitris G. Manolakis is a staple for many, it is considered a very important book for learning DSP. It provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding these concepts. Another excellent resource is *Understanding Digital Signal Processing* by Richard G. Lyons, this one takes a more practical, less math-heavy, approach, which can be incredibly valuable as well, for real world applications. For a more modern and practical angle, particularly focusing on implementations, *Think DSP* by Allen B. Downey is fantastic. It uses python and provides a more hands-on approach that can solidify your knowledge. Reading through scientific papers on specific filtering techniques used in interpolation (e.g., papers discussing polyphase filtering) can also give you a very deep technical understanding of how various algorithms manipulate signal data. Additionally, investigating specific library functions in the scipy library, like `scipy.signal.resample`, is also a good path forward.

Ultimately, the question of length alteration is very nuanced. While downsampling and upsampling *can* result in changes to the initial signal length if not treated carefully, you now know why, and how to investigate it. Being methodical and explicitly tracking your signal transformations is crucial to avoiding errors in your data analysis. Remember, code is never magic, and having the proper underlying theoretical understanding is key to making it work correctly for you.
