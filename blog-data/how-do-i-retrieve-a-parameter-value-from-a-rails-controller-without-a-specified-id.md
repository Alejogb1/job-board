Alright,  I recall a project back in '18, migrating an older Rails 3 app to Rails 5, where we stumbled upon this exact scenario. We had several legacy routes that were configured to pass parameters without a typical resource id, and we needed a reliable way to retrieve those values within our controllers. It’s more common than one might think, especially when dealing with custom actions or specific query parameters outside of standard RESTful routing.

The core issue, as I understand it, is that you're looking to extract a parameter value from within a Rails controller action when that value isn’t a standard route parameter like `:id`, which Rails handles automatically based on your routes. Instead, it’s likely part of the query string or maybe a parameter passed in the request body.

Let’s clarify that there are several ways parameters are passed to a controller: route parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`), query parameters (e.g., `/users?name=john`), and request body parameters (e.g., form data submitted via POST or PUT). Rails makes these all accessible via the `params` hash within your controller actions. It’s just a matter of knowing where to look.

The `params` hash is a `HashWithIndifferentAccess`, which means you can access values using either string keys (`params['name']`) or symbol keys (`params[:name]`). This is convenient, especially when dealing with user input where keys may vary.

Now, the absence of a route parameter isn't an issue. The `params` hash will contain *all* parameters passed to the controller, regardless of their source. This includes query string parameters, parameters from the request body (like form data), and route parameters. If a parameter you are expecting is not present, the access will simply return `nil`.

Let's get into some specific examples using pseudocode, since I can't show you our actual codebase from that project:

**Example 1: Retrieving a Query Parameter**

Imagine you have a route configured like this: `/search?query=some+search+term&type=product`. The user navigates to this URL, and your controller needs to extract 'some search term' and 'product'. In the related controller action, it would look like this:

```ruby
  class SearchController < ApplicationController
    def index
      search_term = params[:query]
      search_type = params[:type]

      if search_term.present? && search_type.present?
        @results = SearchService.perform_search(search_term, search_type)
      else
        @results = []
        flash[:notice] = "Please provide a search query and type."
      end
      render 'index'
    end
  end
```

Here, `params[:query]` retrieves the value associated with the `query` parameter from the URL query string, and similarly, `params[:type]` retrieves the value of the `type` parameter. Notice there is no `id` used here. The key takeaway is that as long as a parameter is included in the request, it's within the `params` hash. We are also using a `.present?` method to ensure our values aren't `nil` or empty strings before trying to do something with them. This prevents errors that would be thrown if you did not check the values were present.

**Example 2: Retrieving a Request Body Parameter**

Suppose you have a form that submits data via POST to a create action in your `UsersController`. A simplified version of the code might look like this:

```ruby
  class UsersController < ApplicationController
    def create
      user_name = params[:name]
      user_email = params[:email]
      user_role  = params[:role]

       @user = User.new(name: user_name, email: user_email, role: user_role)
      if @user.save
        redirect_to users_path, notice: "User successfully created"
      else
        render 'new'
      end
    end

    def new
       @user = User.new
    end
  end
```

In this example, the `params` hash contains the data from your HTML form – assuming your form uses the correct input names like 'name', 'email', and 'role'. Again, the key here is the `params` hash. When a form submits via POST or PUT, these key-value pairs end up within `params` and can be accessed by their associated keys. We are demonstrating how to grab the `name`, `email`, and `role` values that were submitted in the body of the POST request and use them to create a new `User` model in our database. If you do not use the correct input names, you will be retrieving `nil` values from this hash.

**Example 3: Handling Nested Parameters**

Sometimes, parameters are nested, especially if you’re dealing with JSON or complex form structures. For example:

```ruby
  class OrdersController < ApplicationController
    def create
      customer_name = params[:customer][:name]
      customer_email = params[:customer][:email]
      order_items = params[:order][:items]

      @order = Order.create(customer_name: customer_name, customer_email: customer_email, items: order_items)
      if @order.persisted?
        render json: {message: "order created"} , status: 201
       else
        render json: {message: "order failed"}, status: 400
       end
    end
  end
```

In this example, the params hash would contain a key called `customer`, which would itself be another hash containing keys like `name` and `email`. The `order` key is a hash containing an `items` key. You would access them using nested hash keys, as shown here using `params[:customer][:name]` to retrieve the customer's name, and `params[:order][:items]` to retrieve the order's items. Nested parameters are extremely common, especially when sending JSON to an API endpoint.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Strong Parameters:** In Rails, especially since Rails 4, it’s essential to use strong parameters (defined in the controller using methods like `require` and `permit`). This helps prevent mass-assignment vulnerabilities by explicitly defining which parameters your controller should accept. While they don’t directly address retrieving a parameter *without* an id, it’s a crucial security step. I suggest reading the Rails security guide about strong parameters.

* **Parameter Sanitzation and Validation:** The above code has been simplified for brevity. Real-world code must include proper sanitization and validation of the parameters before using them. You don't want to assume every piece of data will be what you expect. You could have a user inject harmful data into the database. It is extremely important to validate user input.

* **Logging and Debugging:** When facing issues with params, logging `params` in your controller can be incredibly useful. You can use `Rails.logger.debug params` or `puts params.inspect` to inspect the content of the hash, which can save you debugging headaches.

* **Documentation:** The official Rails documentation provides very comprehensive details on parameters, and it should be your first port of call when you have any related questions. I would recommend going through all the sections of the Action Controller guide, specifically the section on parameters.

In summary, retrieving parameter values without a specified `id` in Rails is quite straightforward. The `params` hash is your go-to resource, regardless of how the parameters are passed. The examples above should show you how to access them based on the type of parameter you are working with. Be mindful of security and ensure that you're handling user input safely by validating the input data, which has not been included here for brevity. Remember to consult the official Rails documentation for deeper understanding and best practices.
