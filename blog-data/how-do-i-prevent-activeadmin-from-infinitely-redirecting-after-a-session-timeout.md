Okay, let's tackle this. I've certainly seen my share of infinite redirect loops, especially within the context of authentication and session management – it's a particularly sticky problem when dealing with frameworks like ActiveAdmin, which builds upon Rails’ authentication system. You've correctly identified the core issue: a session timeout occurs, and ActiveAdmin, or rather, the underlying authentication mechanisms, get caught in a loop trying to re-authenticate.

The problem isn't necessarily a bug in ActiveAdmin itself, but rather a confluence of factors around how authentication is handled, particularly when a session expires. When a request comes in after the timeout, the application sees an invalid session. The expected response is to redirect to the login page. But if, for some reason, the check to determine whether a user *is* logged in, or a redirect to the login page itself, is subject to the same expired session issue, we have a cycle. The application constantly tries to re-authenticate, fails, and tries again, leading to an infinite loop.

In my experience, these loops often manifest due to a few primary culprits: insufficient session handling, improper redirection logic after a timeout, or the way authentication logic interfaces with middleware. Let's break down how to prevent this with some specific techniques and code examples.

**Understanding the Core Problem**

First, we need to look at the fundamental mechanics. Rails sessions are generally managed using cookies. When a user logs in, a unique session identifier is stored in their cookie, which corresponds to server-side session data. When the session expires, that cookie (and corresponding server-side data) becomes invalid. Ideally, any request made with an expired cookie should redirect the user to the login screen. However, the redirect itself *can be problematic if it relies on session data* that no longer exists.

**The Solution: Robust Session Handling**

The first step is ensuring our authentication logic is robust and *not itself dependent* on a valid session when trying to determine if the current session is valid. Instead of relying directly on session data, we need to introduce a more durable mechanism, at least for determining if the session *is expired*. This often means having an intermediate check that bypasses the usual authentication process, *specifically for redirection*.

Here’s an example of how to achieve this, building upon the typical approach used with `devise`, which ActiveAdmin often leverages:

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception
  before_action :check_session_expiry

  private

  def check_session_expiry
    # This check bypasses the standard authentication logic if a session is invalid
    if session[:user_id].present? && current_user.nil?
       # Session data still present, but user object is nil, indicates an expired session
      session.delete(:user_id) # Ensure session data is cleared.
      redirect_to new_user_session_path, alert: 'Your session has expired. Please log in again.'
      return
    end

    # If a session exists or user object is found it is handled by devise usual flow.
  end
end
```

In this snippet, instead of relying on `authenticate_user!` or a similar method *immediately*, we first check if `session[:user_id]` is present. If it is, but `current_user` is *not* populated, that’s an indication of an expired session. We then proactively clear the user's session data and trigger the redirect manually. Crucially, *this check does not try to authenticate a user and retrieve them from the database*—it's a lightweight check that avoids the infinite loop. It ensures we're not trying to read from a non-existent session. This helps us detect and resolve a session expiration gracefully.

**Ensuring Correct Redirection**

Sometimes the issue isn't the check itself, but where the redirect goes. If the login page *also* relies on session data, or if there’s a middleware component causing a redirect after hitting it, the problem persists. Here’s how to ensure that the login page is accessible without needing an established session:

```ruby
# config/initializers/devise.rb

Devise.setup do |config|
  config.skip_session_storage = [:http_auth, :token_auth]
  # Add more as needed if using other types of non-session based authentication strategies.
  config.warden do |manager|
      manager.default_strategies(:scope => :user).unshift :bypass_session_check

    end
end

Warden::Strategies.add(:bypass_session_check) do
  def valid?
     # check if the user is already logged in; allow normal authentication if valid.
    if params[:controller] == 'devise/sessions' && params[:action] == 'new'
      return true
    end
   false # Only valid when on login page
  end

  def authenticate!
    # no authentication logic here; we are bypassing for the login page.
    success!
  end
end
```

This `Warden` strategy bypasses regular authentication when hitting the login page, allowing it to render without needing an existing session. This combined with the first example ensures an expired session will *always* take you directly to the login page, without getting stuck in a loop.

**Middleware Considerations**

Sometimes, the problem might not reside in the controllers, but in custom middleware. If you're utilizing middleware that performs authentication or redirects, it can cause conflicts with session handling. To be safe, you could implement a filter in the middleware itself, something like this:

```ruby
# app/middleware/authentication_middleware.rb

class AuthenticationMiddleware
  def initialize(app)
    @app = app
  end

  def call(env)
      request = Rack::Request.new(env)
      if request.path_info != '/users/sign_in' # Adjust as needed for your path.
          # Perform authentication checks only if not on the login page.
          # Check for the necessary credentials or user identifier, but not directly using session.
          # Do not rely directly on current_user here. Use session id as in above examples and manual lookup if necessary.
           session_id = env['rack.session'][:user_id]
           if session_id.nil? # check if a session id exists.
                return [302, {'Location' => '/users/sign_in'}, []] #Redirect to login if not logged in.
            else
                # You can optionally try to get the user again here if required but not in a way that causes a loop
            end
      end
    @app.call(env)
  end
end
```

Finally, in `application.rb`:

```ruby
# config/application.rb

config.middleware.insert_before ActionDispatch::Flash, AuthenticationMiddleware
```

This ensures that the middleware checks for a session or session id *before* the standard Rails authentication process, and only triggers redirection to the sign-in page if the user id is not found. This can be helpful to centralize session checks and avoid duplicate logic.

**Recommended Reading**

To delve deeper into these concepts, I strongly recommend two resources:

1.  **"Secure Rails Applications" by Justin Collins:** This book offers a practical guide to implementing secure authentication and authorization in Rails applications. It details session management, common vulnerabilities, and best practices.

2.  **"The Well-Grounded Rubyist" by David A. Black:** This is a comprehensive book on the Ruby language and includes a detailed discussion about Rack middleware and request handling, which is essential for understanding how Rails interacts with web requests.

By understanding the mechanics of authentication, implementing robust session checks, ensuring correct redirection, and being mindful of any middleware, you can effectively prevent those frustrating infinite redirect loops in ActiveAdmin. The code snippets I've provided, while generic, should give you a practical starting point. Keep an eye on your session data flow, always favor explicit checks over implicit ones when dealing with authentication, and you should be able to resolve these issues effectively.
