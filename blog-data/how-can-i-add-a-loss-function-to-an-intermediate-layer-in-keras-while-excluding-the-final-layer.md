Alright, let's unpack this one. I remember facing a similar challenge a few years back when experimenting with a multi-modal network for anomaly detection. The standard keras api, while incredibly versatile, doesn’t directly support applying a loss function to an arbitrary intermediate layer while excluding the final layer. You're going to need to get a little more hands-on with the functional api of keras to pull this off. Essentially, we'll treat the model as a computational graph where we explicitly define the output of each layer and compute our losses directly.

The core problem is that traditional keras model training implicitly calculates the loss only on the final output. To modify this, we need to define an intermediate "loss output" and then combine it with our regular loss. This means, instead of relying on the keras `model.compile()` and `model.fit()` methods entirely, we’ll get a bit more granular.

I've found that there are a few approaches that work well. We'll go through a simple case first, followed by a more complex example to illustrate how these ideas scale. The key idea in every approach is to define custom training loops using tensorflow's `tf.GradientTape` to gain fine-grained control over the backpropagation process.

Let’s begin with a straightforward scenario where we insert a loss after one specific layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# 1. Define a simple model using the functional API
def build_model():
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
  x = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(inputs)
  intermediate_output = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name="intermediate_layer")(x)  # Our layer of interest
  final_output = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(intermediate_output)
  return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[intermediate_output, final_output])

# 2. Define a loss function for the intermediate layer.
# We will just use mean squared error for simplicity, but can be any loss
def intermediate_loss_function(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

# 3. Define the training step
@tf.function
def train_step(model, images, labels, intermediate_labels, optimizer, loss_fn, intermediate_loss_fn):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        intermediate_output, final_output = model(images, training=True)
        main_loss = loss_fn(labels, final_output)
        interm_loss = intermediate_loss_fn(intermediate_labels, intermediate_output)
        total_loss = main_loss + 0.1 * interm_loss  # Weight the intermediate loss
    gradients = tape.gradient(total_loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return total_loss, main_loss, interm_loss

# 4. Generate dummy data and prepare training loop

model = build_model()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
intermediate_loss_fn = intermediate_loss_function

num_epochs = 10
batch_size = 32
num_samples = 1000
num_classes = 10
input_shape = (784,)

images = np.random.rand(num_samples, *input_shape).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, size=(num_samples,))
labels = keras.utils.to_categorical(labels, num_classes)
intermediate_labels = np.random.rand(num_samples, 128).astype(np.float32)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((images, labels, intermediate_labels)).batch(batch_size)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    total_loss_epoch = 0
    main_loss_epoch = 0
    interm_loss_epoch = 0
    for images_batch, labels_batch, intermediate_labels_batch in dataset:
        total_loss, main_loss, interm_loss = train_step(model, images_batch, labels_batch, intermediate_labels_batch, optimizer, loss_fn, intermediate_loss_fn)
        total_loss_epoch += total_loss
        main_loss_epoch += main_loss
        interm_loss_epoch += interm_loss
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Total Loss: {total_loss_epoch/len(dataset):.4f}, Main Loss:{main_loss_epoch/len(dataset):.4f} Intermediate Loss:{interm_loss_epoch/len(dataset):.4f}")
```

In this snippet, the `build_model` function now returns a model with *two* outputs: the intermediate layer’s output (named `intermediate_layer`) and the final prediction. We're then defining our `intermediate_loss_function`, in this instance, we are using mean squared error, but you can define one suited to your requirements.

The crucial part is the `train_step` function. Here, we utilize `tf.GradientTape` to track the operations for gradient computation. We calculate both the regular loss from the final output and the intermediate loss from the target layer output, combine them with a weighting factor (0.1 in this example) and then apply the optimizer. You can choose different weighting schemes for the losses to get desired behaviour.

This shows that we are effectively adding a loss function before the final layer and are explicitly backpropagating from our intermediate layer’s output.

Now, let’s expand on this with a slightly more involved scenario that simulates a branched network structure where multiple intermediate layers need custom losses. We will use categorical cross-entropy for the main loss and mean squared error for each intermediate loss:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np


def build_branched_model():
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
  x = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(inputs)

  branch1 = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name="branch1")(x)
  branch2 = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name="branch2")(x)
  branch3 = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name="branch3")(x)

  concat = layers.concatenate([branch1, branch2, branch3])

  final_output = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(concat)
  return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[branch1, branch2, branch3, final_output])


def intermediate_loss_function(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))


@tf.function
def train_step_branched(model, images, labels, intermediate_labels1, intermediate_labels2, intermediate_labels3, optimizer, loss_fn, intermediate_loss_fn):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        branch1, branch2, branch3, final_output = model(images, training=True)
        main_loss = loss_fn(labels, final_output)
        interm_loss1 = intermediate_loss_fn(intermediate_labels1, branch1)
        interm_loss2 = intermediate_loss_fn(intermediate_labels2, branch2)
        interm_loss3 = intermediate_loss_fn(intermediate_labels3, branch3)
        total_loss = main_loss + 0.1 * interm_loss1 + 0.1 * interm_loss2 + 0.1 * interm_loss3  # Weighted losses
    gradients = tape.gradient(total_loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return total_loss, main_loss, interm_loss1, interm_loss2, interm_loss3


# Generate dummy data
model = build_branched_model()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
intermediate_loss_fn = intermediate_loss_function
num_epochs = 10
batch_size = 32
num_samples = 1000
num_classes = 10
input_shape = (784,)

images = np.random.rand(num_samples, *input_shape).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, size=(num_samples,))
labels = keras.utils.to_categorical(labels, num_classes)
intermediate_labels1 = np.random.rand(num_samples, 128).astype(np.float32)
intermediate_labels2 = np.random.rand(num_samples, 128).astype(np.float32)
intermediate_labels3 = np.random.rand(num_samples, 128).astype(np.float32)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((images, labels, intermediate_labels1, intermediate_labels2, intermediate_labels3)).batch(batch_size)


for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    total_loss_epoch = 0
    main_loss_epoch = 0
    interm_loss1_epoch = 0
    interm_loss2_epoch = 0
    interm_loss3_epoch = 0
    for images_batch, labels_batch, intermediate_labels1_batch, intermediate_labels2_batch, intermediate_labels3_batch in dataset:
        total_loss, main_loss, interm_loss1, interm_loss2, interm_loss3 = train_step_branched(model, images_batch, labels_batch, intermediate_labels1_batch, intermediate_labels2_batch, intermediate_labels3_batch, optimizer, loss_fn, intermediate_loss_fn)
        total_loss_epoch += total_loss
        main_loss_epoch += main_loss
        interm_loss1_epoch += interm_loss1
        interm_loss2_epoch += interm_loss2
        interm_loss3_epoch += interm_loss3
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Total Loss: {total_loss_epoch/len(dataset):.4f}, Main Loss: {main_loss_epoch/len(dataset):.4f}, Interm Loss 1: {interm_loss1_epoch/len(dataset):.4f}, Interm Loss 2:{interm_loss2_epoch/len(dataset):.4f}, Interm Loss 3:{interm_loss3_epoch/len(dataset):.4f}")
```

This example shows that the functional api allows us to extract outputs from any number of intermediate layers and apply loss functions as we see fit. This approach requires more manual coding, but offers unparalleled flexibility for complex network architectures, such as in this branched scenario where we add custom losses to each branch before concatenating them. Notice how the training step now computes the main loss *and* three distinct intermediate losses, which are combined in a weighted fashion before backpropagation.

Finally, let’s go one step further and consider a case where you want to conditionally apply the intermediate loss. Sometimes you might not want the influence of the intermediate layer loss at the beginning of training. We can achieve this using a flag.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np


def build_model():
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
  x = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(inputs)
  intermediate_output = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', name="intermediate_layer")(x)
  final_output = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(intermediate_output)
  return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[intermediate_output, final_output])


def intermediate_loss_function(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))


@tf.function
def train_step_conditional(model, images, labels, intermediate_labels, optimizer, loss_fn, intermediate_loss_fn, use_intermediate_loss):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        intermediate_output, final_output = model(images, training=True)
        main_loss = loss_fn(labels, final_output)
        interm_loss = intermediate_loss_fn(intermediate_labels, intermediate_output)

        total_loss = main_loss
        if use_intermediate_loss:
           total_loss +=  0.1 * interm_loss

    gradients = tape.gradient(total_loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return total_loss, main_loss, interm_loss if use_intermediate_loss else tf.constant(0.0)



# Generate dummy data

model = build_model()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
intermediate_loss_fn = intermediate_loss_function

num_epochs = 10
batch_size = 32
num_samples = 1000
num_classes = 10
input_shape = (784,)

images = np.random.rand(num_samples, *input_shape).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, size=(num_samples,))
labels = keras.utils.to_categorical(labels, num_classes)
intermediate_labels = np.random.rand(num_samples, 128).astype(np.float32)


dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((images, labels, intermediate_labels)).batch(batch_size)
use_intermediate_loss = False

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    total_loss_epoch = 0
    main_loss_epoch = 0
    interm_loss_epoch = 0
    if epoch >= 5:
      use_intermediate_loss = True
    for images_batch, labels_batch, intermediate_labels_batch in dataset:
        total_loss, main_loss, interm_loss = train_step_conditional(model, images_batch, labels_batch, intermediate_labels_batch, optimizer, loss_fn, intermediate_loss_fn, use_intermediate_loss)
        total_loss_epoch += total_loss
        main_loss_epoch += main_loss
        interm_loss_epoch += interm_loss

    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Total Loss: {total_loss_epoch/len(dataset):.4f}, Main Loss:{main_loss_epoch/len(dataset):.4f} Intermediate Loss:{interm_loss_epoch/len(dataset):.4f}")
```

This version of the training loop adds a boolean flag `use_intermediate_loss`, which controls whether we include the intermediate loss into the total loss. In this scenario, the loss will only be used from the fifth epoch. Such conditional loss application is often beneficial in different training situations.

For further study, I would recommend looking into "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, which provides a detailed theoretical underpinning. Specifically, sections related to optimization and backpropagation are quite relevant here. Also, delving into the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on `tf.GradientTape` and custom training loops, will be very useful. Additionally, the paper “Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition” by Yann LeCun et al, though foundational, illustrates well the concepts we use to compute gradients, which is at the heart of all the operations.

These examples highlight that adding custom losses before the final layer is achievable via tensorflow functional api. It does require you to delve a little deeper, but in practice it is really not as complex as it might initially seem. It grants significantly more flexibility to your network design and training regimes. Each of the snippets here can be adapted to handle more complicated or different scenarios.
