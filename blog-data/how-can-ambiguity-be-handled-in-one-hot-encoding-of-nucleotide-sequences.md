,  Having spent a considerable amount of time working with bioinformatics data, particularly genomic sequences, I've frequently encountered the challenge of dealing with ambiguities in nucleotide representations when applying one-hot encoding. It’s not uncommon for a sequence dataset to contain characters beyond the standard A, C, G, and T, and how you handle these 'ambiguous' bases significantly impacts downstream analysis.

Let's start with the core of the problem. One-hot encoding, in its most straightforward form, creates a binary vector representation for each nucleotide. A simple four-letter alphabet (A, C, G, T) will result in vectors like [1, 0, 0, 0] for A, [0, 1, 0, 0] for C, and so on. But what happens when you encounter 'R' which represents either 'A' or 'G', or 'N' which could represent any nucleotide? These ambiguous characters are very common due to limitations of sequencing technologies or inherent genetic variations. Ignoring them outright would mean discarding valuable data, and incorrectly assigning them to one of the four basic bases will introduce noise.

My approach, developed through a few years dealing with this, focuses on building a one-hot encoding scheme that acknowledges the inherent uncertainty. We essentially expand our one-hot vector to accommodate these ambiguous states, but instead of binary states, these vectors represent probabilities. Let me illustrate with a few examples and working code in python:

**Example 1: Basic Ambiguity Handling with Probabilities**

In this initial example, we'll consider a dictionary where we map ambiguous bases to their possible nucleotides. The probability is then divided equally amongst them.

```python
import numpy as np

def one_hot_encode_ambiguous(sequence, alphabet="ACGT"):
  """
  One-hot encodes a nucleotide sequence, handling ambiguous bases with probabilities.

  Args:
      sequence (str): The input nucleotide sequence.
      alphabet (str, optional): The standard alphabet of the sequence. Defaults to "ACGT".

  Returns:
      numpy.ndarray: A 2D numpy array representing the one-hot encoded sequence.
  """

  ambiguity_map = {
      'R': ['A', 'G'],
      'Y': ['C', 'T'],
      'S': ['G', 'C'],
      'W': ['A', 'T'],
      'K': ['G', 'T'],
      'M': ['A', 'C'],
      'B': ['C', 'G', 'T'],
      'D': ['A', 'G', 'T'],
      'H': ['A', 'C', 'T'],
      'V': ['A', 'C', 'G'],
      'N': ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']
  }

  encoded_sequence = []
  for base in sequence:
    if base in alphabet:
      encoded_base = np.zeros(len(alphabet))
      encoded_base[alphabet.index(base)] = 1
    elif base in ambiguity_map:
      possible_bases = ambiguity_map[base]
      encoded_base = np.zeros(len(alphabet))
      for possible_base in possible_bases:
        encoded_base[alphabet.index(possible_base)] = 1/len(possible_bases)
    else:
        encoded_base = np.zeros(len(alphabet)) # handle unexpected bases
    encoded_sequence.append(encoded_base)

  return np.array(encoded_sequence)

# Example usage:
sequence = "ACTGRNYB"
encoded = one_hot_encode_ambiguous(sequence)
print(encoded)
```
This function iterates through the sequence. When encountering an ambiguous character, it identifies its possible nucleotide representations and assigns equal probabilities to them. The resulting encoding retains the information on the base possibilities without forcing the sequence into one of the four standard bases. This is very useful for sequence alignment algorithms or model training.

**Example 2: Incorporating Position-Specific Prior Probabilities**

In a real-world genomic context, ambiguous bases may have context-dependent likelihoods of being a particular nucleotide, based on observed positional frequencies from other related samples, databases or statistical models. Let's say, through our experimental data, we observe that 'R' in a particular location is more likely to be 'A' than 'G'. Here's a modified version of the previous function to accommodate this:

```python
import numpy as np

def one_hot_encode_ambiguous_positional(sequence, alphabet="ACGT", position_probs=None):
  """
  One-hot encodes a nucleotide sequence, handling ambiguous bases with position-specific probabilities.

  Args:
      sequence (str): The input nucleotide sequence.
      alphabet (str, optional): The standard alphabet of the sequence. Defaults to "ACGT".
      position_probs (list of dict, optional): A list of dictionaries containing position-specific probabilities for ambiguous bases.

  Returns:
      numpy.ndarray: A 2D numpy array representing the one-hot encoded sequence.
  """

  ambiguity_map = {
      'R': ['A', 'G'],
      'Y': ['C', 'T'],
      'S': ['G', 'C'],
      'W': ['A', 'T'],
      'K': ['G', 'T'],
      'M': ['A', 'C'],
      'B': ['C', 'G', 'T'],
      'D': ['A', 'G', 'T'],
      'H': ['A', 'C', 'T'],
      'V': ['A', 'C', 'G'],
      'N': ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']
  }
  encoded_sequence = []

  for i, base in enumerate(sequence):
    if base in alphabet:
      encoded_base = np.zeros(len(alphabet))
      encoded_base[alphabet.index(base)] = 1
    elif base in ambiguity_map:
      encoded_base = np.zeros(len(alphabet))
      possible_bases = ambiguity_map[base]
      if position_probs and i < len(position_probs) and position_probs[i]:
        probs = position_probs[i]
        for possible_base in possible_bases:
            if possible_base in probs:
                encoded_base[alphabet.index(possible_base)] = probs[possible_base]
        # Normalize probs if they dont sum to 1
        if encoded_base.sum() != 1 and encoded_base.sum() !=0 :
            encoded_base = encoded_base / encoded_base.sum()
      else:
          for possible_base in possible_bases:
              encoded_base[alphabet.index(possible_base)] = 1/len(possible_bases)
    else:
      encoded_base = np.zeros(len(alphabet))

    encoded_sequence.append(encoded_base)
  return np.array(encoded_sequence)

# Example usage:
sequence = "ACTGRNYB"
position_probs = [None, None, None, {'A': 0.8, 'G': 0.2}, None, {'C': 0.3, 'T': 0.7}, {'C': 0.2, 'G': 0.3, 'T':0.5}]
encoded = one_hot_encode_ambiguous_positional(sequence, position_probs=position_probs)
print(encoded)
```

In this code snippet, `position_probs` is a list where each element corresponds to a position in the sequence. A dictionary at a specific index specifies the probabilities for ambiguous bases present in that position. This allows us to fine-tune the one-hot encoding based on contextual information. It’s crucial for analyses where positional biases are prevalent.

**Example 3: Handling Indels and Gap Characters**

Often, sequences might contain gap characters ('-') representing insertions or deletions (indels). These shouldn't be treated as a regular base, nor should be ignored. We need an additional dimension in our one-hot vector to accommodate them.

```python
import numpy as np

def one_hot_encode_gaps(sequence, alphabet="ACGT-"):
  """
  One-hot encodes a nucleotide sequence, including gaps ('-').

  Args:
      sequence (str): The input nucleotide sequence.
      alphabet (str, optional): The standard alphabet of the sequence. Defaults to "ACGT-".

  Returns:
      numpy.ndarray: A 2D numpy array representing the one-hot encoded sequence.
  """
  encoded_sequence = []
  for base in sequence:
    encoded_base = np.zeros(len(alphabet))
    if base in alphabet:
        encoded_base[alphabet.index(base)] = 1
    else:
      # Handle unexpected bases by assigning 0
       pass
    encoded_sequence.append(encoded_base)
  return np.array(encoded_sequence)

# Example Usage
sequence_with_gaps = "A-CGT-N"
encoded_gaps = one_hot_encode_gaps(sequence_with_gaps)
print(encoded_gaps)
```

Here, the alphabet is explicitly extended to "ACGT-" and the function treats gap characters as a standard base. If another unexpected base was to be encountered, it would get a zero vector which is a good default when nothing else is known. This is straightforward but necessary when analyzing sequences with alignments.

These three examples represent a graduated approach to handling ambiguities, gaps, and position-specific information when creating one-hot encodings. While simple in essence, they handle common real-world challenges encountered when working with sequencing data, or similar data which has non standard values. For deeper understanding, I suggest exploring "Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis" by David W. Mount. The book provides a detailed overview of sequence analysis methodologies, covering more complex scenarios that can benefit from similar but more sophisticated methods of handling ambiguous states. The chapter on sequence alignment will shed more light on situations requiring the consideration of gaps and positional probabilities. Also, the book "Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences" by Dan Gusfield is also a good resource for underlying theoretical concepts used to handle such data. Lastly, for a deep dive into how probabilistic models are used in genomics, a review paper on Hidden Markov Models by Lawrence, Altschul, and colleagues would be extremely informative.

By acknowledging ambiguity, position-dependent factors and gap characters when creating one-hot encodings, we can avoid information loss, incorporate useful contextual knowledge, and facilitate a more robust analysis of nucleotide sequences or any other sequences that have similar properties. Remember, the most effective solutions often stem from a good understanding of the data’s limitations and the relevant context.
