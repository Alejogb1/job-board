Alright, let's tackle this. I've seen this come up a number of times, and it's a surprisingly common need when you're building dynamic web applications, especially ones that need contextual data from forms. The core of the issue here is capturing the specific url of the page where your contact form resides, so it can be submitted along with the other form data. This enables you to understand the context of each submission - where the user encountered the form and potentially the specific content they were engaging with. Think of it like adding a location tag to each message sent from a physical mailbox; it provides crucial context.

My experience with this particular problem goes back a few years, working on a rather complex e-commerce platform. We had a distributed content management system, with product pages, blogs, and resource centers, each with its own contact forms, and it became clear we needed to associate the form submission with the specific page to route queries effectively.

Now, getting the permalink isn't a walk in the park. It's not like the form element has a magical property that hands it over. We need to use client-side scripting, usually javascript, to achieve this reliably. The most common, and frankly most robust, way is to leverage the `window.location` object, specifically the `href` property. This object provides details about the current window's location, including the full url.

However, you cannot simply include `window.location.href` directly into a form field as a default value. Why? Because form elements generally render on the server side, or at least are processed initially on the server side, before the client-side javascript has a chance to execute. So, we need a way to populate this data dynamically after the page has loaded and the javascript is ready to operate.

Here’s how you would typically structure this. The basic process is to add a hidden input field to your form and then, using javascript, populate it with the `window.location.href` after the page has loaded.

Here's the first example using vanilla javascript:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const permalinkInput = document.getElementById('permalink');
  if (permalinkInput) {
    permalinkInput.value = window.location.href;
  }
});
```

In this example, we first use `document.addEventListener` to wait until the DOM (Document Object Model) is fully loaded, indicated by the `DOMContentLoaded` event. Then we attempt to retrieve a form element with an id of 'permalink' and assuming it exists we set its `value` to the current window's location using `window.location.href`. The corresponding form field in html would look like this:

```html
<form id="myForm" action="/submit" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" id="permalink" name="permalink" value="">
  <!-- Other form fields -->
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name">
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```
It's important to note the input is of type 'hidden,' making it invisible to the user but still available to the form for submission. It's also assigned a name `permalink`, which the server-side will be able to use when processing the submission.

The second approach uses jQuery, if you happen to have that included in your project. This approach is logically the same but often more concise. Here’s that version:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#permalink').val(window.location.href);
});
```
This achieves the same goal as the vanilla javascript version: populating a form field with id 'permalink' with the current url once the page is ready.

I prefer the standard, non-jQuery version myself, as keeping dependancies to a minimum often makes long term maintenance less brittle. The core process doesn't change much with a different library.

Now for a slightly more involved scenario. Sometimes you have a web page that uses client-side routing, for example single page applications (SPAs). In these cases, you may need to listen for route changes to ensure the permalink is always correct. It’s no longer enough to only populate this field on `DOMContentLoaded`, since the url can change on the fly. Let's assume you are using a library that uses pushstate and provides a route change event, such as `hashchange` (or something equivalent within your framework).

```javascript
function updatePermalink() {
    const permalinkInput = document.getElementById('permalink');
    if (permalinkInput) {
        permalinkInput.value = window.location.href;
    }
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', updatePermalink);

window.addEventListener('hashchange', updatePermalink);
```
This extended example ensures that the permalink is updated not only when the document initially loads, but also when the hash changes on the url. You will need to add an equivalent listener if you are using `pushstate` rather than the older `hashchange` based route change. This becomes particularly important if the form is kept persistent between page navigation.

Security is also a factor. While getting the url is common, be aware that the user can potentially alter the url value if they inspect the page source and use the browser tools. Therefore it's vital to avoid relying solely on this client-side data for critical security checks. For example, user authorization checks should never rely solely on a value that can be trivially changed client-side. Validate any such contextual data server side.

For further reading, I recommend looking at the documentation for the W3C's navigation timing api, specifically the `window.location` property. Reading the documentation for whichever javascript library or framework you are working with to understand how they expose route or location changes is also crucial. The "javascript: the definitive guide" by david flanagan offers a good deep dive into javascript details, and "understanding ECMAScript 6" by nicholas c zakas is helpful for a modern javascript approach.

The solution isn’t overly complex, but it's vital to approach it with an understanding of the client-side and server-side interaction, along with being aware of potential security ramifications. By combining these techniques, you can ensure that your form submissions provide the essential context for your team, allowing for a more refined and effective response to user feedback.
