Alright, let's delve into this. It's a situation I've seen pop up more than a few times, and it's rarely a straightforward issue, unfortunately. The surface-level symptom—nginx proxy manager unable to communicate with your docker containers—is often a result of a few potential underlying problems. I remember wrestling with this a couple of years back; I had a development environment where newly created containers would simply disappear from proxy manager's radar, and it took a bit of careful diagnostics to nail down the root causes.

Firstly, and probably the most common culprit, is network configuration. Docker containers don't automatically expose their services to the outside world, nor even to other containers by default. They typically operate within their own isolated networks, or at least on Docker's default bridge network. This isolation is a fundamental security feature, but it also means you have to explicitly configure communication paths.

When you're setting up nginx proxy manager, it essentially needs to be able to reach your containers via some defined network, or by publishing the ports on the host where the containers are running. The specific problem, as it relates to nginx proxy manager, usually manifests when the proxy manager and the target containers are not on the same network or if port mappings aren't correctly configured.

The most straightforward setup, if you're running both your proxy manager and your target containers on the same host, is to leverage docker's user-defined bridge networks. These allow containers to communicate with each other using container names as hostnames.

Consider this scenario: let's say you've got a simple web application running in docker, and you've called the container 'my-web-app'. If you launch your proxy manager without specifying a shared network, it won't be able to resolve 'my-web-app' using its internal DNS.

Here's a basic docker-compose.yml file demonstrating the use of a common network:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  my-web-app:
    image: some-web-image:latest
    networks:
      - my-network

  nginx-proxy-manager:
    image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "81:81"
    networks:
      - my-network
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
networks:
  my-network:
    driver: bridge
```

In this snippet, both services, 'my-web-app' and 'nginx-proxy-manager', belong to the `my-network` bridge network. Consequently, the proxy manager can now resolve `my-web-app` as a hostname, assuming the web app exposes a port you intend to proxy, say, port 80. You would configure nginx proxy manager to forward incoming requests to `http://my-web-app:80`.

Now, it is important to note that this scenario assumes that both containers are on the same docker host. This method also relies on the internal docker dns server and is often used in local development environments.

Another common issue is when the target container’s ports are not exposed or mapped. If your container exposes, say port 8080 internally, but you have not mapped it to a port on your docker host (via the `-p` option or `ports` mapping in `docker-compose`), then nginx proxy manager won't be able to communicate directly, even on the same network.

Here's an example of how you'd map ports when starting a container from the command line, or within a docker-compose file:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:8080 my-web-app
```

or, using docker compose:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  my-web-app:
    image: some-web-image:latest
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
    networks:
      - my-network
```

In these cases, the internal port 8080 is mapped to port 80 on the host, enabling nginx proxy manager, running on the host network or sharing the same network, to reach the web app by connecting to port 80 on the host itself.

Now, let’s consider a more complex case, when the proxy manager is on one host and the target container is on another host. In such scenarios, neither shared docker networks nor the use of the container's hostname becomes directly applicable. You will need to rely on explicit port mappings to the external network interfaces.

Here is an example: Let's say the `my-web-app` is running on a server with IP `192.168.1.100`, and it’s exposing port 8080, and your proxy manager is on another server with IP `192.168.1.101`. Assuming port `8080` of the first server has been mapped to port 80 on the same server. You would then configure your proxy manager to connect to `http://192.168.1.100:80`. Note that you should also ensure that there are no firewall rules blocking the communication between those servers.

```bash
# Example of starting the container on server with IP 192.168.1.100:
docker run -d -p 80:8080 my-web-app
```

In this scenario, nginx proxy manager, on 192.168.1.101, would be configured to forward requests to `http://192.168.1.100:80`.

Beyond basic network setup, you also have to consider firewall rules on both the host running the docker containers and potentially any intermediate network devices. If the required ports aren’t open, communication will be blocked. This often gets overlooked when moving from local development to a production or more distributed environment. The internal docker firewall configuration can also impact how the containers can communicate. Docker by default does not allow any outside communication to your containers unless explicitly authorized using the `ports` mapping, so make sure you have your firewalls configured in such a way that the communication can pass through.

For deep dives into these topics, I'd suggest starting with Docker’s official documentation on networking; it's a solid foundation. Also, consider reading "Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton, which provides a fantastic understanding of docker's internal workings, including how networking functions. For broader networking concepts applicable across different systems, "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" by Kurose and Ross offers a comprehensive overview.

In summary, the inability of nginx proxy manager to communicate with docker containers usually boils down to incorrect network configurations, improperly mapped ports, or firewall restrictions. Careful examination of these areas often leads to a resolution, sometimes requiring a detailed exploration of the underlying network setup. Debugging these issues systematically is crucial to avoiding prolonged downtime or configuration headaches.
