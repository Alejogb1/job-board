Alright, let’s tackle this. Finding multiple `DetailsView` controls while looping, especially when dealing with dynamic web forms or complex user interfaces, can indeed be a bit fiddly. I've spent my share of evenings debugging similar issues, so I understand the frustration. The key here isn't necessarily about brute-forcing your way through the page structure. Rather, it’s about understanding the context in which these `DetailsView` controls exist and using the appropriate methods to identify them reliably. Let's break this down.

First off, let’s assume you’re operating within the context of an asp.net webforms environment, given the `DetailsView` control's nature. The most common scenario is that you have multiple `DetailsView` instances dynamically created or embedded within container controls like `Panel`s, `GridView` rows, or custom user controls. The approach you take will often depend on this parent container context.

My experience has shown me that relying solely on direct ID lookups inside a loop isn't robust. Why? Because if the ID generation is slightly off or if you're dynamically adding them at runtime, you end up with fragile code that breaks easily. Instead, we need to utilize techniques that are more resilient.

Here's the thing: ASP.NET uses a combination of naming containers and unique IDs. Inside a `GridView`, for instance, each row essentially becomes a naming container. That means a `DetailsView` inside the *second* row will *not* have the same ID structure as a `DetailsView` in the *fifth* row. Understanding that naming container behavior is critical. We should search within those naming container scopes rather than globally on the entire page.

Let's go through some practical examples.

**Example 1: DetailsViews inside a GridView**

Suppose you have a `GridView` with a templated column, and within this template, you have a `DetailsView`. The important part to note here is the `NamingContainer` of the current row.

```csharp
protected void ProcessDetailsViewsInGrid(GridView gridView)
{
    foreach (GridViewRow row in gridView.Rows)
    {
        if (row.RowType == DataControlRowType.DataRow)
        {
            DetailsView detailsView = row.FindControl("MyDetailsViewID") as DetailsView; //Replace MyDetailsViewID with your DetailsView ID.
            if (detailsView != null)
            {
                // Do something with the found DetailsView.
                // For instance, modify some data inside it
               // detailsView.DataBind();
                // ...other logic
                if (detailsView.Rows.Count > 0)
                    {
                       //access control inside the detailsView.
                       foreach(TableRow trow in detailsView.Rows)
                           {
                                 if (trow.Cells.Count > 0)
                                   {
                                       //for example access a label control.
                                         Label label = trow.FindControl("labelcontrolID") as Label;
                                        if(label != null)
                                            label.Text = "updated text";
                                     }

                            }
                      }
                
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we loop through the `GridView`'s rows. For each data row, we use `row.FindControl("MyDetailsViewID")`. Critically, `FindControl` is invoked *on the row object itself*. This confines the search to the current row's naming container. If you had globally searched for `Page.FindControl("MyDetailsViewID")` in a loop it would fail miserably. That's why understanding the naming container scopes is so essential. I recommend reading up on the ASP.NET Page Lifecycle and server control naming conventions in *Programming ASP.NET* by Jesse Liberty. That book, despite some age, has great sections that cover this.

**Example 2: DetailsViews inside a Repeater or UserControl**

Now, let's consider a scenario with a `Repeater` or a user control that might host multiple `DetailsView` controls. The principle remains the same: search *within the container*. In the example, I am using a simple usercontrol.

```csharp
   // UserControl Code
  // inside usercontrol (.ascx)
    public partial class MyDetailsViewControl : System.Web.UI.UserControl
    {
        public string DetailsViewID { get; set; }
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

        }
      public DetailsView GetDetailsViewControl()
        {
            return this.FindControl(DetailsViewID) as DetailsView;
        }
    }
    // Parent Control code
    protected void ProcessDetailsViewsInRepeater(Repeater repeater)
    {
          foreach (RepeaterItem item in repeater.Items)
                {
                if (item.ItemType == ListItemType.Item || item.ItemType == ListItemType.AlternatingItem)
                    {
                           MyDetailsViewControl myDetailsViewControl = item.FindControl("MyUserControlID") as MyDetailsViewControl;
                           if(myDetailsViewControl != null)
                           {
                                DetailsView detailsView = myDetailsViewControl.GetDetailsViewControl();
                                if(detailsView != null)
                                {
                                    //Do Something with the found control
                                }

                           }

                    }

                 }
    }
```

Here, we are first using a usercontrol `MyDetailsViewControl` which will contain our `DetailsView`. The `DetailsViewID` property allows us to pass an ID from the parent control (e.g. via databinding). This design pattern allows us to encapsulate complex logic in user control and expose the minimum required surface for the parent control to manipulate. Then, inside the repeater loop, we utilize the `FindControl` of the `RepeaterItem` to locate the `MyDetailsViewControl` usercontrol, and then we invoke the user control’s method to locate the embedded `DetailsView`. This is a slightly more indirect approach, but it’s often necessary when dealing with nested controls or templated user controls. A book I often refer back to for such situations is *Microsoft ASP.NET 4 Step by Step* by George Shepherd. Its chapter on creating and utilizing user controls has proven very helpful for me in the past.

**Example 3: Using CSS classes or Custom Attributes**

There are situations where control ID management isn't feasible, or the ID isn't consistently named. This is common in dynamically generated or migrated projects. In this case, CSS classes or custom attributes are our friends. You can assign a common css class to your `DetailsView` controls. In this case you will use a different approach using javascript.

```HTML
<DetailsView runat="server" CssClass="my-details-view-class" ID="dv1" ></DetailsView>
 <DetailsView runat="server" CssClass="my-details-view-class" ID="dv2"></DetailsView>
```

```javascript
   //javascript code
  function processDetailsView() {
         var detailsViews = document.getElementsByClassName('my-details-view-class');

        for (var i = 0; i < detailsViews.length; i++) {
            var detailsView = detailsViews[i];
            // Do something with the detailsView. For example:
              var rows = detailsView.getElementsByTagName("tr");

            for (var j = 0; j < rows.length; j++) {
                   var cells = rows[j].getElementsByTagName("td");
                   for (var k = 0; k < cells.length; k++) {
                            var labels = cells[k].getElementsByTagName("span");
                             for(var l = 0; l < labels.length ; l++)
                                {
                                    if(labels[l].id.indexOf("myLabel") > -1)
                                        labels[l].textContent ="Text updated by js";
                                }

                       }
                  }
        }
   }

   window.onload = processDetailsView;
```

Here, instead of server-side ID manipulation, we're using client-side Javascript. We're using the `getElementsByClassName` function to get all the `DetailsView` controls sharing the same class. Then, within a loop, we can traverse the elements and manipulate them. Note that this requires knowledge of the html markup output of the `DetailsView` control and how it represents the various controls. While convenient, client-side manipulation can be more fragile than server-side processing and must be used with care. It's also crucial to remember that using client-side code for critical logic can expose your application to vulnerabilities, so consider the security aspects of using client-side javascript. When it comes to DOM manipulation, I often reference *JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* by David Flanagan; it's a very thorough book for such tasks.

In conclusion, finding multiple `DetailsView` controls efficiently comes down to understanding naming containers, using the `FindControl` method within the correct scope, or considering client-side manipulation with javascript for more complex situations where server-side control manipulation is not possible. Avoid global searches via `Page.FindControl` in your loops, as they are unreliable and often lead to errors. Instead, remember to search within the context of their parent containers (like `GridView` rows, `Repeater` items, or user controls). Finally consider using client-side Javascript and css classes as the last resort. By applying these techniques and understanding their scope, you’ll avoid common pitfalls and create more maintainable and robust code. I’ve seen firsthand how taking these simple, practical measures saves significant debugging time in the long run.
