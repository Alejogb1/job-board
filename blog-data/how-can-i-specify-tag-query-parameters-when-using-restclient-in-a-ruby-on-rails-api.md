Okay, let's tackle this. I've personally grappled with tag-based querying via rest apis more times than i care to remember, and trust me, it’s more nuanced than it first appears. Specifying tag parameters with `restclient` in a rails api can indeed get a bit fiddly, particularly when you start dealing with multiple tags and varied api expectations. The key here lies in understanding how to correctly form the uri and handle the parameter encoding, along with gracefully handling potential error conditions.

My go-to approach involves building the query string piece by piece before making the actual request. Let me illustrate this with a scenario from a project I worked on a while back; we had to fetch articles based on multiple tags from a third-party api. It was a classic case of "give me all articles tagged with 'ruby' and 'rails' ". We started with a very basic setup, and it evolved quite a bit from there, as these things always do.

First, let's examine the foundational code, where we build the basic structure. Suppose your api expects tag parameters as a comma-separated list of values within the query string itself. Here's how you might construct the request:

```ruby
require 'rest-client'
require 'uri'

def fetch_articles_by_tags(tags)
  base_url = "https://api.example.com/articles"
  query_params = { tags: tags.join(',') }
  uri = URI(base_url)
  uri.query = URI.encode_www_form(query_params)

  begin
    response = RestClient.get(uri.to_s)
    response.body
  rescue RestClient::ExceptionWithResponse => e
    puts "Error fetching articles: #{e.response.code} - #{e.response.body}"
    nil
  end
end

# Example usage:
tags_to_search = ['ruby', 'rails', 'api']
articles = fetch_articles_by_tags(tags_to_search)
if articles
  puts "Retrieved articles: #{articles}"
end
```

In this snippet, we’re using `uri.encode_www_form` to handle the url encoding which is absolutely critical. Without it, you could easily end up with broken query strings if your tags contain special characters. The `RestClient::ExceptionWithResponse` rescue block is also critical, and i've seen it bite people when debugging api issues. It allows you to catch and understand the specific error response from the server, rather than just a generic exception.

But what happens if the api doesn’t accept comma-separated lists? What if it expects multiple tag parameters, each with its own key, like `?tag=ruby&tag=rails`? We had to adjust to this in that same project, as the third-party api was, let's say, not consistently documented. Here is the revised approach:

```ruby
require 'rest-client'
require 'uri'

def fetch_articles_by_tags_multiple_params(tags)
  base_url = "https://api.example.com/articles"
  uri = URI(base_url)
  query_params = tags.map { |tag| ['tag', tag] }
  uri.query = URI.encode_www_form(query_params)

  begin
    response = RestClient.get(uri.to_s)
    response.body
  rescue RestClient::ExceptionWithResponse => e
    puts "Error fetching articles: #{e.response.code} - #{e.response.body}"
    nil
  end
end

# Example usage:
tags_to_search = ['ruby', 'rails', 'api']
articles = fetch_articles_by_tags_multiple_params(tags_to_search)
if articles
  puts "Retrieved articles: #{articles}"
end
```

Notice the difference. We're now mapping the array of tags to an array of key-value pairs like `[['tag', 'ruby'], ['tag', 'rails']]`, which when encoded by `URI.encode_www_form` correctly translates into `?tag=ruby&tag=rails`. This is a common pattern, and you need to be prepared for it. This code is more robust when the api is more specific.

Finally, sometimes, apis will want more structured parameters, perhaps using a more json-like notation for complex queries. While you could manually build a custom query string, `rest-client`'s `payload` parameter can also be invaluable. This is often how we handled more intricate search criteria beyond just tags:

```ruby
require 'rest-client'
require 'json'

def fetch_articles_by_tags_json_body(tags)
  base_url = "https://api.example.com/articles/search"
  payload = { query: { tags: tags } } # structured payload
  headers = { content_type: :json, accept: :json }

    begin
      response = RestClient.post(base_url, payload.to_json, headers)
      response.body
    rescue RestClient::ExceptionWithResponse => e
      puts "Error fetching articles: #{e.response.code} - #{e.response.body}"
      nil
  end
end

# Example usage:
tags_to_search = ['ruby', 'rails', 'api']
articles = fetch_articles_by_tags_json_body(tags_to_search)
if articles
  puts "Retrieved articles: #{articles}"
end

```

In this last case, the api expects a `post` request with the query data embedded in the body as json rather than in the url. Here we use `payload`, setting the `content_type` header to `json` to ensure the api understands the content being delivered. The use of `payload` is particularly advantageous when dealing with complex requests which are awkward to express through query parameters alone.

The key takeaway, from my experience, is that you have to be adaptable and understand the specific nuances of the api you're working with. You shouldn’t make assumptions about parameter formats, and it’s best to handle potential errors explicitly, as shown in each example with `RestClient::ExceptionWithResponse`.

If you want to dive deeper into the nuances of http, i highly recommend reading "http: the definitive guide" by david gourley and brian totty. Additionally, for a comprehensive understanding of url syntax and encoding, "rfc 3986" is your go to document. Lastly, understanding more about web service design best practices would greatly enhance your debugging experience in these cases, so I'd recommend "restful web services" by leonard richardson and sam ruby as a fantastic resource.

These approaches, alongside those materials, have served me well in many situations. Remember that real-world api interaction is often an iterative process. Start simple, carefully observe the api's response, and refine your approach based on the specific requirements.
