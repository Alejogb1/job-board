Alright, let's talk about pinning variables to the GPU – it’s a topic I've had to address quite a few times across different projects, particularly when working with large-scale machine learning models. This isn’t simply about allocating memory; it’s also about ensuring that data resides where it needs to be for optimal computation speed. From my experience, moving data back and forth between the CPU and GPU can quickly become a significant performance bottleneck if not handled carefully.

The core concept revolves around explicitly managing the memory space where your data resides. By default, many numerical computing libraries, like numpy, will create data arrays in main system memory (RAM), handled by the CPU. However, GPUs possess their own, dedicated memory, and operations performed there are orders of magnitude faster than comparable CPU operations, especially for highly parallel tasks like matrix multiplication. To leverage this, you need to move your variables explicitly to the GPU device.

There are multiple ways to achieve this, depending on the framework you’re using. For many folks in the data science sphere, the go-to libraries are usually pytorch and tensorflow, and both have well-defined mechanisms to handle this.

Let's first take a look at pytorch. The primary method in pytorch involves using the `.to()` method on tensors. Here's a quick snippet illustrating the process:

```python
import torch

# create a tensor on the CPU
cpu_tensor = torch.rand(1000, 1000)

# check if a GPU is available
if torch.cuda.is_available():
  device = torch.device("cuda")
  # move the tensor to the gpu
  gpu_tensor = cpu_tensor.to(device)

  # verify that the tensor now resides on the GPU
  print(f"Tensor device: {gpu_tensor.device}")

  # optionally, you can specify the index of the gpu if multiple are available
  gpu_tensor_idx = cpu_tensor.to(torch.device("cuda:0")) # specifies the first gpu

else:
  print("CUDA is not available, using CPU.")
  device = torch.device("cpu")
```

In this example, we initially create a tensor `cpu_tensor` on the cpu using `torch.rand`. Then we check if a gpu is accessible with `torch.cuda.is_available()`. If yes, we create a device object that points to the GPU and move our tensor using the `.to()` method. This method is not an in-place operation, so we need to assign the returned value to a new variable, `gpu_tensor`. You can further specify an index if you have multiple GPUs connected, as seen in `gpu_tensor_idx`. If a GPU is not found, we proceed using CPU computation.

Now, moving onto tensorflow. Tensorflow’s method is quite similar, although the syntax differs. Here's a representative example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# create a tensor on the CPU
cpu_tensor_tf = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))

# check if gpus are available
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
  try:
    # specify the device
    gpu_device = tf.config.experimental.get_device_details(gpus[0])['device_name']
    with tf.device(gpu_device):
      # create a tensor on the specified device
      gpu_tensor_tf = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))

      #verify that the tensor now resides on the gpu
      print(f"Tensor device: {gpu_tensor_tf.device}")

    # alternatively, explicitly specify the device id
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
      gpu_tensor_tf_idx = tf.random.normal((1000,1000))

      #verify that the tensor now resides on the gpu
      print(f"Tensor device: {gpu_tensor_tf_idx.device}")

  except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)

else:
  print("No GPUs found, using CPU")
```

In tensorflow, we start by checking for available gpus using `tf.config.list_physical_devices`. If GPUs are found, we obtain the device name, which allows us to select the active gpu during the creation of tensors by using `with tf.device()`. Similarly to pytorch, you can explicitly specify the device by its identifier, such as '/GPU:0'. If no GPUs are found, a message is displayed and the code will implicitly use the CPU device. This approach provides more contextual control in Tensorflow when managing resource utilization.

Moving beyond deep learning frameworks, let's quickly cover how to use CUDA directly with the `cupy` library which is a drop-in replacement for numpy, but implemented using CUDA:

```python
import cupy as cp

# create a cupy array
gpu_array = cp.random.rand(1000, 1000)

# get the device of the array
device = gpu_array.device
print(f"Array device: {device}")

# You can also set the device manually as follows:
with cp.cuda.Device(0):  # selects GPU with index 0
  gpu_array_specified = cp.random.rand(1000,1000)
  print(f"Specified array device: {gpu_array_specified.device}")
```

Here, using the `cupy` library, array creation directly defaults to the GPU if a compatible GPU is present. You can verify the device location of an array via its `.device` attribute. You can also manually select the device with a similar context manager as we saw with tensorflow.

The key practical consideration is to minimize data transfer between the CPU and GPU. Ideally, you'd create your initial data on the CPU, then move it to the GPU before you start computational kernels, and keep it there during the computations. Also, you can pre-allocate all variables on the GPU when possible, to avoid having to transfer data multiple times. It may feel tempting to perform small operations on the CPU and move the intermediate values to the GPU but in most cases, the movement cost outweighs any performance gain from the GPU computation.

It's also crucial to choose the appropriate data types when working with GPUs. Single-precision floating-point numbers (`float32` in most frameworks) are generally preferred over double-precision (`float64`) as GPUs are highly optimized for single-precision operations, leading to faster computation times while requiring half the memory.

For further reading, I highly recommend consulting the documentation for pytorch (specifically the sections on tensors and cuda), the tensorflow documentation on gpu usage, and diving into the technical papers surrounding CUDA architectures and GPU programming practices. "cuda by example" by jason sanders and edward kandrot, is an excellent resource that breaks down the underlying ideas. Additionally, "programming massively parallel processors: a hands-on approach" by david b. kirk and wen-mei w. hwu provides invaluable insight into the hardware specificities that govern optimal gpu computation. These are not just tutorials, they delve into the architecture and programming models that drive gpu performance. Understanding these details allows you to not only pin variables correctly, but also optimize your entire workflow for high-performance computation. These have been essential resources in my development workflow, providing the needed in-depth knowledge.
