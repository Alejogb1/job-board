i've definitely been down this road before. seeing a mount not behaving as expected in rails 6, particularly with an api, is a surprisingly common head-scratcher. the issue often isn't with the mount itself but rather with how it's interacting with the rest of the application's middleware stack or routing logic. let me walk you through some usual suspects and things i’ve learned the hard way.

first thing’s first, let's talk about what the `mount` method actually does. in rails, particularly when we're focusing on apis, `mount` isn’t some magical incantation, it's more like a plumbing operation. you're basically taking an entire rack application (and rails itself *is* a rack application) and plugging it into your main application's request handling pipeline at a specific path. this means a few things need to be considered carefully.

my initial experiences revolved around misconfigured rack middleware. it was during my early days working on an internal analytics dashboard. i decided to isolate the user authentication part of the application into a standalone rack app that i would `mount` under `/auth`. i thought i was being clever, but boy was i in for a ride. the dashboard itself was a regular rails app, handling most of the business logic. the authentication rack app was pretty basic, just verifying tokens and such.

the problem? cors (cross-origin resource sharing). my authentication app wasn't explicitly setting the necessary cors headers and rails, even though configured correctly on the main dashboard app, had no visibility to the authentication app, since the request was handled on the mounted application first. the requests were failing silently and i spent almost two days blaming the rack app or rails. that’s when i learned to check all middleware stacks.

here’s the first example, showcasing how you'd typically mount a rack app in a `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount AuthApp => '/auth'
  # other routes...
  
  namespace :api do
      resources :widgets
    end
end
```

in this simple scenario, `authapp` would be a class you've created conforming to the rack specification (i’ll show how to make it later) handling any request under the path `/auth`. you wouldn't see anything more in rails logs but you could see it if you added logging to the rack app itself.

if you are mounting an engine (e.g. a rails engine or a more complex rack application) you might find it not working as you expected. sometimes it is an engine that handles a specific resource and you might want to mount it under a namespace (e.g `/admin`). in rails 6 there could be conflicts with the routing. here's an example:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
    mount Admin::Engine => "/admin"
    namespace :api do
      resources :widgets
    end
end

# in the engine's routes.rb
# admin/config/routes.rb
Admin::Engine.routes.draw do
  resources :users
end
```

let's assume you have an engine called `Admin::Engine` responsible for user management, mounted at `/admin`. the problem would arise if you are trying to access the engine resources without being under the `/admin` path. for instance `/users` would not work. you need to access `/admin/users`. this seems a simple detail, but it tripped me up more times than i'd like to remember.

another frequent culprit is the absence of a rack app in the first place. you can mount any object that responds to a `call(env)` method which is exactly what rack middleware does. so your class needs to conform to this interface. for example if you decide to build a simple authentication app you would do the following:

```ruby
# lib/auth_app.rb
class AuthApp
  def call(env)
    request = Rack::Request.new(env)
    if request.path_info == '/auth/verify' && request.params['token'] == 'secret_token'
      [200, {'Content-Type' => 'application/json'}, ['{"status": "ok"}']]
    else
      [401, {'Content-Type' => 'application/json'}, ['{"status": "unauthorized"}']]
    end
  end
end
```
this simple rack app when mounted on `/auth` would respond with an ok status when you call `/auth/verify?token=secret_token` otherwise it would respond with a 401 unauthorized. you can add more complex authentication logic there as needed.

then, the typical mounting of this app would be as follow:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount AuthApp.new => '/auth'
  # other routes...
  
  namespace :api do
      resources :widgets
    end
end
```

now, let's talk about common errors. one of the most frequent ones is that the path you use to mount has a collision with an existing route. rails is very particular about route precedence. if another route higher in the routes file also matches the path prefix of your mounted app, that route will take precedence and your mounted app will never be called. imagine the frustration when the `mount` just doesn't seem to respond.

when dealing with an api it is also very important to check what headers are being sent and received. the api is supposed to behave in a restful manner, which means to return a 200 status code when success, 4xx for failures, and so on. you need to make sure that the mounted app or the engine follow the same standards. rack also handles content negotiation. when you use `rack-accept` middleware the request `accept` header could create strange responses, you need to make sure it returns the same content type as the main application or you could be in trouble.

there’s no single magic fix, but systematically approaching the problem by checking rack middleware stack order and the presence of any routing conflicts are usually the answer. i'd recommend checking out the rack specification, found online at rack's official site. it's a short read but really clarifies how rack works under the hood. there are also great resources in the book "crafting rails 4 applications" by josé valim which go in deep on rails internals. if you want a book about rack i recommend "rack in practice" by michael kohl. and there's a lot of really good information in the official rails guides which are really thorough, and cover most of the common pitfalls. if your api has some performance issues i recommend "redis in action" by josiah carlson.

i think the trick is to remember that a `mount` operation is just a way of plugging another rack application into rails. it's like a sophisticated pass-through. if the passing isn't working as planned, look at the pipes: middleware order and routing. also, debugging a rack app isn’t as straightforward as debugging a rails application but the basic logic is the same. it takes practice.
one time i spent half a day debugging an issue with a mounting application because i forgot to restart the rails server after modifying the mounted class. i should be a clown!
