Let's tackle this. I recall a particularly thorny issue a few years back when building a convolutional network for satellite imagery segmentation – a classic case of the “RuntimeError: 0D or 1D target tensor expected, multi-target not supported”. It was, to put it mildly, frustrating at the time. The error message, while succinct, points to a fundamental mismatch between how your loss function is interpreting the target labels and the shape of those labels themselves. Typically, this arises in scenarios involving classification or segmentation tasks, where we're expecting a specific structure for our ground truth. Let's unpack this.

The error usually stems from providing a target tensor that doesn't conform to the expectations of the loss function. Many common loss functions, such as `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss` or even `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` in some specific cases, are built to operate on either a 0D (scalar) target tensor for a single prediction or a 1D (vector) tensor representing the class indices for multiple predictions. These loss functions expect targets corresponding to class indices, not, for example, one-hot encoded vectors or multi-dimensional image-like structures, unless your specific problem and data are structured to avoid this error, which is uncommon.

The core issue is often how you prepare your data. When you have a multi-class problem, it's tempting to prepare your target variables as one-hot encoded vectors or an image with the same dimensions as your input but with each pixel representing a class label. While intuitively this seems correct, it throws the loss function for a loop because it is not expecting such a complex target format; it expects one target per prediction, usually an index. Similarly, you might have multi-label data but expect a single output, thus needing a specific approach to correctly map multiple labels to the output.

Let's examine some concrete scenarios and associated code snippets:

**Scenario 1: Multi-class classification with incorrect target preparation**

Imagine you have three classes in your dataset (let's say 0, 1, and 2). Instead of passing class indices directly to your loss function, you might mistakenly pass one-hot encoded vectors, such as [1, 0, 0] for class 0, [0, 1, 0] for class 1, and so on. The problem is that the loss function expects simply '0', '1' or '2', respectively.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Sample data, with incorrect one-hot encoded targets
predictions = torch.randn(10, 3)  # 10 samples, 3 classes
targets_incorrect = torch.tensor([[1, 0, 0],  # sample 0 belongs to class 0
                                 [0, 1, 0],  # sample 1 belongs to class 1
                                 [0, 0, 1],  # sample 2 belongs to class 2
                                 [1, 0, 0],  # sample 3 belongs to class 0
                                 [0, 1, 0],  # sample 4 belongs to class 1
                                 [0, 0, 1],  # sample 5 belongs to class 2
                                 [1, 0, 0],  # sample 6 belongs to class 0
                                 [0, 1, 0],  # sample 7 belongs to class 1
                                 [0, 0, 1],  # sample 8 belongs to class 2
                                 [1, 0, 0]]) # sample 9 belongs to class 0
# The loss function
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# This WILL result in the error
try:
    loss = criterion(predictions, targets_incorrect)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")

# Correct target format
targets_correct = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]) # class indices

loss = criterion(predictions, targets_correct) # This will work
print(f"Correct Loss: {loss}")
```

In this example, the `targets_incorrect` is a 2D tensor, which is not accepted by `CrossEntropyLoss`. The solution is to reshape `targets_incorrect` to a 1D tensor, `targets_correct`, containing class indices. The `CrossEntropyLoss` handles the one-hot encoding internally and calculates the loss based on the class indexes.

**Scenario 2: Semantic segmentation where target mask does not have the same shape as input**

Another scenario arises in semantic segmentation. Your output from the model might be a 2D tensor with channels equal to the number of classes, but your target mask may have a mismatch in shape. Specifically, if the mask is a single channel image with labels (not one-hot encoded), then you likely would need the loss function to treat each pixel as a target label, which is different than image-wise classification.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume 2 classes: background (0), foreground (1)
# Model output - (batch_size, num_classes, height, width)
output = torch.randn(1, 2, 64, 64)  # batch_size=1, 2 classes, 64x64 image

# Incorrect target mask: multi-channel
mask_incorrect = torch.randint(0, 2, (1, 2, 64, 64)).float() # Random mask with 2 channels
# This WILL result in the error
try:
    criterion_segmentation = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    loss = criterion_segmentation(output, mask_incorrect)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")


# Correct target mask: Single channel, pixel-wise class labels
mask_correct = torch.randint(0, 2, (1, 64, 64)).long() # single-channel mask
criterion_segmentation = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
loss = criterion_segmentation(output, mask_correct)
print(f"Correct loss: {loss}")

```
Here, the `mask_incorrect` has an additional channel which is not acceptable by `CrossEntropyLoss` since it expects a single label for each position in each item within the batch. The correct `mask` is converted to a long tensor for integer labels.

**Scenario 3: Regression with incorrectly shaped target**

Consider the case where you're attempting regression where you output multiple values, but expect each to be treated as a separate regression.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Regression output, predicting 2 numbers
predictions = torch.randn(10, 2) # batch size of 10, predictions for 2 values

# Incorrect target: 1D with only 1 target for 2 outputs
targets_incorrect = torch.randn(10, 1)

try:
    criterion_regression = nn.MSELoss()
    loss = criterion_regression(predictions, targets_incorrect)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")

# Correct target
targets_correct = torch.randn(10, 2)
criterion_regression = nn.MSELoss()
loss = criterion_regression(predictions, targets_correct)
print(f"Correct Loss: {loss}")
```

In this instance, the `MSELoss` requires the prediction and the target to have the same shape. The target had the shape `[10, 1]` whereas the output had the shape `[10, 2]`, causing the mismatch. The correct target has the same shape `[10, 2]`.

In essence, the 'RuntimeError' serves as a signal that you're not quite feeding your loss function what it’s expecting. The solution is to meticulously inspect your target data, ensuring it aligns perfectly with the requirements of your chosen loss function. If you have multi-class classification, ensure you are supplying class indices not one-hot vectors, if you have a segmentation problem make sure your masks have the right number of channels and if you're dealing with regression, ensure you are predicting and providing the same number of output values. Always go back to the documentation of your specific loss function for its expectations. For deeper exploration of loss functions and how they operate with tensor shapes, I’d suggest delving into “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Specifically, Chapter 6 ("Deep Feedforward Networks") provides the theoretical underpinnings of these concepts. Also, the PyTorch documentation on `torch.nn` modules is invaluable for understanding the input-output expectations of each loss function. Furthermore, “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning” by Christopher Bishop gives a more detailed approach on the optimization challenges including gradient-based methods and different forms of losses.

This issue isn't uncommon, and it’s a great reminder to always double-check our input data's shape and how the loss function interacts with it before spending time debugging seemingly complex parts of our models. Getting the basics correct often saves a significant amount of time in the long run.
