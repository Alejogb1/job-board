Okay, let's tackle this. Been down that rabbit hole more times than I care to remember, and it’s usually the same underlying culprits at play. Asynchronous programming in Python, particularly when using `asyncio`, can be a bit tricky. It's not quite the straight line most expect from synchronous code. I recall one particularly painful debugging session years ago working on a data ingestion pipeline; it was supposed to be blazing fast, but the async bits were just… sputtering. The core issue almost always revolves around understanding how the event loop works and what exactly causes a function to yield control back to it.

So, let's dissect why your async function might not be behaving as you'd expect. The first, and probably most common, mistake stems from a misunderstanding of *blocking calls*. Essentially, if your async function executes any synchronous, blocking operation (like performing network I/O with a non-async library, or doing heavy CPU-bound calculations without explicitly offloading them to a separate thread or process), it stalls the entire event loop. This is because, while your function may *seem* asynchronous because it’s defined with `async`, it can only yield control back to the event loop at specific points – usually when it encounters an `await` expression. If it never reaches an `await` because it’s stuck in a blocking operation, then other coroutines that are ready to run cannot proceed, leading to what can look like a dead application or a significantly slowed one.

Consider this problematic example. Let’s say you have a very simple task, reading a small file.

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def read_file_sync(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        time.sleep(2) # Simulate slow operation
        content = f.read()
    print(f"File {filename} read.")
    return content

async def main():
    tasks = [read_file_sync("file1.txt"), read_file_sync("file2.txt")]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

If you were to create two small text files named `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, and run the code, you'd see that it takes roughly four seconds because the `time.sleep()` function, which represents a blocking operation (in real-world cases, imagine this being a database query that doesn’t have an async driver), blocks the execution flow of each coroutine *and* the event loop. The event loop doesn't switch to the other task until the first one is fully finished. Even though these are async functions, they are not truly running concurrently due to this blocking behavior. `asyncio.gather` does its job, waiting for both to complete, but the blocking operation ruins any potential for concurrency.

The remedy here is to avoid blocking operations inside async functions directly. In the case of reading a file, there's no built-in async file i/o in standard python, but we can use a thread executor. If, for example, you were doing network operations, you would utilize a library designed for asyncio, such as `aiohttp` or `asyncpg`. Here’s an example of using a thread pool for an operation that is non-async ready:

```python
import asyncio
import time
import concurrent.futures

def blocking_read_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        time.sleep(2) # Simulate slow operation
        content = f.read()
    print(f"File {filename} read.")
    return content

async def read_file_async_executor(filename, executor):
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    content = await loop.run_in_executor(executor, blocking_read_file, filename)
    return content

async def main():
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        tasks = [read_file_async_executor("file1.txt", executor), read_file_async_executor("file2.txt", executor)]
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Now, using a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to execute the blocking operations off the main thread, we free up the event loop to schedule other tasks. This example is closer to something you’d encounter in real-world asynchronous situations. We're still reading the files, but now the blocking part of the function executes in the thread pool rather than on the main thread (which is used by the event loop), allowing for concurrency. The execution time will be close to two seconds.

Another common source of confusion is the proper use of `await`. If you call a coroutine function (one declared with `async def`) without using `await`, you're just getting a coroutine object, not actually running the code inside it. In essence, you are not yielding control back to the event loop at all in that case.

Consider this:

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def my_coroutine(delay):
    print(f"Coroutine starting with delay {delay}")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Coroutine finished with delay {delay}")
    return f"Result with delay {delay}"

async def main():
  coros = [my_coroutine(1), my_coroutine(2)]
  results = await asyncio.gather(*coros)
  print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())

```

This example correctly uses await with gather and properly executes the async tasks. But if we remove the await inside gather, you’ll notice immediately that nothing happens as expected. You are not actually triggering execution of the coroutines and the program will terminate directly after the coroutines are created. The event loop never had the opportunity to manage them. It is essential to understand the exact timing of your `await` calls and how they facilitate concurrency.

To reinforce your understanding, I highly recommend diving deeper into the following resources. First, "Programming in Python 3" by Mark Summerfield is invaluable for a strong foundational understanding of Python, particularly its concurrency features. Then, for more practical knowledge of `asyncio`, the "Python Cookbook" by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones has a very strong chapter on asynchronous programming and is an extremely well-written and practical resource. Finally, if you're working with network applications, ensure you're working with aiohttp and read the docs carefully, so you understand how its internals relate to the event loop.

Debugging asynchronous programs can be challenging, but by understanding these common pitfalls—blocking operations, incorrect usage of `await`, and how the event loop works—you'll be much better equipped to build robust and performant concurrent applications. As with all complex systems, thorough understanding of the fundamentals is what makes all the difference.
