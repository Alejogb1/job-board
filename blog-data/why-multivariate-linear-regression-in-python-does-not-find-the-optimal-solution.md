so, you’re having trouble with your multivariate linear regression not hitting that sweet spot, right? i’ve been there, trust me. it’s like chasing a phantom bug, you tweak and tweak, but it just doesn’t quite land. let me share what i’ve picked up from my past scrapes with this, and hopefully, it'll shed some light on what you might be experiencing.

first, let’s clarify: ‘optimal’ in linear regression typically means finding the parameters (the coefficients) that minimize some cost function, usually the mean squared error (mse). the standard approach in python uses methods like ordinary least squares (ols), which have analytical solutions. in theory these should find the global minimum if the assumptions are met. so, when it doesn’t, it's not like the algorithm just decided to go for a coffee break. there are typically some practical reasons that tend to be lurking behind.

the main suspect i’ve found after banging my head against the wall a few times is usually, a problem with data. yes, the data. we all love data right? well not always, i’m joking, relax.

one big issue i’ve encountered is multicollinearity. this is when your predictor variables are highly correlated with each other. if you are using say, the square footage of a house and the number of bedrooms in your regression, well you are almost asking for trouble. as they are likely highly correlated, this messes with the regression model in a major way. mathematically it makes the matrix that you are inverting in the ols calculation poorly conditioned or even singular. that is, the inverse does not exist or is numerically unstable and very sensitive to small changes to the data. from a programming standpoint, you won’t necessarily get an error with scipy or scikit-learn. python will just soldier on and churn out numbers and coefficients, but these results are not trustworthy. the coefficients in this case can be wildly unstable and very sensitive to small changes in the data. to spot this, i usually look at the variance inflation factor (vif).

here’s a quick snippet to calculate vif in python, i find it quite handy:

```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor

def calculate_vif(data):
    vif_data = pd.DataFrame()
    vif_data["feature"] = data.columns
    vif_data["vif"] = [variance_inflation_factor(data.values, i) for i in range(data.shape[1])]
    return vif_data

#example usage
# suppose 'X' is your pandas dataframe with your features
# X = pd.DataFrame(data_here)
# vif_df = calculate_vif(X)
# print(vif_df)

```

if you see vif values greater than 5 or 10, that’s a signal for multicollinearity. what do you do when you find these, well, you have a few options. you can drop some of the correlated variables. but what if you don't want to lose that information? another approach that i’ve used is principal component analysis (pca). it transforms your original features into a new set of uncorrelated features. it’s a common technique for dimensionality reduction. it also handles the multicollinearity problem.

here is a small example with scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

def apply_pca(X, n_components):
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    pca = PCA(n_components=n_components)
    principal_components = pca.fit_transform(scaled_features)

    return principal_components, pca

# example usage
# X = np.array([[...], [...], ...]) # Your data
# n_components = 2
# X_pca, pca_object = apply_pca(X,n_components)
# print(X_pca)
# print(pca_object.explained_variance_ratio_)

```

remember to scale your data before applying pca, as i’ve shown above using `standardscaler` otherwise your pca may be skewed and the results can be misleading as the scale of each feature may dominate the result.

another issue is that the data itself may simply not be linear. linear regression, as the name implies, assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. if your relationship is more curvy or complex, then a linear model is not the tool for the job. you will not achieve what you consider an optimal solution. you will always be in an underfitting regime. this means you're not capturing all the patterns in your data. in this situation, i’ve used polynomial features to model non-linearities. it’s not always the best choice but can be a quick fix.

here is another little snippet to show how to add polynomial features:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
import numpy as np

def apply_polynomial_features(data, degree):
    poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=degree)
    poly_features = poly.fit_transform(data)
    return poly_features

# example usage
# X = np.array([[...], [...], ...]) # Your data
# degree = 2
# X_poly = apply_polynomial_features(X, degree)
# print(X_poly)
```

one caveat of using polynomial features is you can quickly create a very high dimensional dataset so you have to be careful and keep an eye on the number of features.

also, outliers and influential points can really throw the regression off, even if they are only a small number of them. they can pull the regression line away from the general trend. a quick thing i do is to visualize my data with a scatter plot, it’s a basic but effective approach. then i try to identify these outliers and decide what to do with them. sometimes you need to remove them because they are due to a faulty data-gathering process, sometimes the outliers may be valid data points. but as a rule of thumb they must be treated carefully.

now, while i've focused on data issues here, it’s also worth double-checking your code for any errors. a small mistake can completely change the outcome. it’s easy to miss an obvious thing when you are staring at the same code for a long period of time. you also have to keep in mind that ols isn’t the only algorithm you can use. algorithms like gradient descent are also used. the methods in libraries like scikit-learn uses optimized algorithms, and it is unlikely that this would be the root of your problem, but still worth considering.

finally, just a little disclaimer, ‘optimal’ is a bit subjective sometimes. the best model for you is usually a balancing act between accuracy and complexity. it’s also important to keep in mind that some of the assumptions of linear regression may be violated. it’s crucial to keep exploring the diagnostic tools you have at hand and understand their limitations. sometimes, achieving the best model will involve a lot of feature engineering and preprocessing.

as for useful resources, i’ve personally benefited from books like "the elements of statistical learning" by hastie, tibshirani, and friedman; and "pattern recognition and machine learning" by bishop. they’re dense, but if you are serious about understanding what’s under the hood of these machine learning models, then those are essential books. also, i’d suggest looking at some of the papers around statistical modeling with linear regression. there is lots of info and different approaches described in these types of publications.

hope this helps clarify some of the issues and pitfalls you might encounter in your multivariate linear regression journey and gives you a good starting point to debug your model. good luck.
