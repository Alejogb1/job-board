Okay, let's unpack this. I've actually tackled this specific challenge quite a few times in the past, especially when architecting larger, more complex infrastructure deployments. It's not uncommon for projects to outgrow a single, monolithic bicep file, and that's where the need to manage and publish multiple bicep templates to a container registry becomes crucial.

The core concept here is recognizing that bicep files, post-compilation, essentially become arm templates (json). These json files, along with any associated artifacts like parameters files, can be packaged into a container image. The container registry then serves as a repository for these images, allowing you to version and deploy your infrastructure as code with much more granularity. This is especially effective in scenarios where you want to have composable infrastructure modules that can be reused across various environments.

My experience has taught me there are a few key strategies, and the approach I tend to gravitate towards involves leveraging docker build capabilities. I'm not really a fan of overly complicated workflows, so a straightforward, docker-centric method tends to work well.

Firstly, let's establish a logical directory structure. Imagine a typical project where you have multiple infrastructure components. Each component, represented by a bicep file, would have its own dedicated folder. For instance:

```
project/
├── network/
│   ├── main.bicep
│   ├── main.parameters.json
│   ├── Dockerfile
├── compute/
│   ├── main.bicep
│   ├── main.parameters.json
│   ├── Dockerfile
├── database/
│   ├── main.bicep
│   ├── main.parameters.json
│   ├── Dockerfile
```

Each of these component folders contains a bicep template (`main.bicep`), an optional parameter file (`main.parameters.json`), and importantly, a `Dockerfile`. Let's break down a sample `Dockerfile`, specifically within the `network/` folder:

```dockerfile
# Use a minimal image for our needs
FROM alpine:latest

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy files
COPY main.bicep main.bicep
COPY main.parameters.json main.parameters.json

# No need to expose any ports as this is for templates

# Metadata label
LABEL template=network
LABEL version=1.0.0

# This is a good practice to specify what we have in the image
# Optional
# RUN ls -la /app

# Setting a non executable entrypoint to allow us to easily see the container is not running.
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'template container'"]
```
In this `Dockerfile`, we use a lightweight alpine image. Then, we copy our bicep file and its associated parameter file into the container’s `/app` directory. We also set metadata labels to identify the template type and version. The `entrypoint` here is not designed to execute anything, but serves more to quickly confirm that the container has started. Now, for each of these component folders, you have an equivalent `Dockerfile` tailored to the specific template it houses.

With the `Dockerfiles` in place, we now can use docker to build the images and push them to a container registry. This process, ideally, is integrated into a CI/CD pipeline. Here's an example of a simple script that iterates through each template folder, builds its container, and pushes it to a specified registry.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
REGISTRY="myregistry.azurecr.io/templates"
TAG="latest"

# Loop through the template directories
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -not -path "." -print | while read -r dir; do
  # Extract the directory name for the image name
  TEMPLATE_NAME=$(basename "$dir")

  # Build the Docker image
  echo "Building Docker image for $TEMPLATE_NAME..."
  docker build -t "$REGISTRY/$TEMPLATE_NAME:$TAG" "$dir"

  # Check build success
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error building image for $TEMPLATE_NAME."
    continue
  fi
  
   # Push the Docker image
   echo "Pushing Docker image for $TEMPLATE_NAME..."
  docker push "$REGISTRY/$TEMPLATE_NAME:$TAG"

  # Check push success
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error pushing image for $TEMPLATE_NAME."
    continue
  fi
  
  echo "Successfully pushed $REGISTRY/$TEMPLATE_NAME:$TAG"

done

echo "All template images pushed!"
```

This script does the following: it defines the target container registry and tag. It then uses `find` to locate each subdirectory containing our templates and executes the `docker build` command to generate a container image based on the corresponding `Dockerfile`. It tags it correctly using the subdirectory name and specified tag, and then it pushes the image to our specified registry. This is a streamlined, practical solution that has served me well in different real-world projects, especially in those using Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or similar CI/CD tools.

It's important to understand that the container image is not meant to run as an application. Its primary role is to serve as a packaging mechanism for your compiled arm template and associated files. When the time comes to deploy the infrastructure, you'll then reference these image artifacts in your main deployment bicep file or deployment scripts.

To illustrate this usage, let’s imagine a bicep deployment script. This is a very basic example to demonstrate how to reference the templates stored in our registry. Here’s the structure:

```bicep
// main.bicep

param templateRegistry string
param templateTag string

module networkModule 'br:${templateRegistry}/network:${templateTag}' = {
  name: 'networkDeployment'
}

module computeModule 'br:${templateRegistry}/compute:${templateTag}' = {
  name: 'computeDeployment'
}

module databaseModule 'br:${templateRegistry}/database:${templateTag}' = {
    name: 'databaseDeployment'
}
```

In this bicep file, we're defining three modules that reference our deployed bicep templates via the `br:` protocol, which stands for Bicep Registry. We’re also accepting the `templateRegistry` and `templateTag` as parameters to ensure flexibility in deploying different versions of our infrastructure.

This approach provides numerous benefits: template versioning via the container image tags, easier reuse of infrastructure modules, and a more organized and manageable infrastructure as code.

For a deep dive into best practices and advanced techniques for managing infrastructure as code with Bicep, I'd highly recommend exploring the official Microsoft Bicep documentation. You should also refer to the "Infrastructure as Code" section within the Azure Architecture Center documentation, as well as the "Docker Documentation" on creating and using images. These are invaluable resources that have guided much of my own work and I believe they'd be very beneficial to you.

I’ve found this strategy to be scalable and manageable, particularly in environments that require frequent changes and deployments. It keeps the build process simple, the organization tidy, and the deployments repeatable. It might look a little involved at first glance but adopting it significantly improves long-term maintainability.
