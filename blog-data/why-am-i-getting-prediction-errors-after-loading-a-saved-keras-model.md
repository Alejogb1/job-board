Okay, let’s dive into this. I’ve seen this particular headache crop up more times than I care to recall, and it’s rarely a straightforward issue. So, you've got a saved Keras model—presumably, a .h5 file or a SavedModel directory—and the predictions it’s generating after being reloaded are deviating from what you expected, maybe even outright incorrect. The first thing we need to understand is that there isn’t a single, universal cause. It's a combination of factors and often requires methodical investigation. Let me walk you through the usual suspects, drawing from past projects where I've faced the same challenges.

The primary reason prediction discrepancies surface after model loading boils down to **inconsistencies between the state of your environment at the time of training and at the time of prediction**. This broad category encompasses several specific causes.

First and foremost, **data preprocessing discrepancies**. This is probably the most common culprit I've encountered. Let’s say you trained your model using a specific normalization technique—maybe using sklearn's `StandardScaler` or a custom preprocessing layer in Keras. The critical point here is that the *same* preprocessing must be applied to your input data during prediction. For instance, if you standardized your training data to have zero mean and unit variance, you absolutely need to do that to your prediction data. If the scaling parameters (mean and standard deviation) aren't applied identically, or if the preprocessing steps are different, the model will effectively be seeing different data than what it was trained on, hence, the erroneous predictions. I once worked on a project involving sensor data where a colleague neglected to persist the `StandardScaler` object used during training. The model appeared to load successfully, but the predictions were, to put it mildly, garbage. The fix was simple enough—persist the preprocessor along with the model, which is something we'll look at in code soon.

Another source of trouble lies within **custom layers or functions**. If your Keras model employs custom layers or functions, you need to ensure they are registered correctly when loading the model. Keras needs to know how to instantiate these specific components of your model graph; otherwise, it might default to generic layers which, while present, will lead to wildly inaccurate outputs. Consider the situation when you have a specialized activation function, or a custom loss. The model definition requires this custom activation or custom loss. If, upon loading, this definition is missing, Keras will be unable to properly reconstruct the model.

A further problem arises from discrepancies in **the underlying computational libraries**, primarily TensorFlow and Keras versions. There can sometimes be subtle differences in how models are handled between versions. This is crucial especially for complex models or if using specialized layers that might be heavily dependent on specific versions. Downgrading or upgrading TF and Keras versions can lead to different computational results, particularly regarding optimizations or numerical stability. I've seen instances where a model worked fine in one environment but failed spectacularly after a package update. We had to revert to the original library versions to restore performance.

Finally, a less frequent yet possible cause could be from **stateful layers**, particularly in RNNs. If your model includes stateful layers like LSTM or GRU, the state is not automatically reset during model loading. If the state from the previous usage is left over it would be influencing the prediction. This usually happens when your data is a sequence. If the sequence length or data order differs, there will be inconsistencies in the predictions.

Now, let’s examine some illustrative code snippets. These focus on addressing the previously mentioned discrepancies:

**Snippet 1: Persisting and applying preprocessing with `sklearn`**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import joblib
from tensorflow import keras

# Example training data (replace with your actual data)
training_data = np.array([[1, 2], [1.5, 3], [2, 2.5], [3, 4], [5, 6]], dtype=float)

# Fit and save the preprocessor
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(training_data)
joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.pkl')

# Example model (replace with your actual model)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(2,))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(training_data, np.array([[2.9],[4.6],[4.8],[7.6],[11.2]]), epochs=10, verbose=0)
model.save('my_model.h5')

# Example prediction
test_data = np.array([[2.5, 3.5]])
loaded_scaler = joblib.load('scaler.pkl')
scaled_test_data = loaded_scaler.transform(test_data)
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
prediction = loaded_model.predict(scaled_test_data)
print(f"Prediction after correct scaling: {prediction}")

# Without applying the scaler
prediction_without_scaling = loaded_model.predict(test_data)
print(f"Prediction without scaling: {prediction_without_scaling}")

```

This code demonstrates how to fit and then save the `StandardScaler`. It's essential to load and apply this same scaler to *any* data you use for prediction after loading your model. You'll notice that if you forget this, the model output will not be as expected.

**Snippet 2: Saving and loading with custom layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define a custom layer
class CustomActivation(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(CustomActivation, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.nn.relu(inputs) + 0.1

# Create a model using a custom layer
def create_custom_model():
  model = keras.Sequential([
      keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=CustomActivation(), input_shape=(5,)),
      keras.layers.Dense(1)
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
  return model

# Example data (replace with your data)
x = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y = np.random.rand(100, 1)
custom_model = create_custom_model()
custom_model.fit(x,y, epochs=2, verbose=0)

# Save the model with the custom layer
custom_model.save('custom_model.h5')

# Loading and prediction
loaded_custom_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_model.h5',
                                              custom_objects={'CustomActivation': CustomActivation}) # Necessary for Keras to find the layer definition
prediction_after_reload = loaded_custom_model.predict(np.random.rand(1, 5))
print(f"Prediction with Custom Layer: {prediction_after_reload}")

# Loading without correctly resolving the custom layer
try:
    loaded_model_wrong = keras.models.load_model('custom_model.h5')
    prediction_after_reload_incorrect = loaded_model_wrong.predict(np.random.rand(1,5))
    print(prediction_after_reload_incorrect)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error when loading without custom objects: {e}")

```
Notice how you must specify the `custom_objects` argument in `load_model` otherwise Keras will throw a `ValueError` or, more silently, return incorrect results. This is because it can't instantiate the correct layer if it's not defined when the model is being loaded.

**Snippet 3: Handling stateful RNNs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Create a stateful RNN
def create_stateful_rnn():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.LSTM(32, batch_input_shape=(1, None, 1), stateful=True, return_sequences=True),
        keras.layers.LSTM(1, return_sequences=False, stateful=True)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

stateful_model = create_stateful_rnn()
sequence_length = 10
x = np.random.rand(1, sequence_length, 1)
y = np.random.rand(1, 1)

# Train with an initial state (not really a sequence)
stateful_model.fit(x, y, epochs=1, verbose=0)

stateful_model.save('stateful_model.h5')

# Load and use with initial state
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('stateful_model.h5')
prediction = loaded_model.predict(np.random.rand(1, 20, 1))  # Predict with a longer sequence.

# Reset the state
loaded_model.reset_states()
prediction_with_reset = loaded_model.predict(np.random.rand(1,20,1))

print(f"Prediction without reset {prediction}")
print(f"Prediction with reset {prediction_with_reset}")
```

This snippet illustrates that after loading your model you need to call `reset_states` before predicting. If you do not do this, the internal state of the RNN might be in an unpredictable state. Also, note that stateful RNNs expect batch inputs with a specific batch size, in our case `batch_input_shape=(1, None, 1)`.

For deeper insights, I’d strongly recommend consulting papers on model robustness and generalization in machine learning. Specifically, publications on adversarial examples offer a fantastic understanding of how slight perturbations in input data can lead to vastly different outputs, which is, in essence, a similar problem but at a different scale. The book "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville also covers data preprocessing and model building rigorously. For the nuances of TensorFlow and Keras, thoroughly explore their official documentation which I've found immensely useful.

In conclusion, when encountering prediction errors after loading a Keras model, systematically check for the causes discussed above. Proper data preprocessing, correct registration of custom objects, consistent library versions, and handling stateful layers are vital. The problem is often due to slight differences in the pipeline that may seem inconsequential at first glance, but drastically influence the prediction outcome.
