Okay, let's tackle this. It's a question that’s tripped up more than a few people, and, frankly, it's something I’ve had to debug myself on several occasions during past projects involving image processing and machine learning model training. The impact of dataset aspect ratio and size alterations on model performance isn't always straightforward, and there are several facets to consider. It’s not just about "more data is better," or that one aspect ratio is inherently superior; rather, it’s more about the interplay between the dataset’s characteristics, the model's architecture, and the specific task at hand.

From my experience, particularly during a project aimed at detecting defects in industrial components, we ran into some significant problems when scaling up our training data. Initially, we had a dataset consisting of high-resolution images with a 4:3 aspect ratio. As we attempted to incorporate data scraped from diverse sources, which often presented a 16:9 format, we observed a tangible dip in the model's accuracy. This highlighted a fundamental issue: changing the aspect ratio alters the spatial relationships within the images. The model, which had initially learned to recognize patterns in the 4:3 context, found these shifted relationships disorienting, leading to poorer generalization. This is a typical problem that stems from the fact that convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are very commonly employed for image analysis, tend to learn features within a specific spatial framework.

Moreover, consider the impact of size changes. Increasing dataset size, in general, is beneficial, typically leading to better model performance, especially in deep learning models which are data-hungry. More examples mean the model can better generalize from the training set to unseen examples. However, this is not always a linear relationship. At some point, a model may start to plateau or even overfit if the additional data is not diverse or if the model's capacity is insufficient. I recall one particular experiment where we increased our dataset threefold, and, instead of the expected boost, we started seeing marginal improvements and even some accuracy declines on the validation set. Further investigation revealed that the extra data largely consisted of variations of the original images with minor lighting adjustments, failing to capture the wider variety of defects we sought. The model was effectively becoming overly confident in a very limited section of the possible input space.

Let's get into some technical specifics with code examples using python, which I've found to be immensely helpful in prototyping and understanding these issues.

**Example 1: Image Resizing and Aspect Ratio Preservation**

This snippet demonstrates how we can resize images, maintaining aspect ratio, which I always recommend if your images differ in aspect ratio initially. This approach involves calculating the scaling factors based on either width or height and then resizing accordingly, keeping the spatial relationships relatively consistent.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def resize_image_preserving_aspect(image, target_size):
    height, width = image.shape[:2]
    target_height, target_width = target_size

    height_scale = target_height / height
    width_scale = target_width / width

    scale = min(height_scale, width_scale)
    new_height = int(height * scale)
    new_width = int(width * scale)

    resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (new_width, new_height), interpolation = cv2.INTER_AREA) # cv2 is good for resizing

    padding_height = target_height - new_height
    padding_width = target_width - new_width

    top_padding = padding_height // 2
    bottom_padding = padding_height - top_padding
    left_padding = padding_width // 2
    right_padding = padding_width - left_padding

    padded_image = cv2.copyMakeBorder(resized_image, top_padding, bottom_padding, left_padding, right_padding, cv2.BORDER_CONSTANT, value=[0, 0, 0])

    return padded_image


# Example usage:
image = np.random.randint(0, 255, (400, 300, 3), dtype=np.uint8) #Sample image
target_size = (600, 600)
resized_image = resize_image_preserving_aspect(image, target_size)
print(f"Resized image shape: {resized_image.shape}")
```

**Example 2: Augmenting Images to Handle Size Variation**

Another effective strategy for handling dataset size issues is to augment existing images. This can be done with operations like rotation, scaling, translation, and slight modifications in pixel values. It helps expose the model to a broader spectrum of variations and can prevent it from overfitting to a small number of training examples. This is especially useful if you cannot acquire more real data and have limited resources for manual labeling.

```python
import numpy as np
from skimage import transform
import random

def augment_image(image, angle_range=(-10, 10), scale_range=(0.9, 1.1), translation_range=(-10, 10)):

    angle = random.uniform(*angle_range)
    scale_factor = random.uniform(*scale_range)

    tx = random.randint(*translation_range)
    ty = random.randint(*translation_range)

    rotation_matrix = transform.rotate(image, angle, resize=False, preserve_range=True).astype(np.uint8)
    scaled_matrix = transform.rescale(rotation_matrix, scale_factor, multichannel = True, preserve_range=True).astype(np.uint8)

    height, width = scaled_matrix.shape[:2]
    translation_matrix = np.float32([[1, 0, tx], [0, 1, ty]])

    translated_matrix = cv2.warpAffine(scaled_matrix, translation_matrix, (width, height))

    return translated_matrix


image = np.random.randint(0, 255, (200, 200, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
augmented_image = augment_image(image)
print(f"Augmented image shape: {augmented_image.shape}")
```

**Example 3: Visualizing Changes and their Impact**

Here’s a basic way to visualize the changes. This demonstrates the effects of aspect ratio change (a non-aspect preserving resize) and resizing of an image on the data. It is critical to actually look at the data in this way to see if the change you’re making is introducing distortion that would detrimentally affect the model training process.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def display_image_changes(image):
    height, width = image.shape[:2]

    resized_non_aspect = cv2.resize(image, (int(width/2), int(height*1.5)), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
    resized_regular = cv2.resize(image, (int(width/2), int(height/2)), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize = (10,5))

    axes[0].imshow(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
    axes[0].set_title("Original Image")
    axes[0].axis('off')

    axes[1].imshow(cv2.cvtColor(resized_non_aspect, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
    axes[1].set_title("Non-Aspect Resized")
    axes[1].axis('off')

    axes[2].imshow(cv2.cvtColor(resized_regular, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
    axes[2].set_title("Resized")
    axes[2].axis('off')

    plt.show()

image = np.random.randint(0, 255, (200, 300, 3), dtype=np.uint8) # Sample image
display_image_changes(image)

```

In terms of further reading, I'd strongly suggest looking at *Deep Learning with Python* by François Chollet, which has a great section on data augmentation techniques and how they can improve model robustness. For a more fundamental understanding of image manipulation, the relevant chapters in *Digital Image Processing* by Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods are essential, as well as an understanding of basic linear algebra. Papers from conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV will often discuss cutting edge methods for image manipulation that will keep you up to date on the latest changes in the field. Additionally, pay close attention to the "data preparation" sections of papers when dealing with image recognition tasks as the specifics vary by implementation.

In conclusion, the changes in aspect ratio and size of training datasets can significantly influence model performance. It's critical to be mindful of these changes, to ensure that your models are trained on data that truly represents the target distributions, and to use data augmentation and intelligent resizing strategies effectively. These steps can substantially improve the accuracy and robustness of your models, and that's something we all strive for.
