,  Instead of jumping straight into the code, let me preface with something based on a project I worked on a few years ago involving nuanced text summarization. We needed the raw probabilities – the logits – from a Transformer model, specifically t5, not just the generated text. Turns out, directly accessing those logits isn't exactly the "out-of-the-box" functionality you typically encounter when using libraries like `transformers`. We had to do a bit of digging to understand how the model's internal mechanisms work. Essentially, the `generate` method, which is convenient, hides a lot of the internal processing. If you need the raw logits, you'll have to be more explicit in your approach. So, here's how it generally works.

When a T5 model generates text, it produces a probability distribution over the vocabulary at each step in the generation process. These probabilities are derived from logits, which are the raw, unnormalized scores output by the model's linear layer before the softmax function. The softmax function transforms these logits into probabilities that sum to one. To get these logits, you have to bypass the default generation pipeline and use the model in a more granular fashion. This means you'll manually pass the input through the model and analyze the output at each step.

Here's the core process, explained in detail:

1.  **Tokenization:** First, you need to convert your input text into tokens that the T5 model can understand. You will use the tokenizer associated with your particular t5 variant.
2.  **Model Forward Pass:** Next, you feed these tokens through the T5 model. However, unlike using the `generate` function, you must use the model's forward pass function directly. This allows you to get the raw output from the model before it's post-processed into probabilities. Crucially, you need to provide the input ids and attention masks to the model.
3.  **Logit Extraction:** The output from the forward pass typically includes logits alongside other model outputs. These logits correspond to the scores for each token in the vocabulary at each step in the generation. Specifically, the shape of your logits tensor will typically be `(batch_size, sequence_length, vocabulary_size)`.
4.  **Post-processing (optional):** If needed, these logits can be further processed into probabilities via a softmax operation. However, for various tasks, including certain forms of probability manipulation, the raw logits might be sufficient.

Now, let's look at a few code examples to illustrate this process. I will use PyTorch for these examples as that's the most common framework.

**Example 1: Basic Logit Extraction During a Single Step**

This first example shows how to get logits from a single forward pass for a single token. This is closest to what you’d get if you used the default `generate` but would typically be applied within a loop for multi-step generation:

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

# Load pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example input text
input_text = "translate English to German: The cat sat on the mat."

# Tokenize the input
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
attention_mask = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").attention_mask

# Perform a forward pass
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, decoder_input_ids = torch.tensor([[0]])) # Use 0 for the first token ID

# Extract logits
logits = outputs.logits

print("Logit tensor shape:", logits.shape) # Expecting: torch.Size([1, 1, 32100])
print("First few logits:\n", logits[0, 0, :10])
```

Here, the shape of `logits` is `[1, 1, 32100]` (or whatever the vocabulary size for the t5 model is). This indicates 1 item in the batch (our input), 1 token (since the decoder input is a single token), and 32100 possible logits corresponding to the vocabulary. This first example shows the initial step.

**Example 2: Logit Extraction with Loop and Decoding**

This example illustrates a step-by-step generation with manual extraction of logits over multiple steps. This is a bit more complex but provides an accurate representation of what's going on internally, mimicking generation in a less abstracted way:

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

# Load pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example input text
input_text = "summarize: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
attention_mask = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").attention_mask

# Initialize the decoder input with the start token
decoder_input_ids = torch.tensor([[0]]) # Usually zero for t5 (start of sequence)
max_length = 20  # Maximum length for the generation
all_logits = []

for _ in range(max_length):
  with torch.no_grad():
      outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids)
  logits = outputs.logits
  all_logits.append(logits) # Store the logits for each decoding step
  next_token_id = torch.argmax(logits[:, -1, :], dim=-1).unsqueeze(0)  # Get the token with max probability from the last token prediction
  decoder_input_ids = torch.cat([decoder_input_ids, next_token_id], dim=1)

print("Shape of all logits tensor:", torch.stack(all_logits).shape)  # Shape will be (max_length, 1, 1, vocab_size)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(decoder_input_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print("Generated text:", generated_text)

```

In this example, the process is repeated for multiple steps. During each iteration, the logits are stored, and the next token is selected based on the highest logit from the last position in the sequence. The loop continues until `max_length` is reached. This example shows how you would generate text iteratively while collecting all the logit outputs along the way.

**Example 3: Post-processing Logits into Probabilities**

This example focuses on converting raw logits into probabilities. While the previous example shows you how to capture them, you may also need to convert them to probabilities (even though logits are often sufficient). This will involve using the softmax function, though it’s not absolutely required:

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Load pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example input text
input_text = "translate English to French: Hello, world!"
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
attention_mask = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").attention_mask

decoder_input_ids = torch.tensor([[0]])

with torch.no_grad():
  outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids)

logits = outputs.logits
probabilities = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)

print("Logit tensor shape:", logits.shape) # Example Output: torch.Size([1, 1, 32100])
print("Probabilities tensor shape:", probabilities.shape)  # Example Output: torch.Size([1, 1, 32100])
print("Sum of probabilities for the first token:", torch.sum(probabilities[0, 0, :])) # Approximately 1
print("First few probabilities:\n", probabilities[0,0,:10])
```

In this case, we take the raw logits from the first decoder step and apply the softmax function across the vocabulary dimension (`dim=-1`). The resulting tensor is a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary. The sum of the probabilities along the vocabulary dimension should be approximately 1, as it is a probability distribution.

In summary, extracting logits requires direct access to the model outputs by bypassing the built-in generation functions. You’ll need to manipulate the model's outputs and potentially use a loop to obtain the logits for every generation step. These examples demonstrate key steps in the process. For a deeper understanding of the theoretical underpinnings, I’d highly recommend the original T5 paper ("Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer") and for a more general theoretical review of the underlying architecture, "Attention is All You Need," which is foundational for all transformer models including t5. Also, for a more practical perspective on working with transformers, consider looking into “Natural Language Processing with Transformers” by Tunstall et al. (O’Reilly). These resources should give you a very solid foundation for this type of work. Good luck.
