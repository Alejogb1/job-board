Alright,  It’s a frequent question, and one I've definitely stumbled over myself a few times in past projects. Getting at the internal weights of a TensorFlow layer subclass, especially when you’ve designed something custom, isn’t always immediately obvious. It essentially boils down to how TensorFlow manages trainable variables within the computational graph and how subclasses inherit that structure. I remember back during my work on a generative model for time series data, specifically, I needed to inspect the learnt feature transformation matrices. So, I had to dive into the mechanics of this myself, leading me to adopt some techniques that have served me well ever since.

The core challenge lies in the fact that when you build a custom layer by subclassing `tf.keras.layers.Layer`, TensorFlow needs to know which attributes you intend to be treated as trainable parameters (weights). The mechanism for this is that these parameters need to be explicitly created as `tf.Variable` objects, typically within the `build()` method of your subclass, or sometimes directly in the `__init__` if the layer's input shape is static. And it’s these `tf.Variable` instances that we later want to access.

Here’s the breakdown of accessing them:

Firstly, remember that a subclassed layer in TensorFlow does *not* automatically expose its weights as a simple dictionary or list of attributes. Instead, it uses a specific mechanism for managing trainable variables. These variables are stored as part of the layer's state. The `self.trainable_variables` (or `self.variables`, which includes both trainable and non-trainable) attributes give you access to this internal list of `tf.Variable` objects.

When you call the layer, these variables are used in computations as specified in the `call()` method. Now, to inspect these weights, we can iterate over the trainable variables. The most common approach I use, is to directly access the `trainable_variables` property and then, if needed, extract their values using the `.numpy()` method. Here is how it practically works.

**Example 1: Simple Dense Layer Subclass**

Let's look at a basic example, a dense layer, to illustrate this. This type of layer has a weight matrix and a bias vector.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation=None, **kwargs):
        super(CustomDense, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
            initializer="random_normal",
            trainable=True,
            name='kernel',
        )
        self.b = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units,), initializer="zeros", trainable=True, name='bias'
        )
        super(CustomDense, self).build(input_shape)


    def call(self, inputs):
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b
        if self.activation:
          output = self.activation(output)
        return output

# Example usage:
dense_layer = CustomDense(units=64, activation='relu')
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 128))
_ = dense_layer(input_tensor)  # Trigger build

for var in dense_layer.trainable_variables:
  print(f"Variable Name: {var.name}, Shape: {var.shape}")
  print(f"Example Value (first 5 elements): {var.numpy().flatten()[:5]}")
```

In this example, the `build` method creates `self.w` (the kernel) and `self.b` (the bias) as trainable weights. Notice how these are created using `self.add_weight()`. The key takeaway is the explicit creation of these weights using `self.add_weight`. Inside the `for` loop, each `var` represents a `tf.Variable`, which is exactly what we need to access. We print its name and shape, along with a sample of its values, demonstrating the access mechanism. We also have to perform a forward pass to ensure the weights are initialized since the input shape is only known when the layer is called for the first time.

**Example 2: A Convolutional Layer Subclass**

Let's expand to a slightly more complex example, a convolutional layer subclass.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomConv2D(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, filters, kernel_size, strides=(1, 1), padding='valid', **kwargs):
        super(CustomConv2D, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.filters = filters
        self.kernel_size = kernel_size
        self.strides = strides
        self.padding = padding


    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(*self.kernel_size, input_shape[-1], self.filters),
            initializer="glorot_uniform",
            trainable=True,
            name='conv_kernel',
        )
        self.bias = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.filters,), initializer="zeros", trainable=True, name='conv_bias'
        )
        super(CustomConv2D, self).build(input_shape)


    def call(self, inputs):
        output = tf.nn.conv2d(
            inputs, self.kernel, strides=self.strides, padding=self.padding
        )
        output = tf.nn.bias_add(output, self.bias)
        return output

# Example usage:
conv_layer = CustomConv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), padding='same')
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3))
_ = conv_layer(input_tensor)

for var in conv_layer.trainable_variables:
  print(f"Variable Name: {var.name}, Shape: {var.shape}")
  print(f"Example Value (first 5 elements): {var.numpy().flatten()[:5]}")
```

Again, we follow a similar pattern. The `kernel` and `bias` are created as trainable weights using `self.add_weight()`. We iterate through `trainable_variables` and gain access to each variable. We also trigger the building process first using a dummy input.

**Example 3: A Layer with a Non-Trainable Variable**

Lastly, it’s important to distinguish between trainable and non-trainable variables. Sometimes you might want to track statistics within a layer that aren't meant to be updated via backpropagation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomStatsLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(CustomStatsLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
      self.average = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[-1],),
            initializer="zeros",
            trainable=False,
            name='moving_avg',
        )
      super(CustomStatsLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
      self.average.assign(tf.reduce_mean(inputs, axis=0)) # Track a running average
      return inputs

# Example usage:
stats_layer = CustomStatsLayer()
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 5))
_ = stats_layer(input_tensor)


print("Trainable Variables:")
for var in stats_layer.trainable_variables:
  print(f"Variable Name: {var.name}, Shape: {var.shape}")

print("\nAll Variables:")
for var in stats_layer.variables:
    print(f"Variable Name: {var.name}, Shape: {var.shape}")
    print(f"Example Value (first 5 elements): {var.numpy()[:5]}")


```
Here, the `average` variable is created with `trainable=False`. Therefore, it will not be included in the `trainable_variables` list but *will* be in the `variables` list. This highlights that `trainable_variables` gives you only the weights you need for gradient updates during training, whereas `variables` give you all the state-related variables of the layer.

For deeper insights, I'd recommend exploring a few resources. First and foremost, the TensorFlow documentation itself. Dive deep into the sections on `tf.keras.layers.Layer`, specifically the `build()` method and the concept of trainable variables. Then, "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet is excellent for a more practical understanding of how layers function. For a more in-depth theoretical view of automatic differentiation, you can't go past "Numerical Optimization" by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen J. Wright, which, while not Tensorflow specific, gives you solid background on backpropagation. Finally, papers such as the original “Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition” by LeCun et al can be useful for understanding where the concept of trainable variables originated from.

So, remember, accessing layer weights in a TensorFlow layer subclass involves understanding the `tf.Variable` objects, particularly how they're created in the `build()` method using `self.add_weight` or directly, and then utilizing the `trainable_variables` or `variables` attribute of your layer to inspect their contents. It’s a process that becomes second nature with practice and a solid understanding of the underlying mechanisms of `tf.keras.layers.Layer`.
