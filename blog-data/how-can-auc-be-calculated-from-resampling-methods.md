Alright, let's talk about calculating area under the curve (auc) from resampling methods. I’ve actually encountered this problem a fair bit over the years, often when working with imbalanced datasets or trying to get robust performance estimates for models. It’s a critical part of ensuring your model isn't just memorizing noise.

The fundamental idea here is that standard auc calculations, especially those derived directly from a single training and test set split, can be quite brittle, particularly with smaller datasets or when you're dealing with significant class imbalance. Resampling, in this context, refers to techniques like k-fold cross-validation, bootstrapping, or repeated train-test splits. They essentially allow us to simulate multiple 'trials' of our model's performance by changing the composition of the training and testing data. The auc is then computed on each of these trials and then aggregated. Let me break it down, emphasizing practical concerns and techniques.

The core challenge is that each resampled dataset will generate its own set of predictions, and thus a distinct receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve. Therefore, we don’t have just one auc; we have many, one for each resample. The question then isn’t just “how *do* we compute auc on the resamples,” but “how do we combine these multiple auc values into a meaningful single performance metric?”

Typically, the first thing you'll do is compute the roc curve for each of your resamples, whether using k-fold cross-validation or a bootstrap technique. Each fold or bootstrap sample becomes its own independent evaluation. We then compute the auc from this roc curve on each fold.

So, after running our chosen resampling technique (say, ten-fold cross-validation), we end up with ten auc values. Now, here’s where things get interesting: we typically report the *average* auc as the final evaluation metric, along with the standard deviation or confidence intervals to demonstrate the variability in model performance. This is crucial because a single auc on a fixed split can be misleading.

Let me illustrate this with code examples, assuming we are working with scikit-learn in python:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Generate some sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)

# Setup cross-validation
n_splits = 10
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

auc_scores = []

for train_index, test_index in skf.split(X,y):
  X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
  y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]

  # Train the model (a basic logistic regression model)
  model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', random_state=42)
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)

  # Get predictions on test set
  y_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1] # Probability of positive class

  # Calculate auc for current fold
  auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba)
  auc_scores.append(auc)

# Average and variance of scores
mean_auc = np.mean(auc_scores)
std_auc = np.std(auc_scores)

print(f"Mean AUC: {mean_auc:.4f}")
print(f"Std Dev AUC: {std_auc:.4f}")
```

This example directly calculates the auc on each cross-validation fold. This shows how to deal with *one* type of resampling. Let's look at bootstrapping.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.utils import resample

# Generate some sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)

n_bootstraps = 100
auc_scores = []

for i in range(n_bootstraps):
    # Bootstrap resample
    X_resampled, y_resampled = resample(X, y, random_state = i, replace=True)

    # Split into training and testing (using indices as that's what the library uses)
    n_samples = len(X_resampled)
    train_size = int(0.8 * n_samples)

    train_idx = np.arange(train_size)
    test_idx = np.arange(train_size, n_samples)

    X_train, X_test = X_resampled[train_idx], X_resampled[test_idx]
    y_train, y_test = y_resampled[train_idx], y_resampled[test_idx]


    # Train the model (a basic logistic regression model)
    model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Get predictions on test set
    y_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1] # Probability of positive class

    # Calculate auc for current resample
    auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba)
    auc_scores.append(auc)

# Average and variance of scores
mean_auc = np.mean(auc_scores)
std_auc = np.std(auc_scores)

print(f"Mean AUC: {mean_auc:.4f}")
print(f"Std Dev AUC: {std_auc:.4f}")
```

Here we generate many bootstrapped data sets, train a model on each, and get an auc per training run. Again, we get multiple aucs and we aggregate. You might ask, "Why not just *one* single, large, boostrapped sample and compute the auc of *that*?". The answer is that this wouldn't be reflecting the variability in performance; this is about generating many different splits and seeing how much those splits affect the resulting model's performance. We need to capture that uncertainty to report a robust value.

Now, let's consider a more detailed case: repeated random train-test splits. This technique involves splitting your data into training and test sets multiple times, each time randomly, without replacement.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Generate some sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)

n_repeats = 50
auc_scores = []

for i in range(n_repeats):
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=i)

    # Train the model (a basic logistic regression model)
    model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Get predictions on test set
    y_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1] # Probability of positive class

    # Calculate auc for current split
    auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba)
    auc_scores.append(auc)

# Average and variance of scores
mean_auc = np.mean(auc_scores)
std_auc = np.std(auc_scores)


print(f"Mean AUC: {mean_auc:.4f}")
print(f"Std Dev AUC: {std_auc:.4f}")
```

These examples demonstrate how to get robust estimates of the area under the roc curve using multiple common resampling techniques.

However, it is crucial to note that this is still an average of the auc values. It doesn’t, for example, provide the actual *distribution* of the roc curve, but *merely* a collection of auc values. This approach assumes we can summarize performance using an average and standard deviation, which isn’t always true. The interpretation of the aggregated AUC becomes an aggregate of the model’s generalization performance *across* different data subsets.

If you want a deeper dive into cross-validation techniques, I'd recommend "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. It's a classic and covers resampling and model selection in significant detail. For more on bootstrapping, the book "An Introduction to the Bootstrap" by Efron and Tibshirani provides a comprehensive treatment. And, to be clear, in real-world analysis it is common to see a report that shows mean auc *and* the distribution. This last point is very important when we start using these models to make important decisions.

In practice, you may also want to consider using stratified versions of these resampling methods to ensure balanced representation of classes across folds (for cross-validation) or samples (for bootstrapping), especially when you have imbalanced datasets, as I’ve seen on a few projects before.

Finally, remember that the selection of the appropriate resampling technique often depends on the dataset size, structure, and computational constraints. Cross-validation is common, and bootstrapping is more intensive but useful for assessing uncertainty, while repeated train-test splits are a quick-and-dirty but often effective approach. Each provides a different lens on your model’s robustness. The crucial thing is to report the aggregate values of auc along with a measure of variability to truly show your performance is statistically robust.
