alright, so you're looking at building a directed acyclic graph, a dag, that can take csv data, row by row, and feed it into your processing units, or operators. i've been there, done that, got the t-shirt, and probably debugged it way past 3 am a couple of times. let me tell you how i tackled this kind of thing in the past, and what patterns work best in my experience.

first off, let's break this down. a dag, at its core, represents a series of tasks and their dependencies. in your case, we have this flow: read csv row -> perform operation -> maybe write somewhere else. and this needs to happen for every row of your file. so the first part we need to address is how we can ingest our data, i personally found that working with generator functions helps a lot here, they are memory friendly and allow processing as needed instead of loading all the csv into memory.

i worked for a fintech startup some years ago, we had a big influx of csv files for market data on a daily basis, and those csv's could get quite large and messy, like, imagine 100gb files with no clear schema just a couple of columns and that was it. we had to find ways to efficiently ingest this data in near-real-time to build our analytics pipelines, and that's how i started doing this.

here's a quick python snippet to show how you can make a simple generator for csv processing, the csv module from the python standard library is quite handy for this:

```python
import csv

def csv_row_generator(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
        header = next(csv_reader) #skip header if needed or use it for metadata
        for row in csv_reader:
            yield row

# example usage:
# for row in csv_row_generator("my_data.csv"):
#     print(row)
```

this is the first crucial part. the `csv_row_generator` reads the csv and yields one row at a time, it doesn't keep the entire file in ram. this is important, especially when you're dealing with large files, also error handling and sanitizing are left out but should not be dismissed in production scenarios, but the core concept here is what matters, having a generator of rows.

next, we need to think about the dag structure itself. you mentioned 'operators', which implies some form of processing, we need to figure out how to pass the output of the csv generator into those operators. there are several ways, but the approach i've found to be the most flexible involves defining a simple structure to represent our operations and then pass data through. a python class can be very useful here.

i remember once we had to do some complicated transformations, it was so convoluted that the pipeline started looking like an ancient egyptian wall with hieroglyphs and i had to do a refactor to make it understandable. it was not fun, that's why, i started working with simple classes representing the tasks.

```python
class Operator:
    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function

    def process(self, data):
        return self.function(data)

# example operators:
def convert_to_float(row):
  return [float(x) if x else None for x in row ] # some data cleaning too here
def add_one(row):
  return [x+1 if x else None for x in row ]

# example usage:
op1 = Operator(convert_to_float)
op2 = Operator(add_one)

# row = ["1", "2", "3"]
# processed_row = op2.process(op1.process(row))
# print(processed_row)
```

in this snippet, the `operator` class wraps a function. the `process` method executes that function. this allows you to encapsulate operations, making the dag composition easier to reason about. and now you have different processing units you can add to the data flow.

now let's put all of this together. we need to pull from the csv generator and push the data through our dag of operators. this is the core of the processing pipeline, in the real world scenarios you might need to execute some operators in parallel depending on how computationally heavy the operators are or use some message broker like kafka to make the pipeline more scalable, but here, lets keep it simple:

```python
def execute_dag(data_generator, operators):
    for row in data_generator:
        processed_row = row
        for operator in operators:
            processed_row = operator.process(processed_row)
        print(f"output: {processed_row}") # or write to a file, database, etc.

# define operators for our dag
operators_list = [Operator(convert_to_float),Operator(add_one)]

# using our previous function and our operators
csv_data = csv_row_generator("my_data.csv")
execute_dag(csv_data, operators_list)
```

this `execute_dag` function iterates through your csv rows, passes each row through the sequence of operators. the result is what you want, the output of our dag applied to the input data, in this example is just a `print` but can be a write operation to a database, a file or whatever you need.

so, in essence, to achieve what you're asking for, you need:

1.  a data generator that yields your data row by row: the `csv_row_generator`.
2.  a way to define your processing units as operations: the `Operator` class
3.  a way to push your data through the graph, or sequence of operations, like `execute_dag`.

this pattern, in my opinion, is very flexible. you can add more complex transformations, logging, error handling, parallelization and so on. remember, the structure of the dag is implicit in the order of operations in the `operators` list.

and that's it, you have a simple but powerful framework to build your data pipelines. it may not be perfect but it will get you started.

for resources, instead of linking to random blog posts, i'd suggest checking out "designing data-intensive applications" by martin kleppmann, it gives great insights about building data systems. also reading about functional programming concepts might help to think in more composable operators and reduce side effects, a classic book is "structure and interpretation of computer programs" by abelson and sussman, but maybe that is a bit more on the theoretical side for the problem you're looking at. they are all worth reading. i hope this helps, and may your pipelines run smoothly (and quickly!).
