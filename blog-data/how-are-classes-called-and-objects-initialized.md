Alright, let’s delve into this. It's a fundamental question, yet the mechanics are quite nuanced. I've certainly spent more than my fair share of hours debugging initialization errors, and over time, I've come to appreciate the elegant, though sometimes unforgiving, logic at play.

When we talk about calling classes and initializing objects, we're really discussing the lifecycle of an object in object-oriented programming. We have to be clear that a class is a blueprint, a template, for creating objects. It's not an object itself. The process involves, firstly, calling the class constructor and secondly, properly initializing the attributes, the state, of the object instance.

The act of "calling" a class, in practical terms, means invoking its constructor. The constructor, often named something specific depending on the language, for example, `__init__` in Python or the class name itself in Java, is the method that gets automatically executed when an object is created. It's crucial as it's where the object receives its initial state. This process is not simply about allocating memory; it's about crafting an object into a usable form, ready to interact with the rest of the program.

Initialization, on the other hand, is the process of setting the initial values of the object's attributes. It's during this phase that the object's specific properties are defined. For instance, for a class representing a user, the constructor might accept the user's name and email as arguments, and these arguments then initialize the corresponding attributes. Without proper initialization, an object might be in an inconsistent state, leading to unexpected behaviors and those notorious bugs.

Let's walk through some examples. I’ll use Python, Java, and JavaScript to illustrate different nuances, as the specifics can change across languages.

**Example 1: Python**

Python's constructor is defined using `__init__`. Here's a simple example:

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, pages):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.pages = pages
        self.is_borrowed = False # Default state

    def display_details(self):
        print(f"Title: {self.title}, Author: {self.author}, Pages: {self.pages}")


my_book = Book("The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "Douglas Adams", 224)
my_book.display_details()
print(my_book.is_borrowed)
```

In this snippet, `Book("The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "Douglas Adams", 224)` is the line where the class is 'called', and under the hood, the `__init__` method is executed. The arguments are passed to it, which then assigns them to `self.title`, `self.author`, and `self.pages`. The `is_borrowed` attribute is also initialized by default within the constructor to `False`. This illustrates that initialization can also include setting default states.

**Example 2: Java**

Java handles things slightly differently. Constructors use the same name as the class:

```java
public class Car {
    private String model;
    private String color;
    private int year;
    private boolean isStarted;

    public Car(String model, String color, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
        this.year = year;
        this.isStarted = false; // Default state
    }

    public void displayDetails(){
        System.out.println("Model: " + this.model + ", Color: " + this.color + ", Year: " + this.year);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Model S", "Red", 2023);
        myCar.displayDetails();
        System.out.println(myCar.isStarted);
    }
}
```

Here, `new Car("Model S", "Red", 2023)` is where the class is 'called' using the `new` keyword. Again, the values passed in are used to initialize the corresponding fields of the `Car` object. The `isStarted` property is initialized to `false` within the constructor itself, demonstrating default value assignment.

**Example 3: JavaScript**

JavaScript, with its prototypical inheritance, is slightly more nuanced when it comes to classes (introduced later) but operates similarly to the previous languages:

```javascript
class Circle {
    constructor(radius) {
      this.radius = radius;
      this.area = 0;
      this.calculateArea(); //Initialize area at creation
    }

    calculateArea(){
       this.area = Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
    }

    displayDetails(){
        console.log(`Radius: ${this.radius}, Area: ${this.area}`)
    }
  }

  let myCircle = new Circle(5);
  myCircle.displayDetails();
```

In this instance, using the `new` keyword, the `Circle` class is called, and the `constructor` is executed. Notice that the initialization of the `area` is not done directly in the constructor parameters, instead a helper method `calculateArea` is called directly within the constructor to perform more complex initialization logic. This is an important technique for complex objects that need initialization beyond setting simple attributes, as well as demonstrating how the constructor can utilize other methods to fully initialize the object.

Key takeaways from these examples are:

*   **The `new` Keyword:** In many languages, `new` is the explicit operator that triggers the allocation of memory and the execution of the constructor. Languages like Python, although lacking the keyword, implicitly trigger constructor execution when using the class name like `Book("title", "author", 123)`.

*   **Constructor's Role:** The constructor is the entry point for initializing an object's state. It accepts input parameters and uses them to set initial attribute values and can also be used to call other methods for more complex initialization processes.

*   **Default States:** Initializing attributes with default values is common practice. It prevents objects from having uninitialized or unpredictable states from the outset.

When errors occur related to object creation, one must first inspect the constructor, ensuring the correct arguments are being passed, that no required arguments are missing, and that all attributes are properly set, keeping an eye on the types of the passed in arguments. Debuggers are also invaluable tools for stepping through constructor code, watching attribute values, and identifying where errors occur. I've lost count of the times that stepping through the initialization has pinpointed an issue faster than poring over pages of code.

For deeper insights, I’d suggest exploring some classic texts on object-oriented programming and language-specific documentation. "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma et al. is excellent for a theoretical understanding of object construction and design, and "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch provides very practical advice and best practices specific to Java but much of the advice is universally applicable to object oriented principles. Of course, any language’s official documentation should be the first point of reference.

Finally, understanding how classes are called and objects are initialized is crucial for writing robust and predictable code. While seemingly basic, paying careful attention to these foundational concepts can save a significant amount of debugging time down the line. Remember, objects are constructed, not simply created; every detail counts in their initial crafting.
