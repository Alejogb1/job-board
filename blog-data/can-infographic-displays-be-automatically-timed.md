Alright, let’s talk about timed infographic displays. This is a challenge I’ve bumped into several times, particularly during my tenure on a project visualizing real-time sensor data for a large-scale industrial operation. We were dealing with a firehose of information, and just throwing all of it onto a dashboard was clearly not going to work. The sheer volume would overwhelm any user, and without proper sequencing or timing, crucial anomalies might be missed. So, yes, automatically timed infographic displays are absolutely achievable, and they're often vital for effective communication of data, especially dynamic data.

The core idea revolves around dynamically controlling what information is presented and when. The approach fundamentally shifts from a static display to a choreographed data presentation. This requires us to go beyond simple data binding and into the realm of state management, animation, and often, quite a bit of planning related to the pacing of the content. The complexity increases based on the diversity of data, the level of detail required, and the user's specific interaction needs.

There are several ways to tackle this, but they generally fall into a few key categories. The most straightforward involves time-based transitions, where each element or group of elements is displayed for a set duration. A more advanced method employs conditional logic, showing different parts of the infographic based on the current time or perhaps even the value of underlying data. Finally, some systems might integrate with external signals or real-time data streams to dynamically adjust what’s displayed, offering a truly adaptive visualization.

Let's break this down with some examples. Suppose we’re dealing with a simplified system monitoring temperature at three different sensor locations (A, B, and C). We want to cycle through each location's data point within a ten-second interval, so the user can easily follow the data without being overloaded. Here's how we can achieve that using javascript with a basic html structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Timed Infographic</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="infographic"></div>
    <script>
        const infographic = document.getElementById('infographic');
        const sensorData = {
            A: [25, 26, 27, 28, 29],
            B: [20, 21, 22, 23, 24],
            C: [30, 31, 32, 33, 34],
        };
        let sensorIndex = 0;
        let dataIndex = 0;
        const sensors = Object.keys(sensorData);
        function updateInfographic() {
            const currentSensor = sensors[sensorIndex];
            infographic.textContent = `Sensor: ${currentSensor}, Temperature: ${sensorData[currentSensor][dataIndex]}`;
            dataIndex++;
            if (dataIndex >= sensorData[currentSensor].length) {
                dataIndex = 0;
                sensorIndex = (sensorIndex + 1) % sensors.length;
            }
        }
        setInterval(updateInfographic, 2000); // switch every 2 seconds within each sensor's data set
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```
This first example demonstrates the basic timing mechanism. We cycle through sensors, then cycle through values within each sensor. Each data point is displayed for 2 seconds before advancing. The modulo operator ensures we loop back to the first sensor after reaching the last.

Now, let’s introduce a more intricate scenario where timing is not just sequential but also conditional. Imagine an infographic showing system resource utilization. We want to highlight the component with the highest load at each specific time. We can use conditional rendering and javascript to present this. This example includes dummy data, of course, but the fundamental concept is directly transferable to real-world data.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Conditional Infographic</title>
    <style>
        .highlight {
            font-weight: bold;
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="resource-display"></div>
    <script>
        const resourceDisplay = document.getElementById('resource-display');
        const resourceData = [
        { timestamp: 0, cpu: 30, memory: 60, disk: 20 },
        { timestamp: 2, cpu: 70, memory: 40, disk: 30 },
        { timestamp: 4, cpu: 20, memory: 80, disk: 50 },
        { timestamp: 6, cpu: 40, memory: 50, disk: 70 },
        ];
        let currentIndex = 0;
        function updateResourceDisplay() {
            const currentData = resourceData[currentIndex];
            let maxResource = 'cpu';
            if (currentData.memory > currentData[maxResource]) maxResource = 'memory';
            if (currentData.disk > currentData[maxResource]) maxResource = 'disk';

            resourceDisplay.innerHTML = `
            <p>Timestamp: ${currentData.timestamp}</p>
            <p>CPU: <span class="${maxResource === 'cpu' ? 'highlight' : ''}">${currentData.cpu}%</span></p>
            <p>Memory: <span class="${maxResource === 'memory' ? 'highlight' : ''}">${currentData.memory}%</span></p>
            <p>Disk: <span class="${maxResource === 'disk' ? 'highlight' : ''}">${currentData.disk}%</span></p>
            `;
            currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % resourceData.length;
        }
        setInterval(updateResourceDisplay, 2000);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we identify the resource with the highest value at the current timestamp. We then dynamically add a class to highlight it, presenting different elements as the most relevant at different times. This demonstrates conditional timing within the infographic based on underlying data conditions.

Finally, let’s explore a scenario where external factors drive the infographic’s timing. This could involve a system that adjusts its presentation based on real-time data. While a complete real-time data feed is beyond the scope of this response, let’s simulate it by dynamically generating data that we'll then use to adjust the infographic's presentation. We'll visualize data associated with error counts in a distributed system:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Dynamic Infographic</title>
    <style>
       .critical {
           color: red;
           font-weight: bold;
       }
        .warning{
            color: orange;
            font-style: italic;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="error-display"></div>
    <script>
       const errorDisplay = document.getElementById('error-display');
       const nodes = ['node1', 'node2', 'node3', 'node4'];
        function generateErrorData() {
            return nodes.reduce((acc, node) => {
                acc[node] = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10); // Random error counts
                return acc;
            }, {});
        }
        function updateErrorDisplay() {
           const errorCounts = generateErrorData();
           let errorMessages = Object.entries(errorCounts).map(([node, count]) => {
               let cssClass = '';
               if(count > 5){
                  cssClass = 'critical';
               } else if (count > 2){
                   cssClass = 'warning';
               }
               return `<p>Node: ${node}, Errors: <span class="${cssClass}">${count}</span></p>`;
           }).join('');

            errorDisplay.innerHTML = errorMessages;

        }
        setInterval(updateErrorDisplay, 3000); // Update every 3 seconds with new data
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

This example is a step closer to real-world scenarios where the timing of the presentation is driven by fluctuating external conditions. This can be further expanded to handle data feeds, external sensors, or any system providing live metrics. The critical point is that each display update is not only timed, but also actively influenced by changes in the source data.

For those wanting to delve deeper into this, I’d suggest starting with the foundational texts on interactive data visualization. Check out “Interactive Data Visualization: Foundations, Techniques, and Applications” by Matthew O. Ward, Georges Grinstein, and Daniel Keim. It covers the principles that these timed systems build upon. Also, a look at literature on temporal data handling in computer science would help. If you find yourself using Javascript, familiarizing yourself with reactive programming patterns and techniques of manipulating the DOM based on time would benefit you.

In conclusion, automatic timing of infographic displays is not just about making them look flashy—it’s about making them more effective tools for data comprehension. The key is to carefully consider your data, your audience, and the story you're trying to tell, then implement a timing strategy that highlights the critical points at the appropriate moments. This may seem nuanced, but focusing on the 'why' behind the timing, as well as the 'how,' is the difference between a static, overwhelming information dump and a dynamic, insightful visualization.
