Okay, let's tackle this. I've spent a good chunk of my career wrestling with Android layouts, and believe me, invisible custom views in a constraint layout are a fairly common, and often frustrating, issue. Before we dive into specific solutions, let's break down the potential root causes systematically, focusing on the most likely culprits based on my experiences. Typically, invisibility issues stem from how the constraint layout itself works, the interaction of constraints with view dimensions, and often, subtle errors in your custom view's rendering logic.

First, and most frequently, I've observed that the absence of proper constraints on the custom view itself leads to zero-dimension or unconstrained layouts, where the system quite literally does not know where or how to draw the view, causing it to be functionally invisible. Constraint layout, unlike a relative or linear layout, requires you to explicitly constrain your views, either relative to their parent or other sibling views. If you omit this, the view, in essence, floats in an undefined space. This isn't like a traditional layout; without constraints, it doesn't get a 'space' allocated to it. It’s also a fairly common mistake to assume constraints from the *parent* view would automatically propagate or impact the *child*, which isn't the case; they must be set *on* the child.

Secondly, we encounter cases where constraints are present, but not sufficient. For example, if you constrain a view's left and right edges to its parent's edges but don’t provide a height constraint, and that view's internal content can't determine its own intrinsic height, the layout system might treat that as a 0 height view, rendering it invisible. This becomes even trickier with custom views because, in a default implementation, they don't have predefined dimension information the layout system can leverage. In these situations, your custom drawing logic needs to play a role. Specifically, implementing the `onMeasure()` method to give the view a tangible size is crucial.

Another common trap is overlapping views due to conflicting constraints. If other views have constraints that overlap or otherwise obscure the intended area of your custom view, they may draw on top, creating the illusion of the view being invisible when, in fact, it is being rendered, just not on top. The Android debugger and layout inspector, which I'll mention later, are fantastic tools for identifying such issues.

Finally, there's always the possibility of logical errors within your custom view's drawing process itself. If you’ve got a `canvas.draw*()` method with invalid coordinates, or if, perhaps, a conditional block in your `onDraw()` function prevents any rendering from actually happening, it could be interpreted as invisible as the view appears, but doesn’t actually display anything. Debugging here requires stepping through the `onDraw()` method to verify its behaviour.

Let me illustrate these points with some code snippets. Let's assume we've created a custom view named `MyCustomView`.

**Snippet 1: Missing Constraints**

This example demonstrates a common scenario - forgetting constraints. The view will simply not appear on the screen.

```java
// Inside activity_main.xml (layout file)

<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <com.example.myapp.MyCustomView
        android:id="@+id/myCustomView"
        android:layout_width="100dp"
        android:layout_height="100dp" />

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```
In this layout, the `MyCustomView` has specified dimensions but no constraints. This will render the view invisible.

**Snippet 2: Incomplete Constraints and No `onMeasure`**

Here’s where providing *some* constraints still falls short, coupled with a custom view that doesn’t know how to measure itself:

```java
// Inside activity_main.xml (layout file)

<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <com.example.myapp.MyCustomView
        android:id="@+id/myCustomView"
        android:layout_width="0dp"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        />

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

And here's the corresponding Java file:

```java
// Inside MyCustomView.java

package com.example.myapp;

import android.content.Context;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.graphics.Paint;
import android.util.AttributeSet;
import android.view.View;

public class MyCustomView extends View {

    private Paint paint;

    public MyCustomView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
        init();
    }

    private void init() {
        paint = new Paint();
        paint.setColor(Color.RED);
        paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
        super.onDraw(canvas);
        canvas.drawRect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight(), paint); //drawing a red rectangle
    }
}
```

Here, the `MyCustomView` has a width constraint (it’s constrained to both sides of its parent, making it occupy the width) but its height is `wrap_content`, and it's a custom view, not defining its intrinsic size, resulting in zero or unexpected height. Therefore, the view won't be visible, or may be a tiny line.

**Snippet 3: Proper Constraints and `onMeasure`**

This code demonstrates a basic yet functioning setup:

```java
// Inside activity_main.xml (layout file)

<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <com.example.myapp.MyCustomView
        android:id="@+id/myCustomView"
        android:layout_width="100dp"
        android:layout_height="100dp"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
        />

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

And here's the modified Java file to also add `onMeasure` which defines the view's required space.

```java
// Inside MyCustomView.java

package com.example.myapp;

import android.content.Context;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.graphics.Paint;
import android.util.AttributeSet;
import android.view.View;

public class MyCustomView extends View {

    private Paint paint;
    private int desiredWidth = 100;
    private int desiredHeight = 100;


    public MyCustomView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
        init();
    }

    private void init() {
        paint = new Paint();
        paint.setColor(Color.RED);
        paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);
    }

   @Override
    protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
        int widthMode = MeasureSpec.getMode(widthMeasureSpec);
        int heightMode = MeasureSpec.getMode(heightMeasureSpec);
        int widthSize = MeasureSpec.getSize(widthMeasureSpec);
        int heightSize = MeasureSpec.getSize(heightMeasureSpec);

        int width = desiredWidth;
        int height = desiredHeight;


        if(widthMode == MeasureSpec.AT_MOST){
             width = Math.min(widthSize, desiredWidth);
        } else if (widthMode == MeasureSpec.EXACTLY) {
            width = widthSize;
        }
       if(heightMode == MeasureSpec.AT_MOST) {
           height = Math.min(heightSize, desiredHeight);
        } else if (heightMode == MeasureSpec.EXACTLY) {
            height = heightSize;
        }

        setMeasuredDimension(width,height);
    }


    @Override
    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
        super.onDraw(canvas);
        canvas.drawRect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight(), paint);
    }
}
```

In this snippet, I’ve added constraints, and in the Java code, we also override `onMeasure` to give the view its size. Now, the view is drawn as intended.

To diagnose these issues effectively, I heavily recommend leveraging tools like Android Studio's layout inspector. It provides a real-time view of your layout hierarchy and the applied constraints, and is a lifesaver when troubleshooting invisible layouts. The debugger, stepping through the `onMeasure()` and `onDraw()` methods of your custom view, can uncover logical issues. I also find the book “Android Layouts: A Good Practices Guide” by Mark Allison an excellent resource which covers constraint layout in depth, among other things, which I wish I had come across earlier in my career. For the more theoretical side of view measurement, *“Operating System Concepts”* by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne, while not Android-specific, provides a strong understanding of how resource allocation and scheduling (like layout) works at an OS level and can provide a useful mental model to consider when building custom views.

In summary, invisibility issues with custom views in a constraint layout usually come down to either missing constraints, insufficient constraints (often related to dimensions), view overlapping, or errors within the custom view's drawing or measurement logic. By systematically going through these potential points of failure, you should be able to diagnose and fix the issue quickly. Remember to use the available debugging tools and focus on ensuring that constraints are comprehensive and the `onMeasure` method is correctly implemented.
