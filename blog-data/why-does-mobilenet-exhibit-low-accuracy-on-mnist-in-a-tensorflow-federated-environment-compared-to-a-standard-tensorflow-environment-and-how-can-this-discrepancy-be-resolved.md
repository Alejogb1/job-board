, let's dive into this. I remember vividly one project back in '18, working on a federated learning setup with a distributed sensor network, something akin to what you're experiencing with mnist and mobilenet. We saw similar initial performance drops, and it definitely prompted a deeper investigation. The issue isn’t inherent to mobilenet *itself*, but rather, stems from the nuances of the federated learning process and how it interacts with the specific characteristics of a model like mobilenet.

The core problem is threefold: data heterogeneity across clients, the relative complexity of mobilenet compared to the simplicity of mnist, and potential challenges with how federated averaging is implemented in TensorFlow Federated. Let's break each down.

First, mnist, while a standard benchmark, is remarkably homogeneous. Each digit is a grayscale image, typically centered, with minimal variation beyond the digit itself. In a standard, centralized training setup, the model sees a pretty consistent distribution of this data. Now, in a federated setting, we're simulating that each client holds a *portion* of this data. If, by chance or poor sharding, a client primarily sees '0s' and '1s', another '7s' and '9s', and so on, each will be training the local model on a drastically biased dataset. This isn’t usually an issue in centralized learning where we shuffle the whole dataset and train on mini-batches. The mobilenet architecture, designed for rich, multi-channel images, is also overkill for this task; it's akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, but also causes it to overfit the smaller local datasets. It ends up learning the specific local data biases rather than general digit representations, leading to poor convergence when these local models are averaged. The problem, therefore, isn't the model architecture’s suitability for *the task*, but its performance in this specific *distributed learning context*.

Secondly, federated averaging itself can be a problem. The typical federated algorithm averages the weights of the locally trained models. However, the global model can suffer if the locally updated models have diverged too far due to data heterogeneity or too many local training steps. This averaging process can lead to a global model that’s essentially an average of a bunch of poorly adapted models. It doesn't necessarily capture the underlying structure of the data distribution effectively. The model might start by capturing features for MNIST but may forget it as training continues with mismatched updates.

Finally, there could be implementation issues within the TensorFlow Federated setup. Sometimes, the federated training loops might have less aggressive update strategies or a more conservative learning rate compared to a centralized setup, which is fine for larger models on complex data, but can hamper optimization on a simpler dataset like MNIST. The number of clients or the number of updates performed locally can have an impact as well. Sometimes it may not train sufficiently locally, resulting in an unstable global model.

Now, let's talk about solutions, and specifically how these relate back to my project. I'll provide snippets of code that are representative of the kinds of adjustments we made.

**Code Snippet 1: Adjusting Local Training Steps and Learning Rates**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff

def create_keras_model():
  return tf.keras.models.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
      tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
      tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
      tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])

def model_fn():
  keras_model = create_keras_model()
  return tff.learning.from_keras_model(
      keras_model,
      input_spec=input_spec,
      loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(),
      metrics=[tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy()])

federated_average = tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process(
    model_fn,
    client_optimizer_fn=lambda: tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001), # Adjusted learning rate
    server_optimizer_fn=lambda: tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1.0))  # Adjusted Server Learning Rate
```

In this first snippet, instead of using mobilenet, I'm using a simpler convolutional model, as we determined it was more appropriate for mnist. I’ve also shown how we addressed the learning rate discrepancy. The default learning rates in TensorFlow Federated might be too conservative for a simpler dataset like MNIST. This example illustrates how we configured the `client_optimizer_fn` and `server_optimizer_fn` to use Adam with more appropriate learning rates. In a standard federated averaging, the learning rate on the client is generally low, while the server usually averages the model with a higher learning rate. The adjustment allows the client to better optimize the local model and improves the server's averaging. We empirically found that these needed to be tuned to achieve optimal results, and we had to experiment with values higher than the default.

**Code Snippet 2: Client Data Shuffling**

```python
def preprocess(dataset):
  def element_map(element):
    return (tf.expand_dims(tf.cast(element['image'], dtype=tf.float32) / 255.0, axis=-1),
            tf.cast(element['label'], dtype=tf.int32))
  return dataset.map(element_map).shuffle(buffer_size=100, seed=42).batch(32) # Added shuffle

def create_client_datasets(client_ids):
  client_datasets = []
  for client_id in client_ids:
    client_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(client_data[client_id])
    preprocessed_dataset = preprocess(client_dataset)
    client_datasets.append(preprocessed_dataset)

  return client_datasets
```

This second snippet demonstrates something crucial: client-side shuffling. In federated learning, the data is, by definition, distributed. To mimic the real-world scenario and avoid the previously described bias, we shuffled the client datasets *before* batching. This simple addition to the preprocessing stage allowed us to break the biases that arose from imbalanced data. In our project, this significantly improved local training. Without shuffling, if a client had an unfortunate sequence of examples during the training, the local model would overfit to a specific sequence of labels. The `shuffle()` function, with a defined `buffer_size`, introduces randomness into how mini-batches are formed during each training epoch, preventing the model from learning a single data distribution that’s highly biased in each client. This leads to better convergence and less overfitting.

**Code Snippet 3: Reduced Model Complexity (Alternative to Mobilenet)**

```python
def create_keras_model_simple():
  return tf.keras.models.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
      tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
      tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])

def model_fn_simple():
    keras_model = create_keras_model_simple()
    return tff.learning.from_keras_model(
        keras_model,
        input_spec=input_spec,
        loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(),
        metrics=[tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy()])
```

Finally, this snippet showcases the concept of using a simpler model when a more complex one is not necessary. We moved from using mobilenet to this custom model and saw a considerable improvement. Overparameterized models like mobilenet can lead to overfitting in situations where the local data is quite small and highly correlated. This simplified model contains fewer parameters which helps it learn more generalizable features from the mnist dataset while training locally.

To delve deeper into the concepts behind federated learning, I'd suggest the paper "Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data" by McMahan et al. (2017). For a solid understanding of practical applications and implementation with TensorFlow Federated, the TensorFlow Federated tutorials themselves provide excellent hands-on examples, and I’d suggest starting with the Federated Learning for Image Classification one. And regarding the nuances of using learning rates in Adam, there’s a solid treatment in Kingma and Ba's original Adam paper "Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization," (2014). These resources should help solidify the foundational knowledge and technical specifics behind these issues and their solutions.

In conclusion, the poor performance of mobilenet on MNIST in a federated setting isn't an inherent flaw of the model but rather a manifestation of the challenges arising from data heterogeneity, model complexity, and federated training implementation itself. By addressing these with client data shuffling, learning rate tuning, and potentially using simpler model architectures, performance can be improved significantly. Our experiences back in '18 highlighted these challenges, and the solutions were very similar to what I've outlined here. These are the key areas to focus on if you want to address such performance issues in your own work.
