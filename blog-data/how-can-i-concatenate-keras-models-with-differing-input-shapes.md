Right then, let’s tackle the challenge of concatenating Keras models that have varying input shapes. I’ve certainly bumped into this situation more than once, particularly during my tenure working on multi-modal AI projects, where combining image data with tabular features was a regular occurrence. It’s not as straightforward as simply stacking layers; we need a strategy to harmonise the inputs before we can effectively fuse the model outputs.

The core issue arises because the concatenation operation in Keras (or TensorFlow, beneath the surface) requires the tensors it’s joining to have compatible shapes along the axis being concatenated. When we are dealing with outputs of entire models, this almost always involves the final dimension, which usually represents the feature vector size or the number of output units. If our models have differing input shapes, they will often, although not always, generate outputs with disparate feature vector sizes. Therefore, direct concatenation is often going to lead to shape mismatches and errors.

The method I usually lean on involves employing one of two primary techniques, each with their own set of use-cases: input preprocessing and intermediate layer manipulation, often in conjunction with feature mapping. Let’s examine those individually.

**1. Preprocessing Inputs and Feature Extraction**

One common approach involves preprocessing the inputs to a shared format before they are fed into the respective models. This preprocessing might involve resizing images, embedding categorical data, or standardizing numerical inputs to a consistent feature vector length. The trick here is to ensure the outputs of *these* pre-processing steps are compatible before being fed to the models, rather than the inputs *to* the model itself being compatible. Once preprocessed, the models process these inputs and can be concatenated.

For example, consider a scenario where you have a model that takes images as input and another model designed to process tabular data. The image model might output a feature vector of, say, 512 elements, while the tabular model might output a feature vector of 128 elements. Before concatenating their outputs, we'd need to ensure they are of the same size. Let's assume we can get an output of 256 elements from each preprocessing block.

Here's a simplified example using Keras to demonstrate the approach:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers

# Define the preprocessing layers
def create_image_preprocessing(input_shape=(64, 64, 3), target_features=256):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(inputs)
    x = layers.MaxPool2D(2)(x)
    x = layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu')(x)
    x = layers.MaxPool2D(2)(x)
    x = layers.Flatten()(x)
    x = layers.Dense(target_features, activation='relu')(x)
    return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)

def create_tabular_preprocessing(input_shape=(10,), target_features=256):
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
  x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(inputs)
  x = layers.Dense(target_features, activation='relu')(x)
  return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)

# Create model inputs
image_input_shape = (64, 64, 3)
tabular_input_shape = (10,)

# Create preprocessors
image_preprocessor = create_image_preprocessing(image_input_shape)
tabular_preprocessor = create_tabular_preprocessing(tabular_input_shape)

# Dummy inputs
image_input = keras.Input(shape=image_input_shape)
tabular_input = keras.Input(shape=tabular_input_shape)

# Pass the inputs through the preprocessor models
processed_image = image_preprocessor(image_input)
processed_tabular = tabular_preprocessor(tabular_input)

# Concatenate the processed outputs
concatenated_features = layers.concatenate([processed_image, processed_tabular])


# Build and compile the final model
output = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(concatenated_features)
combined_model = keras.Model(inputs=[image_input, tabular_input], outputs=output)
combined_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
combined_model.summary()
```
Here, both `image_preprocessor` and `tabular_preprocessor` transform the original input into a feature vector of the same size. This means that they can be successfully concatenated after their respective outputs are generated. This approach is best when you need control over preprocessing or when direct feature engineering is beneficial.

**2. Feature Mapping and Reshaping**

The second method comes into play when direct preprocessing to uniform feature vector size is too destructive or cumbersome. Instead, it works by manipulating the intermediate layers (specifically the final layers) of each model to map their outputs to a consistent dimension for concatenation. This involves adding additional dense layers to ensure our models’ outputs end with a feature vector with an identical size. This approach is especially useful when the models generate distinct, semantically rich feature representations that shouldn’t be altered by a general resizing step.

Here's a code illustration:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers

# Define simple models with differing output feature sizes
def create_image_model(input_shape=(64, 64, 3), hidden_dim=256):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(inputs)
    x = layers.MaxPool2D(2)(x)
    x = layers.Flatten()(x)
    x = layers.Dense(hidden_dim, activation='relu')(x)
    return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)

def create_tabular_model(input_shape=(10,), hidden_dim=128):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Dense(hidden_dim, activation='relu')(inputs)
    return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)


# Define the target feature size for mapping
target_feature_size = 512

# Create input layers
image_input = keras.Input(shape=(64,64,3))
tabular_input = keras.Input(shape=(10,))

# Create the models
image_model = create_image_model()
tabular_model = create_tabular_model()


# Get the intermediate layer outputs
image_features = image_model(image_input)
tabular_features = tabular_model(tabular_input)

# Add Dense mapping layers
image_mapped = layers.Dense(target_feature_size, activation='relu')(image_features)
tabular_mapped = layers.Dense(target_feature_size, activation='relu')(tabular_features)


# Concatenate the mapped features
concatenated_features = layers.concatenate([image_mapped, tabular_mapped])


# Build the final model
output = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(concatenated_features)
combined_model = keras.Model(inputs=[image_input, tabular_input], outputs=output)
combined_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
combined_model.summary()
```
In this second code snippet, even though `image_model` and `tabular_model` produce feature vectors with different dimensions, we add *mapping layers* after each of the models to force them into a shared dimension (`target_feature_size`), enabling concatenation. This is most useful when the existing models already generate useful features and we want to avoid changing their output.

**3. Hybrid Approach**
It’s important to note that these techniques are not mutually exclusive. A hybrid strategy might sometimes be optimal. For instance, you could apply some initial preprocessing to your inputs, then map the model outputs to a common space. I've used this several times for sequential data combined with other data forms.

Here’s how a simple hybrid would look, building on the prior code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers

def create_image_preprocessing(input_shape=(64, 64, 3)):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(inputs)
    x = layers.MaxPool2D(2)(x)
    x = layers.Flatten()(x)
    return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)

def create_tabular_preprocessing(input_shape=(10,)):
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
  x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(inputs)
  return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)


# Create input layers
image_input = keras.Input(shape=(64,64,3))
tabular_input = keras.Input(shape=(10,))

# Create the preprocessers
image_preprocessor = create_image_preprocessing()
tabular_preprocessor = create_tabular_preprocessing()

# Pass through preprocessers
processed_image = image_preprocessor(image_input)
processed_tabular = tabular_preprocessor(tabular_input)


# Define the target feature size for mapping
target_feature_size = 512

# Add Dense mapping layers
image_mapped = layers.Dense(target_feature_size, activation='relu')(processed_image)
tabular_mapped = layers.Dense(target_feature_size, activation='relu')(processed_tabular)

# Concatenate the mapped features
concatenated_features = layers.concatenate([image_mapped, tabular_mapped])

# Build the final model
output = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(concatenated_features)
combined_model = keras.Model(inputs=[image_input, tabular_input], outputs=output)
combined_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
combined_model.summary()
```

In the hybrid approach, we use both preprocessing on the input data to reduce the disparity, and final layers to map features to the right dimensionality. This approach works when the preprocessing on raw data is needed but the models don't quite have the proper dimensionality for direct concatenation.

**Key Considerations and further reading**

When choosing these approaches, consider:

* **Semantic preservation:** Does resizing or reshaping distort valuable information in your features?
* **Computational cost:** Additional layers add parameters and computational overhead.
* **Model complexity:** Simpler is usually better, so avoid unnecessary complexity.
* **Data specifics**: Consider if the chosen preprocessing or transformation is appropriate for your specific data types.

For deeper dives, I’d recommend looking at the following:

*   **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This textbook offers an excellent theoretical background to deep learning, including concatenation and feature engineering. It will give you the necessary foundation to understand what’s happening under the hood.
*   **Keras documentation:** The official Keras documentation has extensive guides on model building, layer definitions, and concatenation, and is always up-to-date.
*   **Papers on multi-modal learning:** There are numerous academic papers on multi-modal learning, which specifically address fusing data with differing input shapes. Search databases like IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, or Google Scholar.

In summary, concatenating Keras models with differing input shapes involves some creative reshaping of either the input data or the outputs of intermediate layers. Choose the method that best preserves your data's underlying signal and fits your computational resources. I find this to be the most efficient and effective way to handle these kinds of scenarios, and in practice, its proven very useful across many projects.
