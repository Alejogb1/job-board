Okay, let's dive into this. I remember dealing with a similar issue a while back when integrating Chainlink Keepers into a particularly complex smart contract system. The `execution reverted` error you're seeing with `UpkeepIDConsumerExample.registerAndPredictID` is, unfortunately, a fairly common pitfall, and it typically boils down to a few core issues within the Keeper registration process or the contract interaction itself. It's less likely to be a fundamental flaw in Chainlink and more a matter of configuration and contract logic alignment.

The core of the problem generally lies within how you’re interacting with the `KeeperRegistry` contract and how your target contract, `UpkeepIDConsumerExample` in this case, is configured to handle keeper registration. The error `execution reverted` means that somewhere along the line, a transaction attempted to execute an operation that failed based on pre-defined criteria or logic within the smart contract. Let's break down potential causes and solutions.

First, let’s focus on the **registration process** itself. The `registerAndPredictID` function, as its name implies, attempts to both register an upkeep and pre-compute the `upkeepId` for that registration. This makes it more efficient because you don’t need to make a separate call to the registry to retrieve the ID after the registration transaction confirms. However, this efficiency comes with the condition that everything in the registration request is valid. A common oversight here is related to the **gas limit** being set during registration. Keepers perform a certain level of off-chain computation, and this needs to be accounted for in the gas limit provided during registration. A too-small gas limit will cause the transaction to revert. Another common issue is ensuring that your specified `admin` address has the appropriate permission on the registry to register new upkeeps.

Second, consider the **parameters of the registration**. Specifically, look closely at the `checkData` and `performData`. These byte arrays need to be properly formatted and consistent with what your `checkUpkeep` and `performUpkeep` functions in the target contract expect. This is crucial. Incorrect or mismatched data will trigger the `checkUpkeep` function to revert, which will cause the entire `registerAndPredictID` to fail, as the check operation needs to be successful for the registration to go through.

Third, let's examine your **`UpkeepIDConsumerExample` contract** itself. I've seen many issues arise from improperly defined or unimplemented `checkUpkeep` and `performUpkeep` functions, or due to the incorrect return values from these functions. For example, your `checkUpkeep` function *must* return a boolean value indicating whether the upkeep should be performed and, optionally, additional data to be passed to `performUpkeep`. If you are not returning a boolean, you'll get a revert. The data must be encoded correctly. Often a `abi.encode` or some variation is used to encode complex values for return. Let's check some examples to make this clearer.

Here’s a simplified code example that shows a typical scenario:

```solidity
// Example 1: Incorrect checkUpkeep function.
contract SimpleUpkeepConsumer {
  uint256 public counter;
  function checkUpkeep(bytes memory) public view returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory) {
    // Incorrect - returning an empty bytes without data
     return (true, "");
   }

  function performUpkeep(bytes memory) public {
   counter++;
  }
}
```
In this example, while the `checkUpkeep` returns `true`, it returns empty bytes when the perform function might have expected some data or did not encode data properly. The `registerAndPredictID` transaction would likely revert. To fix this you might have to use `abi.encode()` function before returning the `bytes`.
Here’s another example:

```solidity
// Example 2: Fixed checkUpkeep function
contract CorrectUpkeepConsumer {
  uint256 public counter;

  function checkUpkeep(bytes memory) public view returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData) {
      if (block.timestamp % 60 == 0) {
           return (true, abi.encode(counter)); // Proper encoding of data
      } else {
          return (false, bytes(""));
      }
    }

  function performUpkeep(bytes memory performData) public {
      (uint256 newCounter) = abi.decode(performData, (uint256));
      counter = newCounter + 1;
  }
}
```

In this example, I've added a specific logic to check if a minute has passed, if so then upkeep is needed. Also, the counter value is passed to `performUpkeep`. This shows a more complete example of how data should be encoded and decoded in `checkUpkeep` and `performUpkeep`. Finally consider an example where admin access is not correct:

```solidity
// Example 3: Incorrect admin access.
contract UpkeepRegistryMock {
    address public admin;

    constructor(address _admin) {
        admin = _admin;
    }
     function registerAndPredictID(
        address,
        uint32,
        address,
        bytes memory,
        bytes memory,
        uint256,
        uint64,
        address
     ) public view returns (bytes32)
     {
          //this code is just a simulation of an external call to the registry
         if(msg.sender != admin) revert("Not an admin");
         return bytes32(0x123);
     }
}

//in the actual registry contract, this check happens
// and it throws a revert which is picked up
// when interacting with registerAndPredictID.
```

In this example, the registry is simulated for illustration, and it does a check on msg.sender to determine whether it is an admin. During your initial testing and when you encounter the `execution reverted` error, check if the provided admin account for `registerAndPredictID` is the correct admin account within the registry.

For deeper understanding and to debug these sorts of issues, I highly recommend reviewing a few specific resources. First, explore the official Chainlink documentation on Keepers. It's constantly updated, and you will find examples which are highly useful for debugging this issue. Second, read through the OpenZeppelin contract library, focusing specifically on access control and contract interaction patterns. This can help in understanding how permissions and function calls need to be structured. Finally, "Mastering Ethereum" by Andreas M. Antonopoulos is fantastic for a deeper dive into how the EVM works and the underlying mechanisms of contract execution and reverts. These resources will give you the foundational knowledge needed to effectively diagnose and fix these types of errors.

Ultimately, diagnosing a `execution reverted` is often a process of elimination. I always start by double-checking gas limits, access control, function parameters, data encoding and return values. The error is not specific enough, it's true, but by understanding these common pitfalls and using those tools above, you'll be able to pin down the root cause of that revert. It’s all part of the learning curve in smart contract development. Keep at it, and you'll be navigating these sorts of issues with more ease in no time.
