, let's dive into this. It's a classic problem that I've actually encountered several times, usually when trying to transition a model from spreadsheet-based analysis into something more robust like a Python script. The discrepancy between how Excel calculates root mean squared error (rmse) compared to Python isn’t due to fundamental mathematical differences; rather, it stems from how each environment handles data and, crucially, how default settings affect the calculation. I've had to debug some seriously perplexing results because of this seemingly subtle distinction, and believe me, it's rarely what you'd call a straightforward fix.

The core concept of rmse is, of course, straightforward: it's the square root of the mean of the squares of the differences between predicted and actual values. However, it’s in the implementation details where the discrepancies arise. Excel often works with data implicitly as arrays or ranges within a spreadsheet. Python, on the other hand, requires more explicit structuring, often using libraries like NumPy and Pandas. The lack of consistent handling of empty cells or, more often, non-numeric data, is a significant source of variation between the results.

In my experience, Excel often does a form of data “cleaning” on the fly. If a cell has non-numeric data, or if a series has missing values, it may be treated differently than Python's default handling would treat it, or, in particular, by how NumPy handles it, which is often by propagating `NaN` (Not a Number) values. These `NaN` values can significantly influence the average calculation, and in turn, the rmse. Excel may simply ignore such cells, or it might treat them as zeros, depending on context, which differs considerably from a Python environment.

Furthermore, Python's libraries often provide options for error handling (such as propagating `NaN` values), or for specific ways of dealing with edge cases (like the Bessel's correction when calculating standard deviations, which often comes into play). This level of granular control isn't as readily accessible in Excel, which usually relies on simplified assumptions and pre-configured error handling.

Let’s get into some examples to clarify what this looks like in a practical sense.

**Example 1: Basic RMSE Calculation – Consistent Data**

Let's begin with a straightforward scenario where our data is clean and devoid of irregularities. We'll show how both Excel and Python ought to calculate rmse consistently in this case.

In Excel, you would probably create a table with columns for ‘Actual’ and ‘Predicted’ values. Let’s assume these are in columns A and B respectively, starting from row 2. You'd then have another column, typically ‘Squared Error,’ in column C where you'd calculate `(A2-B2)^2` and copy it down. At the bottom, you'd calculate the average of column C, and finally, you'd take the square root of that average to compute the rmse.

Here's how the equivalent of that calculation might look in Python with NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

actual_values = np.array([5, 8, 12, 6, 9])
predicted_values = np.array([5.2, 7.5, 11.8, 6.3, 8.8])

squared_errors = (actual_values - predicted_values)**2
mean_squared_error = np.mean(squared_errors)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error)

print(f"RMSE: {rmse}")
```

This code snippet calculates rmse precisely as it's defined mathematically. When the data is clean, both methods (Excel and this Python code) should produce highly similar, if not identical, results.

**Example 2: Handling Missing Values – Different Interpretations**

The real divergence typically occurs when handling missing or non-numeric values. Imagine a case where, through an oversight, we have a 'NA' (not applicable) value in the actual values.

In Excel, if column A had a cell containing 'NA', a standard `AVERAGE` function applied to a column with squared errors that depend on A may either ignore the row where 'NA' is present, or propagate an error. Depending on the version, the behavior may change, too.

In Python using NumPy, an 'NA' value can be introduced to a NumPy array as `np.nan`. The behaviour of `np.mean()` when encountering `np.nan` is important. By default, it propagates the `NaN` value, making the final rmse calculation `NaN`.

```python
import numpy as np

actual_values = np.array([5, 8, np.nan, 6, 9])
predicted_values = np.array([5.2, 7.5, 11.8, 6.3, 8.8])

squared_errors = (actual_values - predicted_values)**2
mean_squared_error = np.mean(squared_errors)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error)

print(f"RMSE: {rmse}") # This will print 'RMSE: NaN'

# To ignore nan:
mean_squared_error_ignore_nan = np.nanmean(squared_errors)
rmse_ignore_nan = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error_ignore_nan)
print(f"RMSE (ignoring NaNs): {rmse_ignore_nan}")

```

Note that in this case, standard `np.mean()` will produce `NaN`, meaning it doesn’t automatically skip over the non-numeric value, something Excel might implicitly do. Using `np.nanmean()` gives you a more direct comparison with Excel's behavior. In the example, the behaviour that is more closely related to excel's would be `np.nanmean`, as excel would most often skip the row. This is a very important and concrete difference.

**Example 3: Data Type Mismatches – Implicit vs. Explicit**

Finally, consider the scenario of reading data from a file. In excel, you might directly import data and let Excel “figure out” the datatypes on the fly. If a column has a mix of numbers and strings, Excel will make assumptions based on the majority of the data present. It will also often implicitly convert numbers within strings into numerical data when performing calculations.

In Python, this process is more controlled. When reading data from a file, especially from CSV using pandas, data types are typically read as strings unless you explicitly specify their types. For example, a dataframe column with mixed data would, by default, be treated as `object`, or string, type by Pandas. If you attempt to perform math operations on such a column, an error will occur.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Simulate dataframe from a csv where some numbers are stored as strings
data = {'actual': ['5', '8', '12', '6', '9'],
        'predicted': [5.2, 7.5, 11.8, 6.3, 8.8]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# The following will result in TypeError since we're trying math operations with strings
# squared_errors = (df['actual'] - df['predicted'])**2 #This will throw error

# Explicit cast to numeric to make this work
df['actual'] = pd.to_numeric(df['actual'], errors = 'raise') # 'raise' is default, other options exist, such as 'coerce' that would introduce nan
squared_errors = (df['actual'] - df['predicted'])**2
mean_squared_error = np.mean(squared_errors)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error)
print(f"RMSE (after explicit type conversion): {rmse}")
```

Here, the code snippet explicitly converts the 'actual' column in the pandas dataframe to a numeric data type before calculating `squared_errors`. This illustrates a key difference: Excel implicitly makes these kinds of data type conversions, while in Python, we often need to be explicit. This implicit behavior in Excel might lead to different results from Python where such decisions need to be made explicit. In this case, not doing so would raise a type error.

In conclusion, the key to understanding discrepancies in rmse calculations between Excel and Python lies not in differences in the mathematical definition, but rather in subtle differences in data handling and implicit vs explicit conversion rules. While Excel excels at on-the-fly data manipulation for smaller tasks, Python allows for much more controlled and reproducible data handling, particularly when datasets become larger or data preparation steps more complex.

To further understand these issues, I recommend spending time with NumPy's documentation, especially sections concerning `NaN` handling and array operations. The book 'Python for Data Analysis' by Wes McKinney (the creator of pandas) is also an excellent resource for understanding data manipulation in Python, including handling missing data and converting data types correctly. For a deeper dive into the numerical methods behind NumPy, the textbook 'Numerical Recipes' by Press et al. covers fundamental topics in numerical computing, that you might benefit from reading as well. Understanding how each tool handles such cases will help prevent misinterpretations of your data and lead to more reliable results. It's something I’ve learned over several projects, often the hard way, and something that's critical for effective data analysis across platforms.
