Okay, let’s tackle this. I’ve definitely been down this road before, especially with some of the more involved internal tools I’ve worked on, and achieving seamless development console access across different local machines in Rails 6 can be tricky if you're not mindful of the configurations. There isn't one magic bullet, but rather a combination of best practices and deliberate configuration choices. It’s not about opening your system up wildly, but creating a controlled and secure development environment.

The fundamental problem is that by default, the rails development server is bound to `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`). This means only processes *on* that machine can access it. What we need is to allow connections from *other* local machines on the same network. This is primarily a network configuration challenge, not an intrinsic limitation of Rails itself.

Before diving into the how, let me outline a few things I've found crucial. First, think security. We’re opening up access, even if it’s within a "local" network. Using HTTPS, even in a development environment, is a good practice—you could use self-signed certificates for this purpose (more on that later). Secondly, consider authentication—how will we control who can access this console? Often a simple approach of an IP whitelist suffices for a controlled development team. We don't want just any device being able to open this console. Finally, remember that changes to your rails application should be version-controlled, especially when modifying configurations in environments that may require special considerations like this one.

Now, let's talk about the practical side. The first and probably the simplest method is to adjust the binding address. The rails server uses `webrick` or `puma` by default (though I recommend migrating to `puma` if you're not already), and these have configurations to control the binding address.

**Method 1: Modifying the Binding Address**

For `puma`, the configuration change can be accomplished in the `config/puma.rb` file. If you don't have one already, create it. This method doesn't require any changes to the `rails server` command.

```ruby
# config/puma.rb

# Get the default binding port from rails.
port = ENV.fetch("PORT") { 3000 }
bind "tcp://0.0.0.0:#{port}" # listen on all interfaces

workers Integer(ENV.fetch("WEB_CONCURRENCY") { 2 }) # optional

threads_count = Integer(ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 })
threads threads_count, threads_count

preload_app!

rackup      DefaultRackup
pidfile     ENV.fetch("PIDFILE") { "tmp/pids/server.pid" }
state_path  ENV.fetch("STATE_PATH") { "tmp/pids/server.state" }
activate_control_app ENV.fetch("ACTIVATE_CONTROL_APP") { "false" } == "true"

on_worker_boot do
  require "active_record"
  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
end

plugin :tmp_restart
```

In the `puma.rb` example above, the crucial line is `bind "tcp://0.0.0.0:#{port}"`.  By using `0.0.0.0`, you’re telling puma to bind to all available network interfaces. This allows any machine on the same network to reach the server, given they know your machine’s IP. Then, in your shell just do `rails server`.

This is typically enough for most basic setups where the machine is on a local network, and the firewall on the server isn't blocking the connection. Always verify that your firewall is configured to allow traffic on the port your Rails app uses (usually 3000). You may also need to ensure that your network does not isolate machines from each other at the router level.

**Method 2: Leveraging Command Line Options**

Another approach, which I've used more frequently in ad-hoc test environments, is to directly specify the binding address when starting the Rails server through the command line. This bypasses configuration files but can be helpful for quick testing or environments where you don’t want to modify configurations.

```bash
rails server -b 0.0.0.0
```

This command line option achieves the same effect as modifying the `puma.rb` file. It directly instructs the server to bind to all interfaces. After this command is executed, your Rails server should be accessible from other machines on the same network, provided there's network connectivity and firewall allows the access.

**Method 3: Adding Simple Authentication**

Since we're now dealing with more open access, we should implement basic authentication, this is a simple example of how that might work at the Rack level, directly in your rails app. This is not a replacement for robust production authentication but a pragmatic approach for development.

Create an initializer `config/initializers/console_auth.rb` with this:

```ruby
# config/initializers/console_auth.rb
Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before(Rack::Head,  lambda do |env|
   if env['REQUEST_PATH'] == '/rails/console'
     ip_whitelist = ['192.168.1.0/24', '10.0.0.0/24', '172.16.0.0/12', '::1']
     remote_ip = env['REMOTE_ADDR']
     allowed = ip_whitelist.any? do |allowed_ip|
        IPAddr.new(allowed_ip).include?(IPAddr.new(remote_ip))
     end
     if !allowed
       [403, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, ['Access Denied']]
     else
        [200, {}, []]
     end
    else
      [200, {}, []]
   end
end)
```

And to make sure the required gem is there, in `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'ipaddr'
```

and then `bundle install`.

The initializer intercepts requests to `/rails/console` and checks if the request comes from a permitted IP address range. If it doesn't, it returns a 403 Forbidden error. The `ipaddr` gem used here is invaluable for working with ip addresses and ranges. Remember to tailor the whitelist to your local network. This is again, not a bulletproof solution, but a sufficient quick check in a developer environment.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **HTTPS:** While we're aiming for simple access, you should ideally use HTTPS even in a development setting. You can generate a self-signed certificate and configure puma to use it. Refer to puma’s documentation (and openssl documentation) for specific instructions.
*   **Firewall:** Ensure your firewall isn't blocking connections. It’s a common culprit that causes connections to mysteriously fail. Configure the firewall to accept traffic on the specified port.
*   **IP Ranges:** The authentication approach above uses IP address ranges (CIDR notation) for controlling access. Make sure you understand CIDR and use appropriate ranges for your network. Also consider using a VPN for accessing the server.
*   **Security Best Practices:** Remember, this is about easing access in development. Never expose the console to the public Internet. There are more secure methods of accessing a development console remotely, but they are outside the scope of this particular question.
*   **Documentation:** Thorough documentation of your chosen method and configurations for team members will reduce frustration and potential security misconfigurations.

**Further Reading:**

For a deeper understanding of network configurations, I'd recommend digging into *TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1* by W. Richard Stevens; it’s a cornerstone resource for networking fundamentals. Regarding server configuration, *Programming Ruby* by Dave Thomas et al is a solid resource for understanding the Rails environment and server configurations. Lastly, the official Rails documentation is an essential reference. It covers the basics and more advanced aspects, including networking and configurations. Be sure to pay attention to the documentation for Puma as it directly relates to the examples in this response.

I have seen these approaches work reliably. Remember to version control your configurations, maintain good security hygiene, and don’t hesitate to experiment and refine your setup to meet the specific needs of your development workflow. Let me know if you encounter any more questions as you work through this.
