Okay, let’s tackle this one. I’ve seen this particular hiccup surface more times than I care to count, usually with developers who are relatively new to smart contract development or are perhaps transitioning to a more complex deployment setup. The core of the issue isn't actually a limitation within Remix itself, but rather a misunderstanding of how constructor arguments work during contract creation on the ethereum virtual machine (evm). I’ll detail that in a moment.

My first encounter with this was probably back in 2018, working on a decentralized identity management system. We were trying to deploy a complex factory contract that required an initial admin address and a few other configuration parameters. We were repeatedly scratching our heads why these values weren't being correctly passed through using the 'Deploy' button in Remix, despite explicitly setting them in the input fields. Ultimately, the realization dawned that Remix isn't directly passing constructor arguments in the way one might intuitively think.

The problem stems from how Remix handles constructor parameters during deployment. The Remix user interface presents input fields to represent constructor parameters, making it appear as though it's directly passing these values along with the contract code. However, Remix isn't actually packaging up those input values into a transaction’s `data` field as separate arguments. Instead, it's appending these constructor arguments as part of the bytecode itself, the deployment code. This is vital to understand, as the EVM has a very specific format for deploying contracts, and it expects constructor data to follow a specific encoding within that bytecode. If that encoding is incorrect, either no deployment occurs, or the initial values end up being incorrect.

Let’s dive a little deeper into the mechanics here. When a smart contract is deployed, the transaction contains the compiled bytecode of the contract, along with any associated initialization code (the constructor). This bytecode can be visualized as a sequence of EVM opcodes. The EVM, when seeing a contract deployment, doesn't execute the bytecode directly; it first extracts the init code, which might include the constructor and the values you intended to pass in Remix. This init code is run only once. It typically creates a contract's storage layout. The rest of the bytecode, the runtime bytecode, is then stored at the created contract address and subsequently executes during normal function calls.

Therefore, the values you are attempting to pass through in Remix need to be encoded *into* the contract's init code. Specifically, constructor arguments are appended to the end of the contract bytecode in a process called abi encoding. Remix handles the encoding of those provided parameters in the input fields, taking them from the UI and embedding them at the end of the deployment code. However, if those are not being supplied or properly encoded into the bytecode (which is often the result of code issues or misunderstanding how encoding works), then constructor arguments won’t be passed correctly.

To illustrate this, let's look at three simple solidity code examples:

**Example 1: A Simple Constructor**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleConstructor {
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _owner) {
        owner = _owner;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SimpleConstructor` takes an address as a constructor parameter and stores it in the `owner` state variable. To pass the address through Remix, we input it in the constructor parameters in the deploy section. Remix compiles the contract, encodes the address into the deployment bytecode, then dispatches the deployment transaction with that bytecode. If you enter a bad address (e.g., an incorrectly formatted string), the contract deployment will most likely fail, or create an address at 0x0, due to the incorrect encoding.

**Example 2: Multiple Constructor Parameters**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MultiParam {
    uint256 public initialValue;
    address public creator;
    string public name;

    constructor(uint256 _initialValue, address _creator, string memory _name) {
        initialValue = _initialValue;
        creator = _creator;
        name = _name;
    }
}
```

This contract demonstrates how to handle multiple constructor parameters. Here, we have a `uint256`, an `address`, and a `string`. Again, Remix encodes these in the order of appearance in the constructor declaration, using the abi encoding rules. If you enter a string in the uint256 field, the constructor will not decode correctly, as the input parameters will be misaligned due to incorrect data type. For this, knowing the abi encoding format of different types, such as integers, addresses and strings, becomes a critical factor.

**Example 3: Constructor Parameters with Arrays**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ArrayParam {
    uint256[] public values;

    constructor(uint256[] memory _values) {
        values = _values;
    }
}
```

This contract takes an array of `uint256` as a constructor parameter. Here, abi encoding gets slightly more complex due to the variable length nature of the array. Remix has to encode both the length of the array and each element within it. A common issue arises when entering the array in Remix. The input must be a valid json format array, i.e. `[1,2,3]`. If it is not formatted correctly (eg, entering '1,2,3' or '[1, 2, 3]’ ), the contract would not be deployed correctly or the array would be empty.

So, to summarize why it seems values aren't passing correctly: It's typically not a bug within Remix itself, but rather a combination of two factors. First, you might have incorrect input parameter values in Remix that do not conform to the data types expected in the smart contract constructor. This leads to encoding errors during deployment. Second, understanding that Remix isn't passing parameters as *arguments*, but rather as an encoded part of the deployment bytecode is vital. The data must be correctly encoded into the deployment code, using the abi encoding mechanism.

For further in-depth understanding, I would suggest referring to the official Solidity documentation, which includes detailed sections on abi encoding. Additionally, the book “Mastering Ethereum” by Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood contains excellent chapters that provide a fundamental understanding of evm internals and abi encoding. Furthermore, various online resources, such as the ethereum stack exchange and blogs focused on smart contract development, offer valuable insights and real-world examples for how constructor parameter passing occurs. Having a strong grasp of this process will reduce the likelihood of encountering similar issues in the future and will enhance overall effectiveness in smart contract development.
