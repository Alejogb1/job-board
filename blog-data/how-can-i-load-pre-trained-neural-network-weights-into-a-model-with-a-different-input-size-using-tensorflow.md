Let's tackle this; it's a situation I’ve encountered more than a few times in my career, especially when dealing with legacy models or fine-tuning for specific tasks. The challenge of loading pre-trained weights into a neural network with a different input size isn't trivial, but it’s definitely solvable with careful consideration of your model’s architecture and the intended data flow. It usually stems from a discrepancy between the input shapes of the pre-trained model and your new model.

The core issue revolves around how TensorFlow (or any deep learning framework) handles weight initialization and tensor shape compatibility. When you load pre-trained weights, the framework expects the layers to match exactly, including the input dimensions. When the input size differs, the initial layers, particularly dense or convolutional layers, will have mismatched weight matrices. These mismatches can throw errors or, worse, lead to incorrect and unpredictable behavior.

Now, there are a few approaches to manage this, each with its pros and cons. It's rarely a one-size-fits-all situation.

**Option 1: Cropping or Padding the Input**

This is often the simplest approach, where we adapt the input to fit the expected size of the pre-trained model. Imagine we have a pre-trained model expecting images of size 224x224, but our new application needs images of 256x256. We can pad the smaller inputs with zeros to reach 224x224 or crop the bigger inputs to 224x224 before feeding it to the model.

Here's a basic example using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def resize_input(input_tensor, target_size):
    """
    Resizes or pads an input tensor to a target size.

    Args:
        input_tensor: A TensorFlow tensor representing input data.
        target_size: A tuple (height, width) representing the desired size.

    Returns:
        A TensorFlow tensor resized to target_size, or padded.
    """
    input_shape = tf.shape(input_tensor)
    current_height, current_width = input_shape[1], input_shape[2]
    target_height, target_width = target_size

    height_diff = target_height - current_height
    width_diff = target_width - current_width

    if height_diff > 0:
        pad_top = height_diff // 2
        pad_bottom = height_diff - pad_top
    else:
      pad_top = 0
      pad_bottom = 0
    if width_diff > 0:
        pad_left = width_diff // 2
        pad_right = width_diff - pad_left
    else:
      pad_left = 0
      pad_right = 0


    if height_diff < 0 or width_diff < 0:
       return tf.image.resize(input_tensor, target_size)
    else:
        padded_input = tf.pad(input_tensor, [[0, 0], [pad_top, pad_bottom], [pad_left, pad_right], [0, 0]], constant_values=0)
        return padded_input


# Example Usage:
input_size = (256, 256)  # Our new model's input size
pretrained_model_input_size = (224, 224)  # Pretrained model input size
batch_size = 4
channels = 3
example_inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, input_size[0], input_size[1], channels))

resized_input = resize_input(example_inputs, pretrained_model_input_size)

print("Original input shape:", example_inputs.shape)
print("Resized input shape:", resized_input.shape)
```

In this code, the `resize_input` function performs either padding or resizing as necessary. This method is good for maintaining model compatibility, but cropping can lose potentially relevant information, and padding might introduce artifacts and can sometimes affect model performance depending on how important are the edges for the task at hand.

**Option 2: Using a Flexible Input Layer**

Another approach involves designing the initial layers of our model to accommodate different input sizes. Convolutional layers, for example, can often operate with varying input sizes provided their filter sizes and strides are appropriate. We can modify only the first layers to allow for the new input dimensions, without touching the weights of the pre-trained layers that follow. This often requires a more careful design choice for the input layer.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def create_flexible_model(pretrained_model, input_shape):
    """
    Creates a model with a flexible input layer that can accommodate
    different input sizes. The initial convolutional layer is flexible,
    and the remaining pre-trained layers are loaded with their weights.

    Args:
        pretrained_model: A pre-trained TensorFlow Keras model.
        input_shape: A tuple (height, width, channels) representing the input shape.

    Returns:
        A TensorFlow Keras model with a modified input layer.
    """
    input_layer = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
    # A flexible convolutional layer to handle different input shapes
    conv_layer = layers.Conv2D(filters=pretrained_model.layers[0].filters,
                              kernel_size=pretrained_model.layers[0].kernel_size,
                              strides=pretrained_model.layers[0].strides,
                              padding='same',
                              activation='relu')(input_layer)


    # Connect the convolutional layer to the rest of the pre-trained model
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
    model.add(input_layer)
    model.add(conv_layer)
    for layer in pretrained_model.layers[1:]:
         model.add(layer)

    # Transfer weights (excluding input layer)
    # Note: Make sure the pre-trained model’s structure is compatible
    # after the initial layers.
    for i, layer in enumerate(pretrained_model.layers[1:]):
      if len(layer.get_weights()) > 0:
         model.layers[i+2].set_weights(layer.get_weights())


    return model


# Example Usage:
input_size = (256, 256, 3)  # Our new model's input size
# Simulate a pretrained model with an initial conv layer
pretrained_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(10)
])

flexible_model = create_flexible_model(pretrained_model, input_size)

# Ensure model accepts new input
example_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, *input_size))
output = flexible_model(example_input)

print("Output shape:", output.shape)
```

In this approach, we are creating a new model with a flexible first convolutional layer, and copying the remaining layers and the associated weights from the pre-trained model. This strategy works well if the overall structure of the models is relatively similar and the initial layers can accommodate flexible input shapes. It gives you the ability to adapt the input layer while still leveraging the power of the pre-trained layers.

**Option 3: Re-training Input Layers**

Sometimes, the architecture differences are too vast for simple padding or flexible layers. In such scenarios, one must consider freezing the weights of the pre-trained layers and train only a new set of initial layers designed for the new input size. This is a form of transfer learning where you leverage the learned feature space from a pre-existing model, while fine-tuning for your particular data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def retrain_input_layer_model(pretrained_model, input_shape):
    """
    Creates a model with a new input layer for a different input size.
    The weights of the pre-trained layers are frozen and not updated
    during training, while the newly designed input layer is trained.

    Args:
        pretrained_model: A pre-trained TensorFlow Keras model.
        input_shape: A tuple (height, width, channels) representing the new input shape.

    Returns:
         A TensorFlow Keras model with a new input layer.
    """

    input_layer = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
    # New custom layers designed for the specific input shape
    conv1 = layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')(input_layer)
    maxpool1 = layers.MaxPooling2D()(conv1)


    # Freeze the weights of the pre-trained model
    for layer in pretrained_model.layers:
        layer.trainable = False


    # Connect the custom layers to the pre-trained model
    merged = maxpool1
    for layer in pretrained_model.layers:
      merged = layer(merged)

    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=merged)
    return model


# Example Usage:
input_size = (256, 256, 3)  # Our new model's input size
# Simulate a pretrained model with an initial conv layer
pretrained_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(10)
])
retrained_model = retrain_input_layer_model(pretrained_model, input_size)


# Ensure model accepts new input
example_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, *input_size))
output = retrained_model(example_input)

print("Output shape:", output.shape)

```
In this snippet, the initial part of the new model is designed to handle the new input shape, and we make the pre-trained layers non-trainable. Only the custom input layer will be updated during the training process. This ensures the pre-trained knowledge is retained, while the custom initial layers adapt to the new input shape.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further deep dives into the subject, I recommend exploring these resources:

*   **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This is an exceptional resource for understanding the core principles of neural networks, including the architecture and the underlying math behind it. It goes through the fine details of initialization and layer design.

*   **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron:** This book provides practical guidance and code examples for using TensorFlow and Keras effectively, covering model creation, transfer learning, and weight management strategies.

*   **The TensorFlow Official Documentation:** It’s always a good idea to stay up-to-date with TensorFlow's official documentation, particularly the sections on `tf.keras.layers`, `tf.image` and model loading techniques, which are constantly being updated.

*   **Research papers on transfer learning:** Papers from the past few years showcase cutting-edge strategies and methodologies that might offer further insights and guidance, especially if you are working on complex scenarios.

In summary, tackling input size mismatches with pre-trained models requires a blend of clever design and technical understanding. The choice depends heavily on the specific task and constraints, but I've often found that a combination of carefully considered pre-processing (like padding or resizing) along with the approaches described above usually yields a robust and workable solution. Be sure to meticulously check the structure of your models, understand how layers interact, and ensure the weights of the pre-trained layers are correctly loaded or frozen.
