Alright, let's tackle this. I've seen this particular issue rear its head more often than I'd like, usually in scenarios where we're trying to push the boundaries of what standard loss functions can do. It’s almost always a matter of subtle details in the implementation of the custom loss itself, the gradient calculations, or even how it's being integrated into the training loop. Let's break this down based on my experience debugging similar situations, and you'll see that it’s usually a fairly logical process once we identify the usual suspects.

The core issue of a model failing to update its parameters during training despite a custom loss function lies in either the loss function not being differentiable or the backpropagation of the gradient experiencing some kind of breakdown. Remember, the update process hinges on calculating the gradient of the loss with respect to each of the model's parameters and then updating them in the opposite direction of this gradient. If this gradient is zero, near-zero across the entire training set, or `NaN` (Not a Number), the update process essentially grinds to a halt.

**Differentiability Issues**

First up is differentiability. This is critical because the gradient descent algorithms used in training rely on having smooth (differentiable) loss surfaces. If the custom loss function has non-differentiable points (think sharp corners or step functions), the gradient becomes undefined at those points, leading to training instabilities. In my past projects, I've often seen this manifested where the loss function incorporates absolute values or some sort of thresholding without any smoothing.

For example, suppose we have a toy loss function aiming to penalize deviations greater than a certain threshold, like this (and *yes*, it's simplified to demonstrate the problem):

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def custom_loss_naive(y_true, y_pred, threshold=0.5):
    diff = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
    loss = tf.where(diff > threshold, diff, 0.0)
    return tf.reduce_mean(loss)


# Let's create some dummy data
y_true_data = np.random.rand(100).astype(np.float32)
y_pred_data = np.random.rand(100).astype(np.float32)

y_true = tf.constant(y_true_data)
y_pred = tf.constant(y_pred_data)
print(custom_loss_naive(y_true, y_pred))

```

Here, the `tf.where` operation creates a non-differentiable point at `diff == threshold`.  While it might work for certain very simplistic cases, during gradient descent, it would cause havoc and essentially prevent consistent updates. The gradient would be 0 when `diff < threshold` and 1 when `diff > threshold` - the derivative would have a discontinuity and provide poor gradients.

A better approach involves introducing smoothing. Here's a revised version using a smoothed function to avoid sharp corners:

```python
def custom_loss_smooth(y_true, y_pred, threshold=0.5, smoothing_factor=0.1):
    diff = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
    loss = tf.where(diff > threshold,
                    diff,
                    smoothing_factor * tf.math.log(tf.math.cosh(diff/smoothing_factor))) # Smoothed hinge loss-like behavior
    return tf.reduce_mean(loss)

print(custom_loss_smooth(y_true,y_pred))

```

This smooth variant replaces `tf.where` with a more mathematically gentle variant and improves the behaviour. You'll notice I'm using `tf.math.log(tf.math.cosh(diff/smoothing_factor))` which acts like a softened version of the `relu` function and gives you a nice smooth gradient.

**Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**

Another culprit is the notorious issue of vanishing or exploding gradients. This typically occurs when the chain rule, which underlies backpropagation, multiplies many small gradients together (vanishing) or many large gradients together (exploding).  If your custom loss function calculates a gradient that pushes values to these extremes, the parameter updates can become infinitesimally tiny or numerically unstable, respectively. This is especially true when combining custom loss functions that have complicated derivatives in the calculation.

Consider the following slightly more complex example where we try to combine some simple losses:

```python

def combined_loss_problematic(y_true, y_pred):
    l1_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred))
    l2_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))
    return  (1e-8) * l1_loss + (1e8) * l2_loss  # Problematic scaling


y_true = tf.constant(np.random.rand(100).astype(np.float32))
y_pred = tf.constant(np.random.rand(100).astype(np.float32))

print(combined_loss_problematic(y_true,y_pred))

```

Here, the L1 and L2 losses are being combined, but with significantly scaled weights. The `1e-8` and `1e8` will cause problems during gradient calculation, resulting in either vanishing or exploding gradients, and thus, the model will fail to train. This kind of scaling disparity can easily emerge within a poorly-designed loss calculation, and it will often need adjustment.

**Debugging Strategies & Practical Tips**

When faced with this issue, my debugging strategy involves the following:

1.  **Verify the Gradient Computation:** Ensure that the gradients are being computed correctly using libraries like tensorflow or pytorch autograd. Use the `tf.GradientTape` or the appropriate equivalent in pytorch to check these directly. If you’re not familiar with these concepts, look at resources such as 'Deep Learning' by Ian Goodfellow et al., specifically chapters on backpropagation and optimization. You should be able to check what the model is outputting to compare against the expected gradient. Numerical checks, such as finite difference approximation, can help to ensure gradients are being calculated correctly using methods such as central difference.
2.  **Visualize the Loss Surface:** If possible, plot the loss surface with respect to the model’s parameters. This is simpler when dealing with a small parameter set, but in more complex systems, it will be less effective. You can try reducing the size of the parameter set to enable better visual representations of loss surfaces for more complex scenarios.
3.  **Simplify the Loss:** As a troubleshooting step, try replacing your custom loss with a known working loss (e.g., mean squared error). If the training works with this base loss and doesn't with yours, you know your loss function is the source of the problem. Then, start introducing parts of your loss slowly until you find the offending part.
4.  **Check for NaN Values:** Look out for nan values. Often these occur early in training, due to numerical instabilities. When these are detected the loss often has to be rescaled. This usually indicates you have a vanishing or exploding gradient.
5.  **Use Normalization:** Normalize both your input data *and* scale your loss terms so no individual parts dominate. It will also help to apply the batch normalization operation inside the network. If your loss values are not on the same scale then it will become unbalanced during training, even if the gradients are calculated correctly.

**Conclusion**

In my experience, most cases of custom loss function failures come down to the fine details of differentiability or gradient issues. It's often a painstaking process of carefully examining the math and numerical calculations, but ultimately, by methodically debugging, you can almost always get it working. Remember to approach this like a scientist, methodically and systematically, and you will find your problem. It's rarely a fundamental limitation of the custom loss approach, more often than not just an implementation detail which is not quite working right.
