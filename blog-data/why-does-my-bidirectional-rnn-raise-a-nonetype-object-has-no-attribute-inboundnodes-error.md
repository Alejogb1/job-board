Alright, let's address this "NoneType object has no attribute '_inbound_nodes'" error you're encountering with your bidirectional RNN. It's a surprisingly common pitfall, and I've personally spent more than a few late nights chasing down similar issues, often in the heat of trying to deploy a complex model. I remember particularly struggling with it during a time series forecasting project where we were experimenting with a stacked bidirectional LSTM architecture. The culprit, more often than not, isn't some fundamental flaw in the idea of bidirectional RNNs but rather a subtle misconfiguration or incorrect usage in the way you're assembling your model components.

The error message itself is a key clue. The fact that a `NoneType` object is raising an `_inbound_nodes` attribute error suggests that somewhere in your model definition, a layer (or a related object that behaves like one) hasn’t been properly connected to the computational graph. Typically, this occurs when a layer's output is expected by another layer, but instead of receiving the output tensor, it's getting a `None` object. Let's break down the typical causes and then look at how to avoid them.

The most frequent reason, in my experience, is improper handling of the return values when creating your bidirectional layer in frameworks like TensorFlow's Keras. Consider this scenario where you might be using a separate forward and backward RNN layer combined using `concatenate`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Bidirectional, Input, concatenate
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def build_bad_bidirectional_model():
    inputs = Input(shape=(None, 10)) #example shape
    forward_lstm = LSTM(64)
    backward_lstm = LSTM(64, go_backwards=True)

    forward_output = forward_lstm(inputs)
    backward_output = backward_lstm(inputs)

    # this concatenation can cause an error if it does not handle the output of the lstm layer correctly.
    merged_output = concatenate([forward_output, backward_output])

    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=merged_output)
    return model
```

In the above example, if we try to use this model as part of a bigger network, we will likely see this error. Why? Because both the `forward_lstm` and the `backward_lstm` are layers, and when used directly within a functional API, they need their specific tensor output to be propagated throughout the network. The return of the forward_lstm and backward_lstm are single dimensional tensors. We intend that they are passed as input to the concatenate layer, however, in certain cases, these may not be correctly routed in the underlying graph, potentially resulting in a `None` object.

Now, let’s look at a correct implementation of a bidirectional LSTM using the built in `Bidirectional` wrapper class. This is the most common way of structuring a bidirectional layer and eliminates the issues shown above.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Bidirectional, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def build_good_bidirectional_model():
    inputs = Input(shape=(None, 10)) #example shape
    bidirectional_lstm = Bidirectional(LSTM(64))(inputs)  # corrected use of bidirectional wrapper
    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=bidirectional_lstm)
    return model
```

Here, the `Bidirectional` wrapper handles all of the internal routing, so that the `inputs` tensors are properly split and processed into both directions of the LSTM layer, and their outputs are then properly combined before being returned. This greatly simplifies your model building procedure, and reduces the chances of this error occurring. It ensures that the output of the bidirectional layer itself isn't `None`.

Another place where I've seen this is when dealing with complex functional API models in Keras. If you're not careful about naming outputs and passing intermediate layers correctly, you can end up inadvertently passing `None` where a tensor is expected. This usually surfaces when trying to create a custom layer or when attempting to share layers across multiple input paths. Let's illustrate that with a hypothetical example, although the error itself might be less obvious:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def build_problematic_custom_model():
    input_a = Input(shape=(None, 10), name='input_a')
    input_b = Input(shape=(None, 10), name='input_b')
    lstm_layer = LSTM(64)

    # Incorrectly trying to apply a layer to two different inputs simultaneously
    #This is also a common mistake - you may try to create multiple outputs from one layer.
    # It's important to understand that this won't work if you need to return all of the results.
    lstm_output_a = lstm_layer(input_a) #output from lstm_layer using input_a
    lstm_output_b = lstm_layer(input_b) # output from lstm_layer using input_b. This second operation effectively overwrites the layer's output.


    dense_layer = Dense(32, activation='relu')
    dense_output_a = dense_layer(lstm_output_a) #this will work as expected because it's immediately after the correct definition.
    dense_output_b = dense_layer(lstm_output_b) #this is where we get an issue if we try to access another input using the same layer.

    #the output of dense_output_b will overwrite whatever is in the dense layer, and will not be correct.

    merged_output = tf.concat([dense_output_a, dense_output_b], axis=-1)
    model = Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=merged_output)
    return model
```
In the example above, the lstm layer is used twice, and because tensorflow's layers are objects, they can't be shared this way. We overwrite the output of the lstm layer and the dense layer when it is used on input_b. This causes incorrect tensors to be passed through the model's graph, which can result in the `NoneType` error when you try to operate on it or call methods that expect an output from the layer.

So, what are the key takeaways? Firstly, double-check that you’re using the `Bidirectional` layer correctly, especially if using functional API or custom layers. Make sure you're not trying to use the same layer object on multiple input paths incorrectly. Ensure that the layers are connected in a clear sequence, so that each operation's output is passed correctly to the next operation. This is crucial for frameworks like Keras, where the functional API relies on these connections to build the computational graph.

Finally, it's vital to understand what each layer is returning and ensure that the layers downstream can interpret the results correctly. If you still have issues, I'd suggest the following: print out the shapes of tensors between layers and print the output of your layers. I recommend tracing the flow of your tensor variables to identify the point at which the value unexpectedly becomes none. It is also very helpful to use the .summary() method when constructing models, as this gives you an overview of the layers, inputs and outputs, which helps identify potential mismatches.

For further reading, I would recommend delving into the Keras documentation on the functional API, specifically focusing on how layers are used and connected. Also, the book "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet is extremely helpful for understanding both the functional api as well as debugging model building issues. If you are using Tensorflow, the Tensorflow documentation provides a wealth of information on layer implementation and the correct way to build models with both the Sequential API and Functional API methods. Furthermore, the classic book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop, while not specific to deep learning frameworks, offers foundational knowledge of the mathematical principles that these models are built upon, which can greatly assist in diagnosing problems like this. Remember, careful planning and methodical implementation is the key to avoiding this frustrating error.
