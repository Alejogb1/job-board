Okay, let's tackle this. It's not an uncommon requirement, and I've certainly found myself in a similar position before—specifically, while building a data processing pipeline that required meticulous verification at each stage. In that project, I needed to validate transformed CSV data, line by line, against expected values after different transformations. This meant my tests had to be able to read input files as streams and process each row. Here’s how to achieve this with Mocha and Chai, leveraging Node.js's file system capabilities.

The core challenge here is asynchronous behavior. Node's file operations are inherently asynchronous, and so our tests need to manage this while ensuring that Mocha's test runner doesn't prematurely conclude before the file is fully processed. We'll use Node's `readline` module, which is ideal for reading files line by line without loading the entire file into memory at once—crucial for larger files.

Before diving into the code, let's clarify the workflow. We’ll use `fs.createReadStream` to initiate a readable stream from the file, pipe it to `readline.createInterface`, and then process each line within the `line` event listener. Importantly, we’ll use a Promise to encapsulate the asynchronous operation, allowing our Mocha test to properly await the completion of the reading process, and allowing chai assertions for each line within the processing loop. Let’s outline what I have seen and tested with a few examples.

**Example 1: Basic Line-by-Line Assertion**

Suppose we have a data file named `test_data.txt` containing simple numerical data:

```
1
2
3
4
```

Here's how our Mocha/Chai test might look:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readline = require('readline');
const { expect } = require('chai');

describe('Line-by-Line Data Processing Test', () => {
  it('should read and validate each line', async () => {
    const expectedValues = ['1', '2', '3', '4']; // Strings for strict comparison
    let lineIndex = 0;

    const processLineByLine = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const readStream = fs.createReadStream('test_data.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' });
      const rl = readline.createInterface({ input: readStream, crlfDelay: Infinity });

      rl.on('line', (line) => {
        expect(line).to.equal(expectedValues[lineIndex], `Line ${lineIndex + 1} failed to match`);
        lineIndex++;
      });

      rl.on('close', () => {
        expect(lineIndex).to.equal(expectedValues.length, 'Not all lines were processed');
        resolve();
      });

      rl.on('error', (err) => {
          reject(err);
      });
    });

    await processLineByLine();
  });
});
```

In this first example, we are creating a basic setup to ensure each line of our simple text file matches the expected value. Note that the comparison here is strict `equal` using Chai, meaning strings are compared against string values, which is a common gotcha. The use of a Promise ensures the test runner correctly understands when asynchronous processes are complete. Error handling is also included.

**Example 2: Line Processing and Type Conversion**

Now, let's consider a scenario where we need to perform some processing on each line. Perhaps we have comma-separated data that we want to convert into numbers, then perform a range check on them:

Imagine a file called `data.csv` containing:

```
10,20
30,40
50,60
```

Here's an example using Mocha and Chai with processing:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readline = require('readline');
const { expect } = require('chai');

describe('Line-by-Line Processing with Type Conversion', () => {
  it('should read, process, and validate each line of CSV', async () => {
    const processLineByLine = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const readStream = fs.createReadStream('data.csv', { encoding: 'utf8' });
      const rl = readline.createInterface({ input: readStream, crlfDelay: Infinity });
      let lineCount = 0;
        
      rl.on('line', (line) => {
        const values = line.split(',').map(Number);
        expect(values).to.have.lengthOf(2, `Line ${lineCount + 1}: Expected two values`);
        expect(values[0]).to.be.a('number', `Line ${lineCount + 1}: First value is not a number`);
        expect(values[1]).to.be.a('number', `Line ${lineCount + 1}: Second value is not a number`);
        expect(values[0]).to.be.within(0, 100, `Line ${lineCount + 1}: First value out of range`);
        expect(values[1]).to.be.within(0, 100, `Line ${lineCount + 1}: Second value out of range`);
        lineCount++;
      });

      rl.on('close', () => {
        expect(lineCount).to.be.greaterThan(0, 'No lines processed');
        resolve();
      });

      rl.on('error', (err) => {
          reject(err);
      });
    });
    await processLineByLine();
  });
});
```

This example demonstrates a common data processing pattern. We split the CSV string on commas and then cast the results to numbers. We can then make further assertions. The `within` assertion from Chai allows easy range checking, making it simple to validate data. Again, we're using a Promise to manage asynchronicity.

**Example 3: Asynchronous Processing within Each Line**

Finally, let's consider a more advanced example where the processing of each line itself involves an asynchronous operation. Perhaps you might need to call an API for each line or perform a database lookup, for instance. In this made-up example, let’s imagine a fictional asynchronous function `processLineAsync` that mocks an API request. Note how we can handle this within the `on('line')` event handler.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readline = require('readline');
const { expect } = require('chai');

// A fictional async function to simulate async operation on each line
async function processLineAsync(line, lineNumber) {
    // Simulate an asynchronous call
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
    const value = parseInt(line, 10);
    return value + 1; // some simple operation
}


describe('Async Line-by-Line Processing', () => {
    it('should process each line asynchronously', async () => {
        const expectedValues = [2, 3, 4, 5];
        let lineIndex = 0;

        const processLineByLine = () => new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
            const readStream = fs.createReadStream('test_data.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' });
            const rl = readline.createInterface({ input: readStream, crlfDelay: Infinity });


            rl.on('line', async (line) => {
                const result = await processLineAsync(line, lineIndex + 1);
                expect(result).to.equal(expectedValues[lineIndex], `Line ${lineIndex + 1} processed value mismatch`);
                lineIndex++;
            });

            rl.on('close', () => {
                expect(lineIndex).to.equal(expectedValues.length, 'Not all lines were processed');
                resolve();
            });

            rl.on('error', (err) => {
                reject(err);
            });
        });
        await processLineByLine();
    });
});
```

In this example, the `processLineAsync` function simulates an async process within each line. Notice the use of `async/await` within the `line` event listener. It’s crucial to use this properly since we're effectively creating a series of asynchronous tasks. It’s imperative that we await the resolution of each of these async operations within the callback before moving to the next line.

**Recommendations for Further Learning**

For a deeper dive into these concepts, I would recommend exploring these authoritative resources:

1. **"Node.js Design Patterns" by Mario Casciaro and Luciano Mammino:** This book offers a thorough exploration of Node.js asynchronous programming, stream handling, and other core concepts. It will solidify your understanding of the underlying mechanisms at work in these examples.
2. **"Effective JavaScript: 68 Specific Ways to Harness the Power of JavaScript" by David Herman:** Although not specific to Node, this book provides a fundamental understanding of JavaScript’s asynchronous mechanisms. The chapter on promises will be particularly useful.
3. **The official Node.js documentation:** Specifically, sections on the `fs` module (including streams) and the `readline` module. They are the definitive source for understanding these core Node.js libraries.

In closing, reading and processing data line-by-line with Mocha and Chai is quite straightforward when you use Node's native libraries and Promises to manage the inherent asynchrony. Remember to always handle asynchronous behavior correctly to prevent unexpected behavior in tests and be explicit with file encodings (like `utf8`). These patterns have served me well across numerous projects, and I hope they will help you as well.
