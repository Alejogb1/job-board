Alright,  From my own experience, specifically during a project a few years back involving anomaly detection in medical imaging, I came across the very question of whether Grad-CAM attributions can, and should, exceed 1. It's a valid concern, and the answer is nuanced, so let's unpack it.

Grad-CAM, or Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, is a technique to visualize which parts of an input image are most important for a convolutional neural network’s decision-making process. The crux of it lies in computing the gradient of the target class’s score with respect to the feature maps of the last convolutional layer, and then using these gradients to weight the activation maps. The result is a heatmap which, in theory, indicates areas of high influence. However, that heatmap can, and often does, have values outside the [0, 1] range, and here's why that isn't necessarily a problem.

First, let’s get clear about what those attributions actually *are*. They're not probabilities. They are *weighted* gradient values, and gradients themselves aren't constrained to any particular range. These gradients are aggregated and typically normalized to have positive and negative contributions, hence exceeding 1 or going below 0 isn't illogical. The absolute value of the attribution tells us the intensity, and the sign indicates if it's a positive or negative factor that contributes toward the classification.

When thinking about values exceeding 1, think of them as amplified influences. They mean that certain areas in the input contributed disproportionately strongly towards the model's decision. If a single area in the feature map had a very high gradient influence, and the weighted sum is dominated by it, this value can be much larger than 1. There's no hard theoretical limit dictating a maximum of 1 for these values. For instance, let's say the network is highly sensitive to a specific pixel pattern in the image. The gradients corresponding to this pattern would likely be substantial, yielding a high attribution value.

However, you need to also consider that high values don't necessarily indicate high quality explanations. It's still crucial to inspect the generated heatmaps. A well-performing network might have very high activation values for critical features, but an ill-trained model could exhibit large values arbitrarily and for irrelevant areas. In my experience, a good sanity check is visualizing heatmaps side-by-side with the original images. Does the heatmap highlight the areas that a human would expect? Does the intensity of the attribution align with your intuition?

Now, let's look at a few examples to see this practically. I'll use python with pytorch, as that's my most familiar environment.

**Example 1: Basic Grad-CAM Implementation**

Here’s a straightforward implementation showing the calculation of attributions. Note that I'm assuming you already have a trained convolutional network. We're focusing on the Grad-CAM calculation here.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import numpy as np
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image
from torchvision.models import resnet18
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def grad_cam(model, input_image, target_class, layer_name):
    model.eval()
    input_image = transforms.ToTensor()(input_image).unsqueeze(0)

    #register hooks to save gradients
    feature_maps = []
    grads = []
    def save_activation(module, input, output):
      feature_maps.append(output)
    def save_grad(module, grad_in, grad_out):
      grads.append(grad_out[0])
    
    target_layer = None
    for name, module in model.named_modules():
        if name == layer_name:
            target_layer = module
            break
    if target_layer is None:
        raise ValueError(f"Layer {layer_name} not found in model")

    hook1 = target_layer.register_forward_hook(save_activation)
    hook2 = target_layer.register_backward_hook(save_grad)

    output = model(input_image)
    output[0,target_class].backward()

    hook1.remove()
    hook2.remove()

    pooled_grads = torch.mean(grads[0], axis=(2, 3))
    feature_maps = feature_maps[0]
    for i in range(feature_maps.shape[1]):
        feature_maps[:,i] *= pooled_grads[i]
    heatmap = torch.mean(feature_maps,axis=1).squeeze().detach().numpy()
    
    #Optional rescaling to 0-1 for visualization
    #heatmap = (heatmap - np.min(heatmap)) / (np.max(heatmap) - np.min(heatmap))
    return heatmap

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load a pre-trained model
    model = resnet18(pretrained=True)
    model.eval()
    # Load an image (replace path with the path to your image)
    image = Image.open("cat.jpg")
    
    #Example usage
    heatmap = grad_cam(model,image, target_class=281, layer_name='layer4')
    
    #Visualize heatmap
    plt.imshow(heatmap, cmap='jet')
    plt.show()
    print(f"Min heatmap value: {heatmap.min():.2f} Max heatmap value: {heatmap.max():.2f}")
```

This script is the core of Grad-CAM using ResNet18. Notice, the heatmap returned is not constrained. Running this on an image of a cat will likely yield min/max values that are not within 0 and 1.

**Example 2: Exploring High Grad-CAM values**

Let’s create a hypothetical scenario where we see high values by manipulating the gradients directly. We won't be doing backpropagation here. Instead, we'll construct an activation map and assign strong gradient values.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_high_attribution_heatmap(size, max_value = 5):
    heatmap = np.zeros(size)
    # Simulate high influence in a specific region
    center_x, center_y = size[0] // 2, size[1] // 2
    radius = size[0] // 4
    for x in range(size[0]):
        for y in range(size[1]):
            dist = np.sqrt((x - center_x)**2 + (y- center_y)**2)
            if dist < radius:
               heatmap[x,y]= max_value
    
    return heatmap

if __name__ =="__main__":
    heatmap = generate_high_attribution_heatmap((64,64), max_value = 5)
    plt.imshow(heatmap, cmap='jet')
    plt.title("Heatmap with Values Exceeding 1")
    plt.show()
    print(f"Min: {heatmap.min():.2f} Max: {heatmap.max():.2f}")
```

This script artificially creates a heatmap with values that reach 5, clearly demonstrating that the underlying technique doesn’t enforce values within [0, 1].

**Example 3: Normalization Impact**

It’s not uncommon to re-scale or normalize the Grad-CAM values for visualization or comparison purposes. I'll show here how this is typically done, it is not an inherent part of Grad-CAM.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def normalize_heatmap(heatmap):
    min_val = np.min(heatmap)
    max_val = np.max(heatmap)
    if max_val == min_val:
        return np.zeros_like(heatmap)
    
    normalized_heatmap = (heatmap - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
    return normalized_heatmap

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Generating a sample heatmap
    heatmap = np.array([[-0.5, 0.2, 1.5],
                       [0.8, 2.0, 0.1],
                       [-1.0, 0.5, 3.0]])
    
    norm_heatmap = normalize_heatmap(heatmap)
    
    plt.subplot(1,2,1)
    plt.imshow(heatmap,cmap='jet')
    plt.title("Original Heatmap")
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.subplot(1,2,2)
    plt.imshow(norm_heatmap, cmap='jet')
    plt.title("Normalized Heatmap")
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()
    
    print(f"Original Max Value: {np.max(heatmap):.2f}")
    print(f"Normalized Max Value: {np.max(norm_heatmap):.2f}")
```
As you can see from this example, the values are scaled down, to the range from 0 to 1 for easier visualization. However, that doesn't change the fact the original Grad-CAM output may have values greater than 1.

In summary, the fact that Grad-CAM attributions exceed 1 isn't a cause for alarm. It's an artifact of the underlying gradient-based approach. In practice, rather than enforcing a [0, 1] range, I would focus on the *relative* strength of the attributions to determine what aspects of the input the model deemed important. Normalization and rescaling are often employed to facilitate visual analysis.

For further reading, I recommend delving into papers like the original Grad-CAM paper, "Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization" (Selvaraju et al., 2017). A thorough understanding of convolutional neural networks and their gradients is also helpful; for this, consider "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. Additionally, research into techniques beyond Grad-CAM like Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017) and LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) could give you more perspectives.
