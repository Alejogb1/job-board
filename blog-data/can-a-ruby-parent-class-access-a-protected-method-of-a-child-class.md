Let's tackle this one. The nuances of protected methods in object-oriented programming, especially in Ruby's context, are something I've certainly navigated more than once over the years. I recall one particular project—a complex data pipeline built using a custom framework—where we heavily relied on inheritance and method visibility. A misunderstanding of how protected methods behave almost led to some significant debugging headaches. Specifically, we were trying to access a 'validation' method in a child class from its parent, thinking it would behave as if it were public within the hierarchy, which, of course, wasn’t the case.

The direct answer to your question is no, a Ruby parent class cannot directly access a *protected* method of a child class using the dot notation or explicit method call syntax, but it *can* access that protected method if the parent and the child instance of the method is invoked from within a method of another instance of the same class or a subclass. This restriction stems from the core purpose of protected methods: to allow access within a class and its descendants *when called from within an instance of a class in the same hierarchy*, but not through a direct access mechanism from another class.

Consider the fundamental access modifiers in Ruby: *public*, *protected*, and *private*. Public methods can be called from anywhere; private methods are accessible only within the class where they're defined and not even by its subclasses; while protected methods occupy a space in between, designed for controlled access within an inheritance hierarchy. This means the protected method is accessible by an instance of that class or its subclasses when called from within the instance. The key concept here isn't just about inheritance, but the context in which a method call occurs. Protected methods allow us to encapsulate methods in a way to provide access only between members of the class and subclasses, not via direct calls, allowing internal logic to be shared and modified without exposure to the outside world.

To truly understand this, let’s delve into some code snippets.

**Snippet 1: Demonstrating the Limitation**

Here's an example of the direct access attempt that will fail:

```ruby
class Parent
  def initialize
    @data = "Initial Data"
  end

  def access_child_protected(child_instance)
    # Attempting direct access to protected method
    child_instance.protected_method  # This will cause a NoMethodError
  end

  def access_child_protected_via_instance(other_instance)
    other_instance.internal_call
  end
end


class Child < Parent
    def initialize
        super()
        @data = "Child's Initial Data"
    end

  protected
  def protected_method
    puts "Protected method accessed: #{@data}"
  end

  def internal_call
      protected_method
  end
end

parent = Parent.new
child = Child.new

begin
  parent.access_child_protected(child)
rescue NoMethodError => e
    puts "Exception caught: #{e}"
end
parent.access_child_protected_via_instance(child)
```

This code will throw a `NoMethodError`. The `access_child_protected` method in the parent directly tries to call the protected method of the child instance. Ruby enforces the method's protected status and disallows this, as it is not accessed from within an instance of the same class or a subclass. The key point here is that method invocation through the object notation in `child_instance.protected_method` is not allowed. However, `access_child_protected_via_instance` will work, because it delegates the method invocation to the child instance `internal_call` method, which can invoke `protected_method` because they are on the same class instance.

**Snippet 2: Correctly Utilizing Protected Access**

Now, let's look at how protected methods are *intended* to be used within the class hierarchy:

```ruby
class Base
  def internal_use(other_instance)
    other_instance.accessible_method
  end
protected
  def accessible_method
    puts "Accessible within hierarchy."
  end
end

class Subclass < Base
    def instance_call
       accessible_method
    end
end


base = Base.new
sub = Subclass.new

sub.instance_call

begin
  base.internal_use(sub)
rescue NoMethodError => e
  puts "Caught exception: #{e}"
end


```

In this example, `accessible_method` is protected. `Subclass` is able to access it via its `instance_call` method. The line `base.internal_use(sub)` will fail since `base` is not a subclass of `Subclass`, and even if it was, it's not an instance of it. This demonstrates the 'within the hierarchy' aspect of protected access — it's not about direct access across classes, but the method being invoked from an instance of the class or a subclass in which it is declared.

**Snippet 3: Demonstrating access through an instance of a child class.**

This snippet illustrates how a protected method can be invoked on another instance of the same class:

```ruby
class MyClass

    def initialize
        @value = 10
    end
    
    def compare_with(other_instance)
        puts "Comparison result: #{compare(other_instance)}"
    end
    
    protected
    
    def compare(other_instance)
      if(other_instance.instance_variable_get(:@value) > @value)
        return true
      else
        return false
      end
    end
    
end

a = MyClass.new
b = MyClass.new
b.instance_variable_set(:@value, 20)
a.compare_with(b)
```

Here, `compare` is a protected method. Both `a` and `b` are instances of `MyClass`. `compare_with` method in a calls the `compare` method on the `b` instance. This shows how different instances of the same class can access each other's protected method.

**Key Takeaways & Further Reading**

The restriction on a parent class accessing protected methods of a child stems from the fundamental design of these access modifiers. It encourages encapsulation and ensures that class internals are accessed only through defined means and according to class structure.

For a more in-depth understanding, I recommend the following resources:

*   **"Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide" by Dave Thomas, Andy Hunt, and Chad Fowler**: This classic book provides a thorough exploration of Ruby's object-oriented features, including method visibility. It’s a must-read for any serious Ruby developer.
*   **"Eloquent Ruby" by Russ Olsen**: Olsen offers a more philosophical approach, explaining the "why" behind Ruby's design decisions, which can clarify why protected methods work as they do. It helps in moving past the 'how' to the 'why'.
*   The official Ruby documentation, specifically the section on “Visibility”, is incredibly valuable and should always be referred to.

Understanding the nuances of protected methods is essential for writing robust, maintainable Ruby code, particularly when using inheritance extensively. It might seem complex initially, but, with consistent practice and studying, it will become an indispensable aspect of your coding skill set.
