Alright, let's tackle async/await cancellation in Swift. It's a topic that often pops up, and I recall spending a good chunk of time figuring out the nuances back when we were building that real-time collaborative document editor – a project rife with asynchronous operations that needed graceful termination. The standard approach initially didn't feel quite intuitive, but with understanding, it becomes fairly straightforward.

The core concept revolves around `Task`'s built-in cancellation mechanisms. Swift’s concurrency model doesn't directly ‘kill’ an async function mid-execution, but rather, it provides a cooperative model where you, the developer, must explicitly check for cancellation requests within your asynchronous code. This might feel less direct than some other paradigms, but it gives you much finer-grained control over cleanup and resource management.

Essentially, you’re working with `Task.checkCancellation()` which throws a `CancellationError` when cancellation is requested. You must handle that error to break out of the async function's execution flow. The beauty here is you decide when and where to check for cancellation, enabling precise control.

First, let’s look at the basic setup. Imagine we have a function `processData` that performs an intensive operation.

```swift
func processData(id: Int) async throws -> String {
    print("Starting data processing for \(id)")
    for i in 0..<100 {
        try Task.checkCancellation() // Important cancellation check!
        await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 100_000_000) // Simulate work, checking in a loop
        print("Progress for \(id): \(i)%")
    }
    print("Finished data processing for \(id)")
    return "Data processed for \(id)"
}
```

In the above snippet, `Task.checkCancellation()` is the key. If a cancellation has been requested via `task.cancel()`, this call will throw a `CancellationError`, which we'll have to catch in the calling code. This is crucial. Without `try Task.checkCancellation()`, the function will merrily continue executing even if the task has been cancelled. Let's see how we can call and cancel the task.

```swift
func performAndCancelDataProcessing() async {
    let task = Task {
        do {
            let result = try await processData(id: 1)
            print("Result: \(result)")
        } catch is CancellationError {
            print("Data processing was cancelled.")
        } catch {
            print("An error occurred during data processing: \(error)")
        }
    }
    
    // Simulate delay then cancel the task
    await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 500_000_000)
    task.cancel()
}
```

Here, we're launching `processData` within a `Task`, then, after a short delay, we call `task.cancel()`. If `processData` was at a point where a `Task.checkCancellation()` had been executed, the task's execution flow jumps to our `catch is CancellationError`. This behavior provides a clean way to terminate execution, allowing us to handle potential cleanup tasks.

Now, let's enhance the example by introducing some resource management. Consider a scenario where the function fetches a large dataset, and you might want to release the allocated memory upon cancellation.

```swift
class LargeDataset {
    var data: [Int] = Array(repeating: 0, count: 1000000)

    deinit {
        print("LargeDataset deinitialized, memory released")
    }
}

func fetchData(id: Int) async throws -> LargeDataset {
    print("Fetching data for \(id)")
    
    let dataset = LargeDataset()
    for i in 0..<100 {
        try Task.checkCancellation()
        await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 50_000_000) // Simulate work
       print("Fetching \(id) Progress: \(i)%")
    }
   
    print("Data fetched for \(id)")
    return dataset
}
```

And the updated calling function:

```swift
func performAndCancelDataFetch() async {
    var dataset: LargeDataset? = nil

    let task = Task {
        do {
           dataset = try await fetchData(id: 2)
           print("Dataset retrieved")
       } catch is CancellationError {
           print("Data fetch cancelled")
       } catch {
           print("Error encountered: \(error)")
       }
    }
    
    await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 300_000_000)
    task.cancel()
    dataset = nil // Explicitly release the strong reference after cancellation
}
```

In this more complex example, when cancellation occurs we explicitly remove our reference to the dataset using `dataset = nil`. This forces the `LargeDataset` object to be deinitialized and its resources reclaimed. Without this explicit nil assignment, the `deinit` might not get called immediately, leading to delayed deallocation. This is important because while the task is cancelled, Swift doesn't automatically handle all external references; we have to manually help it.

A critical point is that `CancellationError` is not special compared to other errors in the Swift concurrency system. It behaves just like any other thrown error, except that it is thrown from the `Task.checkCancellation()` function. Therefore, you handle cancellation by catching the specific error type `CancellationError` or a more generic error type (`Error`) and then inspecting it to see if it is a cancellation error.

Now, regarding resources for more in-depth understanding: I highly recommend digging into the following resources:

1. **The official Swift documentation on Concurrency**: This is your starting point. Pay special attention to the sections covering `Task`, `Task.checkCancellation()`, and structured concurrency. There’s a wealth of information about all the asynchronous functions and their behavior with cancellation.

2. **"Effective Concurrency in Swift" by Matt Gallagher**: This book provides a very solid understanding of the concepts in the swift concurrency model, and dives into practical strategies of effectively utilizing it including detailed cancellation techniques.

3. **"Concurrency by Tutorials" from raywenderlich.com**: This resource is more practical and offers a collection of examples and projects focused on Swift Concurrency. Their chapters related to cancellation are insightful.

4. **The WWDC session videos on Swift concurrency**: These are excellent and provide a live demonstration of Apple’s concurrency framework, including aspects like cancellation patterns. Focus on the videos from the past few years; the ones on Swift Concurrency have invaluable practical advice.

Implementing cancellation in Swift asynchronous functions isn’t magic, it’s about proactively checking and handling `CancellationError`. It’s a cooperative process where you maintain control. By integrating `Task.checkCancellation()` and understanding how to gracefully handle the `CancellationError`, you can create robust asynchronous code that behaves predictably, especially in complex real-world scenarios. My experience building the document editor taught me these concepts firsthand, and following this path will lead to more reliable and efficient Swift applications.
