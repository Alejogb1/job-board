alright, so you're asking about building a model with multiple branches and how to push data through it element-wise while keeping track of something, like a counter. i've definitely been down this road before, it's a common pattern when dealing with sequence-to-sequence tasks, or anything that requires a bit more intricate processing flow than a standard feedforward net. let me break down how i usually approach this kind of thing, based on my experience.

first, let's talk about the multi-branch part. it’s really just a matter of composing different model modules within your overall structure. instead of one linear flow, you split it at some point, apply different operations, and maybe recombine them later. think of it as a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are operations or models and the edges are data flow.

when i was working on a project involving multi-modal data, say text and images, i had to build something similar. i had one branch for processing the text embeddings using a recurrent network and another to process the image features using a convolutional network. the outputs from both were then concatenated and passed through another network to make the final prediction. this is a classical architecture but it shows the point.

the trick here is to carefully define the input and output shapes at every level, you can use a symbolic library or framework for it. it makes debugging a lot easier down the road. i usually tend to write a quick and dirty diagram of how the data is flowing, including all shapes, or use a framework-specific graph visualization tool to verify. it saves a lot of head-scratching later when things go sideways. here’s some pseudo-code that describes this process:

```python
class MultiBranchModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, text_branch, image_branch, fusion_layer, final_layer):
        super(MultiBranchModel, self).__init__()
        self.text_branch = text_branch
        self.image_branch = image_branch
        self.fusion_layer = fusion_layer
        self.final_layer = final_layer

    def forward(self, text_input, image_input):
        text_output = self.text_branch(text_input)
        image_output = self.image_branch(image_input)
        # we assume these two outputs can be concatenated
        fused_output = self.fusion_layer(torch.cat((text_output, image_output), dim=1))
        final_output = self.final_layer(fused_output)
        return final_output

```

now, about element-wise processing with a token counter. this is where things get a bit more interesting. if i understand correctly, you want to move through your input step-by-step, feed the data into the model, and then update the counter depending on what happens internally at each step.

i've used this many times when working with sequence models. for example, when you have an encoder-decoder architecture, you might need to feed a single token at a time into the decoder, while tracking the token count. this is particularly common in tasks like machine translation or text generation. also in reinforcement learning algorithms this appears a lot.

the core idea here is to loop through the elements and explicitly feed them to the model. within the loop, you can do anything you want with the internal state, including update your counter. the key is to not forget that most deep learning frameworks default to working with batches of data and also tensor operations that are optimized for parallel execution, when we're doing this element-wise operation we lose some of the performance but some tasks require it.

when you are handling text, or anything that is sequential, you might have to handle padding when making the batches for this, using a specific token like `<pad>` or zero-padding.

```python
def elementwise_forward(model, input_sequence):
    batch_size = input_sequence.size(0)  # assuming batch first
    seq_len = input_sequence.size(1)
    counter = torch.zeros(batch_size, dtype=torch.int64) # initialize a counter per batch
    outputs = []
    for step in range(seq_len):
        # grab current timestep data for the whole batch
        input_step = input_sequence[:, step, :]
        output = model(input_step) #assuming our model accepts a single input step
        # increment the counter according to some condition
        # e.g. increment if the probability of a particular class is above a threshold
        if output.argmax(dim=1) == some_class_index:
          counter += 1
        outputs.append(output)
    # stacking the outputs along the sequence dim and returning the counter
    return torch.stack(outputs, dim=1), counter

```

now, let's assume you have a more complex model, maybe an lstm or transformer encoder you’re feeding into another decoder, then you are dealing with a hidden state. in this situation, your elementwise operation needs to take this into account. that is why we need to keep an internal state and pass it to the model at each step, and retrieve it back. a typical situation is to encode some data with a recurrent model and decode it also recurrently, or to generate a sequence. i remember i spent a good amount of time trying to keep the hidden states properly at the beginning. don't forget to initialize them correctly!

```python
def elementwise_forward_with_state(model, input_sequence, initial_state=None):
    batch_size = input_sequence.size(0)
    seq_len = input_sequence.size(1)
    counter = torch.zeros(batch_size, dtype=torch.int64) # initialize counter per batch
    outputs = []
    state = initial_state
    for step in range(seq_len):
        input_step = input_sequence[:, step, :]
        output, state = model(input_step, state) # model now returns (output, state)
        if output.argmax(dim=1) == some_class_index:
            counter += 1
        outputs.append(output)
    return torch.stack(outputs, dim=1), counter, state

```

regarding resources, i wouldn't recommend clicking on some random link, instead i'd point you to some proper material. for understanding the basics, the book "deep learning" by goodfellow, bengio, and courville is a great start. it covers everything from basic neural networks to recurrent models. for sequence models, you might also want to look into the original papers introducing lstms and transformers. the original 'attention is all you need' paper is usually enough to grasp the basics. for practical advice on how to use these in your code, i recommend reading the specific frameworks' documentation. they usually have a good amount of examples and tutorials.

a quick word of advice is also to not overcomplicate your model unless necessary. sometimes the simplest solutions tend to work best. i remember once i tried to get too clever with my model design and ended up spending way too much time debugging a simple mistake that would not have happened with a simpler model. we, as developers, have to remember that we're not only building things, we're also maintaining them.
and sometimes that's harder than building.
