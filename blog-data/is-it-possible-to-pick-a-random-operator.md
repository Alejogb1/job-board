 so picking a random operator yeah I've been down that rabbit hole before it's not as straightforward as you might think at first glance especially when you get into the weeds of different programming languages and their operator handling

Let me tell you a story back in the day when I was messing with some esoteric scripting language thing it basically had a syntax that was like a mashup of everything you'd ever seen but I needed to do some dynamic operation generation and I was looking at just randomly pulling operators

my first attempt was awful really i'm not proud of it but that's how we learn isn't it so i created a big array of string representations of operators and just used random to pick an index in that array then i tried to parse the damn string into something usable and obviously that went south fast it was buggy as hell and the overhead was just atrocious

```python
# Example of the bad approach in python just for illustration don't do this
import random

def bad_random_operator():
    operators = ["+", "-", "*", "/", "%", "**"]
    random_op = random.choice(operators)
    return random_op

print(bad_random_operator())
```

Yeah avoid that kind of stuff it's just painful it's like trying to assemble a lego set blindfolded using only a spork it's theoretically possible but why why make it harder on yourself

The real problem you run into early on is the difference between the operator representation and the actual operational behavior we humans see `+` and go ah yeah addition your code interpreter might have a different idea it needs that operation to be tied to specific instructions in the bytecode or machine code or whatever else you have beneath the surface so you cant just pluck a string and expect it to work you need a way to bridge that gap

So the better way which I eventually stumbled upon was to abstract away the actual operations behind some kind of structure in python which is very cool cause you can do practically anything you want with objects

Here's a less embarrassing version where you can pick a function that implements the operator function instead of dealing with string representation of the operator directly this is obviously better and more pythonic

```python
# A better way in python utilizing function objects
import random
import operator

def get_random_op_function():
    ops = {
        "+": operator.add,
        "-": operator.sub,
        "*": operator.mul,
        "/": operator.truediv,
        "%": operator.mod,
        "**": operator.pow
    }
    random_op_key = random.choice(list(ops.keys()))
    return ops[random_op_key]

random_operator = get_random_op_function()
print(random_operator(5,2))
```
This makes it significantly simpler you are now getting a callable which has the behaviour you want so you can just call it with the corresponding parameters which is much much cleaner I still prefer functional style solutions though where you just choose the function directly without intermediate structures it makes everything much more readable

Now a bit more of a challenge lets suppose we are working in C++ because why not you need to deal with function pointers and it's a different beast all together you can implement something similar but with more manual work and you need to take type safety into account and how to deal with function pointers as a concept because in C++ we work in the real world my friends and real world programming is not always a walk in the park

```cpp
// Example in C++ using function pointers
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <random>
#include <functional>

double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
double subtract(double a, double b) { return a - b; }
double multiply(double a, double b) { return a * b; }
double divide(double a, double b) { return a / b; }
double modulo(double a, double b) { return std::fmod(a,b); }

using BinaryOperation = std::function<double(double, double)>;

BinaryOperation getRandomOperatorCpp() {
    std::vector<BinaryOperation> ops = {add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo};
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen(rd());
    std::uniform_int_distribution<> distrib(0, ops.size() - 1);
    return ops[distrib(gen)];
}

int main() {
    BinaryOperation randomOp = getRandomOperatorCpp();
    double result = randomOp(10.0, 3.0);
    std::cout << "Result " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This approach has a little more code but it's cleaner and it highlights the differences between programming languages and how each deals with operators at a lower level you are basically choosing a function using a random index in a vector which is a common way of generating a random element from a collection

You'll notice that we had to explicitly define those `add` `subtract` etc because C++ is a language that is statically typed and not dynamic like python where function names are objects of the same type and can be randomly returned

Now about resources because links are not cool on this platform I suggest books and a paper if you want to dig deeper into operators and interpreter design.

First grab a copy of *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* by Abelson and Sussman it's like a bible for computer science and it goes deep into interpreters functional programming and all that good stuff it will definitely teach you about abstraction of the basic building blocks of language like operators also there is *Compilers Principles Techniques and Tools* by Aho et al also known as the Dragon book which will definitely show you how operators are handled by compilers and how you can implement them yourself it is a little more advanced than the previous one but invaluable when you want to get a true understanding of how things work behind the scenes

If you want to check more about random generators in algorithms grab a look into the Knuth papers about random number generation there is an excellent paper called *The Art of Computer Programming Vol 2 Seminumerical algorithms* which goes into detail about the process and will be useful if you need a deep understanding of how truly random numbers are created and you need a very good random number generator for your particular case of operator selection

Basically the key takeaway is that operators aren't just strings they are fundamental operations of your programming language so it's better to work with function objects or function pointers rather than trying to parse string representations of the operators that's the advice i wish i had back then when i was wrestling with those random operator issues
oh and yeah that is not a great idea to do for any serious application unless you are doing some generative art or educational programming so don't do that in a production system unless you know exactly what you are doing. It is an exercise to be used in very specific scenarios and not a general programming solution

I hope this helps and best of luck with your coding.
