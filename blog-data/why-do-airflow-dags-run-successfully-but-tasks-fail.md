Alright, let's tackle this common headache. It's frustrating, isn't it, when the orchestration appears flawless, yet the actual work units stumble. I’ve spent more hours than I care to count troubleshooting these situations, and I've learned that a successful DAG run doesn’t guarantee successful tasks. Think of it like a perfectly planned road trip – the itinerary might be spot on, but flat tires or wrong turns can still derail individual legs of the journey.

Essentially, the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) represents the *blueprint* of your workflow. Airflow manages the scheduling and dependencies defined in that blueprint, ensuring that tasks are initiated in the correct order at the designated time. A successful DAG run merely indicates that Airflow has correctly interpreted and executed this orchestration plan. However, the *execution* of each individual task is a separate concern, happening at a lower level. Numerous factors can lead to a task failure despite a flawless DAG run.

The most frequent culprit, in my experience, boils down to issues within the task itself. A task in Airflow is essentially a wrapper around a unit of work – it could be running a shell command, executing a python function, or interacting with an external API. If that unit of work encounters an error, the task will fail, even if the broader DAG is healthy. Resource constraints, coding errors within the task logic, or issues with external systems (database connection issues, API downtimes, etc.) are all prime candidates.

Let's delve into some practical examples.

**Example 1: Resource Limitations**

Imagine a scenario where a python task needs to process a large data file. We’ll use a simplified example here, reading and counting lines from a file:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def count_lines(file_path):
    line_count = 0
    try:
      with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
          for _ in file:
              line_count += 1
      print(f"Total lines in {file_path}: {line_count}")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File not found at {file_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        raise

with DAG(
    dag_id='resource_limitation_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    count_lines_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='count_lines_task',
        python_callable=count_lines,
        op_kwargs={'file_path': '/path/to/large_file.txt'}
    )
```

In this simple DAG, the `count_lines_task` runs a Python function to count lines. However, if the file at `/path/to/large_file.txt` is extremely large, the task might fail due to memory exhaustion. The DAG would have run successfully, initiating the task, but the task itself would fail due to lack of resources.  The Airflow scheduler did its job in starting the task, but the hardware or configuration at the execution level was insufficient. To fix this, I’d typically consider using a more memory-efficient method of reading the file or using a cluster for the computation.

**Example 2: Coding Error**

Let's assume we have a Python task for data transformation which makes a simple attempt to divide one column by another, using a pandas DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def transform_data():
  try:
    data = {'col1': [1,2,3,4,5], 'col2': [2,4,0,8,10]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    df['result'] = df['col1'] / df['col2']
    print(df)
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    raise

with DAG(
    dag_id='coding_error_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
  transform_data_task = PythonOperator(
      task_id='transform_data_task',
      python_callable=transform_data
  )
```

This code will attempt to divide `col1` by `col2`. Notice that `col2` contains a zero. This would cause a `ZeroDivisionError`, leading to task failure. The DAG will execute without issues in scheduling, but the python code will throw an error. In practical scenarios, this might manifest due to unexpected data values during processing. The solution often requires error handling with try-except blocks, data validation prior to transformations, and thorough unit tests.

**Example 3: External System Dependency**

Let's consider a task that needs to fetch data from an API:

```python
import requests
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def fetch_data_from_api(api_url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(api_url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        data = response.json()
        print(data)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during API request: {e}")
        raise

with DAG(
    dag_id='api_failure_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    fetch_data_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='fetch_data_task',
        python_callable=fetch_data_from_api,
        op_kwargs={'api_url': 'https://api.example.com/data'}
    )

```

Here, if the external API at `https://api.example.com/data` is temporarily unavailable, or if there are network issues, the task will fail. The DAG, again, runs fine - Airflow correctly initiates the task - but the downstream dependency is unavailable, causing the `requests.get` to fail, and the task to be marked as such. Robust solutions here include retries with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, or error handling with fallback mechanisms.

For deeper understanding of these issues, I strongly recommend consulting resources such as "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann, specifically the sections on data consistency and fault tolerance. For practical guidance on Python and Pandas, check out "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney. When dealing with distributed systems concepts, "Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design" by George Coulouris et al, can be particularly helpful. And lastly, "The Practice of System and Network Administration" by Thomas A. Limoncelli et al provides valuable insight into general system administration which may be helpful.

In summary, a successfully running DAG indicates proper scheduling and dependency management from Airflow's perspective. Task failures, however, occur at the execution level, often stemming from resource limitations, coding errors, or external system dependencies. Thorough logging, rigorous error handling, and proactive monitoring are vital when troubleshooting these issues. Understanding where the responsibility of the system begins and ends is crucial for quickly diagnosing and remedying issues. It requires a multi-faceted approach to ensure that the orchestration and the individual execution of tasks are both robust.
