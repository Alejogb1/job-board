Okay, let's unpack this. I've seen this tripping up folks for years, and it's a legitimate head-scratcher if you're coming at it fresh. The core of the issue with `torch.nn.DataParallel` and parameter updates boils down to how PyTorch handles model distribution and gradient aggregation, coupled with the subtle way `DataParallel` operates as a module wrapper rather than a true model modification.

Essentially, when you wrap your model with `torch.nn.DataParallel`, the original model instance you are passing to it is not directly used for parameter updates. Instead, `DataParallel` creates *replicas* of your model on different GPUs. When you feed data through this `DataParallel` module, each replica processes its assigned batch chunk, calculates its gradients, and then these gradients are aggregated back to the *master* replica — often, but not always, the one on your primary GPU. The fundamental problem arises because the optimizers you initialize are pointing to the parameters of your original model, not the parameters of the master replica that actually undergoes the aggregation.

This mismatch leads to a frustrating scenario: you appear to train your model, but the parameters don’t actually change. It's like training a mirror image, and the real thing remains untouched. The gradients are computed and combined correctly, but they're not being applied to the correct parameters—the parameters within the original model instance.

Let's illustrate this with some code. Suppose we have a simple linear model:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleLinear, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

input_size = 10
output_size = 1
model = SimpleLinear(input_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) # Note this

# Dummy data
dummy_input = torch.randn(4, input_size) # Batch size 4
dummy_target = torch.randn(4, output_size)
```

Now, if you wrap this with `DataParallel` and try to update, it won’t work as you might expect:

```python
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
    model.cuda() # Move to multiple GPUs
    dummy_input = dummy_input.cuda()
    dummy_target = dummy_target.cuda()

output = model(dummy_input)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
loss = loss_fn(output, dummy_target)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

# If you now inspect model.linear.weight, you will not see the expected updates.
print("Original model parameters before:", model.module.linear.weight if hasattr(model, 'module') else model.linear.weight)
```

The important part to notice here is that the `optimizer` is still tied to the *original* model's parameters. When `DataParallel` performs the forward and backward passes, it's the *replicated* model instances doing the work. The aggregation step only returns gradients to the *master* replica, which is, from an implementation point of view, a hidden attribute of the `DataParallel` module. Because the original model is only being wrapped and is not directly trained, its parameters remain unchanged. We do, however, need to access the master model's parameters inside `DataParallel` to achieve what we want, by calling the hidden attribute `.module`. This brings me to the canonical solution: the optimizer needs to point to the master replica within the DataParallel module.

Here is the corrected example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleLinear, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

input_size = 10
output_size = 1
model = SimpleLinear(input_size, output_size)


if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.module.parameters(), lr=0.01) # Fixed: Point to .module
    model.cuda()
    dummy_input = torch.randn(4, input_size).cuda()
    dummy_target = torch.randn(4, output_size).cuda()
else:
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) # Keep the original optimizer
    dummy_input = torch.randn(4, input_size)
    dummy_target = torch.randn(4, output_size)

output = model(dummy_input)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
loss = loss_fn(output, dummy_target)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
print("Corrected model parameters after:", model.module.linear.weight if hasattr(model, 'module') else model.linear.weight)
```

In this updated code, if `DataParallel` is used (i.e., more than one GPU is available), the optimizer now targets `model.module.parameters()`. The `.module` attribute accesses the underlying model wrapped by `DataParallel`, where the master replica resides. If we’re not using `DataParallel`, i.e. training on a single GPU or CPU, we use the original `model.parameters()`. This approach correctly aligns the optimizer with the trainable parameters. We also moved the input data to the right device, avoiding any other possible issues.

This also highlights that the use of `torch.nn.DataParallel` can introduce some subtle differences on how you write the code. Let me demonstrate an alternative, cleaner approach using `DistributedDataParallel` which addresses these limitations:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.distributed as dist
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel

class SimpleLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleLinear, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

def setup(rank, world_size):
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)

def cleanup():
    dist.destroy_process_group()


def train(rank, world_size, input_size, output_size):
    setup(rank, world_size)

    model = SimpleLinear(input_size, output_size).cuda(rank)

    # Wrap with DistributedDataParallel
    model = DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[rank])

    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

    dummy_input = torch.randn(4, input_size).cuda(rank)
    dummy_target = torch.randn(4, output_size).cuda(rank)
    output = model(dummy_input)
    loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
    loss = loss_fn(output, dummy_target)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Process {rank} - Parameters after training: {model.module.linear.weight}")

    cleanup()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import torch.multiprocessing as mp

    world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()
    input_size = 10
    output_size = 1

    mp.spawn(train,
             args=(world_size, input_size, output_size),
             nprocs=world_size,
             join=True)
```
This last example demonstrates `DistributedDataParallel`. This is not a drop-in replacement for `DataParallel`, as it requires that each process has its own copy of the model which has to be initialized with a proper distributed initialization. `DistributedDataParallel` also doesn’t exhibit the hidden attribute problem we have discussed, because the optimizers are directly initialized from the model. For more complex setups, especially in distributed environments, `DistributedDataParallel` generally provides better scaling and more consistent performance.

To delve deeper into these concepts, I highly recommend "Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz," available on the official PyTorch website. Also, explore the official PyTorch documentation on `torch.nn.DataParallel` and `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`. You should also check out the paper *Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour* by Goyal et al., which discusses optimization strategies when distributing the model and using large batch sizes. The information available in these sources should give you a strong foundation for understanding the inner workings of distributed training within PyTorch, and help you avoid some very common pitfalls.
