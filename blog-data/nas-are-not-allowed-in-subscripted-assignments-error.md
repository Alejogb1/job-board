 I see what's going on here this is a classic "why is Python being so annoying" moment I've banged my head against this particular wall more times than I'd like to admit believe me you are not alone

The core issue as I see it you're trying to use `np.nan` inside a subscripted assignment and getting this "nas are not allowed in subscripted assignments" error right? It's super specific and it basically comes down to how numpy handles assignment operations especially when dealing with masked arrays or complex data types I've been there it's a real gotcha and i remember being in my first job having the same issue for hours.

Essentially numpy wants you to be really explicit about how you're handling missing or undefined values it doesn't magically let you shove `np.nan` into any old location particularly if it messes with the underlying data type of the array you're working with like if you have an integer array and you try to put a `np.nan` in there which is a float it just refuses to make it happen. This is not a bug this is numpy being helpful well sort of it is if you really know what you are doing and you are not playing with fire.

So let's break it down with some examples that usually work for me when I'm wrestling with similar issues i mean i had similar issues a long time ago at some place we were using numpy to process lots of satellite data it was a nightmare.

**Example 1: Masked Arrays the Way to Go**

Often the best approach when dealing with potentially missing data is to use numpy's `ma.masked_array` this lets you explicitly mark certain locations as masked (meaning 'missing' or 'invalid' in whatever context) and then operations skip over those masked elements.

```python
import numpy as np
import numpy.ma as ma

# Let's say you have some data with missing parts
data = np.array([1, 2, -999, 4, -999, 6]) # -999 means missing let's say

# create the masked array
masked_data = ma.masked_where(data == -999, data)

print(masked_data) # outputs: [1 2 -- 4 -- 6] where "--" indicates masked

# Now, you can assign values to masked locations without triggering an error:
masked_data[masked_data.mask] = 10 # replace those missing parts
print(masked_data) # outputs [1 2 10 4 10 6]
```
In this code I was using -999 to mark the 'bad data' points but you can mark them as you want depending on your data. We use that `masked_where` function to create a mask on top of our data wherever the elements are equal to -999 and later on when we perform assignments we target the mask with this expression `masked_data.mask`. When working with real data the mask might be very complex this is just a basic example and remember to clean up that mask before you assign anything or it might mess up with the logic that you need to implement in your application.

This works because `masked_data[masked_data.mask]` directly targets only the missing elements the ones that are already masked we are not trying to implicitly introduce `np.nan` into our data set this lets us work around that subscripted assignment restriction. This `masked_where` function is your best friend in these scenarios its super useful.

**Example 2: Creating Float Arrays from the Start**

Another scenario is when you try to insert a `np.nan` into an array of integers. Numpy is very particular with data types it does not like this kind of stuff because `np.nan` is a float.

```python
import numpy as np

#This will error cause int arrays cannot have nan
#my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=int)
#my_array[1] = np.nan
#print(my_array)

#this will do the trick
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=float)
my_array[1] = np.nan
print(my_array) # outputs: [ 1.  nan  3.  4.]

```

Here's the key point: you must create your array with `dtype=float` if you need to store NaNs in it if you try to add `nan` on a integer array numpy will scream you need to be sure the underlying data type can accommodate the `nan` values or you will find yourself in trouble. This is a common mistake that new users tend to make I saw lots of people making this mistake over the years. If you are dealing with mixed types that's a good indicator that you might want to use `masked_array` because if the data is very messy you might end up having more problems down the road.

**Example 3: Explicit `astype` for Safe Conversions**

Sometimes you might get an array from some external source that is not yet ready to receive `np.nan`. In those cases you have to create a copy and change the data type you cannot change it in place because it can create unexpected behaviors on your data.

```python
import numpy as np

# Imagine you get this from an external system
initial_data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

# You need to set some of the values to nan but the array is integer!
#this line will error: initial_data[2] = np.nan
# you first need to make the array float
float_data = initial_data.astype(float)

float_data[2] = np.nan

print(float_data)  # output: [ 1.  2.  nan  4.]
```

This pattern of using `.astype(float)` is a good safety net it ensures that your array is ready for potentially missing values before you attempt to put `np.nan` into it and you avoid a lot of headaches.

**Why This Error Happens in The First Place**

The reason why numpy does this is for consistency and data type integrity. `np.nan` is a float and numpy works under the hood with pre allocated blocks of memory so it needs to make sure your underlying data types are consistent and this can lead to a lot of headaches when you are working with data that is not fully controlled by you. Numpy does not want to go into situations where it needs to reallocate or change its internal representation because this can slow down calculations and introduce unexpected behaviors so it rather give you the error at the beginning rather than at the end of your calculation which would be a much harder bug to debug.

Also this behavior protects you from unknowingly converting integers into floats especially in performance-critical loops where unexpected conversions can lead to significant slowdowns. It is like if numpy is looking at you saying *are you sure you know what you are doing?* its a good check in place for the long run believe me. I have seen very weird bugs over the years and most of them could have been avoided with a more careful use of numpy and a better understanding of how it works under the hood. The error you encountered is an indicator that you must stop for a second and think *ok what's going on here?*

**Resources**

If you want to dive deeper into these concepts I'd suggest looking into these specific references:

*   **"NumPy User Guide"**: This is the bible for all things Numpy. Look for the sections on data types, masked arrays and array indexing.
*   **"Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake VanderPlas:** This book dedicates good sections on numpy and masked arrays and it covers pretty much everything you need to understand and have solid fundaments on what numpy does.
*   **Scientific Computing with Python for Beginners**: There are a lot of these books out there find one that fits your style they usually have a whole chapter on numpy and how to deal with this kind of problems.

There's no magic wand here you gotta be explicit about how you handle `np.nan` it's a good practice in general when you are dealing with data because data is a mess. These examples should get you on the right track and remember if you still have questions don't hesitate to ask. And please don't use global variables they can lead to problems believe me i had a very stressful day once. They are like the dark side of the force.
