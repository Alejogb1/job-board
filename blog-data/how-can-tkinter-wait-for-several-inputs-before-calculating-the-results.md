,  It’s a fairly common scenario when building interactive applications—needing to collect multiple inputs before kicking off a computation. I've definitely found myself staring at a flickering Tkinter window, wishing it was a bit more cooperative, back in my early days developing interactive data visualization tools. The issue often arises from Tkinter’s event-driven nature; it’s not inherently built to pause and wait. Instead, it continuously monitors for events like button clicks, keystrokes, and window resizes. We need to manage this asynchronous flow explicitly.

The basic problem is that straightforward procedural coding, like reading input sequentially, doesn't work well with Tkinter’s main loop. If you try to ‘wait’ for input within the main loop’s execution, your application will freeze. The window becomes unresponsive because the main thread is blocked. The solution involves using event handlers, which are functions triggered by specific events, coupled with data storage mechanisms to collect the inputs.

Essentially, we utilize variables in the Tkinter application to hold input values, and define functions that are called when events occur (like a button press). These functions record the input in our data collection mechanism. The final computation should then be triggered only after all inputs have been gathered.

Let me demonstrate with three specific examples.

**Example 1: Collecting Numeric Inputs via `Entry` Widgets**

In this case, imagine we want the user to enter three numbers and calculate their average. Here's how I’d approach it:

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk

class NumberAverager(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Number Averager")

        self.numbers = []
        self.labels = []
        self.entries = []

        for i in range(3):
            label = ttk.Label(self, text=f"Enter Number {i + 1}:")
            label.grid(row=i, column=0, padx=5, pady=5)
            entry = ttk.Entry(self)
            entry.grid(row=i, column=1, padx=5, pady=5)
            self.labels.append(label)
            self.entries.append(entry)

        calculate_button = ttk.Button(self, text="Calculate Average", command=self.calculate_average)
        calculate_button.grid(row=3, column=0, columnspan=2, padx=5, pady=10)

        self.result_label = ttk.Label(self, text="Average: ")
        self.result_label.grid(row=4, column=0, columnspan=2, padx=5, pady=5)


    def calculate_average(self):
        try:
            self.numbers = [float(entry.get()) for entry in self.entries]
            average = sum(self.numbers) / len(self.numbers)
            self.result_label.config(text=f"Average: {average:.2f}")
        except ValueError:
            self.result_label.config(text="Invalid input. Please enter numbers.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = NumberAverager()
    app.mainloop()
```

In this example, we use a `ttk.Entry` widget for each input. We store the `Entry` objects in a list, `self.entries`. When the ‘Calculate Average’ button is pressed, the `calculate_average` method is triggered. This method retrieves the input values from each `Entry`, attempts to convert them into floats, and calculates the average. Error handling is added to deal with non-numeric inputs.

**Example 2: Collecting Text Inputs via `Entry` widgets, triggered by a button**

Suppose we want to collect a person's name and location, again triggering action only after all fields are entered.

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk

class NameLocationApp(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Name and Location")

        self.name_label = ttk.Label(self, text="Enter Your Name:")
        self.name_label.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=5, pady=5)
        self.name_entry = ttk.Entry(self)
        self.name_entry.grid(row=0, column=1, padx=5, pady=5)

        self.location_label = ttk.Label(self, text="Enter Your Location:")
        self.location_label.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=5, pady=5)
        self.location_entry = ttk.Entry(self)
        self.location_entry.grid(row=1, column=1, padx=5, pady=5)

        submit_button = ttk.Button(self, text="Submit", command=self.submit_data)
        submit_button.grid(row=2, column=0, columnspan=2, padx=5, pady=10)

        self.result_label = ttk.Label(self, text="")
        self.result_label.grid(row=3, column=0, columnspan=2, padx=5, pady=5)

    def submit_data(self):
        name = self.name_entry.get()
        location = self.location_entry.get()

        if name and location:
            self.result_label.config(text=f"Name: {name}, Location: {location}")
        else:
            self.result_label.config(text="Please fill in both fields.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = NameLocationApp()
    app.mainloop()
```

This example uses the same `Entry` widget approach, but with textual data. The `submit_data` method checks that both input fields contain some value, and only then displays the results, and providing an error message if either input is blank.

**Example 3: Collecting Selection Inputs from Multiple `Combobox` Widgets**

Now let's consider a slightly different case, where we have several dropdown menus and must collect a selection from each of them.

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk

class MultipleDropdownApp(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Multiple Dropdowns")

        self.dropdowns = []
        options_sets = [["Option A1", "Option A2", "Option A3"], ["Option B1", "Option B2"], ["Option C1", "Option C2", "Option C3", "Option C4"]]

        for i, options in enumerate(options_sets):
            label = ttk.Label(self, text=f"Select Option {i+1}:")
            label.grid(row=i, column=0, padx=5, pady=5)
            combobox = ttk.Combobox(self, values=options, state="readonly")
            combobox.grid(row=i, column=1, padx=5, pady=5)
            self.dropdowns.append(combobox)

        submit_button = ttk.Button(self, text="Submit Selections", command=self.submit_selections)
        submit_button.grid(row=len(options_sets), column=0, columnspan=2, padx=5, pady=10)

        self.result_label = ttk.Label(self, text="")
        self.result_label.grid(row=len(options_sets) + 1, column=0, columnspan=2, padx=5, pady=5)

    def submit_selections(self):
      selections = [dropdown.get() for dropdown in self.dropdowns]
      if all(selections):
          self.result_label.config(text=f"Selections: {', '.join(selections)}")
      else:
          self.result_label.config(text="Please make a selection in each dropdown.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MultipleDropdownApp()
    app.mainloop()

```

Here, we employ `ttk.Combobox` widgets to create our dropdown menus, populated with distinct option sets. The `submit_selections` function gathers the currently selected values and displays them only after every menu has a selection. The `all(selections)` line checks that every dropdown has a value selected before displaying the results.

In all of these cases, the important element is that we collect the user's inputs into application-level variables, such as lists or directly via the `Entry` and `Combobox` instances, within the application's class, and then we activate the processing only when the user has interacted with a button.

For deeper understanding of Tkinter event handling, I recommend delving into 'Tkinter GUI Application Development Hotshot' by Bhaskar M., particularly the chapter on event-driven programming. The book provides practical approaches and in-depth explanations of managing events effectively within Tkinter, far beyond the basics that a tutorial may cover. Moreover, if you are looking for resources on GUI design principles and advanced Tkinter layout concepts, consider reading 'Modern Tkinter' by Mark Roseman. I find its focus on building extensible and reusable user interfaces a valuable resource. Finally, the official Tk documentation ([https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/contents.htm](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/contents.htm) as a reference for understanding the low-level mechanisms underlying Tkinter is essential.

These examples and suggested resources should clarify how to manage multiple inputs in Tkinter without blocking the main loop. It’s about understanding that Tkinter is asynchronous, and you need to collect data via its event handlers, not through blocking sequential calls. This event-driven approach is critical to building responsive and robust GUIs.
