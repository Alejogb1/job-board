Okay, let's tackle this. I’ve certainly been down this road a few times, and it’s a common stumbling block when working with asynchronous operations. The core issue revolves around the non-blocking nature of async functions and ensuring that changes made within them are properly reflected in the broader program state. It’s not as straightforward as a simple variable assignment in a synchronous context, but it's entirely manageable with the right approach.

Fundamentally, an asynchronous function, denoted using `async` in many languages (like javascript/typescript, python, c#), doesn't immediately execute. Instead, it returns a promise (or a similar construct like a future in other languages). This promise represents the eventual result of the asynchronous operation. The tricky part is that this result might not be available right away, especially if it involves waiting for i/o operations like network requests or disk reads. Thus, directly modifying external state within the async function without proper handling can lead to race conditions, where the changes might not occur in the order expected, or might get lost altogether.

The key to propagating changes from an async function is to understand the lifecycle of the promise and use appropriate mechanisms to either signal completion or directly update the state when the async operation finishes. The exact approach varies slightly depending on the context, but the underlying principles remain constant.

Let me illustrate this with three distinct scenarios, using javascript-like syntax for ease of understanding:

**Scenario 1: Updating a Component's State in a React-like Environment**

In a user interface context where we are using a reactive framework like react, we often need to update the displayed data based on results fetched asynchronously. Consider a simplified example of fetching user data:

```javascript
class UserComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { userData: null, loading: false };
  }

  async fetchUserData() {
    this.setState({ loading: true });
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/user'); // Imagine this is an actual api call
      const data = await response.json();
      this.setState({ userData: data, loading: false });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching user data:", error);
      this.setState({ loading: false, error: error }); // Consider a more user-friendly error message
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.fetchUserData();
  }

  render() {
   if (this.state.loading) return <p>Loading...</p>
    if (this.state.error) return <p>Error: {this.state.error.message}</p>;
    if (!this.state.userData) return <p>No user data</p>;
    return (
      <div>
          <p>Username: {this.state.userData.username}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Here, `fetchUserData` is our async function. We use `this.setState` from the component to reflect changes. Crucially, we wrap the call to `fetch` in a try-catch block to handle possible errors and update the component’s state accordingly. Setting `loading` to `true` at the start and then `false` after completion or in case of error ensures the user gets visual feedback on what is happening. Also, I’m using the `await` keyword which makes the code execute synchronously and it waits until the operation is fulfilled before it goes further. This is critical because asynchronous operations such as network requests take some time, and we do not want the code to proceed before it receives a response.

**Scenario 2: Returning a Value from an Async Function**

Sometimes, the primary purpose of an async function is to compute or retrieve a value, and we want to access that value after the async process completes. Let's look at a more basic example of calculating a result from a time-consuming process:

```javascript
async function calculateSumAsync(a, b) {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(() => {
          const sum = a + b;
          resolve(sum);
      }, 1000); // Simulating a delay of 1 second.
    });
}

async function main() {
    const result = await calculateSumAsync(5, 3);
    console.log("The sum is:", result);
}

main();
```

In this scenario, `calculateSumAsync` returns a promise that resolves with the sum after a simulated delay. The `await` keyword in `main` waits until the promise resolves before continuing execution, effectively synchronizing the execution of the `main` function with the completion of the asynchronous operation. The result can then be logged. This example also shows how you can create a promise using a constructor `new Promise`. This is useful when dealing with API that does not return a promise.

**Scenario 3: Using Callbacks for Asynchronous Updates (Less Common Today)**

While promises are now the preferred way to manage asynchronous operations, callbacks were very common previously and might still show up in legacy code. I've definitely seen code using callbacks extensively, so let's briefly touch upon it:

```javascript
function fetchUserDataWithCallback(url, callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = { username: "testuser" }; // Simulated data from an api request
    callback(null, data); // First argument for error, second for success
  }, 1000); // Simulated API call taking 1 second

}

function processUserData(error, userData) {
  if (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  } else {
    console.log("Fetched User:", userData.username);
  }
}


fetchUserDataWithCallback('/api/user', processUserData);
```

In this older pattern, the async function `fetchUserDataWithCallback` doesn't directly return anything; instead, it invokes a callback function provided as an argument when the asynchronous operation is complete. We provide `processUserData` as the callback, and it is then executed with either the error or the result. Callbacks are, to some degree, considered less readable and harder to manage in complex applications. The "callback hell," which is essentially nested callbacks, was a big motivator to adopt promises and `async/await`.

In all three scenarios, we see the consistent pattern: the async function itself does not directly change the external state. Rather, it returns a promise or uses callbacks, mechanisms which signal when the operation is complete and which allow for data to then be propagated and used appropriately. The `async/await` syntax provides a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more synchronous style, making the flow of the code easier to follow, but this does not change the asynchronous nature of what happens behind the scene.

For further exploration, I highly recommend the following resources:

*   **"You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance" by Kyle Simpson:** This book provides a deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript, including promises, async/await, and various performance considerations.
*  **"Effective JavaScript" by David Herman:** While not solely focused on async, this book offers valuable insights into modern JavaScript practices, including working with asynchronous patterns.
*   **"Programming in Lua, Fourth Edition" by Roberto Ierusalimschy:** While lua has coroutines, which are similar but slightly different, it will give you a theoretical view into the fundamentals of how asynchronous patterns work.

Understanding how to manage the asynchronous flow is essential for any modern developer. With experience, you will naturally gravitate toward the specific patterns that work best in your specific context. The key is to understand the core concepts of promises, callbacks, and the `async/await` syntax, so that you are equipped to adapt these principles to new and different situations. I hope this explanation helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.
