Okay, let's tackle this. It's a question I've faced countless times across various projects, often finding myself refining the approach based on the specific context. Pairing array elements efficiently isn’t a one-size-fits-all situation; the best solution heavily depends on your performance needs and the nature of the array. I've found that a deep understanding of both the algorithmic implications and the practical coding techniques is crucial here.

The most straightforward scenario is pairing consecutive elements, for instance, creating pairs like `[arr[0], arr[1]], [arr[2], arr[3]], ...`. This is fairly trivial, usually requiring a simple loop with an increment of two, but even here there can be considerations. Let’s say I was working on a graphics processing module some years ago. I needed to process vertices in pairs to form line segments. The goal was to process as many segments as possible, as quickly as possible. In such situations, clarity and efficiency are paramount. We are looking for ways to minimize computational overhead.

```python
def pair_consecutive_elements(arr):
    pairs = []
    for i in range(0, len(arr) - 1, 2):
        pairs.append((arr[i], arr[i+1]))
    return pairs

# example
example_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
paired = pair_consecutive_elements(example_array)
print(paired)  # output: [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
```

This snippet uses Python, and its simplicity speaks volumes. It's readable, easily understandable by anyone familiar with looping and list comprehension, and generally effective. The critical element is `range(0, len(arr) - 1, 2)`, which skips every other element ensuring that we only form non-overlapping pairs. Now, if you are dealing with large lists, especially when considering memory allocations for huge output lists, a generator expression might be more efficient from a memory perspective. It would yield the pairs one at a time.

But what if you needed to pair elements in a way that isn't simply consecutive? Perhaps I had a client project, a recommender system, a few years back, where I needed to calculate similarity measures between different users. I’d represent each user’s preferences as a vector of numerical values, and then needed to compare all user vectors with all other user vectors. Here, I'm talking about generating all possible unique pairs of elements. In the earlier project we didn't need to create each possible vector combination. This creates far more pairs and requires different logic.

```python
def pair_all_unique_elements(arr):
    pairs = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            pairs.append((arr[i], arr[j]))
    return pairs

# example
example_array = ['a', 'b', 'c']
paired_unique = pair_all_unique_elements(example_array)
print(paired_unique) # output: [('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'c')]
```

This second example employs nested loops to create all unique pairs. Note the inner loop, starting with `range(i + 1, len(arr))`. This prevents duplicate pairs (e.g., `('a', 'b')` and `('b', 'a')` are considered the same) and avoids self-pairing, optimizing the results. This method, of course, carries an `O(n^2)` complexity, which becomes noticeable with larger arrays, and its efficiency drops substantially. If you encounter scenarios with huge arrays you might need more efficient algorithms which could perhaps sacrifice some simplicity for speed, for example parallel computing or GPU processing where applicable.

Now, for the third case, consider I needed to pair elements based on specific criteria – a project where I was matching sensors based on readings that were close enough, let's say. The data was unstructured and the pairings weren't just based on indexes. I needed to apply a function to find matches. In this situation you cannot rely on naive solutions and flexibility is key.

```python
def pair_elements_by_criteria(arr, criterion_function):
    pairs = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if criterion_function(arr[i], arr[j]):
                pairs.append((arr[i], arr[j]))
    return pairs

def close_enough(val1, val2):
    tolerance = 0.1
    return abs(val1 - val2) <= tolerance

# example
sensors_readings = [1.0, 1.2, 2.5, 2.6, 4.1, 4.3]
paired_by_criteria = pair_elements_by_criteria(sensors_readings, close_enough)
print(paired_by_criteria) # output: [(1.0, 1.2), (2.5, 2.6), (4.1, 4.3)]
```

This third code snippet incorporates the concept of an arbitrary criteria function (`criterion_function`), which allows for highly adaptable pairing rules. Here, I've used a `close_enough` function, to pair items based on a proximity criterion, but this could be replaced with any other function that determines if two elements qualify for a pairing, demonstrating that sometimes the logic of the program is much more important than any naive algorithms. This version is highly flexible and can be used in many diverse cases.

These examples, though simple, highlight different core ideas I've learned over the years. Choosing the 'right' method boils down to understanding the specifics of your data and what you're trying to achieve. Remember that 'efficient' is a relative term and has to consider the practical realities of the situation.

If you want to delve deeper into algorithmic efficiency, I would strongly recommend "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen et al. This book is considered foundational for understanding algorithm analysis. Additionally, for practical aspects of data structures and algorithms in programming, "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne offers a great balance of theory and practical implementation examples in various languages. For a more specific look into Python optimizations when handling data, a dedicated resource like “Effective Computation in Physics” by Anthony Scopatz and Kathryn D. Huff would be very beneficial. You can explore computational cost optimization using examples specifically in Python.

These books offer a deep dive into the fundamental principles that underpin efficient data processing, moving beyond superficial considerations. They give you the necessary theoretical background and practical tools to tackle these types of problems effectively. These are just starting points, though; constant learning and experimentation are paramount in our field.
