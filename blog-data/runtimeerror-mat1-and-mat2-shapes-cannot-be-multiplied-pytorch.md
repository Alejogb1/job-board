 so you're slamming into the classic PyTorch matrix multiplication shape mismatch right Yeah I know that feeling intimately been there done that bought the t-shirt actually I have several probably with like tensor shapes printed on them somewhere Anyway let's break down this runtimeerror mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied thing because it's not as scary as it looks I promise

First off it means exactly what it says you're trying to multiply two matrices or tensors using PyTorch's matmul or sometimes with the @ operator and their dimensions just don't line up remember matrix multiplication isnt just slap two arrays together and bam you got a result nah there's rules to this game Specifically if you're doing matrix multiplication of say A and B the number of columns in A has to be equal to the number of rows in B this is fundamental linear algebra stuff think of it like trying to fit two LEGO bricks together if the pegs on one don't match the holes on the other it ain't gonna work

I've had this happen to me so many times its almost comical back in my early days I was messing with some deep learning stuff trying to build a simple image classifier I had my input tensor beautifully shaped my weight matrix looking like a piece of art and then boom Runtimeerror like it was mocking my code it turned out I was transposing one of my matrices in the wrong place or something silly like that it was embarrassing I tell you

The error message its useful in a very concise way it does tell you what's wrong but it doesnt always tell you where the problem is It only reports the incompatibility when it reaches the operation and can only report the shapes of the matrices at the time of calculation thus you have to figure out where the shapes are defined and how they are constructed its very painful for large projects

So lets dig into it what are the usual culprits here First up its often due to simple human error transposing a matrix when you shouldn't be or maybe not transposing one when you should be I'm sure most of us have done it at least once if you haven't wait you will I bet my first server's worth of bitcoin that you will at least once Second is often dealing with batch dimensions PyTorch loves to add batch sizes and sometimes you forget that little guy is there this can mess with your matrix shapes in a big way I had a particularly annoying incident where I was trying to multiply two 3D tensors without properly handling the batch dimension caused all sorts of shape conflicts which felt like trying to solve rubik's cube while blindfolded I swear sometimes deep learning feels like just fixing bugs after bugs after bugs and you have to be very meticulous and it was that very project where I learned to check my shapes obsessively

Third you might have not correctly reshaped your input to match the expected input shape of your model so if your model needs 1x100 input and you feed 100x1 it will blow up in your face you should always review each tensor and the operation you are trying to make

Let me give you some examples code that shows this issue and some code showing how to fix it first let's create an example of this error

```python
import torch

# Example of incorrect matrix multiplication
mat1 = torch.randn(3, 4)
mat2 = torch.randn(3, 4)

# This will produce the runtime error
try:
    result = torch.matmul(mat1, mat2)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Caught Error: {e}")
```

In this first example the shapes of `mat1` and `mat2` are both `(3,4)` they dont comply with the rule we discussed earlier the inner dimensions must match so this obviously throws the error in the above code this is very typical and it is one of the most typical examples you will see out there so it can easily be resolved if you understand the root cause

Now let's get our hands dirty with some fixes and let's show some different alternatives to it so you can see more realistic ways you might encounter it in the wild

```python
import torch

# Example 1: Transposing mat2 to make the shapes compatible
mat1 = torch.randn(3, 4)
mat2 = torch.randn(4, 5)  # Corrected shape to be compatible

result = torch.matmul(mat1, mat2)
print(f"Correct Matmul Example 1: Result shape: {result.shape}")


# Example 2: Reshaping mat2 to make the shapes compatible
mat1 = torch.randn(3, 4)
mat2 = torch.randn(5, 4)
mat2 = mat2.T # Here we are transposing using this method

result = torch.matmul(mat1, mat2)
print(f"Correct Matmul Example 2: Result shape: {result.shape}")


# Example 3: Using batch dimensions and handling them
batch_size = 2
mat1 = torch.randn(batch_size, 3, 4)
mat2 = torch.randn(batch_size, 4, 5)

result = torch.matmul(mat1, mat2)
print(f"Correct Matmul Example 3: Result shape: {result.shape}")
```

In the first corrected example we changed `mat2`'s shape to `(4,5)` so now the number of columns in `mat1`(which is 4) matches the number of rows in `mat2`(which is also 4) and that way they comply and multiply without problems In the second example we keep the original matrix and transpose it to have a compatible dimension and in the final example we use batching using batch dimensions which might be more realistic since this is very common when you are training models with batches in neural networks

The most important thing is debugging this thing is to print the shapes of your tensors before the problematic operation itâ€™s a very simple solution but it's also the most efficient way of solving this issue you can use print function directly or you can use debugging tools in your code editors

Now for the resources the PyTorch documentation is your best friend I highly recommend going through the tensor and matmul operation sections very thoroughly it might seem a little boring but its very important also linear algebra knowledge is absolutely key you have to understand the under the hood math so a linear algebra textbook can be very helpful I used "Linear Algebra and Its Applications" by Gilbert Strang for a while and I think its a great book for this kind of stuff but anything works as long as you have a foundation of linear algebra. There is another great paper you should read but I can't remember it right now my brain is currently at 404 not found maybe it's because I've spent way too much time debugging shape errors today or maybe it's because I'm actually an AI pretending to be a human programmer who knows

Anyways dont let those error messages scare you it just means you need to be more careful with your tensor shapes and honestly even the best programmers make these errors from time to time so dont beat yourself up too much and remember to check your dimensions and that is the most important thing here if you are careful with your shapes you will be good to go! and remember coding is mostly debugging so get ready for more of this!
