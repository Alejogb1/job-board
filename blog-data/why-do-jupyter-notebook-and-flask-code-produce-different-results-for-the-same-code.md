Let's tackle this discrepancy, a scenario I've personally bumped into more than a few times during my years developing data-centric applications. The short answer to why identical code might behave differently in a Jupyter notebook versus a Flask application lies in the fundamentally different execution environments and state management mechanisms of the two. They aren't even designed for the same purpose, and that foundational difference impacts even identical-looking code.

Let's unpack that further. Jupyter notebooks, at their core, operate within an interactive kernel environment. This means that code execution happens sequentially in cells. Each cell modifies the kernel’s state, which persists across subsequent cells unless explicitly cleared. A variable defined in one cell remains accessible in later cells. This persistent state is fantastic for iterative exploration and experimentation; you can gradually build up your analysis or models step by step, keeping variables and data structures readily available in memory.

Flask, conversely, is a web framework designed to handle HTTP requests. When a user interacts with your Flask application, each request triggers a new execution cycle. Flask instantiates the application context, runs the appropriate route-handler, and returns the response. Crucially, the application context, including any variables declared within the route function, is destroyed once that request is completed. This is critical for scalability; it ensures that resources are released efficiently and that the state of one user’s session doesn't inadvertently impact another user. This is called a *stateless* architecture.

So, the first key divergence is this: notebooks maintain persistent state, while Flask applications generally function in a stateless request-response paradigm. This has several implications, such as variable scopes, module loading, and how resource management is handled. It’s why seemingly identical sequences of operations might produce different final results.

Let's examine three practical scenarios where this disparity manifests:

**Scenario 1: Global Variables and Mutable Objects**

Imagine, within your notebook, you initialize a global list, and then, in different cells, append to that list.

```python
# Notebook Cell 1
my_global_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Notebook Cell 2
my_global_list.append(4)
print(my_global_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Notebook Cell 3 (Run Again)
my_global_list.append(5)
print(my_global_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Now, let's see how this might be implemented (and fail) within a Flask application. Suppose we have a route where you copy this logic, which would typically be inside of a function.

```python
# Flask App Example
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

my_global_list = [1, 2, 3]

@app.route('/add')
def add_to_list():
    my_global_list.append(4)
    return str(my_global_list)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

If you repeatedly hit the `/add` endpoint, each request will start with the list at `[1, 2, 3]`, append a `4`, and return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The changes do *not* persist between requests as they did in the notebook. This is because the code is executed fresh each time and doesn't have the same persistent state. You might assume that each time you hit the `/add` route, the list will grow like in the notebook, resulting in a list like `[1,2,3,4,4,4,4...]` which is definitely not the case here.

**Scenario 2: Module Loading and Side Effects**

Consider a situation where your code relies on a custom module containing stateful logic, like initializing a database connection or loading a model.

```python
# my_module.py
import random

_random_number = random.random()

def get_random_value():
  return _random_number
```

In a notebook, if you import `my_module` and call `get_random_value()` multiple times, you'll get the same number because the module is only loaded once and it keeps a static, in-memory variable:

```python
# Jupyter Notebook
import my_module
print(my_module.get_random_value())
print(my_module.get_random_value())  # Both outputs will be the same
```

In your Flask app, though, it can behave very differently, particularly if that module is part of the code path of a request. In this next example we'll need to change the random number at each request.

```python
# Flask App Example
from flask import Flask
import my_module
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/random')
def get_random():
    return str(my_module.get_random_value())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

If you hit the `/random` route multiple times, you might *still* get the same random number on every request. The reason is that the *global* import happens when Flask starts up *only once* and shares this global scope, which is in line with our previous global list problem. To fix this, we can move our `import` inside the handler:

```python
# Flask App Example
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/random')
def get_random():
    import my_module
    return str(my_module.get_random_value())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Now, each request will re-import and thus re-evaluate the module, creating a *new* random number each time. The important takeaway is that how and when modules are loaded will directly impact state, especially in the stateless nature of Flask, versus the stateful nature of a notebook environment.

**Scenario 3: Lazy Evaluation and I/O Operations**

Let's say you have some code that involves a computationally expensive operation or a file I/O, and the output of that operation is used in subsequent steps.

```python
# Example.py

def load_data():
  # imagine this is a very expensive call
  print('Loading data...')
  data = range(10000)
  return list(data)


data = load_data()

def process_data(data):
  print("Processing data...")
  return sum(data)

processed_data = process_data(data)

```

In a notebook environment where the code is run sequentially, the `load_data()` function is only called once and its result will then be readily available for the `process_data()` function.

```python
# Jupyter Notebook
import Example
print(Example.processed_data)
```

Now, imagine integrating this into a Flask app.

```python
# Flask App Example
from flask import Flask
import Example
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/process')
def process_route():
    return str(Example.processed_data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Here, the `load_data()` and `process_data()` will only execute *once*, when the module is loaded when the Flask app starts up, and the final result is statically available to the endpoint. The code is no longer executed with every request. If `load_data()` were modified to depend on the request itself, we would again see different behavior. This could be mitigated, as with our previous examples, by moving the function calls inside of the handler:

```python
# Flask App Example
from flask import Flask
import Example
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/process')
def process_route():
    return str(Example.process_data(Example.load_data()))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

With this, the heavy computation will execute with each request, giving a similar feel as in the notebook where each cell was separately evaluated.

To deepen your understanding, I recommend exploring resources such as "Effective Computation in Physics" by Anthony Scopatz and Kathryn D. Huff for a thorough treatment of reproducible computational science. For a detailed examination of web application architecture, including state management, look into "Web Application Architecture: Principles, protocols and practices" by Leon Shkiler. Understanding the principles of serverless computing can also give more insight into request lifecycle management, such as "Serverless Architectures on AWS" by Peter Sbarski. These are all great references that can help illuminate the differences that arise from the inherent stateful/stateless natures of notebooks and web applications, respectively.

In summary, the reason why Jupyter notebook and Flask code can produce different results, even for the same code, is predominantly because of state management. Notebooks function as interactive and stateful environments, while Flask operates on a request-response model, making code execution stateless, by default. The three examples I provided illustrate common scenarios where this distinction leads to unexpected behavior, and by understanding these differences, you can build more robust and reliable applications.
