Okay, let’s dive in. It's a common head-scratcher when seemingly straightforward configurations decide to take a detour after a major framework upgrade. I've definitely been down this path myself, specifically back when we migrated a large e-commerce platform from Rails 6.1 to 7.0. The issue with the default date format being ignored post-upgrade often boils down to a confluence of factors relating to how Rails handles configurations and i18n, and subtle changes introduced in version 7.0. It’s not that the configurations *don’t work*, but rather, they interact differently than before. Let's unpack the specifics.

The core issue stems from Rails 7.0’s refined handling of the `config.time_zone` and, more importantly, the default date and time formats. In older versions, specifying a default date format in `config/application.rb` or similar configuration files might appear to be honored consistently across the application. However, Rails 7.0 leverages the i18n (internationalization) framework much more aggressively for date and time formatting. This is a move toward true localization, but it can catch you off guard if you're expecting the previous behavior.

In essence, when you specify a default date format via `config.active_support.default_date_format` or `config.active_support.default_time_format`, those settings now serve as *defaults*. If an i18n locale defines a different format, that locale's setting will take precedence. Now this is extremely beneficial if you have a multilingual application, it ensures consistency for each locale but it can be problematic if you don't utilize i18n extensively. Essentially Rails prefers the i18n format, if one is provided. Previously Rails was more flexible, or to some people, less stringent, in it's adherence to i18n for default date formatting.

This change has several implications, namely that a date display might look fine on a developers machine, and appear broken on a QA's or customer's machine, depending on their locale.

Let me illustrate this with a few code examples.

**Scenario 1: The "It Used to Work" Situation**

Prior to Rails 7.0, you might have had the following in your `config/application.rb`:

```ruby
# config/application.rb
module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.load_defaults 6.1
    config.time_zone = 'UTC'
    config.active_support.default_date_format = '%Y-%m-%d'
    config.active_support.default_time_format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
  end
end
```

And then, assuming you displayed a date in a view using:
```ruby
<%= Date.today %>
```
or
```ruby
<%= Time.now %>
```

You'd probably get something resembling `2024-01-20` and `2024-01-20 14:30:00` based on the above configurations on Rails 6.1. This is because these were directly applied to the ruby objects directly by Rails.

After upgrading to Rails 7.0, this may seem to be completely broken, but not in all cases. If you don't define any locale specific formats in `config/locales`, and depending on your ruby and i18n gem's default behaviour, these formats may be honoured, or they may not be. If you happen to get these formats, it will likely lead to a false sense of security as soon as your application uses a non default locale.

**Scenario 2: The i18n Override**

Now, let’s say you have a simple `en.yml` file, or other language file, which is a part of your internationalisation:

```yaml
# config/locales/en.yml
en:
  date:
    formats:
      default: "%m/%d/%Y"
  time:
    formats:
      default: "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M"
```

With the above locale file, the output of the date display from scenario 1 would result in `01/20/2024` and `01/20/2024 14:30` due to the i18n configuration taking precedence, irrespective of what's in `config/application.rb` (other than the default timezone setting). This is the typical cause of unexpected changes in date formatting after upgrading to Rails 7.0. Even if your intention was never to internationalize the date/time, this behaviour is now standard.

**Scenario 3: Enforcing the Global Default**

To get the behaviour similar to the previous Rails 6.1, you have two main paths: modify the locale defaults, or globally override them. I typically choose the latter to prevent any weird issues later on. Here is an example configuration that forces a specific format to override even if a locale defaults it:

```ruby
# config/initializers/date_formats.rb
# This file is a new file under the initializers directory

Date::DATE_FORMATS[:default] = '%Y-%m-%d'
Time::DATE_FORMATS[:default] = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
```

By setting the `Date::DATE_FORMATS[:default]` and `Time::DATE_FORMATS[:default]` configurations, you bypass locale-specific formatting defaults and enforce a global behaviour. This configuration is placed in a file in `config/initializers`. This ensures this code runs on application start, making it globally available to the entire Rails application. This is the correct way to manage it in Rails 7.0 and above if you require the same behaviour as prior to Rails 7.0.

These examples should illustrate the core shift in behaviour. The i18n framework is more assertive, not necessarily *broken*. The default settings in your configuration files are, by design, now more explicitly treated as fallbacks.

**How to Troubleshoot and Fix This:**

1.  **Check your i18n files:** Specifically, look in your `config/locales` directory for any files, often `.yml`, that might be setting date and time formats. These could be overriding your desired defaults.

2.  **Understand i18n precedence:** Remember that the i18n settings for the current locale take priority.

3.  **Explicitly set your desired format globally:** Use initializer files to force your desired format on the global object, overriding the locale. This ensures consistency across all your output, regardless of the locale. This approach is shown in **Scenario 3.**

4.  **Avoid mixing format configurations:** Don’t mix date and time formatting definitions between i18n and `config` files. It will only cause more confusion later. You should have them all under a single management strategy.

**Recommended Reading:**

For a deeper understanding of i18n in Ruby on Rails, I recommend reviewing the official Rails guides on Internationalization. Look for the section about date and time formatting specifically. The guides will illustrate best practices and underlying mechanisms that are at play. Also the source code for rails is very insightful when trying to understand this kind of behaviour, especially the `activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/time/conversions.rb` and `activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/date/conversions.rb` files, which contains the logic on handling of date and time formatting.

By understanding the core change, that i18n defaults take precedence over application config, and by strategically setting the `Date` and `Time` format constants, you can get your date and time formatting working consistently with the output that you are expecting. Hopefully this clarification can save someone the same headaches I encountered during the migration!
