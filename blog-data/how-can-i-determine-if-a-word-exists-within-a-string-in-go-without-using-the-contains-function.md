Alright, let's tackle this one. I remember vividly, back in the early days of a particularly challenging text processing project, needing to optimize exactly this scenario – finding if a specific word existed within a larger string, without relying on the straightforward `strings.Contains` function. We were processing massive text files, and even seemingly small performance gains added up quickly. The default string search wasn’t cutting it for us, so we had to get a little creative.

The `Contains` function, internally, often leverages efficient algorithms, but for specific use cases like needing exact word matching (and not partial matches like `contain` within `containing`), or if you were dealing with some peculiar edge case in your text data that the standard implementation didn't account for, you often need to roll your own. I’ve found that often, the "standard way" is good for 80% of cases, but the remaining 20% require something custom.

So, how can we achieve this in go? Well, let’s explore a few techniques. First, and likely the most basic, is string slicing and explicit comparison.

**Method 1: Explicit Looping and Slicing**

The core idea here is to iterate through the larger string, taking substrings of the same length as the target word and comparing them. This method is conceptually simple but requires a bit more manual work. Here’s the Go code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func wordExists(text, word string) bool {
    textLen := len(text)
    wordLen := len(word)

    if wordLen > textLen {
        return false // Word is longer than text
    }

    for i := 0; i <= textLen-wordLen; i++ {
        if text[i:i+wordLen] == word {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}

func main() {
    text := "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
    word1 := "fox"
    word2 := "cat"

    fmt.Printf("Does '%s' exist in the text? %t\n", word1, wordExists(text, word1))
    fmt.Printf("Does '%s' exist in the text? %t\n", word2, wordExists(text, word2))
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates the core mechanics: it walks through the main string, extracts a substring of the correct length at each position, and directly compares it to the target word. The loop condition `i <= textLen - wordLen` ensures that you don't attempt to create a slice that extends beyond the bounds of the original string. It avoids partial matches; it will only return `true` if the target word is present in its exact form within the text.

**Method 2: Utilizing `strings.Fields` for Word Boundary Detection**

This next technique relies on using `strings.Fields` to break the input string into separate words and then iterating over those individual words for comparison. It's a little more high-level than the previous method and relies on Go's `strings` package, just not the `Contains` method itself. It assumes, reasonably enough, that words are separated by spaces, tabs, and newlines which is a common pattern in text data.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func wordExistsFields(text, word string) bool {
	words := strings.Fields(text)
	for _, w := range words {
		if w == word {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}

func main() {
	text := "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, the dog"
	word1 := "fox"
    word2 := "dog,"
    word3 := "dog"


	fmt.Printf("Does '%s' exist in the text? %t\n", word1, wordExistsFields(text, word1))
	fmt.Printf("Does '%s' exist in the text? %t\n", word2, wordExistsFields(text, word2))
    fmt.Printf("Does '%s' exist in the text? %t\n", word3, wordExistsFields(text, word3))
}

```

Here we use `strings.Fields` to split the text into individual words based on white space. We then iterate through these individual words and perform simple equality checks. This will avoid partial matches, and also considers only 'words' as delimited by whitespace, so 'dog,' will be considered a different word to 'dog'.

**Method 3: Regular Expressions for More Sophisticated Matching**

For more complex scenarios like handling punctuation, or performing more flexible pattern matching, regular expressions provide a powerful alternative. They're often overkill for simple exact matching, but incredibly useful for scenarios where your text data is complex or includes punctuation, or if your "word" needs to match a specific pattern, such as having capitalization rules. This is generally more resource-intensive than the previous methods, but necessary for certain problems.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func wordExistsRegex(text, word string) bool {
    pattern := regexp.MustCompile(`\b` + regexp.QuoteMeta(word) + `\b`)
    return pattern.MatchString(text)
}

func main() {
    text := "The quick brown fox, jumps over the lazy dog; the dog."
    word1 := "fox"
    word2 := "dog"
    word3 := "the"


    fmt.Printf("Does '%s' exist in the text? %t\n", word1, wordExistsRegex(text, word1))
    fmt.Printf("Does '%s' exist in the text? %t\n", word2, wordExistsRegex(text, word2))
     fmt.Printf("Does '%s' exist in the text? %t\n", word3, wordExistsRegex(text, word3))
}
```

This snippet uses the `regexp` package, specifically `regexp.MustCompile` which precompiles the regular expression pattern for better efficiency when called multiple times. Crucially, the code uses `\b` to assert word boundaries in the regex pattern to ensure the matching only happens for full words, not parts of words, it also uses `regexp.QuoteMeta(word)` to escape the text of the 'word' to make sure that the word can contain characters which have special meaning in regular expressions. The `MatchString` then executes the match against the given string.

**Practical Considerations and Further Reading**

Choosing the best method depends heavily on your context. The first method, `explicit looping and slicing`, offers the lowest overhead for simple cases, while being simple enough to easily read, understand and adapt to more complicated scenarios. If you're operating on pure text with consistent spaces as word delimiters, then `strings.Fields` may be adequate and offer more readability. But, if you need more powerful pattern matching abilities or need to handle more complex text, regular expressions, via `regexp`, are extremely useful.

For those wanting to explore more about string searching algorithms, I would suggest “*Algorithms*” by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, particularly the sections covering string processing and pattern matching. Additionally, studying the source code of Go's `strings` package on Github can provide valuable insights into its internal operations and optimization strategies, even though we are avoiding the `Contains` functionality, other aspects of the library are directly relevant. For regular expressions, “*Mastering Regular Expressions*” by Jeffrey Friedl provides a comprehensive understanding. Also, the Go standard library documentation itself, particularly for the `strings` and `regexp` packages is extremely valuable.

Remember, optimization is iterative. The ‘best’ approach often depends on the specific data, patterns, and performance requirements of the application you’re developing. There’s no “one size fits all” answer and often, the simplest solution that is easy to read and understand might be sufficient for many use cases.
