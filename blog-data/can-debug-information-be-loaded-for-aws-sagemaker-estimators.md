Let's tackle this. I've certainly been down this road before, spending countless hours diagnosing issues in deployed SageMaker models, and the question of debugging information for estimators is crucial. The short answer is yes, but it’s not always straightforward. It depends heavily on how you’ve structured your training script and how you've configured your SageMaker environment. The challenge often arises from the inherent abstraction layer SageMaker provides—while incredibly useful for scaling and deployment, it can sometimes mask the granular details you'd typically have direct access to during local debugging.

The primary hurdle is the separation between the training code, which runs within the SageMaker managed environment, and your local development environment. Consequently, standard debugging techniques that rely on direct code access (think breakpoints in an IDE) often don't directly translate. However, this doesn't mean you're flying blind. There are strategic ways to glean meaningful debug information, leveraging various SageMaker features and some disciplined coding practices.

Fundamentally, understanding how your training script interacts with SageMaker is paramount. Your script, which SageMaker invokes during the training job, needs to log information in a manner that SageMaker can capture and present back to you. This isn't about magically injecting debuggers into a running container; it's about using the logging and monitoring infrastructure provided by the platform. We’ll cover ways to use these resources effectively.

One common practice is to liberally employ Python's built-in logging module throughout your training script. This is your primary means of communication from inside the training container to the outside world. SageMaker captures standard output and standard error streams; therefore, anything you log will be available via the CloudWatch Logs associated with your training job. This is the first line of defence in understanding what's going on. Let’s illustrate this.

```python
# example_logging.py

import logging
import time
import os

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def train():
    logging.info("Starting training process...")
    for epoch in range(3):
        logging.info(f"Epoch {epoch+1} beginning...")
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some work
        logging.info(f"Epoch {epoch+1} completed.")
    logging.info("Training process complete.")

    # Example of using environment variables
    if "SM_CHANNEL_TRAINING" in os.environ:
        training_dir = os.environ["SM_CHANNEL_TRAINING"]
        logging.info(f"Training data located at: {training_dir}")
    else:
         logging.warning("Environment variable SM_CHANNEL_TRAINING not set.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    train()
```

In this `example_logging.py`, we use the logging module to log various stages of the training process. We also show how to access environment variables (e.g. `SM_CHANNEL_TRAINING`) that SageMaker sets to provide access to training data, among other things, and how to debug their presence. When you run this script using a SageMaker estimator, all these log messages will be viewable in CloudWatch.

Here's how you would typically set up the estimator, assuming the script is located in a `src` directory:

```python
import sagemaker
from sagemaker.pytorch import PyTorch

# Define the entry point script
entry_point_script = 'example_logging.py'
training_source_dir = 'src'

# Define the estimator
estimator = PyTorch(
    entry_point=entry_point_script,
    source_dir=training_source_dir,
    framework_version='2.0.1',
    py_version='py310',
    instance_type='ml.m5.large',
    instance_count=1,
    role=sagemaker.get_execution_role()
)

estimator.fit()
```

Once this `estimator.fit()` method completes, or during its execution, you can inspect the logs in CloudWatch Logs under the specific log stream for your SageMaker training job. You'll see the log messages we've generated. That’s the first vital step: make sure your training code is verbose with its logging.

Another crucial aspect is using SageMaker's debugger capabilities. SageMaker Debugger provides more sophisticated introspection of the training process beyond standard log messages. It allows you to profile the execution and capture tensor values, which can be incredibly valuable for diagnosing performance bottlenecks or gradient anomalies. While it doesn't give you direct step-through debugging, it offers a window into the tensors, gradients, and other internal states of the model during training. Let's see a code example implementing tensor capture using `sagemaker.debugger`:

```python
# debug_tensor_capture.py
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import logging
import time
import os
import sagemaker_debugger

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

def train():

    logging.info("Starting debugging example...")
    model = SimpleNet()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

    # Create a dummy dataset
    X = torch.randn(100, 10)
    y = torch.randn(100, 2)

    for epoch in range(3):
        logging.info(f"Epoch {epoch+1} beginning...")
        for i in range(100):
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            output = model(X[i].unsqueeze(0))
            loss = loss_fn(output, y[i].unsqueeze(0))
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

            sagemaker_debugger.save_tensor(output, "output_tensor", os.path.join("/opt/ml/output/tensors", f"epoch_{epoch+1}_i_{i+1}"))

        logging.info(f"Epoch {epoch+1} completed.")
    logging.info("Debugging example complete.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    train()
```

Here, we've integrated `sagemaker_debugger.save_tensor()` to capture the `output` tensor at each step of the inner loop. The tensors are saved in `/opt/ml/output/tensors`, a location where the SageMaker debugger expects to find them. This data can be analyzed after training via the SageMaker debugger. Note the use of the `os.path.join()` which is important to create paths that are OS agnostic.

To use this with a SageMaker estimator, your `PyTorch` estimator creation would need to be slightly modified:

```python
import sagemaker
from sagemaker.pytorch import PyTorch
from sagemaker.debugger import DebuggerHookConfig, CollectionConfig

# Define the entry point script
entry_point_script = 'debug_tensor_capture.py'
training_source_dir = 'src'

# Define the debugger hook configuration
debugger_config = DebuggerHookConfig(
        hook_parameters={"save_interval": "1"},
        collection_configs=[CollectionConfig(name="output_tensors",
                                            parameters={"include_regex": "epoch"})]
    )

# Define the estimator with debugger configuration
estimator = PyTorch(
    entry_point=entry_point_script,
    source_dir=training_source_dir,
    framework_version='2.0.1',
    py_version='py310',
    instance_type='ml.m5.large',
    instance_count=1,
    role=sagemaker.get_execution_role(),
    debugger_hook_config=debugger_config
)

estimator.fit()
```

In this modified example, we are explicitly specifying the location of the saved tensors and also filtering by using a regular expression for their collection. The `DebuggerHookConfig` ensures that SageMaker is set up to capture these saved tensors for later analysis.

Finally, beyond basic logging and the debugger, it's important to be very careful about the code you're writing and ensure it's modular. Break your scripts down into small well-defined functions, make sure your data loading logic is sound and, ideally, tested locally. The more you can do to reduce the complexity of your training script, the less you'll have to debug in a remote environment. It is advisable to employ version control (e.g., Git) and adopt unit testing practices, as detailed in "Test-Driven Development: By Example" by Kent Beck, and the principles described in "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin. These methods help to prevent bugs and makes it easier to find and fix them.

In summary, while it's true that direct debugger attachment is typically not possible, effective debugging of SageMaker estimators is entirely achievable through comprehensive logging, the use of SageMaker Debugger, meticulous script design, and the application of robust coding methodologies. By combining these strategies, you’ll gain invaluable insight into your model's training process, enabling you to fine-tune performance and diagnose and resolve problems.
