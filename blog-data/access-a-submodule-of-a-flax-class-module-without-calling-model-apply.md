so you're asking how to get into a submodule of a Flax model without going through the whole `model.apply` rigmarole yeah I've been there done that got the t-shirt trust me it’s a common snag when you're digging deep into model internals especially if you are into debugging or doing surgery on the model’s guts.

Let’s be real `model.apply` is great for forward passes and it's all good when you're training or doing inference It handles all the plumbing nicely like updating batch norm stats managing rngs and so on. But sometimes you just need to peek at a specific submodule get at its parameters or inspect its inner workings without going through all of that.

So here's the deal you don't want to apply you just want to dive in directly. It is totally possible it’s all about accessing the model's `variables` dictionary directly. This dictionary holds the whole model's state parameter data batch norm stats the whole nine yards.

I remember a particularly painful debugging session back in my early days trying to figure out why my attention mechanism was spitting out garbage. I was going insane rerunning the entire model with `model.apply` just to print the output of a single layer. That was a bad time it wasted a lot of compute and more importantly a lot of my time. Then I realised I could just grab the module directly by its path and it made my life much easier.

 so let’s get to the meat of it. Let's say you have a model that looks something like this you have a class that holds other classes

```python
import flax.linen as nn
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

class InnerModule(nn.Module):
    @nn.compact
    def __call__(self, x):
        return nn.Dense(features=16)(x)

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    @nn.compact
    def __call__(self, x):
        x = nn.Dense(features=32)(x)
        inner_output = InnerModule()(x)
        return inner_output
```

So your issue is getting to the InnerModule submodule directly without running the whole model yeah? You want to see what its output would be or get the parameters that are associated with it. You want to avoid using the `model.apply()` right?

Here’s how you do it you’ve got the model you’ve initialised it with some dummy data now you want to go to that inner submodule.

First initialize the model as usual and grab a dummy input.

```python
key = jax.random.key(0)
dummy_input = jnp.ones((1, 10))  # Example input
model = MyModel()
variables = model.init(key, dummy_input)

```
So we now have the `variables` dictionary this contains all the state of the model including the parameters of all its modules. The trick is to dive into this dictionary. So let's say you want to access the `InnerModule` inside `MyModel`. This specific InnerModule we just constructed.

Now pay close attention:

```python
inner_module_params = variables['params']['InnerModule_0']
inner_module = InnerModule()

# Generate dummy data with the correct shape
inner_dummy_input = jnp.ones((1, 32))

# You will need to get the InnerModules parameters
# And create a new apply function for just the inner module

inner_apply = lambda params , x: inner_module.apply(
            {'params': params},x
        )


# Apply only to InnerModule
inner_output = inner_apply(inner_module_params, inner_dummy_input)
print(inner_output.shape) # prints (1,16) which is what we expect


```

See what I did there? We go into the `variables` dictionary find the params key which contains all the param values then we find the specific module InnerModule_0 you will have to be careful with the name because Flax automatically assign a number suffix when you have multiple layers of the same class. We then create a new apply function using `inner_apply` which does exactly what we need it applies only to the InnerModule without touching anything else.

Aha you might also want to access the parameters of the inner module you want the `kernel` and `bias` that we defined in the InnerModule. It's also quite straightforward. You can just use this:

```python

inner_module_kernel = variables['params']['InnerModule_0']['Dense_0']['kernel']
inner_module_bias = variables['params']['InnerModule_0']['Dense_0']['bias']

print(inner_module_kernel.shape) # prints (32, 16)
print(inner_module_bias.shape)  # prints (16,)

```

Again I am just traversing the `variables` dictionary to find the parameters. As you can see it is quite direct with the path you can also find the batch norm stats in a similar fashion. I had this very issue last week it took me 5 minutes to find that the weights were not initialised correctly. It wasn’t a big deal when I found it as I could just look up the parameter’s values directly. I didn’t need to rerun the whole model.

So that’s the lowdown I know it might look weird but it is the way to go when you are debugging or trying to understand how the model is working internally. Don't be afraid to print the dictionary and see what's in it this will help you a lot. The trick is always in the variables dictionary which holds the entire state of the model. This method is much more efficient than re-applying the model or trying to extract the outputs in the forward pass.

So resources I would recommend instead of links since we are doing the stackoverflow format:

*   **"Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet:** While it uses Keras it does a solid job explaining how these model structures are created and how they work which helps a lot in understanding how Flax models are built.

*   **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn Keras and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron:** Gives you a good grasp of how neural networks are built from the ground up which is quite useful especially when you're digging into the nuts and bolts of Flax models.

*   **"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop:** It is the bible of machine learning. If you want to understand the mathematics behind all of this it will guide you through all of the details. A bit overkill but very helpful if you really want to know your stuff.

*   **Flax documentation:** Not a book but the official flax documentation is your best friend it has all the details about how Flax works from the ground up and I guarantee if you spend enough time reading it you will become a Flax god.

so that’s how you do it you got it? Now go forth and debug your models without the `model.apply()` shackles. Oh and one last thing I nearly forgot why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn’t get arrays hahaha.
