,  Input shapes for 2d convolutional neural networks, especially when dealing with real-world scenarios, aren't always as straightforward as the textbook examples might suggest. I remember a project a few years back where we were classifying satellite imagery for urban planning – a classic 2d image processing problem – and getting the input shape *just so* was pivotal to the network performing well. We had to move past the usual RGB setup and consider a broader range of factors, and that’s what I'll discuss here.

When we’re talking about 2d cnns, the input shape generally takes the form of (height, width, channels). This might seem simple enough, but the devil is, as always, in the details. The height and width represent the spatial dimensions of your input data – the image itself in many cases. The ‘channels’ dimension, however, holds slightly more nuance. For a color image, this is typically 3, representing red, green, and blue (rgb). But what if you have grayscale images? Or, as we did with the satellite data, multi-spectral data?

First and foremost, the height and width of your input should, where possible, match the dimensions of the images you intend to feed into the model. You could, of course, resize or crop images, but resizing can introduce artifacts, and cropping can lose crucial spatial information. If you are feeding the model batches of variable-sized images, you must do pre-processing. In practice, this often means resizing all images to a fixed size, which might mean choosing a common size (e.g., 256x256, 128x128, or some other dimensions). We often found ourselves experimenting here since higher resolution doesn't always equal better performance and drastically increases computational costs. The chosen height and width are crucial parameters to be consistent.

The 'channels' dimension requires a different approach altogether. The satellite project I mentioned used multi-spectral imagery, not just the typical three rgb channels. This involved near-infrared, shortwave infrared, and other spectral bands. These bands, each capturing information at different wavelengths, provided crucial details about vegetation health, water bodies, and other features that were essential for classification. So, we ended up with more than three channels in that particular case.

Similarly, if your input data isn’t visual data, or if you are augmenting your visual data with supplementary channels, you will need to consider how to incorporate these. Think about a medical scenario, with x-rays or MRI data. An x-ray will likely be grayscale, so one channel. However, an MRI could have multiple channels (sequences), each capturing a different signal of the human body. You must carefully consider the features encoded within each 'channel' and plan accordingly.

Now, let's move to some concrete examples. I’ll use python with the popular pytorch framework, which allows flexibility in defining these shapes:

```python
# example 1: standard RGB image input

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleRGBCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleRGBCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3)
        # ... other layers ...

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        # ... other operations ...
        return x

# Example input: batch of 4 images, each with 128x128 pixels and 3 RGB channels
input_tensor_rgb = torch.randn(4, 3, 128, 128)
model_rgb = SimpleRGBCNN()
output_tensor_rgb = model_rgb(input_tensor_rgb)

print(f"Output shape from RGB model: {output_tensor_rgb.shape}")

```
In this first example, we define a simple cnn that expects an rgb image. Notice the `in_channels` is set to 3 to accommodate the three colour channels. The input tensor is shaped `(batch_size, channels, height, width)`, in this case, `(4, 3, 128, 128)`. This is the standard representation for image data in PyTorch and other similar libraries.

Now let’s consider a scenario where we are working with grayscale images.

```python
# Example 2: grayscale image input

class SimpleGrayscaleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleGrayscaleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=1, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3)
        # ... other layers ...

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        # ... other operations ...
        return x

# Example input: batch of 4 images, each with 128x128 pixels and 1 grayscale channel
input_tensor_gray = torch.randn(4, 1, 128, 128)
model_gray = SimpleGrayscaleCNN()
output_tensor_gray = model_gray(input_tensor_gray)
print(f"Output shape from grayscale model: {output_tensor_gray.shape}")
```

Here, our input only has one channel; the `in_channels` is changed to `1`. This is a very common scenario when dealing with things like x-rays or depth maps.

Finally, let's look at how we could handle the situation from my satellite imagery project:
```python
# Example 3: multi-spectral image input

class MultiSpectralCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MultiSpectralCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=7, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3) # 7 channels for multi-spectral data
        # ... other layers ...

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        # ... other operations ...
        return x

# Example input: batch of 4 images, each with 128x128 pixels and 7 spectral channels
input_tensor_multispectral = torch.randn(4, 7, 128, 128)
model_multispectral = MultiSpectralCNN()
output_tensor_multispectral = model_multispectral(input_tensor_multispectral)
print(f"Output shape from multi-spectral model: {output_tensor_multispectral.shape}")

```

In this third example, we are dealing with seven channels of data; the `in_channels` parameter reflects the added input from the multi-spectral data. It is crucial to ensure the number of channels matches what your data actually contains, or your code will fail.

In summary, choosing the correct input shape for your 2d cnn is not just about the dimensions of the spatial data; it's also about how you represent and organize the informational content within each channel. For further reading on this topic, I strongly recommend delving into "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, especially the chapters covering convolutional networks and input handling. Additionally, the papers related to specific applications of cnns to imagery (such as remote sensing and medical imaging), which are commonly available on IEEE or ACM digital libraries, will offer a wealth of practical insight. Understanding the nuances of your data and appropriately framing the input tensors is paramount for successful model development. These small adjustments often result in a considerable difference in your model’s performance.
