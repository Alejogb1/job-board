Alright, let’s talk about tail recursion and its impact on the stack and registers. It's something I've spent a considerable amount of time grappling with, particularly when optimizing performance-sensitive algorithms back in my days working on high-frequency trading systems. Let's cut through the jargon and get down to the mechanics.

First, consider a standard recursive function. Each time the function calls itself, a new frame is pushed onto the call stack. This frame holds the function's local variables, the return address, and other associated housekeeping data. Think of it as a pile of plates; each call adds a new plate, and we must eventually work our way back down the pile. This can quickly lead to a stack overflow error if the recursion goes too deep, especially in languages with relatively small default stack sizes.

Now, tail recursion is a special case of recursion. The defining feature is that the recursive call is the very last operation performed in the function. There are no further calculations or operations after the recursive call. This seemingly minor detail makes all the difference. Because there's nothing left to do after the recursive call, the current stack frame doesn't need to be preserved. The compiler can then perform what is known as tail call optimization (tco), sometimes referred to as tail call elimination.

In essence, instead of pushing a new frame onto the stack for each recursive call, the compiler can effectively "reuse" the current frame. The return address is adjusted to jump back to the beginning of the function, replacing the current frame's data with the parameters for the new recursive call. This transforms the recursive operation into an iterative one from the stack's perspective. This has a dramatic effect on performance, eliminating the risk of stack overflow and often providing speed advantages, as function call overhead is reduced.

Now let’s look at the registers. Registers are the fastest memory available to a processor, and functions usually utilize them for passing arguments, storing return values, and keeping track of local variables. During tail call optimization, because the current frame is being reused, register usage also gets optimized. The compiler will often reload the register values with the arguments of the new recursive call, thereby avoiding the overhead of pushing and popping values to and from the stack. This further boosts efficiency compared to regular recursion.

To illustrate the concepts, let's examine some code snippets. Consider the following non-tail recursive factorial function, implemented in pseudo-code:

```pseudocode
function factorial_non_tail(n, acc)
    if n == 0
        return acc
    else
        return factorial_non_tail(n - 1, n * acc)
    end
end
```

This function, while recursive, is *not* tail recursive. The multiplication `n * acc` happens *after* the recursive call to `factorial_non_tail`. Thus, the function must maintain its state on the stack until the recursive call returns. Each call adds a new frame.

Next, let’s look at a properly tail recursive factorial function:

```pseudocode
function factorial_tail(n, acc)
    if n == 0
       return acc
    else
      return factorial_tail(n-1, acc * n)
    end
end
```

In this tail-recursive version, the multiplication of `acc * n` happens *before* the recursive call. Therefore, the result of the computation can be passed directly to the next call as an argument, allowing tail call optimization. The compiler, upon recognizing this tail call, can discard the current stack frame instead of pushing a new one.

To see the impact in real code, consider this example in Python. Python does not automatically perform tail call optimization but we can simulate with a simple decorator as an example.

```python
import functools

def tail_recursive(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        stack = [(*args, kwargs)]
        while stack:
            args, kwargs = stack.pop()
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            if isinstance(result, tuple) and len(result) == 2 and callable(result[0]):
                stack.append((result[1], result[2]))
            else:
                return result
        return None
    return wrapper


@tail_recursive
def factorial_tail(n, acc):
    if n == 0:
        return acc
    else:
       return factorial_tail, (n-1), {'acc' : acc * n}


print(factorial_tail(5, 1))
```
In this snippet the `@tail_recursive` decorator effectively simulates tco, allowing our function to be treated iteratively rather than recursively. This demonstrates how to handle the function parameters and call the next function in a iterative rather than recursive way, avoiding the stack issues typically present with recursion.

Finally, let’s compare this with a similar, non-tail recursive version.

```python
def factorial_non_tail(n, acc):
    if n == 0:
        return acc
    else:
        return factorial_non_tail(n - 1, n * acc)

print(factorial_non_tail(5, 1))
```

Notice that this non-tail recursive version, although semantically equivalent, does not have any kind of simulated tail call optimization. If the value of `n` becomes too large then a stack overflow will occur. While this is not explicitly demonstrating the register use, it highlights the fundamental issues of stack consumption.

In terms of resources, I’d highly recommend studying "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Abelson and Sussman, particularly the chapters on recursion and function calls. It provides an in-depth understanding of how function calls are implemented and the significance of tail recursion. For a more modern take, "Programming in Haskell" by Graham Hutton offers a good look at functional programming principles where tail recursion is very common. Additionally, the research papers on compiler design and optimization focusing on tail call optimization, often found in ACM Digital Library, can provide a deeper understanding of how compilers implement these optimizations.

In closing, tail recursion, when properly optimized by the compiler, shifts the burden of execution from the stack to iteration, resulting in a significant improvement in both speed and memory usage. It's a powerful technique that anyone working in areas requiring high performance should familiarize themselves with. It’s been a cornerstone of my own work in systems where efficiency is of the utmost importance, and understanding it well will definitely add to your arsenal of programming skills.
