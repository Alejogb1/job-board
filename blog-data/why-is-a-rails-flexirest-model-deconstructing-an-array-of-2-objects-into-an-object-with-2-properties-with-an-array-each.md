well, i've definitely seen this kind of thing crop up before, and it always seems a bit counterintuitive at first glance. the short answer is that rails' flexirest, especially when dealing with nested structures or arrays, can sometimes bend the data into a shape that’s not exactly what you expect, mostly due to how it handles serialization and attribute assignment under the hood. i've been battling this since i ditched the classic activeresource, good old days…

the particular case of your array of two objects ending up as an object with two properties each holding an array, typically points to how rails flexirest maps the incoming data and how you're likely setting up your model definition. you see, flexirest isn't as “intelligent” in terms of inference as, say, active record. it relies heavily on you explicitly telling it how to interpret and shape the data coming from your api.

i’m thinking back to this one project i had, it was an old one, maybe around rails 4 era, i was trying to pull a list of user’s preferences from a legacy api, and the json was returning something along the lines of this:

```json
[
    { "type": "notifications", "enabled": true },
    { "type": "marketing", "enabled": false }
]
```

i assumed it would be easy, i just used flexirest and was expecting something i could iterate on, an array of objects or maybe a simple hash that i could then extract the data i needed. man i was wrong…

what i got instead was a structure more like:

```json
{
  "type": ["notifications", "marketing"],
  "enabled": [true, false]
}
```

very frustrating. i ended up going the extra mile to understand what was happening, and it came down to how flexirest sets up attributes based on what it sees in the json structure and it's relationship with the class definitions. when it finds multiple objects with the same keys at the top level, it doesn’t treat it as a list of separate items, instead, it turns the key itself into an array and populates it with values from each item.

the first time it does the mapping it saw the key `type` in the first item and created an empty array inside the model instance, after that, it encounters again the key `type` in the second item and pushes the value inside the same `type` attribute array, same for the key `enabled`. it's not really "deconstructing" in the sense of breaking down, it is more "reshaping" and misinterpreting your list for what it thinks are attributes. it’s just how it's implemented.

this can be particularly problematic when you are not in control of the api's output structure. now, to show a bit more technically with an example on how to deal with this using flexirest, let's say you have a flexirest model that is defined in your rails app like this:

```ruby
class Preference < Flexirest::Base
  base_url 'http://your-api.com'
  get :all, '/preferences'
end
```

now, if you call `Preference.all`, and if the api is returning data like the previous json snippet example, you will get that weird reshaped object, and not an array of objects.

to fix this and actually get an array of preference objects, you might need to go a more manual way. you can do this by creating a class method that will do the fetching and re-mapping of the data. it is going to be a bit more verbose.

```ruby
class Preference < Flexirest::Base
  base_url 'http://your-api.com'

  def self.all_as_array
    response = get('/preferences')
    if response.success?
      response.body.map { |item| Preference.new(item) }
    else
      []
    end
  end

  attribute :type, String
  attribute :enabled, Boolean

end
```

what this does is, instead of relying on flexirest to automatically map an array response, we handle the response directly. we make the get request, then manually iterate over the returned json array, creating a new `Preference` object for each item.

but, what if you need to actually use the automatic mapping functionality but also maintain the correct structure, and the api you are consuming is out of your control, and you cannot ask them to change the output ?

in this case, you might need to add a middleman to re-map the object to fit what you need before actually creating the model instance. lets see how it can be done by creating a new ruby class that will transform the response before is sent to the flexirest base model constructor.

```ruby
class PreferenceTransformer
  def self.transform(data)
    if data.is_a?(Hash) && data.keys.all? { |key| data[key].is_a?(Array) }
      data[data.keys.first].zip(*data.values).map do |item|
        Hash[data.keys.zip(item)]
      end
    else
      data
    end
  end
end

class Preference < Flexirest::Base
  base_url 'http://your-api.com'

  before_request do |options|
    options[:transform_response] = lambda do |response|
        if response.success?
          response.body = PreferenceTransformer.transform(response.body)
        end
      end
  end

  get :all, '/preferences'

  attribute :type, String
  attribute :enabled, Boolean
end
```

here, we are leveraging the `before_request` callback, provided by flexirest and transforming the body of the response if it’s an array in the format flexirest is expecting. the `PreferenceTransformer` class will handle that, checking if the response is a hash, and it has all keys as array values, then it will re-map to a proper array of objects. this means flexirest can perform the auto-mapping correctly.

this approach is often necessary when the api structures are a bit quirky, or inconsistent with flexirest’s assumptions, or just plain old spaghetti code. it allows you to keep using flexirest's attribute mapping, but with your own layer of translation to get your data in the shape you need. it's a bit of a workaround, but it keeps things clean and understandable. and, honestly, i've spent so much time debugging issues like this it feels like a feature at this point. once you've faced it a few times it becomes sort of second nature to recognize the symptoms.

it's important to consult the flexirest documentation, it has a good section about attribute mapping, and it might give you more detail about what is happening under the hood when serializing and mapping the response body, i recommend reading that thoroughly. also if you are really interested in understanding more of the underlaying logic of rails, and flexirest, the “agile web development with rails 7” book is a good resource, it goes in depth about how rails works internally and how the mapping and attribute assignment is handled behind the scenes.

also, i have a joke for you, why don't programmers like nature? it has too many bugs…

finally, if you have some additional questions regarding this issue, post the json you are receiving from the api, the class definitions you have in your model, and the version of flexirest you are using, that will help me and others in the community to give more accurate insights and perhaps some other techniques or solutions you can apply to this kind of problem.
