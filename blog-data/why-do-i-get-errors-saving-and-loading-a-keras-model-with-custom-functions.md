Alright, let's tackle this. I've seen this particular issue trip up many developers, and honestly, it's a recurring theme even in projects I've worked on. Saving and loading Keras models, especially those incorporating custom functions, requires a bit more care than the standard procedures for simpler models. The core problem stems from how Keras serializes models— it predominantly deals with the built-in Keras layers and functions, and struggles when it encounters something it doesn't recognize. This often leads to errors during either the saving or loading process, because these custom bits are not part of the standard graph representation.

My past experience involved a large-scale image analysis project where we had implemented a complex custom loss function incorporating several non-trivial calculations. The initial attempt to serialize the model using `model.save()` and `keras.models.load_model()` failed spectacularly, precisely because of the custom loss function. We ended up spending a fair amount of time debugging and exploring the proper methods to get things to work smoothly.

The underlying mechanism at play here is that Keras models are saved as HDF5 or SavedModel files, which contain a graph representation of the network, its weights, and other associated metadata. When you define a custom function— be it a custom layer, a custom metric, or a custom loss function— that function's python code isn't inherently part of this graph. Keras only stores the *name* of the function, which during loading needs to be mapped back to the actual python object it refers to. If Keras doesn’t know how to do this mapping, you encounter problems. There are a few main culprits in these scenarios and I’ll address them:

1.  **Missing Custom Object Definition:** The most frequent mistake is failing to properly tell Keras how to interpret the custom function when loading a saved model. The `load_model()` function has an optional `custom_objects` argument for this purpose, which is basically a dictionary mapping the *name* of the custom function to the function *object itself*. Without this mapping, Keras throws a `ValueError` because it can't find the function it needs.

2.  **Incorrect Scope or Definition:** Sometimes, the problem isn't necessarily a missing definition, but the scope where the custom function is defined. If the custom function is inside a class, or defined locally in a scope, it might not be properly recognized by the loading mechanism. The function must be globally accessible at the time of the loading.

3.  **Serialization Issues with Lambda Functions:** While lambda functions are convenient for quick and short definitions, they can be notoriously difficult to serialize and load because Keras struggles to reconstruct the underlying code structure. Therefore, while they can work in some cases, it's usually better practice to explicitly define custom functions as regular Python functions to avoid serialization issues, especially for more complex logic.

Let's illustrate this with some practical examples. First, I’ll demonstrate a broken implementation which will highlight the initial issues and then improve upon them with correct techniques.

**Example 1 (Incorrect implementation):**

This example will show you the issue where no custom function mapping is provided.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def custom_loss_function(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# compile with our custom loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss_function)

# Create dummy data
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Train model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0)

# Save model
model.save('custom_model_broken.h5')

# Attempt to load the model, this will raise a ValueError
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_model_broken.h5') # Error happens here
```

This code will save the model successfully but will throw an error on the `load_model()` line because it does not know how to map the function name to a python object on load.

**Example 2 (Correct implementation using the custom_objects parameter):**

This example fixes the prior code by providing the required mapping during load.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def custom_loss_function(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))


# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# compile with our custom loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss_function)

# Create dummy data
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)


# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0)

# Save model
model.save('custom_model_fixed.h5')

# Load the model with custom object mapping
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_model_fixed.h5',
                                      custom_objects={'custom_loss_function': custom_loss_function})
```

As you can observe, the error is resolved when we provide the `custom_objects` argument. This is essentially telling Keras, “hey, when you see the name 'custom_loss_function' in the saved model, this is the python function I want you to use for it."

**Example 3 (Correct implementation with a Custom Layer):**

Here is an example of a custom layer demonstrating the same pattern

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class CustomDenseLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomDenseLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                               initializer='random_normal',
                               trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                               initializer='zeros',
                               trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b


model = keras.Sequential([
    CustomDenseLayer(10, input_shape=(5,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Create dummy data
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Train model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0)

# Save model
model.save('custom_layer_model.h5')

# Load model and remap the custom layer
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_layer_model.h5',
                                        custom_objects={'CustomDenseLayer': CustomDenseLayer})
```

This demonstrates the same principle applied to a custom layer.

For further exploration, I recommend reviewing the official Keras documentation on model saving and loading, especially the sections that discuss custom layers and functions. Also, consider looking into the TensorFlow SavedModel format for more advanced serialization techniques, which often offer better portability. Papers from the TensorFlow team on the design of Keras and its model serialization mechanisms are also very valuable. Finally, the book "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet (the creator of Keras) provides excellent insights into how Keras works under the hood. These will definitely help deepen your understanding and make dealing with these kinds of issues much smoother. Remember, meticulousness in properly defining, mapping, and storing your custom functions will help prevent many common headaches down the line when working with complex Keras models.
