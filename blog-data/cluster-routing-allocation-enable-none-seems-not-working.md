so you're seeing "cluster routing allocation enable none" not doing what you expect right Classic. Been there done that got the t-shirt and the debugging scars to prove it. Let me lay it out because this is a common pitfall and I’ve debugged this thing more times than I’d like to admit.

First thing's first when you say "not working" let's be precise here. What are you seeing exactly are the routes still being allocated are you getting error messages is it just silence? It's really crucial to pin down the *specific* behavior that deviates from what you expect. Details people details that's what debuggers crave.

I’m gonna guess here because you know the internet and we’re on it. You probably intend to disable automatic route allocation completely by using `cluster routing allocation enable none`. That's a logical enough reading of the manual page. The issue though is that often this setting by itself isn't enough if the cluster has already allocated routes or if there are other underlying mechanisms still trying to perform route assignment. It's like telling your overly enthusiastic neighbor you don't want any more free vegetables they still drop them off at 7 AM every morning.

My experience usually points to a combination of factors you’ll need to address. First the cluster may have already allocated routes. This means that even if you use `enable none` now it won't retract the routes previously assigned. Think of it like a building contractor if you ask them to not do something after they already completed it is very difficult for them to take it back. Second sometimes internal cluster management agents or other plugins may have their own mechanisms for routing which may bypass or overwrite your settings that are using the common API. We have to remember that these tools are complicated and are build by complex systems and teams. Third there could be some kind of race condition where routes are assigned just before your `enable none` command takes effect. All these need to be considered when you ask for help.

So what's the usual procedure I’ve adopted after banging my head on this particular wall multiple times?

First we check existing routes. Run this command using your cluster interface:
```bash
# Example command to check current routes
get_cluster_routes --all --output json
```

This should show you all current routes. Look at the output. Are there still allocated routes and if yes note them down. Sometimes the problem is not what you think it is but something different is going on.

If you have routes which you are trying to remove you need to specifically tell it to remove them.
```bash
# Example command to delete existing routes
delete_cluster_route --route_id <route_id>
```
You'll need to iterate this command for each route you wanna kill until nothing is left.

The next critical piece here is the timing and the order of operations. You want to make sure that you first nuke all routes and then immediately set the allocation to `none`. If there is a delay some cluster automation will sneak in and re-allocate routes.
```bash
# Example sequence of commands
delete_cluster_route --all # or iterate through all routes as above
cluster routing allocation enable none
```
This usually solves half of the problems. If it doesnt here is the next steps to try.

Now this bit is a little trickier and it usually implies that something internally is trying to reallocate them and it ignores the cluster API to do it. So its overriding what you just told to happen. So you might need to go deeper into the cluster configs to find what is creating these routes. If you're using some proprietary system this can be painful. If you’re using something more standard or open sourced check its configuration files for parameters related to automatic allocation. Look for default routing policies or automated scripts that handle allocation. Some times there are parameters like `auto_route` or `enable_automatic_routing` that can be disabled. If you don't do this you might still see routes being allocated even when everything else is set up correctly.

Another potential culprit are cluster plugins or add-ons. Sometimes they have their own internal state management systems which are not synced with the master settings. I remember one time a plugin was actually managing routes completely separately and there was nothing I could do until I shut down that plugin and then set all the API configurations. I wish I could forget that. It was the day I learn more about internal cluster operation than I ever wanted to. So try and figure out which plugins or extensions could be interacting with the cluster routes. Deactivate them and then set the allocation to none. If this helps then you know you have a plugin issue that you need to deep dive into.

A few debugging tips for this situation that I’ve discovered the hard way:

First always check the cluster logs. Look for anything related to routing allocation. Error messages are gold in situations like these. Most cluster software logs its API calls and routing process steps. So be sure to search for the specific keywords. Use your intuition and search for the events that could be related to it. Search for events of allocation events of route creations or deletion errors or basically any entry that could be related to this. If the cluster is having trouble doing what you want to do you will often find a log with the details of what the problem is or why the issue is happening.

Second I usually use more verbose logging which can be enabled on the fly to understand which calls are being made behind the scenes. I typically use debug mode flags when making API calls. This helps me to better understand the internal behavior of the cluster and understand why the route is allocated even if the configuration asks for none to be allocated.

Third and this is something people forget always check the configuration files. Sometimes there are default configurations or even hidden configurations that are set in files in the system configuration paths. Check files that end with `*.conf` or `*.yaml` or `*.json` or any of the other usual suspects. Look for something that is telling the cluster to always enable routes when it starts up. It is important to check both config files of the cluster and any of the plugins that are enabled.

Ok one joke I promise: Why do programmers prefer dark mode because light attracts bugs. Ok back to debugging.

If after all of this you’re still seeing issues then you might need to do deeper debugging. It's possible that you've uncovered a bug in the cluster itself or its routing management system. In such cases you'll need to be very detailed and rigorous in your approach. Document everything you’re doing so that it can be replicated and understood.

Resources for digging deeper:
* The official cluster documentation is always your first stop. Read the manual from cover to cover if needed.
* Look for the RFC or IETF specification documents if they are available for the routing protocol you are using.
* There are also some good papers on distributed system routing algorithms especially if your cluster uses specific routing algorithm.
* Books on distributed system design and networking can help you build a more solid understanding of the concepts in play. Try “Distributed Systems Concepts and Design” by George Coulouris et al. or "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" by Kurose and Ross.

So yeah it's a complex problem but typically it is one of the reasons described above. You need to dig in to your specific case and do all these things to try and isolate the issue and ultimately understand why it is happening.

Good luck with the debugging and let me know if you have more details I can help you even more. Be specific when you are debugging and give all possible information so I can better help you.
