Let's unpack this question, because it touches on some crucial aspects of model training lifecycle management. I've seen first-hand the problems that arise when this isn't properly understood, specifically during a project involving a complex neural network for time-series anomaly detection back in '18. We were continually retraining with new data and different objectives, and had to develop a very rigorous methodology to avoid some common pitfalls. So, to address the core of your question: *does interrupting and retraining a model with new callbacks reset its weights?* The answer is not a simple yes or no; it’s nuanced and depends on how the interruption and retraining are implemented within the machine learning framework you're using.

The primary factor isn't really *the* callbacks themselves. Callbacks, in most libraries like TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch, are primarily functions that execute during training at specific points — think the start of an epoch, end of a batch, or after training concludes. They don't directly manipulate the model's weights, unless you program them to do so explicitly. What *does* influence weight resetting is how you handle the model instance and the training process during interruptions.

Here's a breakdown of common scenarios and how they relate to weight retention:

**Scenario 1: Continual Training with the Original Model Instance**

In this setup, you've initially trained a model (let's call it `model_a`). Then, you stop training, potentially modify the callbacks (say, add a `ModelCheckpoint` callback to save intermediate models), and then resume training with `model_a`. Crucially, you are using the same model instance. If you've saved no checkpoint and are working with the in-memory instance, then no, the weights are not reset. The training process will continue from the point it was stopped. The new callbacks will simply be executed alongside the already present ones. You aren't *re-initializing* anything that pertains to the model's structure or current state, just continuing an existing learning trajectory.

Here's a simplified, illustrative code example using TensorFlow/Keras:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Assume we have a dataset and model creation process defined elsewhere

def create_model():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model


# Initial training
model_a = create_model()
# Sample input and labels for dummy training
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
model_a.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, verbose=0)


# Interrupt and modify callbacks
checkpoint_callback = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(filepath='my_checkpoint.h5',
                                                     save_best_only=True)
callbacks = [checkpoint_callback] # new list of callbacks, not necessarily additive


# Resume training, same model instance and new callbacks
model_a.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, verbose=0, callbacks=callbacks)

# The model’s weights are now further updated from their state after the first 2 epochs.
# No reset occurred.
```

**Scenario 2: Loading from a Saved Checkpoint**

In this scenario, you train `model_a`, save its state (weights, optimizer state, etc.) to disk using a `ModelCheckpoint` callback or explicit saving methods, and subsequently load the model back, creating, in effect, a new `model_b` from the saved checkpoint, but not a new training process. The model's structure is identical to `model_a`, but with parameters from disk at a specific training step. Then, you might resume training `model_b` with modified callbacks. Again, the weights *will not be reset* to their initial random values, they are the weights that were saved on disk. You're effectively continuing the training where you left off, but possibly with a different set of callbacks that are now active.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Assume we have a dataset and model creation process defined elsewhere
def create_model():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
# Initial training and saving
model_a = create_model()
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
model_a.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, verbose=0)
model_a.save_weights('initial_weights.h5') # Save the state of the model


# Load from saved checkpoint
model_b = create_model()
model_b.load_weights('initial_weights.h5') # Load the weights into a new model
checkpoint_callback = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(filepath='my_checkpoint.h5',
                                                     save_best_only=True)
callbacks = [checkpoint_callback] # new list of callbacks, not necessarily additive

# Resume training, new model instance but with loaded weights and new callbacks
model_b.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, verbose=0, callbacks=callbacks)
# The model weights are updated from the loaded initial_weights.h5.

```

**Scenario 3: Creating a New Model Instance**

This is the scenario where you might expect a reset, and this is where you’ll get it. You train `model_a`, perhaps save its weights, and then, instead of loading those weights, you create a *completely new* model instance (let's call it `model_c`), and then begin the training. This will re-initialize the weights to their starting random values. Any previous weights, including those saved from `model_a`, will *not* be used, even if you add a checkpoint callback. If you don't load weights after creating the model instance, any subsequent training will begin at a *random* initialization, not a loaded or persisted state. You are starting anew.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def create_model():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Initial training
model_a = create_model()
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
model_a.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, verbose=0)
model_a.save_weights('initial_weights.h5')

# Create a NEW model instance
model_c = create_model() # New instance completely random initialized weights
checkpoint_callback = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(filepath='my_checkpoint.h5',
                                                     save_best_only=True)
callbacks = [checkpoint_callback]

# Resume training with new instance, random initial weights with new callbacks
model_c.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, verbose=0, callbacks=callbacks) # model starts with random weights
# The model weights are updated from the random initial values.

```

**Key takeaway:**

The critical factor is not about modifying the list of callbacks. It’s about whether you create a *new* model instance from a random initialization or if you are continuing on with a saved, partially trained, model or its in-memory instance. If you retain the model instance or reload weights explicitly from a saved state, no reset occurs; you continue learning. If you create a new model instance without loading existing weights, then all weights are indeed reset.

For in-depth understanding of model training behavior, I strongly recommend exploring the official documentation of your chosen machine learning library, such as TensorFlow's documentation for `tf.keras.Model` and its callbacks, or PyTorch's documentation regarding the training loop and saving/loading models. A good supplementary text would be *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. While the book does not focus specifically on this "resume" scenario, it provides essential background for building a clear model and how weight initialization, saving, and loading should be approached and understood. Understanding the underlying mechanics will prove indispensable in avoiding accidental re-initializations and maintaining training continuity. Also, delve into research papers focusing on incremental and continual learning as many methodologies address similar challenges.
