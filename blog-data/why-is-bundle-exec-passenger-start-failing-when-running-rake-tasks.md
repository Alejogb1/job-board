Alright, let's address this. I've seen this scenario play out more times than I care to count, and usually, it boils down to subtle environmental mismatches between how your Rake tasks are invoked and how Phusion Passenger expects things to be set up. When `bundle exec passenger start` fails when running Rake tasks, it isn’t typically Passenger itself that's broken; rather, it's usually about how the gem environment and the application’s runtime are being coordinated.

Here's the thing: Passenger manages the application environment very specifically. When it starts, it loads the application with a very particular set of environment variables and gem paths, essentially creating a sandboxed context. Rake tasks, on the other hand, often rely on the shell's environment and your system's gem configuration, particularly when you run them directly. This difference is where the issues start to creep in.

The root cause is generally that Passenger, when executing, does not inherently source the bash profile (or zshrc, if you're into that sort of thing) which might set up your ruby paths and gems paths as they should be. Instead, it builds its environment based on what it perceives within the Gemfile.lock, bundler itself and the system setup. Now, if your rake tasks rely on gems installed system-wide or otherwise not included in your Gemfile, you're heading for a problem. Furthermore, using non-standard gem paths that are configured only via your shell rc files is a very common culprit.

Think back a couple of years to a project I was working on where we had some really specific Rake tasks for asset preprocessing. It took me nearly half a day to figure out why those tasks were failing with `bundle exec passenger start`. The crucial issue was that some of the Rake task dependencies were installed into a user-specific gem path rather than as part of the application's bundler environment. Running `rake my_task` locally worked fine, but Passenger failed because it was using its own, sanitized environment. The solution was to ensure everything was consistently configured under bundler's jurisdiction.

Here are the typical situations and solutions i've found to overcome these issues:

**1. Missing Gem Dependencies:**

The most common reason is that the gems required by your Rake tasks aren't explicitly listed in your `Gemfile`. Even though your tasks may function when run from the shell (because system gems are available), Passenger operates within its carefully managed gem environment.

**Solution:** Make sure all necessary gems are specified in your `Gemfile`. This includes development dependencies that you may think are trivial but are actually being utilized within your rake task.

*Example Code Snippet:*

```ruby
# Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '~> 7.0'
gem 'pg'
gem 'nokogiri' # A gem that might be used by your Rake task
gem 'rake'

group :development do
  gem 'rspec'
  gem 'dotenv-rails' # Also might be used by your rake task
end
```

After modifying the `Gemfile`, remember to run `bundle install` to bring those gem dependencies into the application.

**2. Incorrect Environment Variables:**

Rake tasks might rely on environment variables that are only set in your shell's startup files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`). Passenger, when launched via `bundle exec passenger start`, doesn’t automatically inherit these. This issue is common with configurations that are specific to your development environment and aren't provided to your production server.

**Solution:** Ensure that necessary environment variables are explicitly set within your Passenger configuration. You could use a `.env` file in conjunction with something like the `dotenv-rails` gem. Or you can configure Passenger's startup environment directly.

*Example Code Snippet:*

```ruby
# config/passenger.conf (example for standalone Passenger)
passenger_ruby /usr/bin/ruby
passenger_app_env development
passenger_env_var DATABASE_URL "postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database"
PASSENGER_ENV_VAR SECRET_KEY_BASE "your_secret"
```
The important point is you have to explicitly set the variables that your rake task depends on, or it will fail, as it cannot 'see' the settings in your shell configurations.

**3. Incorrect Path Configurations:**

Sometimes, your Rake tasks might rely on executables located in directories that aren’t in Passenger’s default `PATH`. These could include system-level executables or application-specific tools.

**Solution:** Ensure the correct paths are included in Passenger's environment.

*Example Code Snippet:*

```ruby
# config/passenger.conf (example for standalone Passenger)
passenger_ruby /usr/bin/ruby
passenger_app_env development
passenger_env_var PATH "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin" # Add needed paths
```

In this snippet, I'm appending `/usr/local/bin` to the standard system paths. This resolves a scenario where external libraries (such as ImageMagick or other CLI-based utilities that your Rake task relies upon) might not be found if they reside in non-standard locations. The key point here is to explicitly specify the path or paths for external programs or tools.

**Debugging Techniques**

If you're experiencing this, the first thing I'd do is try running the command in an interactive environment: `bundle exec rails runner 'puts ENV.to_h'`. This allows you to see exactly what environment variables are being passed to your app under `bundle exec`. If the variables you need for your Rake tasks are missing from that output, you have your answer. Another really useful practice is to create a small ruby script that dumps environment variables and runs your rake task, executing that script via the same `bundle exec` mechanism as passenger. This allows you to quickly and effectively debug environment discrepancies and understand exactly where any issues lie.

Also ensure, that after any changes to your environment or Gemfile, that you execute `bundle install` again. There are also useful debugging flags within Passenger itself to assist with understanding startup issues. These often offer a more detailed glimpse into the specific failures and help isolate the problem effectively. Furthermore, reviewing the Passenger error logs is absolutely key. These logs are usually very clear on what is missing or wrong in your execution environment, if you are comfortable looking through the stack traces that they often contain.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper dive into managing Ruby environments, I highly recommend reviewing the Bundler documentation closely (https://bundler.io/) and the gem documentation itself. Understanding how it handles gem paths and environments is pivotal. Then, the official Phusion Passenger documentation (https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) will give you an in-depth understanding of Passenger's environment management capabilities. Finally, a solid reference for understanding Unix-like environments is “Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment” by W. Richard Stevens, which provides valuable insights on how processes inherit environment variables, file descriptors and other crucial concepts.

In short, `bundle exec passenger start` failing with Rake tasks is almost always down to a mismatch between the shell environment you’re developing in and the controlled environment that passenger creates and utilizes. By ensuring you specify your gem dependencies, environment variables and path configurations correctly, you can navigate this issue, and the result is usually a more robust and well-understood deployment.
