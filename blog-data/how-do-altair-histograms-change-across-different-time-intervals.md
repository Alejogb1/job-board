Alright, let's tackle this. It's a question that brings back memories of a rather complex project I worked on a few years back, where analyzing sensor data for predictive maintenance was crucial. Specifically, we were using Altair to visualize those temporal changes, and the nuances of how histograms shifted over time were pivotal to our analysis. So, when we're talking about Altair histograms and their behavior across time intervals, we're essentially dissecting how the distribution of a particular variable evolves. This isn't merely about slapping some bars on a chart; it’s about understanding the story those distributions tell over time, and how Altair can effectively portray that.

Firstly, it's important to clarify that "change" can mean several things in this context. The simplest case involves static datasets that have an associated timestamp and we display each slice as a separate histogram alongside each other. More advanced uses, which often lead to deeper insight, concern the evolution of the *shape* of the distribution itself; does it become more or less skewed, more or less spread out, move towards a different central tendency? All of this data is encoded within the shape of the histogram and will vary across time if the underlying generating process changes over time.

The core idea is to create multiple histograms—each representing a specific time interval—and then arrange them in a way that allows for visual comparison. Altair makes this fairly straightforward through its layering capabilities and by carefully constructing the data. Let's dive into a few examples based on my experiences, and I will use some sample code to illustrate.

**Example 1: Simple Side-by-Side Histograms Over Time**

Imagine we're dealing with hourly temperature readings. Our goal is to visualize how the temperature distribution changes throughout a single day. Here’s how we could achieve this with Altair:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data (replace with your actual data)
np.random.seed(42)
hours = np.arange(0, 24)
temperatures = [np.random.normal(15 + (hour * 0.5), 3, 100) for hour in hours] # Simulate daily cycle
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'hour': np.repeat(hours, 100),
    'temperature': np.concatenate(temperatures)
})


chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('temperature:Q', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=20), title='Temperature (°C)'),
    alt.Y('count()', title='Frequency'),
    alt.Column('hour:O', title='Hour of Day')
).properties(
    title="Temperature Distribution Across Hours"
)

chart.show()
```

This snippet generates simulated temperature data, then it uses `alt.Column` to facet the histogram by the 'hour' variable. Each column effectively creates a separate histogram, and we display them side-by-side. In terms of temporal comparison, this is the most basic approach - and it's highly effective for spotting differences in distribution parameters. Each sub-plot displays the distribution of temperature during the hour specified at the top of the plot.

**Example 2: Overlaying Histograms with Transparency for Visualizing Changes**

Sometimes, juxtaposing histograms can be less informative when the changes are nuanced, which I learned on that predictive maintenance project when the signal was quite weak for a while. When data overlaps significantly, overlaying the histograms with transparency can make comparisons easier by showing which ranges are dense at some time and not others.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
periods = ['Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening']
means = [10, 25, 18]
data = pd.DataFrame()

for period, mean in zip(periods, means):
    period_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'value': np.random.normal(mean, 5, 500),
        'period': [period] * 500
    })
    data = pd.concat([data, period_data])


chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_bar(opacity=0.7).encode(
    alt.X("value:Q", bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30), title="Measurement Value"),
    alt.Y("count()", title="Frequency"),
    alt.Color('period:N', title = 'Time Period')
).properties(
    title="Measurement Distribution Across Time Periods",
    width = 600
)
chart.show()
```
Here we see that by overlaying histograms, the differences in the distributions become visually clearer. The use of `opacity=0.7` allows us to see through the overlapping bars, revealing the density of measurements in each range for each period. This is far superior to placing the histograms side-by-side when there is significant overlap between the distributions. The change in the central tendency of the distribution is immediately apparent.

**Example 3: Animated Histograms Across a Time Series**

For truly dynamic temporal analysis, animation is the next logical step. Instead of simply showing static slices, animations allow us to observe the *continuous* evolution of the distribution. This can bring out underlying trends that static charts struggle to convey. For this, we can use Altair in conjunction with some techniques to pre-process our data in the manner needed to properly animate. This example assumes a very granular dataset with minute-by-minute samples.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data with minute-by-minute data
np.random.seed(42)
minutes = np.arange(0, 60 * 24)  # Full day in minutes
values = [np.random.normal(10 + (minute * 0.005), 2, 10) for minute in minutes]
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'minute': np.repeat(minutes, 10),
    'value': np.concatenate(values),
    'hour': np.repeat(minutes // 60, 10)
})

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('value:Q', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=20), title="Measurement Value"),
    alt.Y('count()', title='Frequency'),
    alt.Frame('hour:O', title="Hour of Day")
).properties(
    title="Evolution of Measurement Distribution Over the Day"
).interactive()
chart.show()

```
In this case we are animating the bins using the `alt.Frame` parameter, which allows the histogram to morph in a smooth and continuous manner. It's important to emphasize that the data used to generate such animations might require pre-processing to ensure that the bins align correctly across frames and that the transition is smooth. This method is incredibly useful in situations with high temporal granularity.

In summary, visualizing histogram change in Altair relies heavily on careful data structuring and using Altair’s expressive encoding capabilities. While the side-by-side method is great for initial comparisons, layering and animation provide far more impactful views when dealing with nuanced changes in distributions over time.

For further exploration into the theoretical underpinnings of visualizing distributions and time-series data, I'd recommend delving into Edward Tufte’s "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"—a classic for understanding the principles of data visualization, and "Time Series Analysis" by James D. Hamilton, which provides rigorous foundations for modeling time series, which, when paired with appropriate visualizations, like these Altair histograms, can provide a complete and thorough picture of how the distributions change over time. Also, exploring articles from research journals that delve into the application of dynamic histograms can provide a lot of insight, specifically any articles which deal with the visualization of non-stationary time-series, which is an important topic in itself.
