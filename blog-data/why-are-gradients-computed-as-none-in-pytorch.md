Okay, let's tackle this. I've seen this issue crop up more times than I care to remember, usually in the wee hours of the morning when debugging seemingly straightforward models. The scenario is always the same: you're expecting backpropagation to populate your tensor gradients, but instead, you find them stubbornly `None`. It's frustrating, to say the least, but the reasons are usually quite logical once you understand the underlying mechanisms of PyTorch's computational graph and autograd engine.

The primary reason gradients show up as `None` isn't necessarily a bug; it's often a consequence of how PyTorch tracks operations for gradient computation. Autograd, the heart of PyTorch's automatic differentiation, works by constructing a dynamic computational graph. It only keeps track of operations that involve tensors with the `requires_grad=True` attribute. If this flag isn't set or the involved tensors are not participating in any gradient-calculating operation, gradients won’t be calculated, leading to them being `None`.

This leads me to a situation I encountered a few years back. I was working on a complex multi-stage training pipeline. I had one initial stage where data was preprocessed, including calculating some numerical features. I forgot, in my initial setup, to set `requires_grad=True` on the feature tensors that I then fed to my actual network, and thus, gradients would not be computed with respect to those tensors and everything downstream would have `None` gradients. When I traced the backpropagation through the debugger, I noticed the `grad` attribute of the feature tensors was indeed `None` immediately after the initial calculation. That's when the lightbulb went off. I realized I had to explicitly specify which operations the autograd system should monitor by specifying which tensors require gradient tracking.

Now, let's break it down with some code examples.

**Scenario 1: Missing `requires_grad=True`**

This is the most common culprit. If your tensor is involved in a computation but doesn't have the `requires_grad=True` attribute set, its gradients will be `None`. Consider this simple example:

```python
import torch

# Tensor without requires_grad=True
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y = x * 2
z = y.sum()
z.backward()

print(x.grad)  # Output: None
print(y.grad) # Output: None
```

In this case, the gradient of `x` will be `None` because we haven't told PyTorch to track its operations. The gradient of `y` will also be `None` because `y` is derived from `x`, so if `x` doesn’t require gradient computation, neither does `y`.

**Solution:**

```python
import torch

# Tensor with requires_grad=True
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y.sum()
z.backward()

print(x.grad) # Output: tensor([2., 2., 2.])
print(y.grad) # Output: None (because we did not compute gradients for the intermediate variables)
```

By setting `requires_grad=True` when defining `x`, PyTorch now knows to track the operations and compute the gradients during backpropagation. Note that gradients are computed for all tensors that require gradients *and* which have been used in computations that produce the output on which `.backward()` is called. `y`’s gradient isn't filled as the user did not specify that we should compute it.

**Scenario 2: Operations that don't propagate gradients**

Not all operations trigger gradient computation. Operations like slicing, indexing, and reshaping (when view is used) often don't keep gradient information directly. They manipulate tensors, but they are not treated as part of the computational graph in terms of gradient calculation in all cases, especially when no new memory is allocated. If you have a tensor that is the result of such operations, its gradient can be `None` even if the original tensor did require gradients. Consider:

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], requires_grad=True)
y = x[:, 0] # Slicing operation
z = y.sum()
z.backward()
print(x.grad) # Output: tensor([[1., 0.], [1., 0.]])
print(y.grad) # Output: None
```
`y` is a slice of `x`, which does require gradients; however, slicing does not directly accumulate gradients onto intermediate tensors. The computation of gradients for `x` was successful, but not directly for `y`, because it did not have an explicit computation that accumulated its gradients.

**Scenario 3: In-place operations**

This is a silent killer for new and even seasoned users alike. Operations that modify a tensor in place, such as `+=`, `-=`, or the in-place version of other methods (e.g., `add_()`), can break the computational graph. This is because autograd needs the original tensor to compute the gradient. These in-place manipulations overwrite that original tensor and thus destroy the link in the computational graph. Let’s look at this:

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y += 1
z = y.sum()
z.backward()

print(x.grad) # Output: None
```

The in-place `y += 1` operation modifies y directly, which disconnects it from the computational graph used for backpropagation. Because it has not been specified that we should compute gradients for it, `y` is not filled. More importantly, the gradient for `x` also becomes `None` because the chain of operations is broken. The in-place change means `y` is no longer linked back to the original value of `y` that autograd needs to compute the gradient with respect to `x`.

**Solution:**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y = y + 1 # Non in-place addition
z = y.sum()
z.backward()

print(x.grad) # Output: tensor([2., 2., 2.])
```
By replacing the in-place `+=` with `y = y + 1` a new tensor is created, which doesn’t affect the graph or disrupt the connections required for backpropagation, thus allowing the gradient to be computed.

For deeper exploration of PyTorch’s autograd, I recommend diving into the official PyTorch documentation. It’s detailed and provides a solid foundation. For a more theoretical understanding of automatic differentiation and computational graphs, the book "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville provides a really good basis. Specifically, the chapter on backpropagation and computational graphs are of relevance here. Furthermore, exploring papers related to automatic differentiation and deep learning frameworks, such as those found in journals like the *Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)* or *Neural Computation* can provide some really helpful insights.

In summary, finding `None` gradients usually boils down to whether `requires_grad=True` is set correctly, whether the operations used are gradient-propagating, and if in-place operations are being used. By carefully understanding the computational graph construction by PyTorch and tracking the usage of the tensor with respect to gradients, these issues can be avoided. I've definitely been bitten by these issues several times, and meticulous attention to these details can often save hours of debugging.
