Alright,  I’ve seen this particular challenge pop up in several projects, and it's a solid question. The need to persist form data across a redirect, specifically in a Rails POST request, without leaning on instance variables, stems from a desire for a cleaner controller and often, a more maintainable application. Over the years, especially when dealing with complex multi-step forms, reliance on instance variables can quickly become a tangled web. Let me walk you through a few approaches I've used successfully, and why I'd favor some over others.

First, let's establish *why* instance variables can be problematic. Imagine a multi-page form, perhaps for a user registration with several stages. You might initially use `@user = User.new(user_params)` and then pass `@user` across multiple controller actions. If an error occurs at step three, and you want to repopulate the form fields, your controller becomes responsible for handling a partially populated `@user` object. This introduces complexity. Furthermore, these variables are essentially state, tied to the lifecycle of a single request-response cycle. This can make testing, and debugging more tedious.

So, how do we avoid this? The answer lies in temporary storage mechanisms, primarily utilizing session data or flash messages, and sometimes a clever use of form helpers.

**1. Leveraging Session Data**

Sessions are designed to store information across multiple requests, identified by a cookie sent from the client. This makes them a suitable candidate for temporary form data. I've used this pattern quite frequently with significant benefit in streamlining controller logic. Let's imagine a simple example of handling a form to add a new product to a catalog:

```ruby
# app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController

  def new
    @product = session[:product_data] || Product.new
  end

  def create
    session[:product_data] = params[:product]

    @product = Product.new(session[:product_data])
    if @product.valid?
      @product.save
      session[:product_data] = nil # Clear the session data
      redirect_to products_path, notice: 'Product added successfully'
    else
      flash[:error] = 'There were errors. Please correct the form below.'
      render :new
    end
  end
end
```

Here's what's happening: the `new` action initializes `@product` with session data, or an empty `Product` if there’s nothing in the session. When the `create` action receives the submitted data, instead of creating the product directly, we *temporarily store* the `params[:product]` in the session. Then, we *reconstitute* a new `@product` using this session data. The benefit? Our controller action's logic stays focused on creating and validating the model, not on persisting an instance variable. We also clear out the session data after successful creation. The session data is only used to populate the form if errors are present.

**2. Using Flash Messages (for simpler scenarios)**

For very simple scenarios, especially single-page forms that might encounter validation errors, the flash message can be a viable solution. Although typically used for notices, the flash can carry entire data payloads as well. The caveat here is that `flash` messages are explicitly intended to appear *only* on the next page load; using it for more than that is an abuse and it is best to use session. I would only use this for very basic situations. This method is most appropriate when not dealing with multi-step processes, as session is better suited for prolonged storage. I have found the flash useful for scenarios when the submission of the form results in an error, and I need to populate the fields again. Here is an example:

```ruby
# app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb
class ContactsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @contact = flash[:contact_params] ? Contact.new(flash[:contact_params]) : Contact.new
  end

  def create
     @contact = Contact.new(params[:contact])
      if @contact.valid?
        @contact.save
        redirect_to contacts_path, notice: 'Contact created.'
     else
        flash[:contact_params] = params[:contact]
        flash[:error] = 'Please correct the errors below'
        render :new
      end
  end
end
```

In this example, if there's an error in `create`, we store `params[:contact]` in the `flash[:contact_params]` hash. Then, in the `new` action, we reconstruct a `Contact` object with this data if present; thus, we do not have to use instance variables.

**3. Form Helpers and Hidden Fields**

A third way, though less frequently used alone, is using hidden fields to pass the data back. I have sometimes used this in conjunction with a server-side session for more complicated use cases. This isn't a direct replacement but can complement session or flash in particular multi-part forms, which use a "next" button to go through each step. You can take the data gathered from one page and add it as a hidden field to the next form. This is most effective if the page is a read-only summary, where you want to be able to populate values on the next form, without persisting data in the database. This approach has helped me reduce reliance on sessions in less complicated use cases.

```erb
<!-- app/views/users/step1.html.erb -->
<%= form_with(url: step2_users_path, method: :get) do |form| %>
  <%= form.label :name %>
  <%= form.text_field :name %>

  <%= form.label :email %>
  <%= form.email_field :email %>

  <%= form.submit "Next" %>
<% end %>

<!-- app/views/users/step2.html.erb -->
<%= form_with(url: create_users_path, method: :post) do |form| %>
    <%= hidden_field_tag :name, params[:name] %>
    <%= hidden_field_tag :email, params[:email] %>
    <%= form.label :phone_number %>
    <%= form.text_field :phone_number %>

    <%= form.submit "Submit" %>
<% end %>

```

In this example, the data from the first step is passed as a hidden parameter to the next page. On the create step, all data would be present. The server-side session solution is ideal for persisting data through complicated multi-step processes. The client-side hidden field example is suitable for simple scenarios where data persistence over a short, directed user flow is required.

**Recommendations for further learning:**

For a deeper understanding of session management in Rails, I recommend consulting the official Rails documentation on ActionController::Base, specifically the sections on sessions. I also strongly advise reading "Agile Web Development with Rails 7," specifically the chapters covering controllers and form handling, for best practices in web application development. Another excellent resource, though not specific to Ruby on Rails, is "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" by Martin Fowler; its section on architectural patterns is invaluable for understanding web applications' underlying concepts and helps establish the conceptual understanding needed to apply Rails principles. These resources have always been foundational to my development approach and have equipped me with the necessary knowledge to overcome the types of challenges we've just discussed.

In summary, avoiding instance variables for form data persistence during redirects in Rails can significantly enhance application maintainability and reduce controller clutter. Employing sessions, flash messages, and even hidden form fields each offer unique advantages depending on the complexity of the scenario at hand. Each technique allows you to focus the controller logic on what it is designed for - the coordination of requests and responses - without coupling it to the internal state of each request. I've used all three, and each has its proper place within a web application's design. The key is selecting the right tool for the job.
