Alright,  It's a problem I've encountered quite a few times, especially when dealing with dynamic content coming from APIs, or when you're working with custom views that have intrinsic, variable size requirements. The crux of the issue with `constraintlayout` and unknown child sizes is that you can't rely on fixed values or ratios for alignment. It’s often not as straightforward as you might assume initially.

The typical approach with a basic `linearlayout` might be to let its internal measuring system handle these cases relatively automatically, but `constraintlayout` provides more control, at the cost of a bit more initial complexity. It's this control that we leverage to address the unknown sizes. Instead of thinking about it as 'guessing' or relying on implicit behaviour, the core strategy here lies in employing the `constraintlayout`’s robust constraint-based system in a smart way, specifically through the strategic use of guidelines and chains, sometimes combined with dimension constraints like `wrap_content`.

Let me walk you through the mechanisms I've found most effective, drawing from some projects I worked on that involved dynamically resizing text fields and image views, where the content was, for lack of a better term, wildly unpredictable.

Firstly, **guidelines are paramount**. These virtual lines, either horizontal or vertical, aren’t drawn on the screen, but act as powerful anchors. You can position a guideline at a percentage of the parent, or a fixed distance from an edge, allowing children to align relative to it. For example, if you have a text field that may have variable lengths, and an icon next to it that you want aligned vertically, you would start by creating a horizontal guideline. Then, you would align the top and bottom of the text field to this guide, and also the top and bottom of your icon to the same guide. This achieves vertical alignment regardless of the height of the text because the guideline ensures both start at a shared reference point.

```xml
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <androidx.constraintlayout.widget.Guideline
        android:id="@+id/guideline_vertical_center"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:orientation="vertical"
        app:layout_constraintGuide_percent="0.5"/>

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/variable_text"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Some variable text"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toStartOf="@+id/icon"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"/>

    <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/icon"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:src="@drawable/ic_icon"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf="@+id/variable_text"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="@+id/variable_text"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="@+id/variable_text"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"/>

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

In this example, notice that the `TextView` (variable_text) and `ImageView` (icon) use `app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf` and `app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf` set to the same guide. This ensures they share the same vertical center regardless of the content's specific dimensions. Critically, the text and icon wrap their content. This allows their dimensions to be determined during layout and also they push each other via the constraints they have connecting them.

Secondly, **chains** provide us with the capability to spread content evenly. When children have unknown sizes, setting up chains, especially with styles like `spread`, `spread_inside` or `packed` can be a lifesaver. They allow you to determine how space is distributed amongst sibling views connected with each other via constraints on their start and end edges. The constraint system takes care of ensuring proper alignment despite unknown sizes of components.
For example if you have three views of unknown length and you wish to align them horizontally, you can use a chain. The chain will ensure that the space is distributed equally amongst them.

```xml
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">


    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/text1"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Text 1"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toStartOf="@+id/text2"
        />

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/text2"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="A much longer text 2"
         app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf="@+id/text1"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toStartOf="@+id/text3"
       />

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/text3"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Text 3"
         app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf="@+id/text2"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        />

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

In this code snippet, the three `TextView` elements are linked with start to end constraints, thereby creating a horizontal chain. By default this will create a `spread` style chain which ensures that the views have the same space in between each other and they fill the parent. You can set `app:layout_constraintHorizontal_chainStyle` on the first element to manipulate the chain styling. For instance using `packed` will ensure that space is only distributed between the sides of the parent and the start and end of the chain.

Finally, the intelligent use of **`wrap_content`** is a crucial piece of the puzzle. While `match_parent` forces a child to take up the same space as its parent (or the available space constrained by the constraints), `wrap_content` is not a static measure. When combined with constraints that don't impose a specific size, the child’s view will adjust dynamically according to its content. It’s this dynamic behavior we can leverage to make everything line up correctly. This is usually used in conjunction with guidelines or chains to align elements based on their actual, calculated size.

Let's consider a case where you might want to have a dynamic image and some descriptive text underneath it. Both these views may have unknown dimensions, yet you need the text to be centered below the image.

```xml
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/dynamic_image"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:src="@drawable/dynamic_image_placeholder"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"/>

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/description_text"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Some description text, of variable length."
        app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@+id/dynamic_image"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="@+id/dynamic_image"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="@+id/dynamic_image"
        />

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

Here, the `ImageView` has `wrap_content` for both its width and height. This makes the image determine its size. The text then aligns using the start and end constraints linked to the image. Consequently, the text is always centered horizontally below the image, irrespective of both the image and the text’s actual dimensions.

In summary, achieving alignment with `constraintlayout` when child widget sizes are unknown isn't about brute-forcing. It is about strategically combining `wrap_content`, guidelines, and chains. You have to carefully plan your constraints, keeping in mind that the layout system will perform the necessary measurement passes and propagate the correct dimensions based on this.

For deeper understanding on layout systems, I would recommend reading *Android UI Fundamentals* by Marcin Koziol, or checking out the official documentation of the Android framework. Also, the *ConstraintLayout* documentation on the Android Developers site is always a valuable resource. Also a dive into *Designing Interfaces: Patterns for Effective Interaction Design* by Jenifer Tidwell can give insights into why these components are placed as they are from a user experience perspective, and why alignment matters so much. Understanding layout from the user point of view makes you design more effective and user friendly UIs. These resources should provide a strong theoretical background and also more concrete examples that will expand your knowledge beyond this particular response. Remember, it's not about memorizing layouts, but about understanding the underlying mechanics, which will allow you to solve complex layout issues elegantly.
