Let's tackle this one, shall we? From my experience, I've often found myself switching between environments, and the desire for consistency in my visual workspace is quite relatable. The short answer to whether visual studio code (vs code) themes can be directly applied to rider is: no, not in a direct, plug-and-play manner. They are fundamentally different beasts under the hood, built on different architectures and technologies. However, it's certainly not the end of the story, and there are viable alternatives that approximate the look and feel. Let's delve deeper.

The core issue is that vs code uses a json-based theme format, relying on the textmate grammars for syntax highlighting. These grammars are processed by vs code's internal rendering engine. Rider, on the other hand, leverages jetbrains’ proprietary platform, which utilizes a different model for syntax highlighting and theming. Specifically, it uses custom xml configuration files to define styles. Because these foundational structures are not interchangeable, direct theme import is simply not possible. To visualize it, imagine trying to insert a square peg into a round hole – it won't fit even if both shapes aim to achieve the same visual effect.

During my tenure on a large cross-platform project a few years back, we actually faced a similar challenge. The team was split between developers using vs code for frontend tasks and others using rider for backend development. This inconsistency across the team not only affected the visual consistency but also led to slight inefficiencies in communication, where developers would describe code snippets using different color cues. So, the need for a unified look and feel was felt quite strongly.

We explored several avenues to bridge the visual gap. First, we attempted to create a custom rider theme that mimicked a vs code theme. This is where the practical part comes in, and it's quite useful for getting the effect you desire. It wasn't a copy-paste exercise; rather it involved an in-depth study of the color schemes, contrast, and font properties used in the original vs code theme, and then manually recreating them through rider’s settings.

The process entails navigating to ‘file > settings > editor > color scheme’ in rider. You can either modify an existing theme or create a new one. This involves a granular approach, where we specified custom foreground and background colors, font styles and sizes, and syntax highlighting rules for various code elements like keywords, comments, strings, and operators. This required meticulous attention to detail because the mapping between vs code and rider's syntax elements is not one-to-one.

Here's a snippet of a configuration file that you would typically see in a rider custom theme (although the full schema is quite extensive and varies based on specific versions):

```xml
<scheme name="MyCustomTheme" version="142" parent_scheme="Darcula">
  <option name="LINE_SPACING" value="1.0" />
  <option name="EDITOR_FONT_SIZE" value="12" />
  <option name="EDITOR_FONT_NAME" value="Consolas" />
  <colors>
      <option name="CARET_COLOR" value="ffffff" />
      <option name="GUTTER_BACKGROUND" value="1e1e1e" />
      <option name="LINE_NUMBER" value="606060" />
      <option name="SELECTED_INDICATION" value="373737" />
      <option name="SELECTION_BACKGROUND" value="373737" />
   </colors>
  <attributes>
      <option name="TEXT">
          <value>
            <option name="FOREGROUND" value="ffffff"/>
             <option name="BACKGROUND" value="1e1e1e"/>
          </value>
       </option>
      <option name="JAVA_KEYWORD">
         <value>
          <option name="FOREGROUND" value="6692e3" />
          <option name="FONT_TYPE" value="1" />
         </value>
      </option>
      <option name="JAVA_STRING">
          <value>
              <option name="FOREGROUND" value="ce9178" />
          </value>
      </option>
   </attributes>
</scheme>

```

In this example, you can see how we are tweaking colors, like the caret color, background of the gutter and the highlighting color when you select, which is done via rgb hexadecimal values. Further down you can see how you can change the color and style of code elements, here specifically setting a color for general text, java keywords and string. This is a very small piece of the entire theme definition, yet it does show what the basic structure is like.

You can see how this configuration starts with declaring the theme name and that it should inherit properties from the existing "darcula" theme. It then tweaks aspects like font and colors of the text and the color of several elements of the code, such as strings and keywords.

Another approach we explored involved the use of theme customization plugins. While there aren't any plugins that directly convert vs code themes to rider, there are those that extend rider's theming capabilities, allowing for more granular control. Some plugins offer options for custom css overrides, enabling users to fine-tune various aspects of the editor's presentation. This can be especially handy when attempting to replicate the subtle details of a specific vs code theme.

Here’s a small snippet showcasing how you might use a css override plugin for rider (this is not actual code that executes, but is more illustrative of the kind of approach used by such plugins):

```css
/* overriding base styles for editor text */
.editor-text {
  color: #abb2bf !important; /* setting the primary text color */
  background-color: #282c34 !important; /*  setting a background color similar to dark vs code themes*/
}

/* Overriding comments */
.editor-comment{
    color: #5c6370 !important;
}

/* Overriding method definition */
.method-definition {
    color: #e06c75 !important; /* set a color for methods*/
    font-weight: bold !important; /* makes them appear bold */
}
```

In this example, we are employing css like selectors to redefine color properties of different parts of the text editor. Note that the actual css file structure is provided by the plug in that is used to implement this functionality, not something provided by rider. We're overriding general text, making comments less prominent and highlighting method definitions to add a visual separation. Such plugins often provide selectors to access a wide range of elements of the IDE.

Thirdly, there are many community-created rider themes available which might be inspired by existing vs code ones, and can be found online via searches or on the plugins repository of jetbrains marketplace. These themes are specifically created for rider’s engine and require no manual translation, offering the closest experience to a direct ‘import’.

For example, let’s assume you stumble upon a rider theme configuration file, which might be used to define a theme:

```xml
<scheme name="MonokaiInspired" version="142" parent_scheme="Darcula">
    <option name="LINE_SPACING" value="1.0" />
    <option name="EDITOR_FONT_SIZE" value="13" />
    <option name="EDITOR_FONT_NAME" value="Monospace" />
    <colors>
        <option name="CARET_COLOR" value="f8f8f2" />
        <option name="GUTTER_BACKGROUND" value="272822" />
        <option name="LINE_NUMBER" value="49483e" />
        <option name="SELECTION_BACKGROUND" value="49483e" />
   </colors>
    <attributes>
        <option name="TEXT">
            <value>
                <option name="FOREGROUND" value="f8f8f2"/>
               <option name="BACKGROUND" value="272822"/>
            </value>
        </option>
        <option name="JAVA_KEYWORD">
            <value>
                <option name="FOREGROUND" value="f92672" />
            </value>
        </option>
        <option name="JAVA_STRING">
            <value>
              <option name="FOREGROUND" value="a6e22e" />
            </value>
        </option>
         <option name="JAVA_COMMENT">
            <value>
              <option name="FOREGROUND" value="75715e" />
            </value>
        </option>
    </attributes>
</scheme>
```

Here, this configuration is not modifying an already existing theme but rather creates an entirely new one with a specific palette and formatting structure inspired by "monokai" theme and it goes into the `<schemes>` directory inside the rider configurations directory, this is the file that is parsed when a theme from the available list in the settings is chosen.

While the underlying architectures prevent a direct transfer, the process of mimicking vs code themes in rider through these techniques is quite effective. It involves manual configuration, css modifications through plugins, or adopting community themes, each providing the user with viable alternatives.

For further insight into theme design, I recommend diving into ‘the art of color’ by Johannes Itten for a strong foundational understanding of color theory and how to use it effectively. Further, ‘practical typography’ by Jason Cranford Teague can assist greatly in selecting optimal fonts for readability and maintaining accessibility. As for jetbrains’ architecture itself, exploring their official documentation is quite beneficial to understand more about the underlying systems used for the rendering and the way themes are loaded and applied. Exploring the source code of theme based plugins may also reveal interesting approaches for solving more difficult customization problems.
