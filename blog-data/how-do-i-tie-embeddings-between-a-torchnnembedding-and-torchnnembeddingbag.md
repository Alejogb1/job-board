Alright, let’s tackle this. I remember a project a few years back, involved heavily optimized natural language processing on resource-constrained devices. We were experimenting with various forms of embedding layers to squeeze maximum performance, and this exact problem of tying `torch.nn.Embedding` and `torch.nn.EmbeddingBag` came up. It's not immediately obvious, but definitely solvable with a bit of careful planning.

Essentially, you're aiming to share the underlying weight matrix between these two different kinds of embedding layers in PyTorch. Think of it as having one source of truth for your word embeddings, which both layers can tap into. The motivation behind this, as I experienced, is often memory efficiency and maintaining consistency between contexts where you need individual token embeddings (`torch.nn.Embedding`) and those where you need to aggregate embeddings over a sequence (`torch.nn.EmbeddingBag`).

Now, let's get into the nuts and bolts. The crucial part here lies in manipulating the `weight` parameter of each layer. `torch.nn.Embedding` stores its embeddings as a matrix where rows correspond to embedding vectors for specific indices. `torch.nn.EmbeddingBag` also uses a matrix but employs a specific indexing pattern which includes offsets and sequence lengths for efficient batch operations. The key, however, is that both can be made to share the same underlying weight tensor.

Here's how I tackled it then and how I would recommend doing it now, with a focus on flexibility and clarity.

First, let's define the initial embedding layer, using `torch.nn.Embedding` because it's simpler to visualize initially, and subsequently tie the `EmbeddingBag`’s weights to it:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the embedding size and vocabulary size
embedding_dim = 128
vocab_size = 10000

# Create the shared embedding layer (Embedding)
shared_embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

# Create the EmbeddingBag layer and initialize it to use the shared embeddings
embedding_bag = nn.EmbeddingBag(vocab_size, embedding_dim, mode="mean", _weight=shared_embedding.weight)

# Verify they are the same object
print(shared_embedding.weight is embedding_bag.weight) #Output: True

# Example input
input_indices = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (5, 10))  # 5 sequences of 10 tokens each
offsets = torch.arange(0,50,10)
seq_lens = torch.full( (5,), 10 )

# Get output using the normal embedding
embedding_output_indiv = shared_embedding(input_indices)
print("Output of embedding:", embedding_output_indiv.shape) #Output: torch.Size([5, 10, 128])

# Get output using the shared EmbeddingBag layer
embedding_bag_output = embedding_bag(input_indices, offsets)
print("Output of embedding_bag:", embedding_bag_output.shape)  #Output: torch.Size([5, 128])

```

In this first snippet, we establish `shared_embedding` as the source. When creating `embedding_bag`, we specifically pass in `_weight=shared_embedding.weight`. This is the crucial step where both layers now point to the same underlying tensor. Modifying the weights of one automatically affects the other. The printed output of `shared_embedding.weight is embedding_bag.weight` demonstrates that the two layers do indeed share the same tensor. We create two example tensors, one is a 2D tensor of the indices, and the other two represent the offsets and lengths for processing with `EmbeddingBag`.

Now, let’s demonstrate the modification aspect. We’ll modify one embedding layer’s weights and see that the change is reflected in the other. This is where the "tying" effect truly becomes apparent:

```python
# Modify the weights of the shared embedding layer
with torch.no_grad():
  shared_embedding.weight[0, :] = torch.ones(embedding_dim)  # Set the first embedding vector to all ones

# Retrieve the first weight vector from both embedding layers
weight_from_embed = shared_embedding.weight[0]
weight_from_embedbag = embedding_bag.weight[0]

# Print output to show that the vector is equal
print(torch.equal(weight_from_embed, weight_from_embedbag)) #Output: True
print("First Embedding Vector (from embedding):", weight_from_embed[:5]) #First five numbers
print("First Embedding Vector (from embedding bag):", weight_from_embedbag[:5]) #First five numbers
```
The crucial detail is the `with torch.no_grad():` block here. Since we're manually setting values, this will prevent PyTorch from tracking those modifications for backward passes if that were to be part of the computational graph. The tensors pulled from the two embedding layers have identical data showing we’ve successfully tied the underlying tensor.

It's also worth noting a few important practical considerations based on my past work. Firstly, always make sure you're handling gradients correctly, particularly when modifying weights directly. Using `torch.no_grad()` is vital to prevent errors during backpropagation as demonstrated. If you are training, and want to change values for debugging, don't forget the `with torch.no_grad()` or you will face many frustrating bugs. This is very important for the `torch.nn.Embedding` object, but is automatically taken care of by `torch.nn.EmbeddingBag`.

Finally, another crucial point is dealing with situations where the embedding layers aren’t created at the same time. I've encountered cases where we'd pre-load weights into a separate `Embedding` object, perhaps from a pre-trained model, and *then* create the `EmbeddingBag`. Here’s how you could handle that:

```python
# Load pretrained embeddings from a matrix or file.
# Example: We will create a random pre-trained embedding weights object, usually read from disk.
pretrained_weights = torch.rand(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

# Create a new embedding layer with pre-loaded weights
pretrained_embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
with torch.no_grad():
    pretrained_embedding.weight.copy_(pretrained_weights)

# create a new EmbeddingBag with the pre-loaded weights
new_embeddingbag = nn.EmbeddingBag(vocab_size, embedding_dim, mode="mean", _weight=pretrained_embedding.weight)


# Check that the tensors are the same.
print(pretrained_embedding.weight is new_embeddingbag.weight) # Output: True
# Let's check the equality of the first 5 weights.
print("First five weights from pre-trained embedding", pretrained_embedding.weight[0][:5]) # First five
print("First five weights from embedding_bag", new_embeddingbag.weight[0][:5]) # First five
```
The important aspect is again passing the `pretrained_embedding.weight` to the `EmbeddingBag`. We also demonstrate that the actual weights are the same in both objects.

This is a reasonably efficient method, especially when dealing with large vocabularies, as you’re not duplicating the memory footprint of the embedding matrix. It also allows seamless sharing of weights if, for example, you are transitioning between different types of layers for different inputs, within the same model.

For a deeper dive into embedding techniques, I strongly recommend starting with the original Word2Vec paper by Mikolov et al., specifically "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space". Understanding the core principles of word vector representations helps contextualize how embeddings are utilized in modern deep learning systems. Also, "Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents" by Le and Mikolov explains paragraph vector which is relevant for this response. When it comes to PyTorch specifically, the official documentation is a fantastic resource for details on the layers, but understanding the under-lying math and representation is key to doing complex things like embedding tying. You can look at other more contemporary methods in papers using transformers, such as "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. These are all great resources that will help solidify your understanding beyond the specifics of PyTorch itself.
