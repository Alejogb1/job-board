Okay, let’s talk about grouping users by age range in a Rails application. It’s something I've handled more than a few times, especially when dealing with analytics or feature segmentation. There are several ways to approach this, and the "best" solution often depends on the size of your dataset and how frequently you need to perform this grouping operation. My experience tells me to prioritize database optimization when dealing with larger datasets, so I’ll lean into that here.

The naive approach is, of course, to do the age calculation on the fly each time you need to group users. This is acceptable for small user bases or when you need it for a one-off report. However, doing this repeatedly across a million users can slow things down considerably, so let’s consider alternatives.

The core idea revolves around having a computed or derived property, or what some databases call "virtual columns." We're essentially pre-calculating the age group and storing it somewhere, either in the database itself, or in memory after retrieval. Let's walk through a few methods with increasing complexity and efficiency. I will explain the underlying rationale and tradeoffs of each method.

**Method 1: Computed Age Category in Memory**

This is the simplest approach, great for prototyping or very small datasets. You pull all the users, then iterate through them, determining the age group in application code.

```ruby
def group_users_by_age_range(users)
    age_groups = {}
    users.each do |user|
        age = calculate_age(user.date_of_birth)
        age_group = determine_age_group(age)
        age_groups[age_group] ||= []
        age_groups[age_group] << user
    end
    age_groups
end

def calculate_age(date_of_birth)
  now = Time.now.utc.to_date
  now.year - date_of_birth.year - ((now.month > date_of_birth.month || (now.month == date_of_birth.month && now.day >= date_of_birth.day)) ? 0 : 1)
end


def determine_age_group(age)
    case age
    when 0..12
        '0-12'
    when 13..19
        '13-19'
    when 20..35
        '20-35'
    when 36..55
        '36-55'
    else
        '56+'
    end
end

# Example Usage
# all_users = User.all
# grouped_users = group_users_by_age_range(all_users)
# grouped_users.each { |range, users| puts "#{range}: #{users.count} users" }
```

Here, I defined three methods: `calculate_age`, which returns an integer representing the user's age, `determine_age_group`, which categorizes age into ranges such as `0-12`, `13-19`, etc, and `group_users_by_age_range` which actually iterates through each user to group them.

**Pros:** Very easy to implement and understand. Doesn’t require any database modifications.
**Cons:** Highly inefficient for large datasets because you're fetching *all* users and performing the age calculations in application code. This becomes increasingly slower as the number of users grows. This also pulls all records into memory, and can be problematic if the dataset is excessively large.

**Method 2: Database Computed Column (PostgreSQL Example)**

For larger datasets, it’s much more efficient to precompute the age group directly within the database. Databases, such as PostgreSQL, offer the functionality to define computed columns (also known as generated or virtual columns) that are automatically calculated based on other columns. This eliminates the need to compute this value during each request.

First, we will add the `age_group` column via a migration.

```ruby
class AddAgeGroupToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_column :users, :age_group, :string, generated: :always, as: "CASE WHEN (extract(year from age(date_of_birth)) BETWEEN 0 AND 12) THEN '0-12'
                                                                       WHEN (extract(year from age(date_of_birth)) BETWEEN 13 AND 19) THEN '13-19'
                                                                       WHEN (extract(year from age(date_of_birth)) BETWEEN 20 AND 35) THEN '20-35'
                                                                       WHEN (extract(year from age(date_of_birth)) BETWEEN 36 AND 55) THEN '36-55'
                                                                       ELSE '56+' END", stored: true
    add_index :users, :age_group
  end
end
```

**Important**: This migration is written for PostgreSQL. Other databases may use slightly different syntax for computed columns; consult your specific database documentation. Note also the use of `stored: true` means that the calculated `age_group` will be physically saved into the table and will be kept up to date automatically. We've also added an index for optimal query performance.

After the migration, you can query the database directly:

```ruby
User.group(:age_group).count
```

This will output a hash, similar to: `{'0-12' => 50, '13-19' => 120, '20-35' => 300, '36-55' => 200, '56+' => 80 }`.

**Pros:** Very efficient querying and fast retrieval, especially when combined with an index on the `age_group` column. Computations are done by the database, which is generally more efficient than in application code. Less data is transferred from the database to the application server.
**Cons:** Requires database schema modification. The syntax for generated columns varies between databases. Needs careful consideration of edge cases in the SQL expression used.

**Method 3: Periodic Batch Processing and Caching**

Let's assume your database doesn't fully support computed columns or you need a more controlled update frequency. You can implement a background job (using something like Sidekiq or Resque) to update a separate field that stores the age group. This approach requires a bit more infrastructure but gives you greater flexibility.

First, add a regular `age_group` column without the generation clause in your migration.

```ruby
class AddAgeGroupToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_column :users, :age_group, :string
    add_index :users, :age_group
  end
end
```

Next, create a job that updates all user records with an `age_group` column.

```ruby
# lib/tasks/user_age_updater.rake
namespace :user do
  desc "Update all user age groups"
  task update_age_groups: :environment do
      User.find_each(batch_size: 1000) do |user|
        age = calculate_age(user.date_of_birth)
        age_group = determine_age_group(age)
        user.update_column(:age_group, age_group)
      end
    puts "Age groups updated for all users."
  end
end
```

You can then schedule this task using a cron job or similar mechanism. After the job runs, you query your database the same way as in Method 2:

```ruby
User.group(:age_group).count
```

**Pros**: Allows batch processing of age groups, which is especially useful if calculating age is resource-intensive, while also utilizing database indexing to maximize efficiency. It doesn’t rely entirely on database computed columns and allows for custom update schedules.
**Cons**: Needs an additional job queue and task scheduling system. Data might be slightly out of date until the next background job. Requires a job scheduler such as cron or a service like sidekiq.

**Choosing the Right Approach**

The best method for you depends on your requirements. If you have a small dataset and this is a one-time thing, Method 1 might suffice. For larger user bases and frequent queries, Method 2 or Method 3 offers considerably better performance and scalability. Method 2 (database computed column) is generally the most performant as it fully utilizes database optimization. However, if your database does not support generated columns, then method 3 can provide a good alternative.

For further information on database performance optimization, I would highly recommend reading "Database Internals: A Deep Dive into How Relational Databases Work" by Alex Petrov. Also, “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” by Martin Kleppmann offers a wide range of perspectives on data processing and database technologies. Finally, the official documentation of your specific database is crucial.

In my experience, choosing the database computed column approach wherever possible provides significant and long-lasting performance benefits. Just make sure you plan for edge cases and update the computed column expression as your requirements evolve. Always prioritize the database performance and try to push data processing to the database, when possible.
