Let's dive into this. Getting at elements within a fluent ribbon's backstage view, particularly containers, isn’t always as straightforward as one might hope. I recall a particularly memorable project a few years back, developing a custom CAD application; the backstage view was a central hub for managing files, and we needed very fine-grained control over the elements, specifically item containers hosting project previews. The problem stems from the backstage view being conceptually and often physically separate from the main ribbon’s visual tree. Direct access isn't usually available through simple visual tree traversal techniques commonly used for the ribbon's core controls. We can’t, for example, simply search by element name using generic WPF utilities.

The issue's root lies in how the backstage is typically constructed and how its elements are exposed. Fluent UI frameworks, such as the one typically built on WPF or similar technologies, usually manage the backstage’s visual components internally. This abstraction is great for keeping the codebase clean and modular, but it poses a challenge when we need that precise access. We generally need to go through the application object, and access a specific property representing the current fluent ribbon instance, and *then* dig into its backstage object or equivalent. From this point, we usually have access to an array of backstage tabs. Each tab may contain several components. To get hold of an element container, you have to iterate through these components.

For example, think of a scenario where you have a backstage tab labeled "Projects" which holds a list of recent project files, and each file has its own container. These containers usually render thumbnails of the project files. If we want to, for instance, dynamically change the background of a specific file’s preview container when that project is highlighted elsewhere in the application, direct access is essential.

The strategy then involves two primary steps. First, locating the backstage control itself, then traversing its internal structure to find your target item container. Here's how that typically works with code snippets using a WPF-based Fluent ribbon scenario:

**Example 1: Accessing the backstage control and its tabs**

Let’s imagine a WPF application where the main window has a `Ribbon` control named “mainRibbon”. To get to the backstage, we need a reference to it and to extract the backstage control.

```csharp
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Controls;
using System.Windows.Controls.Ribbon;

public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        Loaded += MainWindow_Loaded;
    }

    private void MainWindow_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        // Assuming "mainRibbon" is the x:Name of your Ribbon control
        Ribbon ribbon = mainRibbon; // Direct access through x:Name in this specific context.

        if (ribbon != null && ribbon.Backstage != null)
        {
            RibbonBackstage backstage = ribbon.Backstage;

            // Accessing the backstage tabs
            foreach (RibbonBackstageTab tab in backstage.Items)
            {
                System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Tab Found: {tab.Header}");
                // Further processing can be implemented for each tab...
            }
        }
        else
        {
          System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Backstage or ribbon not found.");
        }

    }
}
```

This code snippet focuses on getting to the backstage instance and looping through its tabs. It does not target an item container directly, but serves as a foundation for the next example. In a real-world application, you would replace the `System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine` with more meaningful processing that extracts container elements.

**Example 2: Finding a specific tab and its items**

Now, let’s say the "Projects" tab is the second tab, and that each item within this tab is a `RibbonMenuButton`. It is important to note that in your fluent ui implementation, backstage item could be a ribbon control, a regular control, or custom user interface elements.

```csharp
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Controls;
using System.Windows.Controls.Ribbon;

public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        Loaded += MainWindow_Loaded2;
    }

    private void MainWindow_Loaded2(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        Ribbon ribbon = mainRibbon;

        if (ribbon != null && ribbon.Backstage != null)
        {
            RibbonBackstage backstage = ribbon.Backstage;

            if(backstage.Items.Count > 1) {
              RibbonBackstageTab projectsTab = backstage.Items[1] as RibbonBackstageTab;

              if(projectsTab != null){
                System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Project tab found: {projectsTab.Header}");

                foreach (object item in projectsTab.Items){
                    if (item is RibbonMenuButton menuButton)
                    {
                      System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Menu Button found:{menuButton.Header}");
                      // Here you would potentially check menuButton.Content and/or menuButton.Item to find your targeted element container based on your UI hierarchy and custom element structure
                      // Example would be to iterate menuButton.Items to find a given container, provided you had that layout.

                    } else
                    {
                      System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Non menu button item found:{item.GetType()}");
                    }
                }
              }
            }
        }
        else
        {
          System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Backstage or ribbon not found.");
        }
    }
}
```

This revised example aims to find the specific "Projects" tab and then access its immediate children. The critical part is understanding the structure of the items within each tab. In practice, you’ll need to inspect your UI tree and determine the specific type and name of the control you are targeting. This often involves using tools like Snoop or WPF Inspector during development to visualize the logical structure.

**Example 3: Targeting a specific element container**

Now, let's assume you've identified that within your menuButton.Items, there's a `Grid` containing project preview. This grid is also the element container we are looking for. This is obviously simplified for demonstration purposes. In a real-world app, container elements often tend to be wrapped in further layouts.

```csharp
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Controls;
using System.Windows.Controls.Ribbon;

public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
  public MainWindow()
    {
      InitializeComponent();
      Loaded += MainWindow_Loaded3;
    }


    private void MainWindow_Loaded3(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
      Ribbon ribbon = mainRibbon;

      if (ribbon != null && ribbon.Backstage != null)
      {
        RibbonBackstage backstage = ribbon.Backstage;

        if(backstage.Items.Count > 1) {
          RibbonBackstageTab projectsTab = backstage.Items[1] as RibbonBackstageTab;

            if(projectsTab != null){
                foreach (object item in projectsTab.Items){
                    if (item is RibbonMenuButton menuButton){
                      foreach (object menuButtonItem in menuButton.Items) {

                        if(menuButtonItem is Grid projectPreviewGrid)
                        {
                           //Project preview grid found, here you can manipulate it
                            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Preview Container Grid found!:{projectPreviewGrid.Name}");

                            // An Example: Setting background color for demo purposes
                            projectPreviewGrid.Background = System.Windows.Media.Brushes.LightCoral;
                        } else
                        {
                            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Not Grid item found:{menuButtonItem.GetType()}");
                        }
                      }
                    } else
                    {
                      System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Non menu button item found:{item.GetType()}");
                    }
                }
            }
        }
      }
      else
      {
        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Backstage or ribbon not found.");
      }
    }
}
```

This third example directly targets a `Grid` element within a `RibbonMenuButton` and changes its background. This illustrates how to not only access the structure but to interact with specific visual elements within the backstage. You need to adapt the logic within the inner most loop to the specifics of your UI.

For those who want a deep dive into this, I’d recommend looking into Chris Sells' book, "Programming WPF," for foundational knowledge about the visual tree, or checking out Microsoft's official documentation on WPF and Fluent UI components. Specifically, understanding logical and visual tree structures, element relationships, and how to effectively use tools like Snoop are critical for this. While this approach might feel a bit verbose, the precision and fine-grained control it offers are often needed when working with complex applications.

Remember, the key is to navigate the logical structure of your backstage view based on the specific implementation of your chosen fluent ribbon. Using inspection tools, coupled with understanding your control structure, should allow you to access the target element containers effectively. And in my experience, the effort spent on getting this granular control is invariably worth it, especially when trying to craft a polished and responsive user experience.
