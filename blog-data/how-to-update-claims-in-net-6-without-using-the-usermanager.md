Right, let's tackle updating claims in .net 6, bypassing the UserManager. I've certainly been in a position where needing to directly manipulate claims was more efficient than going through the UserManager's abstractions, especially in high-throughput scenarios or when dealing with very specific claim types. The UserManager, while convenient, isn't always the most performant or flexible solution for every claims update operation.

The core issue boils down to understanding how claims are actually stored and accessed within the authentication pipeline. In essence, claims are typically serialized into an authentication cookie or token (often a JWT). When a user is authenticated, these claims are deserialized and stored in the `ClaimsPrincipal` associated with the user's HttpContext. To update these claims, we need to manipulate this `ClaimsPrincipal` directly, and then signal the authentication system that it needs to re-serialize this updated state, essentially overwriting the existing cookie or token.

Now, a common misconception is that directly modifying the Claims collection within the `ClaimsPrincipal` magically persists the changes. It doesn't. The `ClaimsPrincipal` represents the *current* user's claims *for that request*. To persist changes, we need to interact with the authentication middleware, specifically by re-issuing the authentication cookie or token. This is where things can get interesting because you have to manage this process carefully to avoid session invalidation issues.

In my experience, a few critical steps are necessary. First, locate the relevant authentication cookie or token. Second, get an access point to modify the existing claims collection. Third, issue a new authentication ticket with the updated claims. Let's dive into a few concrete scenarios to better understand the process:

**Scenario 1: Adding a New Claim**

Imagine you need to add a custom claim representing a user’s specific role within a specific application component after the initial login. This isn't part of their standard role membership, and it needs to be dynamic. Here's how you'd achieve that:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using System.Security.Claims;

public async Task UpdateClaimsPrincipal(HttpContext context, string newClaimType, string newClaimValue)
{
    var currentPrincipal = context.User;

    if (currentPrincipal == null || !currentPrincipal.Identity!.IsAuthenticated)
    {
      return; // nothing to update, not authenticated
    }

    var claimsIdentity = currentPrincipal.Identities.FirstOrDefault(x => x.IsAuthenticated) as ClaimsIdentity;
    if (claimsIdentity == null)
    {
        return; // could not find an authenticated claims identity
    }

    var newClaim = new Claim(newClaimType, newClaimValue);
    claimsIdentity.AddClaim(newClaim);


    await context.SignInAsync(
        CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        currentPrincipal,
        new AuthenticationProperties{ IsPersistent = true } // Important to use IsPersistent where appropriate
        );
}
```
In this example, we acquire the current `ClaimsPrincipal` from the `HttpContext`. We check for valid authentication. We access the first (and ideally only) authenticated `ClaimsIdentity`. We construct a new claim, add it to the existing identity, and call `SignInAsync`. `SignInAsync` is crucial because it handles re-issuing the authentication cookie or token, thereby persisting the changes we made to the claims. The `IsPersistent` on the `AuthenticationProperties` is used to ensure cookie expiry behavior is consistent, which you'll want to adjust based on how your cookies are configured. Remember to include the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies` packages for this example to work.

**Scenario 2: Modifying an Existing Claim**

Let's say we need to update the 'DisplayName' claim of a user based on a profile update. Here is how that looks:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Linq;

public async Task UpdateDisplayNameClaim(HttpContext context, string newDisplayName)
{
    var currentPrincipal = context.User;

     if (currentPrincipal == null || !currentPrincipal.Identity!.IsAuthenticated)
    {
      return; // nothing to update, not authenticated
    }

    var claimsIdentity = currentPrincipal.Identities.FirstOrDefault(x => x.IsAuthenticated) as ClaimsIdentity;
    if (claimsIdentity == null)
    {
      return; // could not find an authenticated claims identity
    }


    var displayNameClaim = claimsIdentity.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.Name);

    if (displayNameClaim != null)
    {
        claimsIdentity.RemoveClaim(displayNameClaim);
    }

    var newClaim = new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, newDisplayName);
    claimsIdentity.AddClaim(newClaim);

    await context.SignInAsync(
        CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        currentPrincipal,
        new AuthenticationProperties{ IsPersistent = true }
        );
}
```

Here, we find the existing 'DisplayName' claim using `FindFirst(ClaimTypes.Name)`. We remove it and then add the new claim. Once again, `SignInAsync` saves the updates. The important point here is to first remove the existing claim and replace it. This ensures consistency, especially if a claim can only exist once, as is the case for `ClaimTypes.Name`.

**Scenario 3: Removing a Claim**

Sometimes, you need to remove a specific claim entirely. Let's see how to remove a specific feature flag claim:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Linq;


public async Task RemoveFeatureFlagClaim(HttpContext context, string claimTypeToRemove)
{
    var currentPrincipal = context.User;
     if (currentPrincipal == null || !currentPrincipal.Identity!.IsAuthenticated)
    {
      return; // nothing to update, not authenticated
    }

    var claimsIdentity = currentPrincipal.Identities.FirstOrDefault(x => x.IsAuthenticated) as ClaimsIdentity;
    if (claimsIdentity == null)
    {
        return;
    }


    var claimToRemove = claimsIdentity.FindFirst(claimTypeToRemove);
    if(claimToRemove != null)
    {
        claimsIdentity.RemoveClaim(claimToRemove);
    }

    await context.SignInAsync(
        CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        currentPrincipal,
        new AuthenticationProperties{ IsPersistent = true }
        );
}
```

The process mirrors the previous example: we find the claim using `FindFirst`. We remove it if it exists. We then re-issue the authentication ticket with the updated claims by calling `SignInAsync`, ensuring the cookie or token is updated.

In all these scenarios, we are bypassing the UserManager but staying within the bounds of the authentication middleware. This approach requires understanding that directly modifying the `ClaimsPrincipal` doesn't persist changes unless you re-issue the authentication ticket via `SignInAsync`.

For further reading on this topic, I would highly recommend starting with the official ASP.NET Core documentation on authentication and authorization, specifically the sections on cookie authentication. A deeper dive into the `System.Security.Claims` namespace will be immensely helpful. For understanding JWTs, "JSON Web Tokens" by John Bradley, Nat Sakimura, and Michael Jones provides an excellent technical overview. Additionally, look into "Programming ASP.NET Core" by Dino Esposito for a broad and in-depth practical application. Remember to always stay updated with the latest official documentation from Microsoft, as it frequently evolves with the .NET ecosystem.

These code examples should provide a solid foundation for updating claims directly. Remember to adapt these snippets to your specific context; error handling, logging, and proper claim type management are crucial in production code. By properly using `SignInAsync`, you can effectively manage claims without needing the UserManager’s abstraction layer when it is not needed, offering more flexibility and improved performance for specialized use cases.
