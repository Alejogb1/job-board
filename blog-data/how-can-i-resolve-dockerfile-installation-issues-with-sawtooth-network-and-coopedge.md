Alright,  Sawtooth network setups within Docker, especially when you introduce CoopEdge, can indeed present some unique challenges during the build process. I've certainly spent my share of late nights debugging seemingly nonsensical build failures, and more often than not, it boils down to nuances in how Dockerfiles interact with the specifics of these platforms. It’s less about fundamental Docker problems and more about subtle version conflicts, dependency mismatches, and the intricacies of Sawtooth's distributed architecture.

From my experience, these issues typically manifest during three key phases of the Dockerfile build: the base image selection, package installations, and finally, the configuration and setup of the Sawtooth and CoopEdge components themselves. Getting each of these right is essential.

First, let’s discuss the base image. Don't just grab the latest of everything. The official Sawtooth documentation, particularly the sections on Docker deployments, will often recommend a specific version of Ubuntu or a Debian derivative. Sticking to this recommendation is often the simplest route. Often, the latest Ubuntu may contain updates that conflict with the older Sawtooth components. I’ve seen this firsthand where newer system libraries caused incompatibilities with the ledger’s C++ bindings, requiring a lot of manual intervention to pinpoint and rectify. So, begin with a concrete, specified base image, *not* just `FROM ubuntu:latest`.

Second, package installation, in my experience, is where the majority of the frustrations lie. Sawtooth and CoopEdge depend on specific versions of Python, typically 3.6 or 3.7, along with a host of libraries like libzmq3-dev, protobuf, and various python-dev packages. The default repositories in your base image might have slightly newer versions than what’s expected by the frameworks. So, it’s critical to use a `RUN apt-get update` followed by `RUN apt-get install -y` with specific version numbers where needed, especially for things like Python and protobuf. Further, it's wise to install the development packages first, even if you aren't doing development in the container. This can avoid subtle issues later during the Python package installation phase. Moreover, the `pip` versions included might be incompatible with your `requirements.txt`, leading to weird dependency conflicts. Explicitly installing the desired `pip` version using `python -m pip install pip==<version>` can avoid this. In CoopEdge’s case, remember that often, it includes specific python libraries that must align with your Sawtooth node setup.

Third, and this is where things often become quite nuanced, consider the order in which you set up the Sawtooth and CoopEdge network components. The simplest case is when you have a validator, and maybe a REST-API. But even then, ensure that your Dockerfile doesn’t attempt to start services before the required packages are installed and properly configured. I’ve seen countless issues when the node attempt to start up before the network is properly set up and that is often due to the container attempting to run parts of its startup script before all dependencies are installed. This can lead to confusing error messages that point to the wrong root cause. It may sound simple, but using the `&&` within the `RUN` commands is essential for avoiding these sorts of problems, especially when cleaning up installation files. For example, `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y packageA packageB && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` is far better than using multiple RUN commands as it consolidates all these commands within one layer of the docker image making the image smaller.

Let’s get to the code examples. Here are three snippets that highlight some typical approaches and illustrate potential resolutions for these problems.

**Snippet 1: Basic Sawtooth Validator Setup**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:18.04

# Install prerequisites for sawtooth
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    libzmq3-dev \
    protobuf-compiler \
    wget \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install a specific version of pip, to avoid potential issues with the default
RUN python3 -m pip install pip==20.0.2

# Install Python dependencies for Sawtooth
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy over the sawtooth configuration files
COPY sawtooth-validator.toml /etc/sawtooth/sawtooth-validator.toml
COPY genesis.batch /etc/sawtooth/genesis.batch

# Configure and Run the validator
WORKDIR /
COPY entrypoint.sh .
RUN chmod +x entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["./entrypoint.sh"]

```

Here, you see the core elements: specific image version, install packages, specific pip version, install python requirements, copy configuration, and execute. `entrypoint.sh` is a separate file that manages starting up the sawtooth validator in the correct order after all setup is complete. This script should contain, at least, the command to run `sawtooth-validator`. This script is crucial to correctly configure the entry point to the container and to avoid problems with process management when Docker runs the container.

**Snippet 2: Adding CoopEdge with Specific Versioning**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Install base dependencies for both Sawtooth and CoopEdge
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    libzmq3-dev \
    protobuf-compiler \
    wget \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*


# Install a specific version of pip, to avoid potential issues with the default
RUN python3 -m pip install pip==21.0.1

# Install python dependencies for sawtooth
COPY sawtooth-requirements.txt ./
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r sawtooth-requirements.txt

# Install python dependencies for coop edge
COPY coopedge-requirements.txt ./
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r coopedge-requirements.txt

# Copy over sawtooth configuration
COPY sawtooth-validator.toml /etc/sawtooth/sawtooth-validator.toml
COPY genesis.batch /etc/sawtooth/genesis.batch

# Copy over coop edge configuration
COPY coopedge.json /opt/coopedge/coopedge.json

# Configure and Run everything
WORKDIR /
COPY entrypoint.sh .
RUN chmod +x entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["./entrypoint.sh"]
```

In this version, I’ve added a separate `coopedge-requirements.txt`. This helps avoid polluting the dependencies and maintains clearer dependency separation. Notice the additional dependency, `curl`. I've seen that CoopEdge often requires this and it is often a silent failure during development.

**Snippet 3: Addressing potential pathing and configuration issues**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    libzmq3-dev \
    protobuf-compiler \
    wget \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN python3 -m pip install pip==21.3.1

# Set environment variables often necessary for sawtoth and coopedge.
ENV PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/coopedge/
ENV SAWTOOTH_HOME=/etc/sawtooth

# install python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
COPY sawtooth-validator.toml $SAWTOOTH_HOME/sawtooth-validator.toml
COPY genesis.batch $SAWTOOTH_HOME/genesis.batch
COPY coopedge.json /opt/coopedge/coopedge.json

RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

This third example introduces some environmental variables that are essential when running coop edge. I've seen a lot of people getting stuck on this as the specific paths that the framework use may not be the same in the container as outside and this needs to be addressed. Remember the python path needs to include the CoopEdge installation path.

For further, more in-depth study, I recommend the official Sawtooth documentation from Hyperledger, particularly the sections on setting up validator nodes and transaction processors. For CoopEdge specific issues, reviewing their documentation is equally important. Books such as "Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton can provide a deeper understanding of Docker internals, which is invaluable when diagnosing issues. Also, "Programming Python" by Mark Lutz provides a comprehensive overview of Python, which is crucial for understanding the dependency issues that may arise.

Ultimately, debugging Dockerfile issues is less about luck and more about methodically isolating the source of the problem. Always start with the base image, carefully manage dependencies, and meticulously configure the network components. And do not forget to consult the documentation for the specific frameworks!
