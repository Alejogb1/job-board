well, this looks like a fairly common issue when you're dealing with relational databases and the sometimes tricky nature of `has_one :through` associations in rails. i've definitely tripped over this one a few times myself, so i can relate to the head-scratching. let's break it down and see how we can get things working smoothly.

it seems like you've got a setup where you're trying to update a record that's linked via a `has_one :through` association, but the join table you're using looks like it's designed for a `has_many :through` relationship. this mismatch is likely where the problem lies, and it's causing headaches. i've seen this particular pattern rear its ugly head in projects more often than it should. in my early days, i once spent a whole afternoon debugging a similar problem, only to discover i'd completely misunderstood the subtle difference between how `has_one` and `has_many` manage their join tables. it was painful, but a good learning experience.

let's illustrate it with a made-up example of courses, students and enrollments. imagine you have a `student` model, a `course` model, and a `enrollment` model which connects them. now, if you were doing a classic `has_many :through`, it would look like this:

```ruby
# app/models/student.rb
class Student < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments
  has_many :courses, through: :enrollments
end

# app/models/course.rb
class Course < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments
  has_many :students, through: :enrollments
end

# app/models/enrollment.rb
class Enrollment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :student
  belongs_to :course
end
```
in this scenario, a student can have many courses through many enrollments. now, let's flip it, let's say you want to track the primary course of a student (like their major), which, in theory should be only one course.

that's when you would be tempted to do this:

```ruby
# app/models/student.rb
class Student < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments # keep this for sanity
  has_one :major_enrollment, class_name: 'Enrollment' # this is just to clarify there is a single major enrollment
  has_one :major_course, through: :major_enrollment, source: :course
end

# app/models/course.rb
class Course < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments
  has_many :students, through: :enrollments
end

# app/models/enrollment.rb
class Enrollment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :student
  belongs_to :course
end
```

you are probably thinking, that's it, problem solved! but here is where the gotcha is, because you are not specifying how the `major_enrollment` should get populated, nor the `major_course`, because `has_one :through` relationships, unlike `has_many :through`, expect a single associated record, they don't automatically handle multiple records in the join table. it needs a mechanism to tell which one is *the one*. this has_one association will not get created automatically, you need to specify how to select it.

the way to handle a `has_one :through` with a join table that *could* have many entries (similar to a has_many-style) involves adding a constraint, usually via a foreign key or some column that specifies which is *the one*. lets change the migrations to add a constraint that only a single enrollment can be the major enrollment:

```ruby
class CreateEnrollments < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :enrollments do |t|
      t.references :student, null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.references :course, null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.boolean :is_major, default: false
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

and now, lets change the model to specify how to retrieve that single major enrollment:

```ruby
# app/models/student.rb
class Student < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments
  has_one :major_enrollment, -> { where(is_major: true) }, class_name: 'Enrollment' # this scopes it down by the `is_major` boolean.
  has_one :major_course, through: :major_enrollment, source: :course
end
```

now, the `major_enrollment` association will only return the enrollment where `is_major` is set to true.

to update this association, you'll typically work with the `Enrollment` record directly. for instance, if you want to change a student's major, you'd need to first mark the current major enrollment as no longer the major, and then mark the new major enrollment as such. let's assume you have a student already persisted and enrolled in several courses, here is the method to change the major:

```ruby
  def change_major(new_major_course)
    # find current major and mark as no longer a major.
    current_major = self.major_enrollment
    current_major.update(is_major: false) if current_major

    # find the new enrollment or create if not exists, and set as a major
    new_enrollment = self.enrollments.find_or_create_by(course: new_major_course)
    new_enrollment.update(is_major: true)

    self.reload # to reload the associations and return the changed data.
  end
```

this ensures that only one enrollment will be marked as a major at a time. you need to ensure this logic is used when assigning the `major_course` association.

this example should highlight what's probably happening in your scenario. the critical piece is that the `has_one :through` association expects a single matching record in the intermediary join table. you need to establish a way to filter or select which of those records is the "one" that should be associated via your `has_one :through`.

you could also use a different kind of logic to select the one that should be selected, using a specific value of the join table, that might be more suitable to your problem domain. also, you can even use a different join table instead of using a boolean like i did on my example, depending on how flexible you need your models.

when it comes to deeper understanding of active record and relational databases i would recommend picking up "agile web development with rails" by sam ruby, david thomas, and david heinemeier hanson. it covers this kind of complex relationships in detail.

another classic that helped me a lot is "understanding relational databases" by fabian pascal, it's a bit older but the fundamentals never go out of style, and will make you understand the whole idea behind how relational databases work.

also, i found "refactoring databases" by scott w. ambler and pramod j. sadalage to be very insightful on how to handle migrations and database changes. it might help you a lot with the migration aspect of this problem.

you could find other solutions online, but those books cover all those topics extensively and will be a good investment. it will make you understand why rails handles relationships the way it does.

remember, it is  to have a bit of a headache sometimes! as a wise man once said: "why do programmers prefer dark mode? because light attracts bugs!" (had to get that one out of my system, sorry).

i hope this explanation and the code snippets help clarify how to handle `has_one :through` when your join table might contain multiple matching entries, and how to structure your update method. it took me a while to get the hang of this myself, so don't get too discouraged. just keep trying things out and you'll get there.
