Alright, let’s tackle this one. It’s a common challenge, especially when dealing with large datasets and resource-intensive models like BERT in pytorch. I remember a project back in my deep learning days where we were processing massive text corpora for a language model, and we hit this exact bottleneck. Getting data onto the GPU efficiently is absolutely critical for performance. So, let's break down the strategies, covering not only the how, but also the why behind them.

First off, the inherent problem: data loading and transfer between CPU and GPU can be a major performance bottleneck. Your GPU can crunch numbers like nobody’s business, but it's constantly waiting if it doesn't have the data it needs readily available. We're aiming to minimize that waiting time. This involves not only batching, but also smart data management on the cpu before it's transferred to the GPU. The standard, naive approach of loading each data point one by one and moving it over is, frankly, an exercise in inefficiency.

The key is to prepare data in batches on the cpu, then transfer entire batches to the GPU. Pytorch provides excellent tools for this purpose, particularly the `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` classes. Let’s start there. Your data loading pipeline should be a custom class inheriting from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. This class needs to implement two crucial methods: `__len__()` (to return the total number of data points) and `__getitem__(index)` (to return a single data point by its index).

Here's a simplified example. Imagine we have a dataset of text strings we want to use with a BERT model. For simplicity, we'll just represent the texts as a list of strings.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from transformers import BertTokenizer

class TextDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts, tokenizer, max_len):
        self.texts = texts
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_len = max_len

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.texts)

    def __getitem__(self, index):
      text = self.texts[index]
      encoded_input = self.tokenizer.encode_plus(
            text,
            add_special_tokens=True,
            max_length = self.max_len,
            padding='max_length',
            truncation=True,
            return_attention_mask=True,
            return_tensors='pt' #return pytorch tensors
        )
      return encoded_input['input_ids'].squeeze(0), encoded_input['attention_mask'].squeeze(0)

texts = ["This is the first sentence.", "Here's a second one, a bit longer.", "And yet another, just for good measure."]
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
dataset = TextDataset(texts, tokenizer, max_len = 128)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=False)

for input_ids, attention_mask in dataloader:
    print("Input IDs Shape:", input_ids.shape)
    print("Attention Mask Shape:", attention_mask.shape)

```

In this first snippet, I've created a `TextDataset` class that encapsulates text encoding. The important aspect here is how the data gets converted to `input_ids` and `attention_mask` using the tokenizer. crucially, we set `return_tensors='pt'` which outputs pytorch tensors directly from the tokenizer, avoiding unnecessary conversion steps later. Also note the `padding` and `truncation` are handled directly inside the dataset at the time of processing to prepare batches of the same length. This avoids processing overheads in the data loader.

Now, we use the `DataLoader` to actually create batches. The `DataLoader` handles the process of sampling, batching, and optionally shuffling the dataset. The batch size you choose greatly affects performance. Smaller batch sizes might fit in memory more easily, but might not fully utilize the GPU, and larger batch sizes, provided they fit in GPU memory, can lead to better performance up to a point, until you run out of memory and incur out-of-memory errors. Experimentation is key here.

The next crucial step is to get this data onto the GPU efficiently. When iterating through the `DataLoader`, you need to transfer each batch of data to the GPU. Here is a second code example that shows how to do this.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from transformers import BertTokenizer

class TextDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts, tokenizer, max_len):
        self.texts = texts
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_len = max_len

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.texts)

    def __getitem__(self, index):
      text = self.texts[index]
      encoded_input = self.tokenizer.encode_plus(
            text,
            add_special_tokens=True,
            max_length = self.max_len,
            padding='max_length',
            truncation=True,
            return_attention_mask=True,
            return_tensors='pt' #return pytorch tensors
        )
      return encoded_input['input_ids'].squeeze(0), encoded_input['attention_mask'].squeeze(0)

texts = ["This is the first sentence.", "Here's a second one, a bit longer.", "And yet another, just for good measure.", "Fourth text item", "Fifth one too!"]
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
dataset = TextDataset(texts, tokenizer, max_len = 128)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")

for input_ids, attention_mask in dataloader:
    input_ids = input_ids.to(device)
    attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)
    print("Input IDs Shape:", input_ids.shape)
    print("Attention Mask Shape:", attention_mask.shape)
    # Pass these to your model
    # model(input_ids, attention_mask = attention_mask)

```

Notice the changes here. We've added `device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")` to detect whether a GPU is available. Then, inside the loop, I'm using `.to(device)` to explicitly move the tensors to the GPU (if available), before they are passed to the model.  Without this step, the data processing will be done on the cpu which can bottleneck the entire process.

One more technique that improves performance significantly, especially with large datasets, is asynchronous data loading with multiple workers. By using `num_workers` in the `DataLoader`, you can leverage multiple cpu cores to prepare the next batch of data in parallel, while the GPU processes the current batch.

Here is a final code example to illustrate this:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from transformers import BertTokenizer
import time

class TextDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts, tokenizer, max_len):
        self.texts = texts
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_len = max_len

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.texts)

    def __getitem__(self, index):
      text = self.texts[index]
      encoded_input = self.tokenizer.encode_plus(
            text,
            add_special_tokens=True,
            max_length = self.max_len,
            padding='max_length',
            truncation=True,
            return_attention_mask=True,
            return_tensors='pt' #return pytorch tensors
        )
      return encoded_input['input_ids'].squeeze(0), encoded_input['attention_mask'].squeeze(0)

texts = ["This is the first sentence.", "Here's a second one, a bit longer.", "And yet another, just for good measure."] * 1000
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
dataset = TextDataset(texts, tokenizer, max_len = 128)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, num_workers = 4) # set num workers to 4

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")


start = time.time()
for input_ids, attention_mask in dataloader:
    input_ids = input_ids.to(device)
    attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)
    #print("Input IDs Shape:", input_ids.shape)
    #print("Attention Mask Shape:", attention_mask.shape)
    # Pass these to your model
    # model(input_ids, attention_mask = attention_mask)
end = time.time()
print(f"Time taken with num_workers: {end - start}")

start = time.time()
dataloader_without_workers = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, num_workers = 0)

for input_ids, attention_mask in dataloader_without_workers:
    input_ids = input_ids.to(device)
    attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)
    #print("Input IDs Shape:", input_ids.shape)
    #print("Attention Mask Shape:", attention_mask.shape)

end = time.time()
print(f"Time taken without num_workers: {end-start}")


```

In this final snippet, I’ve added `num_workers=4` (choose according to your CPU's cores) to `DataLoader`. I've also timed the data loading with and without workers to demonstrate the performance improvement. The use of multiple workers can reduce the CPU overhead, particularly when your data preprocessing is CPU-intensive (like text tokenization). The exact optimal number of workers will depend on the system, and you should experiment to find what works best. One must be careful not to over burden the CPU when many workers are used.

For further deep dives, I recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. These documents often come with detailed explanations and also additional performance considerations. Also a book called "Deep Learning with Pytorch" by Eli Stevens et al. is an excellent resource for understanding all aspects of pytorch. Additionally, reading research papers that introduce parallelization strategies in data loaders would be useful. For example, any papers from authors like J. Dean from Google on scalable data loading would prove beneficial. These are excellent resources that should elevate your proficiency in loading data effectively onto your GPU and handling the process. Efficient data loading is a cornerstone of high performance machine learning and its implementation is very specific to the dataset and the hardware.
