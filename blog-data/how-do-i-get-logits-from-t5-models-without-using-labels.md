Alright,  Logits from a T5 model without using labels – it's a common scenario, especially when you're moving beyond supervised training and into areas like unsupervised learning or generating custom outputs. I’ve run into this myself quite a few times while working on sequence-to-sequence projects, and it can get tricky if you're used to relying on the standard training loop with labels readily available.

The fundamental issue here is that, in a typical supervised training scenario, your model calculates logits based on the input *and* the target labels; during training, these logits are then used to compute the loss. When you *don’t* have labels, that backpropagation step goes out the window – you're left with the raw, unadulterated output of the model. Let's clarify what we mean by "logits." In the context of a transformer model like T5, logits are the raw, pre-softmax output scores from the final linear layer of the model for each token in the output sequence. They represent the model's unnormalized prediction for each token in the vocabulary. When we want probabilities, we apply softmax to these logits, but raw logits are what we need in cases where we aren't doing standard classification.

Now, there are several reasons why you might need these logits without labels. Maybe you're implementing a custom decoding algorithm, exploring the model's uncertainty, or doing some form of contrastive learning. Regardless, getting the logits is about extracting a specific intermediate output from the model's forward pass.

The typical T5 implementation in libraries like `transformers` from Hugging Face assumes you're going to use it with labels, and it will process them internally. If you try to pass an input without labels during a typical forward pass, you’ll encounter a failure because the loss function is expecting them. To bypass this, you need to explicitly tell the model to just give us the raw logits without calculating the loss. We'll need to invoke the model's forward function slightly differently. Specifically, we’ll pass `return_dict=True` and not specify `labels` in the forward pass. This lets the model know we're interested in accessing the outputs directly, rather than expecting a loss to be calculated.

Let's dive into some code examples to solidify this. We'll be using `transformers`, as it's the most common library people use with T5.

**Example 1: Basic Logit Extraction**

This snippet demonstrates the bare minimum you need to get logits from a T5 model for a given input without passing labels.

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

# Load the pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Input text for which you want logits
input_text = "translate English to German: Hello, how are you?"

# Tokenize the input text
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate the output without labels and retrieve the logits
with torch.no_grad():
  outputs = model(**inputs, return_dict=True)

# Extract the logits from the output
logits = outputs.logits

# The variable 'logits' now contains a tensor of raw scores.
print(f"Shape of logits: {logits.shape}")
```

In this example, we’re avoiding the standard supervised process by omitting `labels` from the model's forward call. Notice the use of `with torch.no_grad():`, which is important because we don't want gradients calculated during this inference phase. The `return_dict=True` is critical as well, because it ensures that the output is a dictionary-like object, from which we can directly access `logits`. The output shape will be `[batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]`, where the last dimension represents the scores for each token in the vocabulary.

**Example 2: Decoding with Logits Instead of Predicted Tokens**

The standard generation method will apply a softmax operation and select the highest scoring tokens. When we need more control, we need to leverage the raw logits.

```python
import torch
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

input_text = "summarize: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The lazy dog wakes up and chases the fox."
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs, return_dict=True)
    logits = outputs.logits

# Let's apply a simple argmax to get token ids, as a demonstration (this is a less flexible approach)
predicted_token_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)
decoded_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(predicted_token_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)

print(f"Decoded text with argmax: {decoded_text}")

# Now, let's look at using logits to generate in a custom way, demonstrating a more advanced technique:
# Let's start with a special token, for example, the start-of-sequence token.
start_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id # we could use a different one here too

current_token_ids = torch.full((1,1), start_token_id, dtype=torch.long)  # Initialize with a start-of-sequence token.
generated_text_tokens = []

for _ in range(20): # Generates up to 20 new tokens for demonstration.
    with torch.no_grad():
      generation_inputs = { 'input_ids': inputs['input_ids'], 'decoder_input_ids': current_token_ids }
      gen_outputs = model(**generation_inputs, return_dict=True)
      gen_logits = gen_outputs.logits[:, -1, :] # get last logits

    next_token_id = torch.argmax(gen_logits, dim=-1)
    current_token_ids = torch.cat([current_token_ids, next_token_id.unsqueeze(1)], dim=1)
    generated_text_tokens.append(next_token_id.item())

decoded_custom_text = tokenizer.decode(generated_text_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(f"Custom decoded text: {decoded_custom_text}")
```

In this case, we're demonstrating how the raw logits, rather than the decoded output, can be the starting point for custom text generation, including a simple `argmax` to get predicted tokens as well as a more detailed example of building a sequence token by token using the logits as a decision mechanism. In real world applications you might use things like beam search or a sampling based method for selecting the next token given these logits.

**Example 3: Extracting Logits from a Batch of Inputs**

Here’s an example demonstrating batch processing, essential for efficient computation.

```python
import torch
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

input_texts = [
    "translate English to French: Hello, world!",
    "summarize: This is a very long sentence about a very important topic, but let's make it shorter.",
    "question: What is the capital of France?"
]

inputs = tokenizer(input_texts, padding=True, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs, return_dict=True)
    logits = outputs.logits

print(f"Shape of logits: {logits.shape}")
```

Here, we use a list of texts and the tokenizer’s `padding=True` to ensure all input sequences in the batch are the same length. The model will then process them together, resulting in a logits tensor where the first dimension reflects the batch size. This is important because using batches lets your GPU (or whatever compute resource you use) make more efficient calculations.

Regarding further learning, I'd strongly recommend getting familiar with the core transformers concepts outlined in the original "Attention is All You Need" paper by Vaswani et al. (2017), the foundational work that spawned the entire transformer architecture. For a more practical and in-depth exploration of sequence-to-sequence models and their implementation, I would suggest “Natural Language Processing with Transformers” by Tunstall et al. (2022). It offers a good blend of theoretical background and practical applications, including the use of T5 and other transformer models.

In summary, extracting logits from a T5 model without labels involves bypassing the loss calculation by omitting `labels` from your forward pass. You also need `return_dict=True` to access the outputs directly. Once you have the logits, you're able to use them as input to other parts of your pipeline or in any custom way you see fit. Remember to always perform inference with `torch.no_grad()` to avoid unnecessary gradient calculations, and understand the implications of raw logits vs softmax probabilities. Good luck experimenting, it’s the best way to understand how these things work at a deep level.
