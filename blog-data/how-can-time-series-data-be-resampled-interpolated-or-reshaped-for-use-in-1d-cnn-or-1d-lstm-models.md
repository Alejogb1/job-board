Alright, let's tackle this. From my experience, handling time-series data for deep learning, particularly for 1D convolutional or LSTM networks, often requires a good amount of preprocessing. It's not uncommon to encounter datasets with inconsistent sampling rates or shapes that don't quite fit the input expectations of these models. So, let me walk you through some techniques I've found effective, focusing on resampling, interpolation, and reshaping.

First off, understand that the goal is to prepare your time-series data so it becomes both compatible with the neural network architecture and beneficial for learning. A common issue is that your signal may not be sampled at a rate that's optimal or even consistent across different instances of the same phenomenon. Resampling addresses this directly. It's essentially converting your data from one sampling rate to another. We've got a couple of main approaches here: upsampling, which increases the sampling rate, effectively adding more data points, and downsampling, which does the opposite.

In one project, I had sensor data being recorded at irregular intervals due to a hardware hiccup, some readings were coming in at 10hz and some at 100hz. We needed a constant 50hz for our CNN and so, resampling became paramount. It would have been far easier if all data was consistent but, well, the real world throws curveballs. When performing resampling I generally lean toward functions available through `scipy.signal`, which provides robust tools like `resample` and `resample_poly`. While ‘resample’ provides direct change of rates (e.g. 100 Hz to 50 Hz), it's often better to utilize ‘resample_poly’ to upsample and downsample in stages using least common multiples for better aliasing suppression, especially if the required rate is a large factor from the original.

Here’s a quick example of downsampling:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import resample_poly

def downsample_signal(signal, original_rate, target_rate):
    """
    Downsamples a signal to a new rate using resample_poly.

    Args:
        signal (np.ndarray): The input time-series data.
        original_rate (int): The original sampling rate.
        target_rate (int): The desired sampling rate.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The downsampled signal.
    """
    gcd_rate = np.gcd(original_rate, target_rate)
    up_factor = target_rate // gcd_rate
    down_factor = original_rate // gcd_rate
    resampled_signal = resample_poly(signal, up=up_factor, down=down_factor)
    return resampled_signal


original_data = np.random.rand(1000)
original_sampling_rate = 100
target_sampling_rate = 50

downsampled_data = downsample_signal(original_data, original_sampling_rate, target_sampling_rate)

print(f"Original data length: {len(original_data)}, New Data Length: {len(downsampled_data)}")
```

Next, let's consider interpolation. Where resampling changes the sample rate, interpolation usually focuses on estimating values at specific points within or beyond existing data points. This often comes into play when dealing with missing data. While you could simply remove segments with missing values, this is wasteful. So, techniques such as linear or cubic interpolation can be incredibly helpful, provided the missing data isn't too extensive. For instance, if you've lost a few data points in a sensor stream, a linear interpolation can usually bridge the gap without distorting the signal substantially, especially when the underlying process is smooth and continuous.

However, using interpolation techniques is often subjective. Sometimes it's necessary, sometimes it's not. For larger stretches of missing data, you might need to explore more complex methods such as spline interpolation or even a process called Gaussian process regression, but that's outside the realm of what's typical for preprocessing a dataset. When you use interpolation, be mindful of introducing bias. If you're extrapolating too far or handling missing data with insufficient domain knowledge, you can easily distort your signal, which could result in your models learning the wrong patterns. I’ve seen cases where using the simplest, linear interpolation when the underlying data was far from linear, can drastically change results for the worse.

Here’s an example of linear interpolation:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

def interpolate_missing_data(signal, missing_indices):
    """
    Interpolates missing values in a signal using linear interpolation.

    Args:
        signal (np.ndarray): The input time-series data with NaNs for missing values.
        missing_indices (np.ndarray): The indices of missing values to interpolate.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The signal with interpolated values.
    """
    existing_indices = np.where(~np.isnan(signal))[0]
    existing_values = signal[existing_indices]
    interpolator = interp1d(existing_indices, existing_values, kind='linear', fill_value="extrapolate")
    interpolated_signal = interpolator(np.arange(len(signal)))
    return interpolated_signal

signal_with_missing = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, np.nan, 6, 7, 8, np.nan, 10,11,12])
missing_indices = np.where(np.isnan(signal_with_missing))[0]
interpolated_signal = interpolate_missing_data(signal_with_missing, missing_indices)
print(f"Interpolated Data: {interpolated_signal}")
```

Finally, let’s talk about reshaping. This step is about modifying the data’s structure to align with the neural network’s input layer. Both 1D CNNs and LSTMs generally expect a 3D tensor as input. The dimensions would typically be something like `(number_of_samples, time_steps, features)`. For univariate time series, ‘features’ may equal 1, for multivariate time series, the ‘feature’ dimension will be higher.

Often the raw data arrives in a 2D format, perhaps as a flat list. This means reshaping or, more specifically, windowing. Windowing involves taking chunks of the raw time series and creating individual samples for the model. The size of the window depends on the signal and how the network is going to analyze patterns within that window. A related issue here is stride, which controls the overlap between successive windows. If it's set at the window size, there's no overlap. if it's less than window size, then adjacent windows will overlap. We have to be careful with the overlap though, too much overlap could introduce unwanted dependencies among the samples. These windows create the ‘time steps’ for our model.

Here’s a quick example of windowing:

```python
import numpy as np

def create_windows(signal, window_size, stride):
    """
    Creates a sequence of overlapping windows from a time-series signal.

    Args:
        signal (np.ndarray): The input time-series data.
        window_size (int): The size of each window.
        stride (int): The stride between consecutive windows.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: An array of windows.
    """
    num_windows = (len(signal) - window_size) // stride + 1
    windows = np.zeros((num_windows, window_size))
    for i in range(num_windows):
        start = i * stride
        end = start + window_size
        windows[i] = signal[start:end]
    return windows


raw_data = np.arange(1, 101)
window_size = 10
stride = 2

windows = create_windows(raw_data, window_size, stride)
print(f"Number of windows: {windows.shape[0]}, Window Length: {windows.shape[1]}")
print(f"Shape of resulting tensor: {windows.shape}")

```
For further reading on the theory behind signal processing, I'd recommend starting with "Digital Signal Processing" by Proakis and Manolakis, which is a solid foundational text. For more advanced techniques and implementations using python, I’d recommend anything by the likes of Alan V. Oppenheim and Steven W. Smith. Their work is extensive, covering a broad spectrum of signal analysis. Be sure to cross-reference these texts with more modern texts that delve into deep learning, to bridge the gap between fundamental theory and modern AI models.

In summary, resampling, interpolation, and reshaping are not independent steps but should be chosen and combined thoughtfully to prepare your data for 1D CNNs or LSTMs. The exact methods will depend heavily on the specifics of your data and the goals of your model, but focusing on these core principles should provide a decent foundation for handling time series effectively.
