Okay, so, let's unpack this. It's not as straightforward as simply copying a block of text, that's for sure. I remember dealing with a similar problem years ago when I was part of a team working on a custom deep learning framework. We needed to introspect user-defined network architectures to apply automated performance optimizations, but executing the user's code was out of the question for security and stability concerns. It forced us to really dive into the mechanisms of how these frameworks construct networks.

The key here is to focus on the *declarative* aspect of neural network construction rather than the imperative execution. Most modern deep learning frameworks, such as tensorflow, pytorch, and keras, employ a symbolic approach to defining neural networks. This means that the user's code primarily establishes a *graph* of operations rather than actually performing computations during the construction phase. This graph represents the structure of the network—layers, activation functions, connections, etc.—and it's this symbolic representation that we can target for extraction.

We achieve this by intercepting or analyzing the framework's internal mechanisms for building this computational graph. There are several ways this can be tackled, varying in complexity and the amount of information you can reliably extract. For instance, one fairly reliable approach is to analyze the function calls and object creations involved in defining the model. Let's illustrate with an example that mirrors what i experienced in a more simplified scenario:

```python
# Example 1:  Simplified PyTorch Model Construction
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(20, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleNet()

# Hypothetical function to extract the layer structure
def extract_layers_from_pytorch(model):
    layers = []
    for name, module in model.named_children():
        if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):
            layers.append({'type': 'linear', 'in_features': module.in_features, 'out_features': module.out_features})
        elif isinstance(module, nn.ReLU):
            layers.append({'type': 'relu'})
    return layers

extracted_layers = extract_layers_from_pytorch(model)
print(extracted_layers)
```

In this first example, we've focused on intercepting the construction of a PyTorch model by simply traversing the `named_children()` of a model object. This technique only gives information about the layers defined directly within the module's `__init__` function; it will not capture layers within another sub-module, for example. It assumes certain naming conventions and will require specific checks based on the model structure.

Another path, particularly useful when dealing with dynamically generated network architectures or those defined using more complex custom classes, involves using symbolic execution or abstract interpretation techniques. This delves into the creation of the graph at a lower level. These advanced methods parse the code that instantiates the layers, and capture the intent, without actually executing the forward propagation step. This enables a more robust capture of the model structure. The code below uses a lightweight inspection:

```python
# Example 2:  Tensorflow/Keras Layer Inspection

import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

def extract_layers_from_keras(model):
    layers = []
    for layer in model.layers:
        layer_config = layer.get_config()
        if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.Dense):
            layers.append({
                'type': 'dense',
                'units': layer_config['units'],
                'activation': layer_config['activation'],
                'input_shape': layer_config.get('batch_input_shape', None)
                 })
        # You could extend this to support other layer types as needed
    return layers

extracted_layers = extract_layers_from_keras(model)
print(extracted_layers)
```

Here, we are examining the `layer.get_config()` method for keras. This demonstrates a similar objective but leverages the way Keras layers are built. Each layer in Keras holds configuration details, which allow us to examine type, number of units or activations without explicit model execution. This is more resilient to variations in how a Keras model might be structured, as long as they rely on standard keras mechanisms.

Finally, and this is generally more cumbersome but can provide the most details, you can also utilize the framework's internal APIs for graph representations directly. For example, in TensorFlow, you can access the underlying graph proto through tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph().as_graph_def(). In PyTorch, you may need to trace a dummy input tensor and then analyze the resulting trace.

```python
# Example 3:  Extracting through a Tensorboard Graph visualization (PyTorch)

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

class ComplexNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ComplexNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * 7 * 7, 10) # Assume input of 28x28 image

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
      x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv2(x)))
      x = x.view(-1, 32 * 7 * 7)
      x = self.fc(x)
      return x

model = ComplexNet()
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 28, 28)

# Write a tensorboard log of the model structure
writer = SummaryWriter()
writer.add_graph(model, dummy_input)
writer.close()

print("Tensorboard log generated. Inspect in Tensorboard (e.g., via 'tensorboard --logdir runs') to get model information")
# The structure is now captured, you would need to parse this output instead of a programmatic response as in the other examples.
```

This final example doesn't produce a direct programmatic extract, but it demonstrates how frameworks like PyTorch create and expose a computation graph. The graph can then be parsed using Tensorboard. You could write a parser to pull layer details from a tensorboard graph file programmatically; this technique is generally useful if the other approaches become too cumbersome for complex model definitions.

A few closing points: Frameworks are constantly evolving. Your implementation might need to be adjusted with new releases. For more detailed approaches, i’d recommend looking into papers on static analysis of machine learning frameworks. Specifically, research on symbolic execution applied to deep learning models or abstract interpretation techniques can provide a sound theoretical foundation for this kind of extraction. Also, any of the framework's respective documentation related to graph representation will be beneficial. For instance, TensorFlow's GraphDef proto or PyTorch's tracing and jit modules offer insights. I would specifically suggest reviewing documentation on the `torch.jit` and the way `torch.export` is used. Understanding the underlying mechanism a framework provides and keeping up to date will allow for the most reliable extractions. The book "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet provides a good overview of the conceptual aspects of frameworks as well. Lastly, testing against a wide variety of model structures would be critical to catch any edge cases.
