Alright, let's talk about standardizing dataset columns without resorting to vectorization or machine learning—a problem I've encountered more times than I care to count, usually when I'm knee-deep in data pipelines that need to be lightning-fast and lightweight. There are definitely scenarios where applying techniques from machine learning is overkill; sometimes, good old fashioned data manipulation gets the job done efficiently. And no, we don't need neural networks for this.

The core issue here is that different columns in a dataset can have vastly different scales. Think of it: one column might represent age in years, ranging from 0 to 100 (or more), while another could represent a probability between 0 and 1. Without standardization, any downstream calculation that treats these columns equally can get seriously skewed, causing all sorts of headaches. The problem is especially noticeable when using distance-based algorithms or statistical analyses.

So, without vectorization, which often involves numpy arrays, or sophisticated machine learning, what options do we have? We have several valid techniques. Let’s explore the most common and useful, with some actual code examples to make the concept more concrete.

First, the straightforward **Min-Max scaling**. This method scales all values in a column to a range, typically between 0 and 1. The formula is quite simple: `(x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))`. For each value `x`, we subtract the minimum value of the column and then divide by the range of that column. The key here is that you are doing this at the column level, individually.

```python
def min_max_scale(column):
    min_val = min(column)
    max_val = max(column)
    if max_val == min_val:
        return [0.0] * len(column)  # handle case where range is zero
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in column]

# example usage
data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
scaled_data = min_max_scale(data)
print(f"Min-Max Scaled: {scaled_data}") # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

data2 = [10,10,10,10]
scaled_data2 = min_max_scale(data2)
print(f"Min-Max Scaled: {scaled_data2}") # Output: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

```

This function performs min-max scaling on a single list representing a column. Notice that if the minimum and maximum values are the same, we need to handle this to avoid a division by zero. We handle it here by outputting a column with all zeros. You could also choose to skip that column in such a case, or other alternative logic; it is really dependent on your specific application. This is a fundamental technique and is useful in several cases where you need to bring data into a limited range.

Next, we have **Standardization**, or z-score normalization. This is one I reach for the most. It transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The formula is: `(x - mean(x)) / std(x)`. This effectively centers the data around zero, making it easier for algorithms that are sensitive to different scales.

```python
import statistics

def standardize(column):
    mean_val = statistics.mean(column)
    std_dev = statistics.stdev(column)
    if std_dev == 0:
        return [0.0] * len(column) #handle case where standard deviation is zero
    return [(x - mean_val) / std_dev for x in column]


# example usage
data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
standardized_data = standardize(data)
print(f"Standardized: {standardized_data}") # Output: [-1.4142135623730951, -0.7071067811865476, 0.0, 0.7071067811865476, 1.4142135623730951]

data2 = [10,10,10,10]
standardized_data2 = standardize(data2)
print(f"Standardized: {standardized_data2}") # Output: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

Similar to Min-Max scaling, this Python function performs standardization for a single column. We're using Python's `statistics` module to calculate the mean and standard deviation. Again, we add a check for a zero standard deviation as division by zero would cause a problem. We treat this case by returning a column of all zeroes. This is common when dealing with data of uniform values.

Lastly, there's the **Robust Scaling**. This is less common in my experience but very useful when dealing with outliers in the data. It uses the median and interquartile range (IQR) to scale the data. It’s more resistant to the effect of outliers compared to using the mean and standard deviation. The formula is: `(x - median(x)) / IQR(x)`.

```python
import statistics

def robust_scale(column):
    median_val = statistics.median(column)
    q1 = statistics.quantiles(column, n=4)[0]
    q3 = statistics.quantiles(column, n=4)[2]
    iqr = q3 - q1
    if iqr == 0:
        return [0.0] * len(column) #handle case where IQR is zero
    return [(x - median_val) / iqr for x in column]


# example usage
data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 100] # outlier at 100
robust_scaled_data = robust_scale(data)
print(f"Robust Scaled: {robust_scaled_data}") # Output: [-0.5, -0.25, 0.0, 0.25, 24.0]

data2 = [10,10,10,10]
robust_scaled_data2 = robust_scale(data2)
print(f"Robust Scaled: {robust_scaled_data2}") # Output: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

This `robust_scale` function implements robust scaling using median and IQR calculations. We use the `quantiles` function from the standard library, asking for four values to get our first and third quartile. Again, a check for an IQR of zero is handled as before. Notice how outliers affect robust scaling less than regular standardization. When you know your dataset has potential outliers, this method is preferred over standardization.

Now, I’ve seen issues in the past when forgetting to save scaling parameters used (the means, stds, min and max values). When you apply this scaling to a training set you need to scale the testing set using the training set parameters. The scaling is not a universal operation; it depends on your dataset. Make sure to remember this: data leakage is real, and it can seriously mess with your results if you do not apply transformations consistently.

When choosing a technique, the context of your problem matters. Min-Max scaling is great for data with a defined range. Standardization is fantastic for most statistical and machine-learning algorithms that assume data is roughly normally distributed. Robust scaling is a lifesaver when dealing with outliers. Each has its own properties and use case.

For further reading, I recommend examining the principles of exploratory data analysis presented in John Tukey’s *Exploratory Data Analysis*. Understanding how these methods came about and their purpose will deepen your understanding. Also, explore the statistical methods described in *Practical Statistics for Data Scientists* by Peter Bruce, Andrew Bruce, and Peter Gedeck. It offers a hands-on approach to these concepts that is very useful for practical applications in real world problems. Both are classics that have stood the test of time and provide very helpful background to understand these problems.

In conclusion, column standardization without vectorization or machine learning is not only possible, it is often the most sensible way to approach data preprocessing for many scenarios. These methods are fast, deterministic, and easy to implement without adding the complexity of machine learning libraries. In my experience, they're a vital part of my toolkit for data manipulation. It's not always about the newest, fanciest tool; sometimes, the basics get the job done just fine, and more efficiently.
