Okay, let's tackle this. Accessing a Docker container's web service from a Windows host isn't always as straightforward as it might seem initially, but it’s a common scenario. I've seen this tripping up both junior developers and sometimes, even experienced folks who haven’t spent a lot of time with the Docker ecosystem on windows. It's all about understanding the network layers at play.

Essentially, when you run a container, it's isolated in its own network namespace. Docker, by default, creates a virtual network for these containers, often referred to as the "bridge" network. This means the web server running inside your container isn’t directly accessible from your Windows host using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` on its exposed port.

The key lies in understanding how Docker exposes ports and how to route traffic to those exposed ports. Think of it like a port forwarding configuration on your home router, just localized to your machine. Docker provides different mechanisms for achieving this, but the primary one we'll focus on is port mapping, often specified using the `-p` flag during the `docker run` command.

The simplest scenario is mapping a container’s port directly to a specific port on the host. For instance, if your container’s web service listens on port 80 inside the container, you could map this to port 8080 on your host. That means requests directed to port 8080 on your Windows machine get forwarded to the container. This works but it can become unwieldy if you start running many containers or need specific configurations.

Here's where the practical bit comes in. I remember a project a few years back where we had numerous microservices running in containers, each exposing a web interface. Mapping each to a separate host port quickly led to port conflicts and a management nightmare. We moved to using Docker compose in the end which streamlined it.

So, let's delve into some code examples:

**Example 1: Basic Port Mapping**

Suppose you have a basic node.js application that serves a web page on port 3000 within your container. The following Docker command shows how to map port 3000 of the container to port 8080 on your Windows host.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:3000 my-node-app
```

In this example, `-d` runs the container in detached mode. `-p 8080:3000` performs the critical step of port mapping.  Now, when you open a browser on your windows host and go to `http://localhost:8080`, you’d expect to see your node.js application’s content. This is the most basic use-case and while straightforward, it's not scalable for complex applications.

**Example 2: Using Docker Compose**

For more complex scenarios, Docker compose significantly improves the management. Consider a `docker-compose.yml` file for the same node.js application:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    image: my-node-app
    ports:
      - "8080:3000"
```

Here, the compose file defines a service called "web" using the same `my-node-app` image as before.  The `ports` section does the port mapping. Now you can use `docker compose up -d` to launch the container and the application will still be available at `http://localhost:8080`. I tend to favor this structure due to its scalability and clear separation of configuration. Compose allows us to define multiple container setups and make the overall deployment more reproducible. It helped in the microservices project I mentioned earlier. We moved everything to compose, and it made maintenance far more streamlined.

**Example 3: Host Network Mode**

Finally, there is another approach called host network mode. This mode makes the container share the host's network stack directly. This means the container would be accessible directly on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` using its exposed port number and avoids the need for specific port mapping. Be cautious with this as it bypasses some isolation provided by docker, but it’s useful in some very specific scenarios. You should consider the security implications before opting for this approach. It is not advisable for a majority of web applications as there is more potential for conflicts, however, this is included for completeness.

Here's how it looks in a docker command:

```bash
docker run -d --network host my-node-app
```

and in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    image: my-node-app
    network_mode: host
```

In this scenario, if your `my-node-app` listens on port 3000, you could now access the app directly on your host at `http://localhost:3000`. As I’ve mentioned before, this approach comes with trade-offs and should be employed carefully. In particular, if you're running multiple containers using the host network, you will need to avoid port conflicts.

**Beyond The Basics**

It’s critical to also check your Windows firewall settings. Sometimes, the firewall blocks connections to the mapped ports. You'll need to create rules to allow traffic to the ports exposed by the Docker container. The windows firewall is particularly sensitive if docker is not running or there are updates that require a restart. This has tripped me up on numerous occasions when debugging issues. I tend to use `docker compose down` and `docker compose up` to reset my containers if I encounter networking issues and check the windows firewall as a matter of course before delving deeper into the container itself.

Also, depending on your use-case, consider using docker volumes to persist application data which are a critical aspect of container management which isn't directly related to accessing web address from Windows, but equally important for your containerized application development lifecycle.

**Recommendations for Further Learning**

To deepen your understanding, I strongly recommend several resources:

* **"Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton:** This book provides an in-depth explanation of Docker concepts, including networking. It’s a practical and well-written guide that goes beyond the surface level.
* **Docker’s Official Documentation:** The official documentation is extensive and continuously updated. It’s an indispensable resource and should be at the top of your list. Start with the 'networking' section.
* **"Kubernetes in Action" by Marko Lukša:** While this is about Kubernetes, understanding Kubernetes networking concepts is extremely helpful for getting more context into how containers communicate within a cluster and this is often the next step in containerized development. This provides more advanced networking context.
* **Microsoft Docs on WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux):** If you're using WSL2, understanding how WSL2 interacts with Docker on Windows is also critical. This is often the underlying technology that docker for windows runs on, which makes understanding networking for wsl2 also helpful.

In conclusion, accessing a Docker container's web service on Windows primarily revolves around mapping ports correctly and understanding the network isolation Docker provides. Start with basic port mappings, then gradually move to using Docker compose for more complex applications. If you need to, leverage host network mode with caution. Always be sure to double-check windows firewall rules and read up on the various resources I've included to solidify your understanding.
