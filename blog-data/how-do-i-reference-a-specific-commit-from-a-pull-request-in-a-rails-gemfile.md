Alright, let's tackle this one. It's a scenario I’ve bumped into more times than I care to recall, often in the throes of rapid prototyping or debugging those particularly stubborn dependencies. Referencing a specific commit from a pull request directly in a `Gemfile` is a technique that’s useful, but also one that requires a bit of understanding of how Bundler handles these sorts of situations. It's not about simply pointing at the pull request itself; instead, you're pointing at the commit hash within the repository where that pull request resides.

Essentially, when you want to pin to a particular commit, you are bypassing the typical versioning conventions that gems use. This bypass can be crucial for testing a bug fix or a feature that hasn't been formally released yet. I recall a project years back, where we absolutely needed a specific feature from a gem that was being actively developed. We couldn’t wait for the official release, and referencing the specific commit from the relevant pull request was the fastest path to unblocking our team.

The process hinges on two components: the Git repository hosting the gem and the specific commit hash. Let's break it down practically. First, you’ll need the full Git URL of the gem’s repository. This usually looks something like `git@github.com:some-user/some-gem.git` for SSH or `https://github.com/some-user/some-gem.git` for HTTPS. Then, you need to identify the precise commit hash that corresponds to the changes you're targeting, not necessarily the pull request number, but the commit after the pull request has been merged into its target branch or is the last commit on the pull request's branch before a rebase.

Now, for the Gemfile syntax. The critical part here is the `:git` and `:ref` options within your gem declaration. Let's examine a few scenarios with accompanying code examples.

**Scenario 1: Referencing a commit on the main branch**

Let's suppose the desired fix or feature was merged onto the main branch, and the commit hash you need is `a1b2c3d4e5f6`. Your `Gemfile` entry would look like this:

```ruby
gem 'some_gem', git: 'https://github.com/some-user/some-gem.git', ref: 'a1b2c3d4e5f6'
```

In this straightforward case, Bundler will clone the repository at that specific commit. When Bundler performs `bundle install`, it will ignore any tagged versions and directly use the code at that particular hash. This is the simplest scenario, and it's pretty common when you're tracking the `main` branch.

**Scenario 2: Referencing a commit on a specific branch**

Sometimes, the commit isn't on the main branch; it's in a feature branch or a release branch. Let's imagine you're targeting a commit `f6e5d4c3b2a1` from a branch named `feature-x`. The Gemfile would adjust slightly, like this:

```ruby
gem 'some_gem', git: 'https://github.com/some-user/some-gem.git', branch: 'feature-x', ref: 'f6e5d4c3b2a1'
```

Notice the addition of the `branch` key. This tells Bundler which branch to pull from before locking to the specified commit. Without the branch specification, Bundler would default to the repository's default branch, which may or may not contain your desired commit.

**Scenario 3: Referencing a commit on a specific branch that is constantly rebased**

Now, let’s tackle something more complex. Sometimes, the branch you’re pointing at, such as a feature branch still undergoing active development, is subject to frequent rebases. Each rebase, of course, will change the commit history of that branch and likely will also change commit hashes on that branch. This can lead to `Gemfile.lock` conflicts and build failures, even though the code you require might be, functionally, the same. To alleviate this, one way would be to reference a specific tag or a stable point in that branch instead of the latest commit, if available. If tagging is not possible, you could specify a commit hash as before. However, you need to be aware that your gemfile would become brittle because changes in the branch could invalidate your reference and require a lock update with a new commit hash.

```ruby
# In this case, we point to a specific commit on a branch which we know will not
# be changed, or is close to a stable point. This method is brittle and you
# need to keep an eye on these kinds of gem references
gem 'some_gem', git: 'https://github.com/some-user/some-gem.git', branch: 'feature-x', ref: '1a2b3c4d5e6f'
```

The crucial aspect here is that while the commit is targeted correctly, you should be prepared to update the commit reference if the branch history changes. I would recommend, as a general practice, being quite careful with referencing a commit in a branch that’s under active rebase. Whenever possible, aim for stable references like tagged commits, or get the maintainer of that gem to create a stable branch that contains the exact commit that you are targeting.

Several things are critical to consider when using this approach. First, `Gemfile.lock` plays a vital role in ensuring consistent builds. Bundler saves the commit hashes in `Gemfile.lock`, so whenever your team updates their gem bundles, they retrieve the same revisions as before. If you update the commit reference in the `Gemfile`, you must also re-run `bundle install` to update the `Gemfile.lock`. Additionally, keep an eye on the git repository itself. If the repository is inaccessible or has been removed, Bundler will be unable to fetch the specified commit and your build will fail. Therefore, this method works best with internally hosted or private repositories over which you have some level of control.

Also note that the commit you reference should contain all necessary dependencies of the gem. If it relies on a separate private repository, you might need to include that as well. Another potential issue to watch out for is when the repository's structure changes, for example, moving the `gemspec`. In such scenarios, the referenced commit might be pointing to code that's no longer functional within the gem.

For further exploration, I’d highly recommend delving into the Bundler documentation itself, which is the definitive source of information on all its functionalities. Specifically, look at the section detailing how Bundler handles Git dependencies. Additionally, the book "The Ruby Programming Language" by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto provides a detailed explanation of Ruby's module system, which can be helpful in understanding why gem dependencies need to be locked. Lastly, the "Pro Git" book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub is a solid resource to understand how commit history works within Git and how the concept of rebase can have an effect on your gem lock file. I have found these resources instrumental in my own understanding and practice, so I hope they can be as helpful for you.

In conclusion, referencing a specific commit from a pull request in your `Gemfile` is possible and can be extremely beneficial in certain development scenarios. However, use it with prudence and a full understanding of the implications. It’s a powerful tool, but like any powerful tool, it requires a good grasp of the fundamentals to ensure consistent, reliable results.
