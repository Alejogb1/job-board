Let's tackle this head-on. I’ve seen this issue crop up more times than I care to remember, and it almost always boils down to a few specific, often interconnected, problems when trying to get NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to play nicely with OpenAI Gym inside a Jupyter environment. It’s not a matter of one single error; it's usually a combination of environment quirks, configuration mishaps, and the inherent complexities of asynchronous operations inherent in this kind of setup.

First, let's dispense with the idea that Jupyter itself is inherently flawed for this purpose. It's not. Jupyter's just an intermediary, a user interface on top of a Python interpreter. However, that layer of abstraction can introduce wrinkles. The core issues typically revolve around process management, rendering difficulties, and often, the silent failure modes that can accompany evolving neural networks.

My early experiences with NEAT and Gym were particularly instructive. I vividly recall a project where we were trying to train a NEAT agent to navigate a simple environment. Locally, everything worked flawlessly. The moment we transitioned that to a remote Jupyter environment, it all fell apart. Agents would barely move, fitness values wouldn’t update correctly, and the whole training process just felt…broken. After a fair bit of painstaking investigation, the root causes became clear.

One common culprit is the lack of proper environment rendering within Jupyter. OpenAI Gym environments often rely on GUI-based rendering to visualize the simulation. If the backend X server isn't correctly configured or is missing altogether (as is frequently the case in remote server environments), the rendering fails silently, often leading to unexpected behavior. NEAT agents, while not directly dependent on the rendering for training in most implementations, may use rendered outputs to ascertain fitness. Without it, fitness evaluation often fails, or the environment crashes due to unexpected behavior.

Another frequent issue involves process management. NEAT implementations, by their nature, often involve creating new agents and running simulations in parallel. When you are running code directly in Jupyter, you're constrained by the notebook's single process. If your simulation isn't explicitly designed to operate within this single process constraint, you can see all kinds of weird, non-deterministic behaviour, race conditions, or simply crashes. This is particularly pronounced with some of the older NEAT libraries not well-suited for concurrent execution within a single process. The problem becomes more complex when dealing with environment resets that have underlying C++ code and are used within a single Python environment. They were never designed to run within the same scope in rapid succession.

Let’s dig into a few practical scenarios with code.

**Scenario 1: Missing Rendering Setup**

Assume we're using a simple cartpole environment. Here's how a typical NEAT-based training loop might look with a flawed rendering configuration inside Jupyter, assuming we have some core functions implemented to generate agents and evaluate fitness:

```python
import gym
import neat
import numpy as np

def eval_genome(genome, config):
  net = neat.nn.FeedForwardNetwork.create(genome, config)
  env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
  observation = env.reset()
  fitness = 0
  for _ in range(500):
    action = np.argmax(net.activate(observation))
    observation, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    fitness += reward
    if done:
        break
  env.close()
  return fitness

def run(config_path):
    config = neat.Config(neat.DefaultGenome, neat.DefaultReproduction,
                             neat.DefaultSpeciesSet, neat.DefaultStagnation,
                             config_path)
    pop = neat.Population(config)
    pop.add_reporter(neat.StdOutReporter(True))
    stats = neat.StatisticsReporter()
    pop.add_reporter(stats)
    winner = pop.run(eval_genome, 100) # assuming 100 generations for demonstration purposes
    return winner
#This main block will run if I am running it inside of a Python IDE.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    local_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    config_path = os.path.join(local_dir, 'config-feedforward.txt')
    winner = run(config_path)
    print('\nBest genome:\n{!s}'.format(winner))

```

In the above, the simulation itself will work but the display of the cartpole won't be visible or will cause an error. Now, how does this problem appear within Jupyter? Well, if the underlying display server is not set up or is missing, calls within the `env.step` function which trigger the backend rendering will fail. That can be silent or it can outright break. The error messages can be extremely misleading. I've often encountered errors related to X11 display issues or even seemingly random crashes due to missing dependencies.

**Solution (for missing x11 rendering) :** Setting up a virtual display. One approach is to use a library like `xvfbwrapper`. Adding the following at the beginning of my notebook often fixes such issues if I am on a server without a display:

```python
import os
from xvfbwrapper import Xvfb
vdisplay = Xvfb()
vdisplay.start()
os.environ['DISPLAY'] = 'localhost:0'
```
Then you can proceed running the other code within the notebook. The xvfb server will serve as a rendering backend and allow the environment to output images which can be used by NEAT and other algorithms.

**Scenario 2: Process Management Issues**

This is a bit more insidious. Let's say our `eval_genome` function makes use of multiple parallel executions. It does a very simple parallel training over a single generation. Here is what a problem version could look like:
```python
import gym
import neat
import numpy as np
import multiprocessing as mp

def eval_genome(genome, config):
  net = neat.nn.FeedForwardNetwork.create(genome, config)
  env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
  observation = env.reset()
  fitness = 0
  for _ in range(500):
    action = np.argmax(net.activate(observation))
    observation, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    fitness += reward
    if done:
        break
  env.close()
  return fitness

def parallel_eval_genomes(genomes, config, pool):
    fitnesses = pool.starmap(eval_genome, [(genome, config) for _, genome in genomes])
    for (genome_id, genome), fitness in zip(genomes, fitnesses):
        genome.fitness = fitness

def run(config_path):
    config = neat.Config(neat.DefaultGenome, neat.DefaultReproduction,
                             neat.DefaultSpeciesSet, neat.DefaultStagnation,
                             config_path)
    pop = neat.Population(config)
    pop.add_reporter(neat.StdOutReporter(True))
    stats = neat.StatisticsReporter()
    pop.add_reporter(stats)

    pool = mp.Pool(mp.cpu_count()) # Use all available processors
    for gen in range(100):
        genomes = list(pop.population.items())
        parallel_eval_genomes(genomes, config,pool)
        pop.next_generation()
    winner = pop.best_genome
    pool.close()
    pool.join()
    return winner
#This main block will run if I am running it inside of a Python IDE.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    local_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    config_path = os.path.join(local_dir, 'config-feedforward.txt')
    winner = run(config_path)
    print('\nBest genome:\n{!s}'.format(winner))
```

Here, the issue arises because some older versions of the `gym` environment are not entirely thread-safe, nor are they designed to be created and destroyed rapidly within a multiprocessing pool. This code could produce random failures as environments get created in rapid succession within the same Python context.

**Solution (for multiprocessing):** Using a separate helper function to isolate gym environment instantiation:
```python
import gym
import neat
import numpy as np
import multiprocessing as mp
import os
def eval_genome_helper(genome, config):
  env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
  net = neat.nn.FeedForwardNetwork.create(genome, config)
  observation = env.reset()
  fitness = 0
  for _ in range(500):
    action = np.argmax(net.activate(observation))
    observation, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    fitness += reward
    if done:
        break
  env.close()
  return fitness


def parallel_eval_genomes(genomes, config, pool):
    fitnesses = pool.starmap(eval_genome_helper, [(genome, config) for _, genome in genomes])
    for (genome_id, genome), fitness in zip(genomes, fitnesses):
        genome.fitness = fitness


def run(config_path):
    config = neat.Config(neat.DefaultGenome, neat.DefaultReproduction,
                             neat.DefaultSpeciesSet, neat.DefaultStagnation,
                             config_path)
    pop = neat.Population(config)
    pop.add_reporter(neat.StdOutReporter(True))
    stats = neat.StatisticsReporter()
    pop.add_reporter(stats)

    pool = mp.Pool(mp.cpu_count()) # Use all available processors
    for gen in range(100):
        genomes = list(pop.population.items())
        parallel_eval_genomes(genomes, config,pool)
        pop.next_generation()
    winner = pop.best_genome
    pool.close()
    pool.join()
    return winner
#This main block will run if I am running it inside of a Python IDE.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    local_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    config_path = os.path.join(local_dir, 'config-feedforward.txt')
    winner = run(config_path)
    print('\nBest genome:\n{!s}'.format(winner))

```
This is one way to make the multiprocessing pool run a little more safely with the `gym` env.

**Scenario 3: Configuration Mismatches**

Sometimes, the issues are far more subtle. I've encountered cases where a minor configuration error in the `neat` library configuration was enough to make the whole system grind to a halt. This can range from incorrect parameter settings to incompatible library versions. For instance, a configuration for a feedforward network being used with a recurrent network, or an incorrect activation function. If the parameters are outside the stable operating range, the network will not converge to a solution and the fitness will be random and therefore it will not learn anything.

**Solution (for incorrect parameter configuration):** The most effective solution here is through careful validation of the parameter configurations, starting with a single agent environment, to ensure it works as intended. For example, if we are using feed forward networks we should ensure that there is a corresponding config file like this:

```
[NEAT]
fitness_threshold = 100000 #Example
pop_size = 200
reset_on_extinction = True
[DefaultGenome]
num_hidden = 0
num_inputs = 4
num_outputs = 2
initial_connection = full
connection_add_prob = 0.1
connection_delete_prob = 0.0
node_add_prob = 0.01
node_delete_prob = 0.01
[DefaultSpeciesSet]
[DefaultStagnation]
species_fitness_func = mean
max_stagnation = 15
[DefaultReproduction]
elitism = 2
```
Ensure this file is present and it matches the specific requirements of your network type.

In summary, diagnosing the lack of success with NEAT and OpenAI Gym in Jupyter requires a systematic, step-by-step approach. Start by confirming the rendering setup is valid, investigate process management quirks with libraries such as multiprocessing and try to eliminate shared resources where possible, and finally, carefully examine the configuration settings. It's often a layered problem, where multiple issues combine to create the illusion of a monolithic failure.

For more in-depth knowledge, I'd suggest looking into resources like the original NEAT paper by Kenneth O. Stanley, "Evolving Neural Networks Through Augmenting Topologies," and the official OpenAI Gym documentation. For a deeper understanding of multiprocessing in Python, “Programming in Python 3” by Mark Summerfield is a solid resource. Also consider exploring other resources related to remote desktop configurations, such as X11 forwarding, as such systems can shed light on some of the rendering problems you might be experiencing. Remember, patience and a methodical approach are your best allies in troubleshooting such issues.
