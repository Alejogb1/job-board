Ah, the persistent quirks of deterministic systems… it's a puzzle I've encountered more than once, particularly when dealing with transformer models. Let me share a bit from my past experience; I remember a particularly thorny case where we were fine-tuning a BART model for abstractive summarization. We rigorously controlled the random seed, yet, our evaluation pipeline consistently spat out slightly different summaries for the same input text, and with the same model, I might add. It drove me absolutely nuts for a few days, and it's not an uncommon issue, to be honest. The core issue is that while we might set a seed for the *primary* random number generator, other components in the pipeline can introduce non-deterministic behavior even when a seemingly fixed seed is used.

First, let’s address the naive assumption. Setting a seed in your training scripts using a library like pytorch or tensorflow is essential to control the initial weights, data shuffling and other random elements of model training, but this alone isn’t sufficient to guarantee perfectly deterministic behavior end to end during inference and summarization. This is a crucial distinction; the seed primarily ensures the initial model weights are the same, and the training process unfolds identically if all is indeed truly deterministic (which, often, it's not).

The variations you see typically fall into a few buckets. Firstly, and perhaps most commonly, there are hidden layers of randomness *inside* the libraries themselves. These can be subtle and hard to track, mostly concerning things like how operations on the GPU are executed, especially on lower level layers. Frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow optimize operations based on the available hardware, which can introduce non-determinism. For example, when a matrix operation is computed on the GPU, the specific order of how threads are spawned and execute can differ slightly between runs leading to minute differences in the output even if the inputs are identical. These differences might be as small as the fifth or sixth decimal place, but in the context of a sequence-to-sequence model such as a transformer, these can rapidly multiply and result in significant variation in the final output when decoding.

Secondly, the beam search algorithm used in generation can introduce non-determinism depending on how its implementation breaks ties when calculating the beam, and how that might utilize randomness. While beam search aims to find the most probable sequence, it often needs tie-breaking mechanisms when multiple sequences have similar probabilities. Depending on the specific library implementation, this tie-breaking could introduce subtle randomness, even with a fixed seed. Additionally, some libraries may not provide a fully deterministic way to implement beam search, especially in highly optimized parallel environments. This becomes more complicated with varied GPU hardware as the way things are scheduled under the hood can differ. I’ve seen this particular case myself with discrepancies between summaries from training done on two physically separate machines even with exact matching libraries.

Thirdly, preprocessing steps can be another culprit, especially with tokenization. While a fixed vocabulary will always tokenize the same text identically, specific implementations can use asynchronous operations or rely on data structures that don't guarantee consistent iteration order which might contribute to very subtle differences in input sequences. While not common, this is still a possible vector.

To illustrate these points with working code snippets (using Python and the transformers library), consider these scenarios. Firstly, let's look at the naive approach:

```python
import torch
from transformers import pipeline, set_seed

set_seed(42)  # Set primary seed

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
text = """[Your input long text here]"""
summary1 = summarizer(text)[0]['summary_text']
summary2 = summarizer(text)[0]['summary_text']

print(f"Summary 1:\n{summary1}\n")
print(f"Summary 2:\n{summary2}\n")
print(f"Are the summaries identical? {summary1 == summary2}")

```

You might expect `summary1` and `summary2` to be identical. However, in many cases you will see that they are not exactly the same, even on the same machine, which points to the non-deterministic factors mentioned earlier.

Next, let's try an approach with forced determinism on pytorch itself. This is more of a shotgun approach, but sometimes it can help:
```python
import torch
import numpy as np
from transformers import pipeline, set_seed

def set_all_seeds(seed):
    set_seed(seed)
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
      torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)
      torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
      torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
    np.random.seed(seed)

set_all_seeds(42)  # Set primary seed with additional precautions

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
text = """[Your input long text here]"""
summary1 = summarizer(text)[0]['summary_text']
summary2 = summarizer(text)[0]['summary_text']

print(f"Summary 1:\n{summary1}\n")
print(f"Summary 2:\n{summary2}\n")
print(f"Are the summaries identical? {summary1 == summary2}")
```
This code snippet utilizes more fine-grained control over the random number generation across different modules. It addresses the specific CUDA implementation using the deterministic flag. While more robust, even this may not be absolutely foolproof against all sources of randomness.

Finally, If you suspect issues related to beam search or if you can adjust the parameters used with the beam search, forcing greedy search could help isolate some of the randomness:

```python
import torch
from transformers import pipeline, set_seed

set_seed(42)

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn", 
                      num_beams=1, do_sample=False)  # Force greedy decoding
text = """[Your input long text here]"""
summary1 = summarizer(text)[0]['summary_text']
summary2 = summarizer(text)[0]['summary_text']

print(f"Summary 1:\n{summary1}\n")
print(f"Summary 2:\n{summary2}\n")
print(f"Are the summaries identical? {summary1 == summary2}")

```

This last snippet forces the pipeline to use greedy search (essentially beam search with `num_beams=1` and sampling turned off), this removes a potential source of non-determinism related to tie-breaking and probability selection in typical beam-search. If summaries are identical under these conditions, but differ otherwise, then we can isolate the beam search as the culprit.

To understand more about determinism in these types of systems, I’d strongly recommend reading up on resources related to GPU computing determinism specifically, the *CUDA toolkit documentation* can be helpful here for specifics about the CUDA API and how it relates to different hardware. Furthermore, exploring research in the *IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems* on parallel and distributed computing can offer some high level insights into the complexities of ensuring deterministic behavior. A deep dive into the source code of the specific transformers library (like Hugging Face transformers) or any library you use for the generation/summarization task can also shed light on the areas of potential non-determinism. While it can be tedious, understanding the underlying architecture will help identify where exactly these issues lie.

In summary, while setting seeds is a fundamental practice, achieving deterministic behavior end-to-end in a complex pipeline involves addressing multiple layers of potential non-determinism, from GPU-level operations to algorithmic implementations within the libraries themselves. Careful control, isolating the potential problem areas, and deep understanding of the used libraries are required to obtain identical results consistently. It's a common problem, and certainly not one that is unique to you, or I, but by being aware of these potential issues we can avoid the frustrating confusion of seemingly random inconsistencies.
