Alright, let’s talk serialization of non-model object lists. This is something I’ve certainly tackled more than once across various projects, and it often pops up in situations where you're dealing with data transformations, caching, or inter-service communication. The challenge lies in that these objects aren't necessarily tied to a database structure or an ORM, so conventional serialization mechanisms might not directly apply. Let's get into some technical approaches.

First off, when we speak of "non-model objects," we're generally referring to instances of custom classes or data structures that aren’t directly mapped to, say, database tables. These objects often carry transient or derived data. Standard database-backed models usually come with built-in methods or frameworks for serialization to formats like json or xml, but here, we need to be a little more hands-on.

The fundamental concept of serialization is converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, then later reconstructed back into its original form, essentially making it persistable. For non-model objects, this typically involves manually defining how to represent the object's state in a serialized format like json.

The simplest method, and often the most suitable, is to employ a manual serialization function within each object. This involves adding a `to_dict()` or `serialize()` method to the class. Inside this method, you specify which attributes you want to include in the serialized representation. This approach has the advantage of giving you very fine-grained control.

Here's a python example demonstrating this technique, imagining we have a `ProcessedDataPoint` class:

```python
class ProcessedDataPoint:
    def __init__(self, raw_value, calculated_value, timestamp):
        self.raw_value = raw_value
        self.calculated_value = calculated_value
        self.timestamp = timestamp

    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            'raw_value': self.raw_value,
            'calculated_value': self.calculated_value,
            'timestamp': self.timestamp.isoformat() # Assuming timestamp is a datetime object
        }

import datetime
import json

data_points = [
    ProcessedDataPoint(10, 20, datetime.datetime.now()),
    ProcessedDataPoint(15, 30, datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=5))
]

serialized_data = [dp.to_dict() for dp in data_points]

print(json.dumps(serialized_data, indent=4))

```
In this code snippet, the `to_dict()` method prepares a dictionary representation of each `ProcessedDataPoint` instance. We then use list comprehension to apply this to all data points, before using the `json.dumps` method for serialization. Observe how we've also considered transforming the datetime object to an iso format for proper serialization and deserialization.

A second approach, when you deal with many different types of objects, is to develop a dedicated serialization function or class that understands the different object types you need to serialize. This reduces code duplication and provides a more centralized and maintainable system. This is useful especially when the classes themselves may not be under your control (external libraries or legacy systems).

Here’s an example where we use a central serializer function in Python:

```python
import json
import datetime

class CustomObjectA:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

class CustomObjectB:
    def __init__(self, name, created_at):
        self.name = name
        self.created_at = created_at


def serialize_object(obj):
    if isinstance(obj, CustomObjectA):
       return {"x": obj.x, "y": obj.y, "type": "CustomObjectA"}
    elif isinstance(obj, CustomObjectB):
        return {"name": obj.name, "created_at": obj.created_at.isoformat(), "type": "CustomObjectB"}
    else:
       raise TypeError(f"Unsupported object type: {type(obj)}")


objects = [
    CustomObjectA(100, 200),
    CustomObjectB("test", datetime.datetime.now())
]

serialized_objects = [serialize_object(obj) for obj in objects]
print(json.dumps(serialized_objects, indent=4))
```
Here, the `serialize_object` function acts as a dispatcher, checking the type of each object and generating its appropriate serialized form. This makes it easier to manage the serialization logic for diverse objects. We’ve also included type information for object reconstruction.

Finally, sometimes you might find yourself in a scenario where performance becomes important, particularly if you're serializing large lists. In this case, libraries like `pickle` in python offer a compact and fast serialization method; however, they are not human-readable, and you must be wary of security implications if you are deserializing from untrusted sources. `pickle` is not ideal for cross-language compatibility but it's excellent for local storage or inter-process communication when performance is key.

Here's a quick example using `pickle`:

```python
import pickle
import datetime

class DataObject:
    def __init__(self, id, value, timestamp):
        self.id = id
        self.value = value
        self.timestamp = timestamp

data_objects = [
    DataObject(1, 500, datetime.datetime.now()),
    DataObject(2, 750, datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=10)),
]

serialized_data = pickle.dumps(data_objects)
deserialized_data = pickle.loads(serialized_data)


print(f"Serialized data: {serialized_data[:50]}...") #printing only first 50 for brevity
print(f"Type of deserialized object:{type(deserialized_data)}")
```

In this example, `pickle.dumps` converts the list of objects into a byte stream, and `pickle.loads` reconstitutes the list. Note the byte stream printed is not human readable; if needed, the output can be converted to an encoded representation.

Choosing the appropriate method for serializing non-model objects depends largely on your requirements. If you require human readability and cross-language compatibility, json serialization with either `to_dict` methods or a serializer function is suitable. When performance is paramount and the data is used internally, you might lean towards libraries like `pickle`, keeping its caveats in mind.

For further exploration, I recommend delving into 'Effective Java' by Joshua Bloch, which dedicates a lot of space to object-oriented design, including serializable object design best practices. Also, the 'Data Structures and Algorithms' books by Cormen et al., though not specifically about serialization, contain invaluable concepts about encoding data that will help understand some underlying principles. And, of course, documentation for Python’s `json` and `pickle` modules, should be studied in detail, as these have subtleties often missed. Understanding the inner workings of these tools is crucial for implementing robust solutions.
