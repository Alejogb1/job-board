, let’s delve into that. It’s a foundational question, yet understanding the nuances of that initial convolution layer in a convolutional neural network (cnn) is key to grasping how these systems extract features. I've encountered variations in its implementation and the impact of its parameterization, making it a recurring, important topic.

The 'first' convolution, as it were, is not conceptually different from any other convolution operation within a cnn, but its position in the network pipeline imparts a special significance. It's where the raw input data, typically an image represented as a tensor of pixel values, is first subjected to the learned filters of the convolutional layer. It’s this initial transformation that starts the process of abstracting information from the pixel domain to a feature space that the network can use for subsequent tasks like classification or object detection.

Essentially, this first convolution layer applies a set of filters, also known as kernels, to the input data. These kernels are small matrices of weights. The convolution operation itself is a sliding window process. Imagine taking that filter (a small matrix of numbers), placing it over a small portion of your input image (for instance, a 3x3 chunk of pixels), multiplying the corresponding values in the filter by the corresponding pixel values, and then summing the result into a single output value. You repeat this process, shifting the kernel across the entire input, creating a complete feature map.

This might sound intricate, but let’s clarify with some code examples. These will be simplified for clarity, as most deep learning libraries like tensorflow or pytorch provide pre-built functions to abstract this away. However, visualizing the base logic is vital.

**Example 1: Basic 2D Convolution with numpy**

This snippet illustrates the core steps without any padding or stride considerations for simplicity.

```python
import numpy as np

def naive_convolution_2d(input_matrix, kernel):
    input_height, input_width = input_matrix.shape
    kernel_height, kernel_width = kernel.shape
    output_height = input_height - kernel_height + 1
    output_width = input_width - kernel_width + 1
    output_matrix = np.zeros((output_height, output_width))

    for row in range(output_height):
        for col in range(output_width):
            output_matrix[row, col] = np.sum(input_matrix[row:row+kernel_height, col:col+kernel_width] * kernel)
    return output_matrix

# Example usage
input_data = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                      [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
                      [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
                      [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
                      [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]])
filter_kernel = np.array([[1, 0, -1],
                        [1, 0, -1],
                        [1, 0, -1]])

output_feature_map = naive_convolution_2d(input_data, filter_kernel)
print(output_feature_map)
```

This simplified example shows a single filter being applied. In practice, this first layer will consist of multiple filters, each generating a different feature map. These feature maps are the output of the convolution operation and serve as inputs to subsequent layers.

The output from that very first convolution, therefore, represents a set of locally abstracted features from the original input image. It's important to grasp the parameters that influence this process. The kernel size, number of kernels (which equals the depth of the output feature map), stride (how many pixels the filter moves with each step), and padding (whether and how to pad the edges of the input) all play a part. The choices made here have a substantial impact on what patterns the subsequent layers pick up and how the features are represented spatially.

It's a balancing act. Too small a kernel might miss larger patterns. Too large and you might get a very blurry, overly generalized result. The choice depends on the specifics of the data and what kind of features you expect to learn.

**Example 2: Introducing Padding**

Let's look at how padding addresses the shrinking output size that comes with convolutions, often referred to as 'valid' convolution. This snippet introduces ‘same’ padding.

```python
import numpy as np

def convolution_with_padding_2d(input_matrix, kernel, padding="same"):
    input_height, input_width = input_matrix.shape
    kernel_height, kernel_width = kernel.shape
    if padding == "same":
      pad_height = (kernel_height - 1) // 2
      pad_width = (kernel_width - 1) // 2
    else:
      pad_height = pad_width = 0

    padded_input = np.pad(input_matrix, ((pad_height, pad_height), (pad_width, pad_width)), mode='constant')

    padded_height, padded_width = padded_input.shape
    output_height = padded_height - kernel_height + 1
    output_width = padded_width - kernel_width + 1

    output_matrix = np.zeros((output_height, output_width))
    for row in range(output_height):
        for col in range(output_width):
            output_matrix[row, col] = np.sum(padded_input[row:row+kernel_height, col:col+kernel_width] * kernel)
    return output_matrix

# Example usage, same input as before:
input_data = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                      [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
                      [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
                      [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
                      [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]])
filter_kernel = np.array([[1, 0, -1],
                        [1, 0, -1],
                        [1, 0, -1]])

output_feature_map = convolution_with_padding_2d(input_data, filter_kernel)
print(output_feature_map)
```
By adding ‘same’ padding, the output of this convolution has the same spatial dimensions as the input (in this case, if the stride is 1). This is common in the first convolutional layer, to preserve the spatial information.

The learning that happens in the first convolution is crucial because these initial filters are responsible for capturing fundamental patterns – edges, corners, blobs of color. The subsequent layers then build upon these, identifying more complex combinations of these elementary features.

**Example 3: Handling multiple input channels (e.g., RGB)**
A significant practical consideration is that the input image may not be a single-channel (grayscale) image. It could be a 3-channel rgb image, or more (hyper-spectral imaging, for example). Our filters must reflect this and operate across all the channels.

```python
import numpy as np

def convolution_with_channels(input_tensor, kernel):
  input_channels, input_height, input_width = input_tensor.shape
  kernel_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width = kernel.shape

  if input_channels != kernel_channels:
      raise ValueError("Input channels and kernel channels must match.")

  output_height = input_height - kernel_height + 1
  output_width = input_width - kernel_width + 1

  output_matrix = np.zeros((output_height, output_width))

  for row in range(output_height):
      for col in range(output_width):
         for channel in range(input_channels):
             output_matrix[row,col] += np.sum(input_tensor[channel,row:row+kernel_height, col:col+kernel_width] * kernel[channel])
  return output_matrix
# Example Usage
input_image = np.array([[[1, 2, 3, 4],
                        [5, 6, 7, 8],
                        [9, 10, 11, 12]],

                       [[13, 14, 15, 16],
                        [17, 18, 19, 20],
                        [21, 22, 23, 24]],

                       [[25, 26, 27, 28],
                        [29, 30, 31, 32],
                        [33, 34, 35, 36]]]) # shape: 3x3x4 (channels, height, width)
filter_kernel = np.array([[[1, 0, -1],
                         [1, 0, -1],
                         [1, 0, -1]],
                        [[1, 0, -1],
                         [1, 0, -1],
                         [1, 0, -1]],
                        [[1, 0, -1],
                         [1, 0, -1],
                         [1, 0, -1]]])# shape: 3x3x3 (channels, height, width)

output = convolution_with_channels(input_image, filter_kernel)
print(output)
```
As this example illustrates, the kernel now also has a channel dimension. The filtering operation then takes place across all input channels to create a single feature map (if one kernel is used; in practice many such filters would be used, creating many feature maps).

For a deeper understanding, I would recommend consulting *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. It's a comprehensive resource that covers the theoretical foundations of neural networks, including convolutional layers, in great detail. Furthermore, consider reading papers specifically on the architecture of various convolutional networks, such as *ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks* by Alex Krizhevsky et al. to understand their practical usage.

In conclusion, the first convolution layer, while similar to subsequent layers in operation, plays a critical role in the feature extraction process. It is the gateway for input data into the neural network, and the choices made in its design impact the network’s performance, sensitivity, and what patterns it learns. Its parameters, such as kernel size, number, stride, and padding, demand careful consideration to ensure efficient learning. The examples provided, although simplified, illustrate the underlying mechanisms. It’s not necessarily about ‘complicated’ code here, it’s about understanding the ‘why’.
