Alright,  It's a situation I've faced more than once, particularly in scheduling and resource allocation problems, where the need for distinct values coupled with unique variable tuple combinations is critical. We're talking about the intersection of minimizing the cardinality of value sets and enforcing uniqueness of variable combinations within a constraint satisfaction problem (csp). It's not straightforward, but definitely solvable with constraint programming techniques.

The core challenge is that standard constraint satisfaction solvers are primarily focused on finding *any* solution that satisfies all constraints, often without any explicit optimization regarding the number of distinct values used. To force them to minimize distinct values, we need to guide them using specific constraints and often, search strategies. Simultaneously, we need to maintain the uniqueness of variable tuples, which isn't just about distinct values but about preventing repetitions in the assignments to our variables.

My approach over the years has revolved around a combination of two core strategies: leveraging global constraints and strategically incorporating auxiliary variables and constraints. For the distinct values minimization, the `globalCardinality` or similar constraints, offered in most constraint programming solvers, are invaluable. These directly constrain how many times each value can be assigned to variables within a set. For unique tuples, we often have to be a bit more creative and may use a combination of `allDifferent` constraints on specific combinations of variables in the tuple, depending on the desired uniqueness properties.

To illustrate, let’s consider a simplified problem: we have a set of tasks that need to be assigned to employees, each task has a specific requirement level and an employee's expertise level which the task cannot exceed. We want to minimize the number of distinct requirement levels used across all tasks while ensuring that each task-employee pair is unique. This example is simplified for clarity, but it captures the essence of the challenge.

**Example 1: Implementing distinct value minimization with `globalCardinality` and auxiliary variables**

Here’s how I’d approach it using Python with a constraint programming library (for demonstration, I will use a generic pseudocode syntax since different libraries implement the exact syntax with slight variation but the underlying ideas are identical):

```python
# Example 1: Distinct Values Minimization
def solve_distinct_values(tasks, employees, expertise_levels):
    solver = ConstraintSolver()
    task_vars = [solver.IntVar(0, len(employees) - 1, name=f"task_{i}") for i in range(len(tasks))]
    requirement_vars = [solver.IntVar(0, len(expertise_levels) - 1, name=f"req_{i}") for i in range(len(tasks))]

    # Constraint: Each task is assigned a unique employee
    solver.allDifferent(task_vars)

    # Constraint: Employee expertise >= Task requirement
    for i in range(len(tasks)):
      solver.constraint(expertise_levels[task_vars[i]] >= requirement_vars[i])

    # Auxiliary variables to count distinct requirement levels
    distinct_values = [solver.BoolVar(name=f"d_{i}") for i in range(len(expertise_levels))]

    # Link distinct values to auxiliary boolean variables
    for value_index in range(len(expertise_levels)):
        solver.constraint( distinct_values[value_index] == (sum( [ (requirement_vars[i] == value_index) for i in range(len(tasks)) ] ) > 0) )

    # Objective: Minimize the count of distinct values
    solver.minimize(sum(distinct_values))

    solution = solver.solve()
    if solution:
      return {
          'task_assignments': solution.get_values(task_vars),
          'requirement_assignments': solution.get_values(requirement_vars),
          'min_distinct_reqs': sum([ solution.get_value(dv) for dv in distinct_values ])
        }
    return None
```

In this example, the `globalCardinality` functionality is implicitly managed by setting boolean variables ( `distinct_values` ) to represent the existence of each value for tasks requirement level. By summing these and minimizing, the solver tries to reduce the number of distinct values used. The `expertise_levels` would be an array that maps each employee index to their expertise level.

**Example 2: Ensuring Unique Tuples with `allDifferent`**

Now, let's address the tuple uniqueness issue. Assuming we want task-employee pairs to be unique, we can explicitly impose this constraint. Building on example 1, here is how we can change the code:

```python
# Example 2: Unique Task-Employee pairs
def solve_unique_pairs(tasks, employees, expertise_levels):
    solver = ConstraintSolver()
    task_vars = [solver.IntVar(0, len(employees) - 1, name=f"task_{i}") for i in range(len(tasks))]
    requirement_vars = [solver.IntVar(0, len(expertise_levels) - 1, name=f"req_{i}") for i in range(len(tasks))]

    # Constraint: Each task is assigned a unique employee - the uniqueness aspect of example 1 is eliminated for this example
    # solver.allDifferent(task_vars)

    # Constraint: Employee expertise >= Task requirement
    for i in range(len(tasks)):
      solver.constraint(expertise_levels[task_vars[i]] >= requirement_vars[i])

    # Unique task-employee pairs by considering each pair as a composite tuple and enforcing allDifferent
    solver.allDifferent([(task_vars[i], requirement_vars[i]) for i in range(len(tasks))])

    # Auxiliary variables to count distinct requirement levels
    distinct_values = [solver.BoolVar(name=f"d_{i}") for i in range(len(expertise_levels))]

    # Link distinct values to auxiliary boolean variables
    for value_index in range(len(expertise_levels)):
        solver.constraint( distinct_values[value_index] == (sum( [ (requirement_vars[i] == value_index) for i in range(len(tasks)) ] ) > 0) )

    # Objective: Minimize the count of distinct values
    solver.minimize(sum(distinct_values))

    solution = solver.solve()
    if solution:
      return {
        'task_assignments': solution.get_values(task_vars),
          'requirement_assignments': solution.get_values(requirement_vars),
          'min_distinct_reqs': sum([ solution.get_value(dv) for dv in distinct_values ])
        }

    return None
```

Here, I've removed the `allDifferent` constraint on only the task assignments and instead implemented a `allDifferent` constraint on the *tuple* formed by task-employee assignments, thus enforcing the uniqueness of the tuples.

**Example 3: Combining Both with an Objective Function**

Combining both constraints and adding an objective function becomes crucial for optimizing distinct values while respecting uniqueness:

```python
# Example 3: Combined approach
def solve_combined(tasks, employees, expertise_levels):
    solver = ConstraintSolver()
    task_vars = [solver.IntVar(0, len(employees) - 1, name=f"task_{i}") for i in range(len(tasks))]
    requirement_vars = [solver.IntVar(0, len(expertise_levels) - 1, name=f"req_{i}") for i in range(len(tasks))]


    # Constraint: Employee expertise >= Task requirement
    for i in range(len(tasks)):
      solver.constraint(expertise_levels[task_vars[i]] >= requirement_vars[i])

   # Unique task-employee pairs
    solver.allDifferent([(task_vars[i], requirement_vars[i]) for i in range(len(tasks))])

    # Auxiliary variables for distinct requirement levels
    distinct_values = [solver.BoolVar(name=f"d_{i}") for i in range(len(expertise_levels))]
    for value_index in range(len(expertise_levels)):
        solver.constraint( distinct_values[value_index] == (sum( [ (requirement_vars[i] == value_index) for i in range(len(tasks)) ] ) > 0) )


    # Objective: Minimize the count of distinct values
    solver.minimize(sum(distinct_values))

    solution = solver.solve()
    if solution:
      return {
        'task_assignments': solution.get_values(task_vars),
        'requirement_assignments': solution.get_values(requirement_vars),
          'min_distinct_reqs': sum([ solution.get_value(dv) for dv in distinct_values ])
        }
    return None
```

This combines the previous two examples, enforcing both unique tuples and minimizing distinct values through an objective function.

This three-pronged approach provides a structured methodology for tackling this complex constraint satisfaction challenge. It’s all about strategically using the toolkit available in constraint programming: global constraints, careful variable modeling, and a well-defined objective.

For deeper understanding, I'd recommend delving into the core texts on constraint programming, such as "Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming" by Kenneth R. Apt or "Handbook of Constraint Programming" edited by Francesca Rossi, Peter van Beek, and Toby Walsh. These books provide a more formal treatment of the techniques I've outlined, along with advanced concepts and algorithms used in state-of-the-art solvers. Reading research papers on specific global constraints implementations for libraries like Gecode, or Choco, could also be very insightful for those who want to understand implementation details.

Finally, keep in mind that performance often hinges on the chosen search strategy and constraint propagation mechanisms. Experimentation is key to finding what works best for a particular problem instance. The provided examples are foundational and can be expanded upon to meet more complex and diverse challenges.
