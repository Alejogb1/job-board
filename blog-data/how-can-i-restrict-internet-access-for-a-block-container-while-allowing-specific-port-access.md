Alright, let's unpack this. It’s a problem I’ve tackled quite a few times, particularly during a project involving isolated microservices communicating over specific ports, and it's a common requirement when you're aiming for granular network control within containerized environments. The goal, as I understand it, is to effectively block all internet access for a given container, except for defined port(s). There are several ways to approach this; the most effective usually centers around using network configurations inherent in containerization tools, rather than attempting to perform these restrictions within the container itself. It's about setting the correct guardrails from the host level.

The first layer we typically explore is leveraging docker's network features, which allows you to control traffic via bridges, overlays, or custom networks. My experience has demonstrated that directly manipulating the docker bridge is often the quickest route, though it's also important to understand the implications of this approach if you're working within a broader orchestration environment such as kubernetes. You don't always have direct control over bridge networks in such instances.

Let’s start with the simplest scenario, where we aim to block *all* internet access and then punch a hole for a specific port. We can accomplish this with docker using a combination of the `--network none` option on container creation, which disconnects the container from any bridge network, and then uses the host's networking stack to provide the specific port connectivity.

Here is a simplified docker-compose example to illustrate this principle:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  restricted_container:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80" # maps host port 8080 to container port 80
    networks:
      default:
        ipv4_address: 172.18.0.2 # Assign a static ip address
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 1; done;"]
networks:
    default:
      ipam:
        config:
          - subnet: 172.18.0.0/16
```

In this example, note how we are explicitly assigning a static ip for the container and using a custom bridge network with a defined subnet. By only allowing connectivity from host to container through the specified port, external connections to other ports are essentially blocked. The nginx container doesn't have access to the internet via docker's default bridge since we have specified a different network.
This will give us a functioning container at host port `8080`.

However, this doesn't explicitly *block* internet access, but rather prevents it by not connecting the container to a routable network. Now, let’s say, you need a more granular control. Specifically, to block all outbound internet traffic but still permit specific ports to the outside world. Here we need to involve the host's firewall. This is where we combine our understanding of docker networking with the functionality of `iptables` (or `nftables` in newer systems).

Here's a practical approach using a shell script that would typically follow the docker container creation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -q --filter "name=restricted_container")

# Get the IP address of the container
CONTAINER_IP=$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' $CONTAINER_ID)

# Flush existing iptables rules related to the container (optional)
iptables -D FORWARD -s $CONTAINER_IP -j ACCEPT 2> /dev/null
iptables -D FORWARD -d $CONTAINER_IP -j ACCEPT 2> /dev/null
iptables -D OUTPUT -s $CONTAINER_IP -j ACCEPT 2> /dev/null

# Drop all outbound traffic from the container
iptables -I FORWARD 1 -s $CONTAINER_IP -j DROP
iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d $CONTAINER_IP -j DROP

# Allow traffic on the desired port (e.g., port 5432)
iptables -I FORWARD 1 -s $CONTAINER_IP -p tcp --dport 5432 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d $CONTAINER_IP -p tcp --sport 5432 -j ACCEPT

echo "Iptables rules applied to restrict container $CONTAINER_ID"
```

This script does the following: it retrieves the container ID and IP, flushes any rules pertaining to the container, drops all outbound traffic from the container's IP and then allows specific traffic, on port `5432`, in this case, by inserting an accept rule for the specified container's IP address for both input and output.

It’s very important to remember the order of your rules in `iptables`. The first rule to match wins, so a broad `DROP` rule should typically come after specific `ACCEPT` rules. This script is more a functional illustration, and depending on your specific requirements, you might need to adjust the chains and rules. Additionally, this configuration is not persistent by default. You'd need to either save and load `iptables` rules or incorporate the script into your container provisioning process.

Finally, let's consider a more sophisticated scenario using `docker-compose` with user-defined networks. This is relevant if you have multiple containers, and you need to isolate them while still maintaining some port accessibility. This can be particularly useful for isolating application components within the same infrastructure.

Here’s how we’d define a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  app_container:
    image: busybox:latest
    command: sh -c "while true; do sleep 1; done"
    networks:
      isolated_net:
        ipv4_address: 172.20.0.2
    ports:
      - "8081:80" # Expose a specific port for access from the host

  other_container:
    image: busybox:latest
    command: sh -c "while true; do sleep 1; done"
    networks:
      isolated_net:
        ipv4_address: 172.20.0.3

networks:
  isolated_net:
    ipam:
        config:
          - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16
```

In this setup, both `app_container` and `other_container` are on a custom isolated network and cannot access the external internet. Only `app_container` has a port exposed to the host. You would need to use the firewall rules, similar to the script mentioned above, to further refine the network policies for the exposed port. Again, here we have assigned static ip addresses for clarity.

It's critical to remember that these examples demonstrate basic implementations, and you should consult the documentation for both docker and your firewall provider for a full understanding of the options available. Specifically, I highly recommend *Docker Deep Dive* by Nigel Poulton and the iptables documentation for detailed insights into this domain. For more advanced network concepts, especially regarding microservices architecture, the book *Building Microservices* by Sam Newman offers a great overview.

In a practical production environment, one would typically employ a container orchestration platform like kubernetes, in which network policies provide a higher level abstraction to accomplish the same goal with CRDs. These are, of course, more complex, but provide enhanced management features compared to running standalone docker containers.

The key takeaway here is that controlling access in containers is a layered process that involves understanding docker networking, host firewall configuration, and potentially orchestration-level policies. Starting with a foundational understanding of the fundamentals provides you with the flexibility to implement highly customized network configurations that serve diverse requirements.
