Alright, let's unpack this. I remember back in the day, working on a social platform for amateur photographers, we had a similar challenge. Users were constantly creating new posts, and the need to surface the "most liked" content became critical for user engagement. The votable gem, as you mentioned, is a solid choice for implementing voting functionality in Rails, and extracting that 'most liked' data efficiently is certainly achievable. Here's how I approach this, combining database optimization techniques with straightforward ActiveRecord queries.

Essentially, the core concept hinges on using the `votes_for` association, which `votable` provides and leverages SQL aggregations to retrieve our top content. The key is to craft our queries to work with the underlying data in a performant manner, especially as the data scales.

Let’s start by assuming you have a `Post` model that is configured as votable:

```ruby
# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_votable
end
```

Now, extracting the most liked posts involves querying for the total positive vote count associated with each post. `votable` itself doesn't store an aggregated count directly on the `posts` table, so we leverage the `votes` table and aggregate the results. Here's our first query, which directly uses the association to achieve this:

```ruby
# First example: leveraging the association with `votes_for`
def top_posts(limit = 10)
    Post.joins(:votes_for)
        .group("posts.id")
        .order("count(votes.id) DESC")
        .limit(limit)
end

# Example usage:
most_liked = top_posts(5)
most_liked.each { |post| puts "Post ID: #{post.id}, Likes: #{post.votes_for.count}" }
```

Here, we're using an `inner join` on the `votes` table, grouping by `post.id`, ordering by the count of votes in descending order, and then limiting the result set. While this is functionally correct, it's not the most efficient method, primarily because, in this scenario, you might end up fetching and initializing numerous `Vote` objects per `Post` on every like count retrieval, which can be costly, especially as the `votes` table grows.

To optimize this, we can employ a more efficient approach using a subquery that avoids instantiation of those extra vote objects and gets us directly to the count.

```ruby
# Second example: Using a subquery and raw SQL for efficiency
def top_posts_optimized(limit = 10)
  Post.find_by_sql(
    "SELECT posts.*, COUNT(votes.id) as vote_count
      FROM posts
      LEFT JOIN votes ON votes.votable_id = posts.id AND votes.votable_type = 'Post' AND votes.vote_flag = TRUE
      GROUP BY posts.id
      ORDER BY vote_count DESC
      LIMIT #{limit}"
  )
end

# Example usage:
most_liked = top_posts_optimized(5)
most_liked.each { |post| puts "Post ID: #{post.id}, Likes: #{post.vote_count}" }
```

This query utilizes raw SQL which might seem initially less elegant than pure ActiveRecord but provides a direct route to count aggregation in the database. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that posts with zero votes are also considered (they will have a count of 0). Importantly, the result set includes a `vote_count` attribute directly available on each returned `Post` model, and thus avoids those expensive collection of individual votes per post during rendering or any other process.

Now, another crucial point to consider for performance, especially in scaling, involves indexing. Ensure that your `votes` table has appropriate indices on `votable_id`, `votable_type`, and `vote_flag` (and `created_at` if that is also used for filtering), which will significantly speed up lookups. This is essential to avoid full table scans every time you need to retrieve or count votes.

However, if you find that even this optimized query has performance problems due to extremely high traffic or a very large votes table, a denormalization strategy may be required, where we cache the total vote count directly on the `posts` table. This does, however, introduce some complexity for updates when votes are added or removed. You could achieve this through a callback on the `Vote` model:

```ruby
# Third example: Using callbacks to denormalize vote counts
# within the Post model and caching vote count on post.
# this example assumes you've added 'vote_count' as an integer
# column to the 'posts' table.

class Vote < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :votable, polymorphic: true
  after_create :update_votable_vote_count
  after_destroy :update_votable_vote_count

  def update_votable_vote_count
    votable.update(vote_count: votable.votes_for.count)
  end
end

# Updated Post model
class Post < ApplicationRecord
    acts_as_votable

    def self.top_posts_cached(limit = 10)
       order(vote_count: :desc).limit(limit)
    end
end

# Example usage:
most_liked = Post.top_posts_cached(5)
most_liked.each { |post| puts "Post ID: #{post.id}, Likes: #{post.vote_count}" }
```
Here, we've added a `vote_count` column to our `posts` table, and each time a vote is created or destroyed, we update this count. Now, our retrieval is as simple as ordering by that column. This provides extremely fast query times at the cost of maintaining data consistency across vote and post records.

This denormalization approach trades consistency overhead (in the form of callback computation) for faster read times, and should be evaluated based on your actual load patterns and needs. For the initial stage of most projects, the optimized sql query example (number two) is typically sufficient.

For further information on database indexing and performance, I would recommend reviewing “High Performance MySQL” by Baron Schwartz, Peter Zaitsev, and Vadim Tkachenko. For general ActiveRecord optimization, I find the ActiveRecord documentation itself quite comprehensive, and reading through the relevant sections is beneficial. Also, “Database Internals” by Alex Petrov provides a good deeper understanding about how database perform queries.

In summary, while `votable` simplifies the vote interaction itself, correctly querying the “most liked” data involves a blend of ActiveRecord associations, clever SQL, indexing strategies, and, potentially, strategic data denormalization based on your specific needs and usage patterns. As always, monitor your query performance as your application scales, and make adjustments as necessary. It's a classic trade-off between complexity, performance, and maintainability. Start with the optimized query I outlined in my second code sample, and move to denormalization if you run into scaling issues.
