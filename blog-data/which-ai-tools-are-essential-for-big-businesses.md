So you're looking into Enterprise AI tools huh  That's a broad topic but I get it  It's like the wild west out there  Lots of players  Lots of buzzwords  Here's the thing  You gotta think about what you actually need  Is it machine learning  Natural language processing  Something else  Once you figure that out you can narrow down your choices  I'd suggest checking out tools like TensorFlow  PyTorch  or even something like Google Cloud AI Platform  Those are good starting points  But again  it really depends on what you're trying to accomplish  If you're working with a lot of data  you might want to consider a data lake like Snowflake  And if you're focused on customer service  you might need a chatbot platform  Like Dialogflow  Remember  AI is just a tool  It's up to you to use it effectively  Good luck with your search  

```python
from tensorflow import keras
```
