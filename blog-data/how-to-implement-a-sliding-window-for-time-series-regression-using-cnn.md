alright, so you're looking at implementing a sliding window for time series regression with cnns, that's a pretty common task and i’ve definitely spent some time on this myself. let's break down what i've learned over the years.

first off, the core idea is to transform your time series data into a format that a cnn can actually understand. a cnn, as you probably know, excels at processing spatial data, like images. it doesn’t inherently ‘get’ the temporal nature of a time series. that's where the sliding window comes in. it essentially creates a series of ‘snapshots’ from your time series that act like mini-images for the cnn.

imagine you have a time series with values like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and let’s say your window size is 3. with a stride of 1.

what you would do is, you would create windows like:

window 1: [1, 2, 3]
window 2: [2, 3, 4]
window 3: [3, 4, 5]
window 4: [4, 5, 6]
... and so on.

this way each of these windows becomes an input to your cnn and you would use the next value after the window as your target value to be predicted. that’s the basic principle.

now, for the implementation, there are a couple of approaches that i’ve found effective. one approach involves using python with libraries like numpy and tensorflow or pytorch, which you're probably used to.

here's a simple python function using numpy that i usually use:

```python
import numpy as np

def create_sliding_windows(data, window_size, stride=1):
    windows = []
    for i in range(0, len(data) - window_size + 1, stride):
        window = data[i: i + window_size]
        windows.append(window)
    return np.array(windows)

# example usage:
time_series = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
window_size = 3
stride = 1

sliding_windows = create_sliding_windows(time_series, window_size, stride)
print(sliding_windows)
```

this function just takes your time series data, the desired window size, and the stride and returns a numpy array of sliding windows, pretty straightforward. i’ve used this exact function countless times and it gets the job done. obviously it could be improved but it is a good starting point.

now, after creating your windows you'll likely need to reshape your data into something a cnn expects. cnns typically work with input of the form `(batch_size, height, width, channels)`, or `(batch_size, channels, height, width)` depending on your framework’s data format. in our time series case we treat time as a spatial dimension. for example if our time series are of the form `[ [1, 2, 3] , [2, 3, 4] , [3, 4, 5], ...]` and the `window size` is 3, then what we can do is for example set the shape of the input as `(number of windows, 1, window_size, 1)` or `(number of windows, window_size, 1, 1)`, either way works, it is just a matter of the libraries you use and the format that you are comfortable with and it is easier to keep in mind if you think the data as an image with 1 channel.

here's how you might do that in tensorflow assuming a `channels_last` format:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def prepare_cnn_input(windows):
    num_windows = windows.shape[0]
    window_size = windows.shape[1]
    cnn_input = windows.reshape(num_windows, 1, window_size, 1)
    return tf.convert_to_tensor(cnn_input, dtype=tf.float32)


# assuming we have the `sliding_windows` numpy array from the last snippet
cnn_ready_input = prepare_cnn_input(sliding_windows)
print(cnn_ready_input.shape)
```

in the above code, we have taken the array of `sliding_windows` and reshaped them into a tensor that the cnn can consume later. note that i’m converting the numpy array into a `tf.tensor`, that's crucial to feed the data to tensorflow, if you were using pytorch you would do the same but converting into a `torch.tensor`. i personally prefer to use tensorflow most of the time, i found that it has better options for deployment and there are a lot more resources.

now, regarding the target values for your regression task, that depends on how you structured your time series. in general you would have your window `[x_t, x_{t+1}, ..., x_{t+n}]` which represent the past, and your target will be `x_{t+n+1}`, which means that when you are preparing the labels you will need to ‘shift’ the time series data by one position.

example:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def prepare_regression_labels(data, window_size, stride=1):
  labels = []
  for i in range(window_size, len(data), stride):
      labels.append(data[i])
  return tf.convert_to_tensor(np.array(labels), dtype=tf.float32)


# assuming you have the original `time_series`
# and it has been split into train/test by an arbitrary manner
time_series_train = time_series[:8]

time_series_test = time_series[8:]

window_size = 3
stride = 1

sliding_windows = create_sliding_windows(time_series_train, window_size, stride)
cnn_ready_input = prepare_cnn_input(sliding_windows)

regression_labels = prepare_regression_labels(time_series_train, window_size, stride)
print(regression_labels)
```

so after that you would use the `cnn_ready_input` as the `x_train` and the `regression_labels` as the `y_train`, the same process can be repeated for test set splitting the data in the same way, and now you have your data ready for training. just remember that your regression labels need to match the number of windows that you've created. if your input has 7 windows your labels should have the same length.

a common mistake i see is when people try to use only one large window, and that means the network has to learn dependencies from far away in the time series, this is really hard for most nets, so a sliding window makes the learning process more manageable because each window only ‘sees’ a small portion of the time series. it’s like showing the network a zoomed-in image instead of the whole panorama all at once.

talking about specific cnn architectures, i’ve personally had good results with one dimensional cnns with a few convolutional layers with increasing numbers of filters, followed by some pooling layers, and a fully connected layer as the final regression layer. the specific hyper parameters, like filter size, number of layers and so on, will totally depend on the specific characteristics of your data, if your data are not noisy then you can use a larger filter size with more layers.

i usually start with something pretty basic and then iterate based on the performance. you can also include batchnorm layers or dropout layers to prevent overfitting which is pretty common when using cnns, also l1 or l2 regularization should help. you can find lots of material on how to structure cnns in different deep learning books, two that i would recommend are 'deep learning' by ian goodfellow, yoshua bengio, and aaron courville, which is like the bible of deep learning, another one could be 'hands-on machine learning with scikit-learn, keras & tensorflow' by aurélien géron which contains really practical examples and that’s a must for someone starting with tensorflow.

the choice of stride will also affect the amount of training data you will get, a stride of 1 will produce many overlapping windows which means more training data but can cause some redundancy, a larger stride, for example a half of the window size will give you less overlapping data but less data in total so the network can be more prone to overfitting.

also, when dealing with time series regression you will often see the need to work with sequences of data of variable length, and that is a hard issue in machine learning because networks usually require a fixed size input. a solution for that is to simply pad the sequences so they have the same length. you can use the `tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences` function if you are using tensorflow, it will pad the sequences so they have the same length. but this is a detail for other question that i won't discuss further here.

one thing that might not be that obvious is that often time series have a lot of noise so using techniques to denoise the data, like a low-pass filter or median filter can greatly help the learning process, but this is beyond the scope of this question.

and one last detail, remember to split your time series data before creating the windows, otherwise, you will have data leakage and the results you see in test are not a reliable estimate of the performance of your model.

and here is a random joke: why did the programmer quit his job? because he didn't get arrays.

anyway, i hope this helps! feel free to ask if you have any further questions.
