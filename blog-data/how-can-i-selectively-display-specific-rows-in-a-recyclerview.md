,  Displaying specific rows in a `RecyclerView` is a common task, but the implementation details can often feel a bit nuanced. From my experience, especially in the earlier days of Android development, handling dynamic data with `RecyclerViews` wasn't always straightforward, and this particular issue – selectively showing items – came up quite a bit. I recall one project where we were building a complex UI for a financial app; user actions needed to toggle the visibility of detailed transaction records based on filter selections. Initially, the naive approach of simply hiding or showing views inside the adapter directly led to all sorts of issues, mostly with animations and layout inconsistencies. We learned pretty quickly that there were much more effective methods.

The key is to not try to force the `RecyclerView` to display fewer items by messing with view visibility directly. Instead, the proper approach involves working with your data source and then notifying the adapter that the data set has changed. This sounds simple, and it is, but the details of data management are where the actual work happens. Your adapter should always be a reflection of your data, not the other way around. Here's how I approach it, generally:

**1. Maintain a Comprehensive Data Source:**

First, you need to have a complete list of all possible items you *could* display. This is the ‘master’ dataset. In this master list, each item must have a property to indicate whether it should be displayed or not. I usually add a simple boolean like `isVisible`. This is where most developers get into trouble; they tend to modify the list itself to remove the item they want to hide. Don't do that. That approach makes it more difficult to restore the item to the view, and it leads to recalculating `position` indices, which becomes a maintenance headache. This master list shouldn’t be touched unless we’re adding new items or completely deleting something from the list, which has a different context in the application’s business logic.

**2. Create a Filtered Display List:**

Second, you'll derive a separate list specifically for the `RecyclerView`. This list will contain only the items from the master list where the `isVisible` property is set to `true`. You'll modify this visible list based on user actions or any other criteria determining which items to show. The `RecyclerView` adapter will use this list as its source for the elements to render. Remember, it is very important to keep these two lists separated to avoid complex management issues. This filtered list should be easily reconstructible from the full master data using simple conditional rules.

**3. Update the Adapter:**

Once your visible list is updated, use one of the adapter's notify methods. You have options here like:

*   `notifyDataSetChanged()`: the most straightforward, but not the most efficient because it updates the whole view and ignores the specifics. It is useful when you don’t have control over which item has changed.

*   `notifyItemRangeRemoved(int startPosition, int itemCount)`: useful when you’re removing a range of items.
*    `notifyItemRangeInserted(int startPosition, int itemCount)`: useful when you’re inserting a range of items.
*   `notifyItemRemoved(int position)`: useful when you remove only one item.
*   `notifyItemInserted(int position)`: useful when you add a new item.
*   `notifyItemChanged(int position)` or `notifyItemRangeChanged(int positionStart, int itemCount)`: useful when the item’s content is modified and we need to reflect that in the `RecyclerView` item.

Choose the most specific notify method that matches what happened to the data. This will significantly improve performance and ensure smoother animations.

Let’s take a look at some examples using Kotlin to see this in action:

**Example 1: Basic Toggle**

This example demonstrates how to toggle visibility for one item at a specific position. The data is a simple list of strings with a boolean `isVisible` property:

```kotlin
data class Item(val text: String, var isVisible: Boolean = true)

class MyAdapter(private var items: List<Item>) : RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder>() {

    class ViewHolder(itemView: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView) {
        val textView: TextView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.my_text_view)
    }

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ViewHolder {
        val view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context).inflate(R.layout.my_item_layout, parent, false)
        return ViewHolder(view)
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        holder.textView.text = items[position].text
        //here we will implement onClickListener, so when user clicks the item we toggle the isVisible status for the item inside the master list and notify the adapter with notifyItemChanged()
    }

    override fun getItemCount() = items.size


    fun toggleItemVisibility(masterList: MutableList<Item>, position: Int){
          masterList[position].isVisible = !masterList[position].isVisible
           //now create a list with the visible elements.
           val filteredList= masterList.filter { it.isVisible }
           this.items=filteredList
            notifyDataSetChanged()
    }
}


//Inside the activity or fragment you would have something similar:
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var recyclerView: RecyclerView
    private lateinit var adapter: MyAdapter
    private val masterItemList = mutableListOf(
        Item("Item 1"),
        Item("Item 2"),
        Item("Item 3"),
        Item("Item 4", isVisible = false),
        Item("Item 5")
    )

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        recyclerView = findViewById(R.id.my_recycler_view)
        recyclerView.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(this)
        val visibleList= masterItemList.filter { it.isVisible }
        adapter = MyAdapter(visibleList)
        recyclerView.adapter = adapter
    }

     fun onListItemClicked(position: Int) {
       adapter.toggleItemVisibility(masterItemList, position)
    }
}
```

**Example 2: Filtering based on a String**

This example shows how you can apply string filtering. Imagine a search bar that filters list items based on what’s typed into it. The master list now contains an extra field, the original text:

```kotlin
data class Item(val text: String, val originalText: String, var isVisible: Boolean = true)

class MyAdapter(private var items: List<Item>) : RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder>() {
    //ViewHolder implementation as before...

    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        holder.textView.text = items[position].text
    }

     fun filterItems(masterList: MutableList<Item>, filterString: String) {
        if(filterString.isBlank()){
            masterList.forEach { it.isVisible = true }
        } else{
             masterList.forEach { it.isVisible = it.originalText.contains(filterString, ignoreCase = true) }
        }
         val filteredList = masterList.filter { it.isVisible }
           this.items = filteredList
            notifyDataSetChanged()
    }
}

//Inside the activity or fragment
//...
   fun onSearchTextChanged(text:String){
      adapter.filterItems(masterItemList,text)
   }

```

**Example 3: Using a Predicate Function**

This more flexible approach uses a lambda to define the selection criteria. This can handle more complex selection scenarios:

```kotlin
data class Item(val text: String, val id: Int, var isVisible: Boolean = true)

class MyAdapter(private var items: List<Item>) : RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder>() {
    //ViewHolder implementation as before...

      override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        holder.textView.text = items[position].text
    }

     fun filterItems(masterList: MutableList<Item>, predicate: (Item) -> Boolean) {
        masterList.forEach { it.isVisible = predicate(it) }
         val filteredList = masterList.filter { it.isVisible }
           this.items = filteredList
            notifyDataSetChanged()
    }
}
//Inside the activity
//...
   fun filterByIds(ids: Set<Int>){
      adapter.filterItems(masterItemList) { item -> ids.contains(item.id) }
   }
```

**Further Reading and Exploration**

For an in-depth understanding of the underpinnings of RecyclerView and how these approaches work, you should definitely dive into the Android documentation on RecyclerView and Adapter classes. Also, studying the work of Google's engineers is always a good idea. In addition to this, I highly recommend taking a look at “Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch. It provides excellent guidelines on how to design robust and scalable APIs and data structures, which is crucial when handling dynamic data in your applications.

**Conclusion**

The core principle here is to separate your model from the view. Your `RecyclerView`'s adapter is a presentation layer and shouldn't contain your application’s logic. By keeping a comprehensive list and constructing the `RecyclerView`’s data source from a filtered version, you gain control, flexibility and performance when displaying selective content. The key takeaway is to manage your data effectively and use the proper adapter methods for updating the RecyclerView. Remember, choose the most suitable `notify` method when updating to optimize for animations and layout updates. It might seem a bit intricate at first, but with practice, this approach will become second nature. Good luck.
