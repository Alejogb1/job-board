Alright, let's unpack this. Identifying the current ActiveAdmin action within a sidebar is a common challenge, and one I've tackled more than a few times in my projects, particularly back when I was heavily involved in building internal administration tools for e-commerce platforms. I remember one project in particular, where we needed to dynamically display specific user guides based on the action they were taking within the admin panel. This required a solid grasp of how ActiveAdmin handles context.

The key to understanding this lies within ActiveAdmin's routing and how it exposes the controller context. Within the sidebar partial, you're essentially working within the view layer, so direct access to controller variables isn’t always straightforward. However, ActiveAdmin cleverly provides access to the controller itself via the `controller` method within your view. This gives us the necessary tools to access the current action being executed.

Now, the most direct approach is leveraging the `controller.action_name` variable. This variable returns the string representation of the current action. For instance, on a new record creation page, this variable would return `'new'`, for the edit page, it'll return `'edit'`, for index page it'll be `'index'` and so on. This allows us to construct conditional logic in our sidebar partials. Let me show you a basic example first:

```ruby
# app/admin/components/_sidebar.html.arb

div class: 'sidebar-content' do
  if controller.action_name == 'new'
    h3 'Creating a New Item'
    p 'Please fill in the details below...'
  elsif controller.action_name == 'edit'
    h3 'Editing an Item'
    p 'Make your changes...'
  elsif controller.action_name == 'show'
    h3 'Viewing Item Details'
  else
    h3 'General Admin Area'
    p 'Navigate using the links provided.'
  end
end
```

This first example directly uses `controller.action_name` in our partial. It uses a simple conditional to output different content within the sidebar based on the current action being performed. It demonstrates a basic but effective approach to making the sidebar context-aware.

However, this quickly becomes unwieldy when you start adding more actions and custom routes. To simplify our code, we can utilize ActiveAdmin's `params` hash, particularly the `:action` and `:controller` keys. Instead of having long `if/elsif` chains, we can build helper methods to determine if an action falls within a certain category or if the current controller matches our sidebar requirements.

Here’s a slightly more advanced approach using a helper method:

```ruby
# app/helpers/admin/sidebar_helper.rb

module Admin::SidebarHelper
  def is_action?(action_name)
      controller.action_name == action_name.to_s
  end
  def is_resource_controller?(resource_name)
    controller_path = controller.controller_path.split('/')
    controller_path.include?(resource_name.to_s)
  end
  def is_in_resource_action?(resource_name, *actions)
    is_resource_controller?(resource_name) && actions.include?(controller.action_name.to_sym)
  end
end

# app/admin/components/_sidebar.html.arb
div class: 'sidebar-content' do
    if is_in_resource_action?('products', :new, :create)
        h3 'Adding a Product'
        p 'Follow these steps...'
    elsif is_in_resource_action?('products', :edit, :update)
      h3 'Updating the Product Details'
      p 'Ensure all fields are correctly completed'
    elsif is_action?(:index) && is_resource_controller?('products')
        h3 'Products'
        p 'Review current product catalog'
    else
        h3 'Admin Control Panel'
        p 'Use the menus to navigate'
    end
end

```

This approach keeps our views cleaner and moves logic into a helper which we can use through our entire admin area. Note how the code is much more concise using the helper method.

Furthermore, sometimes you'll have resources that are nested, for example nested comments within posts. The straightforward method will identify both ‘posts’ and ‘comments’ controllers as containing the ‘post’ string. To get more specificity in such a scenario, the following code snippet uses regular expressions.

```ruby
# app/helpers/admin/sidebar_helper.rb

module Admin::SidebarHelper
    def is_action?(action_name)
        controller.action_name == action_name.to_s
    end

    def is_resource_controller?(resource_name)
      controller_path = controller.controller_path.split('/')
      regex = Regexp.new("\\b#{resource_name.to_s}\\b")
      controller_path.any? {|part| regex.match(part)}
    end
    def is_in_resource_action?(resource_name, *actions)
      is_resource_controller?(resource_name) && actions.include?(controller.action_name.to_sym)
    end
  end
# app/admin/components/_sidebar.html.arb
div class: 'sidebar-content' do
    if is_in_resource_action?('posts', :new, :create)
        h3 'Creating a Post'
        p 'Follow these steps to create a new post'
    elsif is_in_resource_action?('posts', :edit, :update)
        h3 'Editing a Post'
        p 'Ensure all post details are correct'
    elsif is_action?(:index) && is_resource_controller?('posts')
        h3 'All Posts'
        p 'Review current posts'
    elsif is_in_resource_action?('comments', :new, :create, :edit, :update)
        h3 'Managing Comments'
        p 'Manage comments under individual posts'
    else
        h3 'Admin Control Panel'
        p 'Use the menus to navigate'
    end
end
```

In this example, I’ve added a regex to check if a full word match exists in the controller path. This prevents matching "post" in “comments”. This is especially useful in handling nested resources where more specificity is required.

For further reading, I highly recommend exploring "The Rails 7 Way" by Obie Fernandez. It provides a detailed view of the Rails framework which also extends into how ActiveAdmin is structured. Secondly, the official ActiveAdmin documentation itself, though sparse in certain areas, is essential for grasping how it handles request context. Finally, "Metaprogramming Ruby" by Paolo Perrotta is extremely beneficial to understanding how Rails (and ActiveAdmin) leverage metaprogramming for its dynamic behavior, which can help you debug and extend ActiveAdmin's functionality even further.

Remember, while `controller.action_name` is straightforward, the helper method approach will make your code easier to manage as your ActiveAdmin panel grows in complexity. Always think about code maintainability from the outset; it’ll save you a lot of time down the road. The key to these solutions lies not in complex machinery but in understanding the fundamental workings of ActiveAdmin's request context.
