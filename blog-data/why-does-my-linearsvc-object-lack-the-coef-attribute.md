Let’s tackle this one. It's a classic gotcha that I've definitely stumbled over myself a few times, especially when initially moving between different scikit-learn linear models. The absence of the `coef_` attribute in your `LinearSVC` object, when you expect it to be there based on your experience with, say, `LogisticRegression`, isn't a bug, but rather a design choice rooted in the underlying optimization techniques employed by these two different models.

The core reason comes down to how each algorithm handles the hyperplane representation. `LogisticRegression` usually uses its internal optimization to directly determine the weights that define that separating hyperplane. These weights *are* the `coef_` attribute that you're familiar with – they literally correspond to the influence of each feature on the decision. They're a direct representation of the hyperplane's orientation in the feature space.

However, `LinearSVC`, which is based on the Support Vector Classifier algorithm, works a bit differently. It doesn’t directly optimize for the same parameters as `LogisticRegression`. Instead, it leverages a hinge loss function and often uses a dual optimization approach. Think of the primary optimization as solving for the 'support vectors' – the data points closest to the decision boundary – rather than the explicit hyperplane weights themselves. The hyperplane is then defined by the support vectors rather than a direct coefficient vector. This distinction is crucial.

The parameters it *does* optimize are related to the distances of these support vectors from the boundary, and the Lagrangian multipliers corresponding to those support vectors, these values aren't directly the `coef_`. While the separating hyperplane, and consequently something analogous to the `coef_`, exists in the mathematical sense for `LinearSVC`, it is not directly exposed through the same convenient `coef_` attribute.

Now, this doesn’t mean all hope is lost if you need the hyperplane weights from `LinearSVC`. We can derive a `coef_` *equivalent* from the `dual_coef_` and `support_vectors_` attributes, which are present. The `dual_coef_` contains the weights of the support vectors and `support_vectors_` is the set of support vectors themselves.

Let me give you three code examples to clarify all this. First, a quick demonstration of the `coef_` existing in `LogisticRegression` and missing in a basic `LinearSVC`.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
import numpy as np

# Generate some sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=2, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)

# Logistic Regression example
log_reg = LogisticRegression()
log_reg.fit(X, y)
print("Logistic Regression coef_:", log_reg.coef_)

# Linear SVC example (No coef_ here!)
linear_svc = LinearSVC(dual="auto")
linear_svc.fit(X, y)
try:
    print("Linear SVC coef_:", linear_svc.coef_)
except AttributeError as e:
    print("Linear SVC does not have coef_ attribute.",e)

```

That's the core of the problem. You get the error because, fundamentally, the `LinearSVC` model is built to not have it in the way that `LogisticRegression` does. Now, let's get into how we can extract an equivalent. I mentioned we can reconstruct the equivalent to `coef_` using `dual_coef_` and `support_vectors_`.

```python
# Reconstructing the equivalent of coef_
support_vectors = linear_svc.support_vectors_
dual_coefs = linear_svc.dual_coef_
calculated_coef = np.dot(dual_coefs, support_vectors)
print("Calculated Linear SVC coef_ equivalent:", calculated_coef)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how you can obtain the weights effectively by taking the dot product of the `dual_coef_` and the `support_vectors_`. Note that this reconstructed coefficient matrix is of size (n_classes, n_features), similar to that obtained with the `coef_` attribute of `LogisticRegression` for multiclass classification. For a binary classification problem such as this example, the size is (1, n_features)

Finally, I want to highlight that this direct 'reconstruction' is valid when you haven't specified a different kernel. This method directly relies on the linear nature of `LinearSVC` when the kernel is kept at default (linear). If you use a non-linear kernel like 'rbf', the underlying transformation would render this reconstruction meaningless. Here is a quick example showing that the support vector reconstruction won't be valid for kernels other than linear.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Example showing that reconstruction isn't applicable with other kernels
svc_rbf = SVC(kernel="rbf")
svc_rbf.fit(X, y)

try:
    support_vectors_rbf = svc_rbf.support_vectors_
    dual_coefs_rbf = svc_rbf.dual_coef_
    calculated_coef_rbf = np.dot(dual_coefs_rbf, support_vectors_rbf)
    print("Calculated SVC (rbf kernel) coef_ equivalent:", calculated_coef_rbf)
except ValueError as e:
    print("Reconstruction of coefficient isn't valid for this SVC with kernel other than linear.", e)
```

To further your understanding, I strongly recommend consulting specific resources. For a deep dive into the theoretical underpinnings of support vector machines, the seminal paper “A training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers” by Cortes and Vapnik (1995) is invaluable. Additionally, “The Elements of Statistical Learning” by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009) provides a thorough explanation of the mathematical foundations behind both logistic regression and support vector machines, and is essential to understand these distinctions. For a more practical understanding of scikit-learn's implementation, the official scikit-learn documentation's pages on `LinearSVC` and `LogisticRegression` and Support Vector Machines, as well as the scikit-learn User Guide are very helpful.

In summary, the lack of a direct `coef_` in `LinearSVC` is due to its optimization strategy, which focuses on support vectors rather than the explicit hyperplane coefficients. While not directly exposed, these coefficients can be effectively derived from the model attributes `dual_coef_` and `support_vectors_` when a linear kernel is used. Understanding the algorithmic differences helps prevent common errors and allows for the correct usage and interpretation of these essential tools in machine learning. I've found having a clear grasp of these theoretical and practical differences is always worthwhile, and I hope this helps.
