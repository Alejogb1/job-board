Alright, let's tackle this. Funny enough, I actually dealt with a similar problem quite a few years back while working on a rather peculiar sensor data project. We had this massive 2D array of readings, and for our model validation, it was crucial to ensure an even-odd split, not just some arbitrary shuffle. I quickly learned that a naive approach can quickly lead to biased splits, especially when temporal or spatial dependencies are involved. So, let's unpack exactly how to achieve a robust even-odd split for a 2D array, returning the results as two tuples.

The core idea here revolves around using the *index* of the array's first dimension – effectively, the row number – to decide whether a given row belongs to the 'even' set or the 'odd' set. This is a deterministic and straightforward method that avoids randomness, which, in this context, is highly desirable.

First, let’s define what I mean by ‘even’ and ‘odd’ sets. Rows with even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) will be grouped into one tuple (the ‘even’ tuple), and rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) will be grouped into another tuple (the ‘odd’ tuple). We want to preserve the original row structure within those tuples, so we're not changing the inherent data shape within the split.

Here's a basic approach using pure python and list comprehensions, which often provides a great balance between readability and performance for these kinds of operations:

```python
import numpy as np

def even_odd_split_python(data):
  """
  Splits a 2D array into even and odd row tuples based on index.

  Args:
    data: A 2D array (list of lists)

  Returns:
      A tuple containing two tuples: (even_rows_tuple, odd_rows_tuple)
  """
  even_rows = tuple(row for i, row in enumerate(data) if i % 2 == 0)
  odd_rows = tuple(row for i, row in enumerate(data) if i % 2 != 0)

  return (even_rows, odd_rows)


# Example usage:
data_ex = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15]]
even, odd = even_odd_split_python(data_ex)
print(f"Even rows: {even}")
print(f"Odd rows: {odd}")
```

In this first example, you can see how the list comprehension iterates through the input 'data', using `enumerate` to provide both the index ('i') and the actual row. The modulo operator (`%`) determines if the index is even or odd, appending to the corresponding lists, which then converted to tuples.

While effective, if you're dealing with extremely large datasets, and are using `numpy`, the performance of the previous code is not ideal. `NumPy` provides vectorized operations that can handle this task much more efficiently. This is usually preferred in a production environment.

Here’s how you might achieve the same using `numpy` indexing:

```python
import numpy as np

def even_odd_split_numpy(data):
  """
  Splits a 2D numpy array into even and odd row tuples based on index.

  Args:
    data: A 2D numpy array

  Returns:
      A tuple containing two tuples: (even_rows_tuple, odd_rows_tuple)
  """
  data_arr = np.array(data)
  even_rows = tuple(data_arr[::2])
  odd_rows = tuple(data_arr[1::2])
  return (even_rows, odd_rows)


# Example usage:
data_ex_np = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15]])
even_np, odd_np = even_odd_split_numpy(data_ex_np)
print(f"Even rows (numpy): {even_np}")
print(f"Odd rows (numpy): {odd_np}")
```

Here, `numpy`'s powerful array slicing `[::2]` and `[1::2]` does the heavy lifting by directly indexing for even and odd rows. The slicing notation [start:end:step] is concise and is a fundamental concept in using NumPy. `[::2]` means 'start from the beginning, go to the end, in steps of 2' which gives us all even-indexed rows and `[1::2]` similarly selects odd rows. The `np.array()` ensures the data is in the correct format and is crucial to fully benefit from vectorization, where operations are performed on entire arrays rather than individual elements, significantly speeding up computations. I must stress that for large datasets, the performance difference compared to the pure Python version will become substantial.

Finally, let's consider a scenario where we might need to preserve the original numpy array type without converting the result tuples into array type.

```python
import numpy as np

def even_odd_split_numpy_no_conversion(data):
    """
    Splits a 2D numpy array into even and odd row tuples based on index,
     but keeps data as ndarray in tuple for further operations.

    Args:
      data: A 2D numpy array

    Returns:
        A tuple containing two numpy arrays (even_rows_arr, odd_rows_arr)
    """
    data_arr = np.array(data)
    even_rows = data_arr[::2]
    odd_rows = data_arr[1::2]
    return (even_rows, odd_rows)

# Example usage:
data_ex_np = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15]])
even_np_noc, odd_np_noc = even_odd_split_numpy_no_conversion(data_ex_np)
print(f"Even rows (numpy no conversion): {even_np_noc}")
print(f"Odd rows (numpy no conversion): {odd_np_noc}")
```
Here, instead of casting to a tuple, we maintain the numpy arrays in the return tuple, providing added flexibility for cases where those array types must be preserved for the next processing stage.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Data Structure:** Ensure your input `data` is a 2D array or a list of lists before processing to avoid index-out-of-bounds or type errors.
*   **Performance:** If working with large datasets, using numpy for its vectorized operations is highly recommended. The list comprehensions will often not scale as efficiently.
*   **Tuples or ndarrays:** Depending on your application needs, you may want to keep the output as tuples, lists, or numpy ndarrays for further operations.
*   **Maintainability:** While pure Python can be more readable for smaller cases, NumPy's approach is more concise and scalable for larger data.

**Further Reading:**

For further study, I'd strongly recommend delving into:

1.  **"Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney:** This book is a goldmine when it comes to data manipulation using pandas and NumPy, and it is essential reading for anyone using these libraries. Pay special attention to the chapters about numpy indexing.
2.  **The official NumPy documentation:** The NumPy documentation is very thorough and provides precise descriptions of every function and feature. Understanding the finer points of array slicing can significantly improve the efficiency of your code.
3.  **"Data Science from Scratch" by Joel Grus:** Provides a foundation in many data science topics including array processing. This one will provide background context on why the even/odd split is important.

The even-odd split might sound simple, but it can be incredibly useful when building models with specific constraints or when you need consistent data separation. In the real world, the context dictates the method best suited to your needs. This process allows for a deterministic and reproducible separation which can be beneficial in data exploration and model validation.
