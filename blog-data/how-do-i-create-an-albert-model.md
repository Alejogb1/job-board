Alright, let's talk about building an ALBERT model. This isn't a weekend project, but it's certainly within reach if you’ve got a solid grasp of transformers and some practical experience with deep learning. I remember back in '19, I was working on a complex NLP project for sentiment analysis, and that's when I first encountered the complexities of implementing ALBERT. The challenge wasn’t just getting the code to run; it was understanding the architecture’s nuances to fine-tune it effectively. So, let's break down what's involved.

Essentially, an ALBERT (A Lite BERT) model is a streamlined version of the original BERT model. The main goals behind ALBERT are to reduce the model’s parameter size, thereby increasing training speed and decreasing memory consumption, without sacrificing performance. This is achieved primarily through two techniques: parameter-sharing across layers and a sentence-order prediction (SOP) task instead of the next-sentence prediction (NSP) task used in BERT. Parameter sharing means all the layers in the encoder or decoder share the same parameters, and the SOP task focuses on understanding the coherence between consecutive sentences, learning more subtle patterns than the binary classification of BERT’s NSP task.

When you approach creating an ALBERT model, you're really looking at a few major areas: architecture setup, data preparation, and training. The architecture is already defined for you in research, but adapting that architecture with modifications is possible.

First, we need to set up the architecture. This involves defining the embedding layer, transformer encoder layers, and the necessary pooling layers to get a final representation. I typically start with a configuration file detailing these parameters, such as the hidden size, number of attention heads, number of layers, and the intermediate size for feed-forward networks.

Here's a snippet using pytorch that illustrates this:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class AlbertEmbedding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.word_embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.position_embedding = nn.Embedding(512, embedding_dim) # 512 max length assumption
        self.layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(embedding_dim)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)

    def forward(self, input_ids):
        seq_len = input_ids.size(1)
        position_ids = torch.arange(0, seq_len, dtype=torch.long, device=input_ids.device).unsqueeze(0)
        word_embeddings = self.word_embedding(input_ids)
        position_embeddings = self.position_embedding(position_ids)
        embeddings = word_embeddings + position_embeddings
        embeddings = self.layer_norm(embeddings)
        embeddings = self.dropout(embeddings)
        return embeddings

class AlbertAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_attention_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_attention_heads = num_attention_heads
        self.attention_head_size = hidden_size // num_attention_heads
        self.all_head_size = hidden_size

        self.query = nn.Linear(hidden_size, self.all_head_size)
        self.key = nn.Linear(hidden_size, self.all_head_size)
        self.value = nn.Linear(hidden_size, self.all_head_size)

        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)

    def transpose_for_scores(self, x):
        new_x_shape = x.size()[:-1] + (self.num_attention_heads, self.attention_head_size)
        x = x.view(*new_x_shape)
        return x.permute(0, 2, 1, 3)

    def forward(self, hidden_states):
        mixed_query_layer = self.query(hidden_states)
        mixed_key_layer = self.key(hidden_states)
        mixed_value_layer = self.value(hidden_states)

        query_layer = self.transpose_for_scores(mixed_query_layer)
        key_layer = self.transpose_for_scores(mixed_key_layer)
        value_layer = self.transpose_for_scores(mixed_value_layer)

        attention_scores = torch.matmul(query_layer, key_layer.transpose(-1, -2))
        attention_scores = attention_scores / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(self.attention_head_size, dtype=torch.float))

        attention_probs = nn.functional.softmax(attention_scores, dim=-1)
        attention_probs = self.dropout(attention_probs)

        context_layer = torch.matmul(attention_probs, value_layer)
        context_layer = context_layer.permute(0, 2, 1, 3).contiguous()
        new_context_layer_shape = context_layer.size()[:-2] + (self.all_head_size,)
        context_layer = context_layer.view(*new_context_layer_shape)
        return context_layer


class AlbertEncoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_attention_heads, intermediate_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.attention = AlbertAttention(hidden_size, num_attention_heads)
        self.ffn_intermediate = nn.Linear(hidden_size, intermediate_size)
        self.ffn_output = nn.Linear(intermediate_size, hidden_size)
        self.layer_norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(hidden_size)
        self.layer_norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(hidden_size)
        self.activation = nn.functional.gelu
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)

    def forward(self, hidden_states):
        attention_output = self.attention(hidden_states)
        hidden_states = self.layer_norm1(hidden_states + self.dropout(attention_output))
        intermediate_output = self.activation(self.ffn_intermediate(hidden_states))
        ffn_output = self.ffn_output(intermediate_output)
        hidden_states = self.layer_norm2(hidden_states + self.dropout(ffn_output))
        return hidden_states


class AlbertEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_layers, hidden_size, num_attention_heads, intermediate_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer = nn.ModuleList([
            AlbertEncoderLayer(hidden_size, num_attention_heads, intermediate_size)
            for _ in range(num_layers)
        ])

    def forward(self, hidden_states):
        for layer in self.layer:
            hidden_states = layer(hidden_states)
        return hidden_states

class AlbertModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_layers, hidden_size, num_attention_heads, intermediate_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = AlbertEmbedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.encoder = AlbertEncoder(num_layers, hidden_size, num_attention_heads, intermediate_size)
        self.pooler = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)


    def forward(self, input_ids):
      embeddings = self.embedding(input_ids)
      encoder_output = self.encoder(embeddings)
      first_token_tensor = encoder_output[:, 0] # Assuming first token is cls token
      pooled_output = self.pooler(first_token_tensor)
      pooled_output = torch.tanh(pooled_output)
      return pooled_output


```

This basic structure includes an embedding layer, multi-headed attention, and feed-forward networks. Now, remember, the crucial part of ALBERT is sharing those layer parameters. In a full implementation, you’d make use of a parameter-sharing technique, where `AlbertEncoder` doesn't actually contain multiple layers, but a single layer that is reused multiple times.

Next is data preparation. Since ALBERT needs to learn a sentence order (SOP) objective, your data needs to be structured accordingly. You’ll have pairs of sentences – either the correct order or the reverse – with a label indicating if they’re in the correct order. Data augmentation might include swapping consecutive sentences in a text, creating negative samples for SOP. Tokenize your text using a word piece tokenizer such as the sentence piece tokenizer, and remember to add special tokens like `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` to the beginning and the end of each sentence.

Here’s a simplified example showing data preparation using a tokenizer and generating SOP labels:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

def prepare_sop_data(text1, text2):
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
  encoded_text1 = tokenizer.encode_plus(text1, add_special_tokens=True)['input_ids']
  encoded_text2 = tokenizer.encode_plus(text2, add_special_tokens=True)['input_ids']
  concat_text = encoded_text1 + encoded_text2[1:] #remove [CLS] from second sentence
  if len(concat_text) > 512:
      concat_text = concat_text[:512]
      concat_text[-1] = 102 # replace with [SEP] if its too long
  return concat_text, 0 # 0 for in-order

text_a = "the cat sat on the mat."
text_b = "the dog barked loudly."
concat_data, label = prepare_sop_data(text_a, text_b)
print(f"Tokenized data: {concat_data}, Label: {label}")


text_a = "the cat sat on the mat."
text_b = "the dog barked loudly."
concat_data, label = prepare_sop_data(text_b, text_a) # reverse order
print(f"Tokenized data: {concat_data}, Label: {label}")
```

Remember that the actual labels for sentence order during the pre-training of ALBERT is either `1` if the sentences are flipped and `0` if in the correct order. In the above code snippet we only illustrate how the tokens are made, it does not illustrate all steps required. The full logic to generate SOP pairs and negative samples would include swapping sentence pairs randomly within large blocks of text.

Finally, you need to train your model. This involves defining your loss function, an optimizer (AdamW is usually a good choice), and setting up your training loop. A key part of ALBERT training is the combination of masked language modeling (MLM) loss (like BERT) and SOP loss.

Here is a snippet for training:

```python
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
import numpy as np


def create_dummy_dataset(seq_length, vocab_size, num_samples):
  input_data = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(num_samples, seq_length))
  labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(num_samples,)) #0 or 1 for sop
  return input_data, labels

def train_albert_model(model, epochs, batch_size, vocab_size):
    input_data, labels = create_dummy_dataset(512, vocab_size, 1000)
    input_tensor = torch.tensor(input_data, dtype=torch.long)
    label_tensor = torch.tensor(labels, dtype=torch.long)
    dataset = TensorDataset(input_tensor, label_tensor)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)


    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() # example SOP loss
    optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for batch_inputs, batch_labels in dataloader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(batch_inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, batch_labels) #simplified sop loss
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
        print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')


# Example usage
vocab_size = 30522 # size of the Bert vocabulary
embedding_dim = 128
num_layers = 6
hidden_size = 768
num_attention_heads = 12
intermediate_size = 3072

albert = AlbertModel(vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_layers, hidden_size, num_attention_heads, intermediate_size)
train_albert_model(albert, 5, 32, vocab_size)
```

In a real scenario, you will need to set up the language modelling objective as well, and this includes masking out some of the tokens and using the prediction output of the transformer to determine what the masked tokens were. This requires a loss function and the prediction output from the model.

For a comprehensive understanding of the ALBERT model, I'd strongly recommend reading the original paper, "ALBERT: A Lite BERT for Self-supervised Learning of Language Representations" by Lan et al. from Google Research. Additionally, "Natural Language Processing with Transformers" by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf is excellent for diving into the practical side of building these kinds of architectures. Both resources provide a solid background on the theoretical underpinnings and practical details necessary for a successful ALBERT implementation. Also, the Hugging Face `transformers` library provides a pre-implemented ALBERT model that is an ideal learning tool to gain further experience with its setup and intricacies.

Creating an ALBERT model from scratch is a substantial undertaking, but by breaking it into these manageable pieces – architecture, data, and training – it becomes much more achievable. Remember, it's an iterative process, so expect to refine and adjust your approach as you go.
