Right, let's tackle this. It's a scenario I’ve seen pop up more often than you might think, particularly in fields that deal with time series data exhibiting daily fluctuations that coalesce into larger weekly trends. You’re looking to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network on daily data, and extrapolate predictions to a weekly timescale. It's not a simple temporal aggregation; it’s about understanding the underlying daily patterns that contribute to the weekly picture. I've wrestled with this kind of forecasting in the past, and there are a few reliable methods to get you on track.

The core challenge here is the mismatch in temporal granularity between your input and output. LSTMs are great for learning sequential dependencies, but by default, they predict based on the same time step as the input sequence. To predict weekly outcomes from daily data, you'll need to re-frame your problem slightly. There isn't a single silver bullet; you'll likely need to combine a few approaches tailored to the specifics of your data. Let's consider a few techniques that are generally effective.

Firstly, you need to structure your data into a suitable format. Instead of simply feeding the LSTM a sequence of raw daily values, we'll be creating input sequences of a fixed length, representing the preceding days, and then linking each input sequence to a *single* weekly outcome. This means you're not just showing the LSTM one day at a time but a *context window* of, let’s say, seven days of daily values in order to predict the following single weekly outcome. A typical structure for each sample would therefore consist of seven daily input values and *one* weekly output value.

Here’s how it might look in code, using Python with TensorFlow/Keras:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

def create_sequences(data, seq_length, week_offset):
    xs, ys = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - seq_length - week_offset):
        x = data[i:(i + seq_length)]
        y = data[i + seq_length + week_offset -1] # Assuming weekly data is available with offset
        xs.append(x)
        ys.append(y)

    return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)

# Example Data (replace with your actual daily data)
daily_data = np.random.rand(365)
seq_len = 7  # 7 days in a week
week_offset = 7  # assuming next week's output
X, y = create_sequences(daily_data, seq_len, week_offset)

# Reshape for LSTM
X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1))

# LSTM Model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(seq_len, 1)),
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Make a prediction for a new week (using the most recent week of daily data)
new_week_start = daily_data[-seq_len:]
new_week_start = new_week_start.reshape((1,seq_len,1))
prediction = model.predict(new_week_start)
print(f"Predicted weekly outcome: {prediction[0,0]}")
```

In this example, the `create_sequences` function generates the input and output pairs, and the LSTM is set to learn the relationship between these sequences. The important point here is how we're mapping seven consecutive daily values to a single weekly value.

Secondly, we can look at feature engineering. Instead of just feeding raw daily values, consider engineering features that might help the LSTM capture weekly patterns more effectively. This could involve calculating weekly averages or moving averages using pandas, for instance, as additional inputs or targets. Perhaps the daily change or rate of change might influence the weekly total.

Let’s illustrate this with a code example that calculates a weekly moving average and then uses the last value of this as the target variable:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

def create_sequences_with_weekly_avg(data, seq_length, week_offset):
  df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['daily_values'])
  df['weekly_avg'] = df['daily_values'].rolling(window=7).mean()
  df = df.dropna()
  data = df.values
  xs, ys = [], []
  for i in range(len(data) - seq_length - week_offset):
    x = data[i:(i + seq_length),0].reshape(seq_length, 1)
    y = data[i+seq_length+week_offset -1 , 1]
    xs.append(x)
    ys.append(y)
  return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)

# Example Data (replace with your actual daily data)
daily_data = np.random.rand(365)
seq_len = 7  # 7 days in a week
week_offset = 7
X, y = create_sequences_with_weekly_avg(daily_data, seq_len, week_offset)

# LSTM Model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(seq_len, 1)),
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)


new_week_start = np.array(daily_data[-seq_len:])
new_week_start = new_week_start.reshape(1,seq_len, 1)
prediction = model.predict(new_week_start)
print(f"Predicted weekly outcome (using weekly average): {prediction[0,0]}")
```

Notice here that we're extracting the average from the rolling window of the weekly data. The data preparation has some added complexity, but it also better highlights how the weekly patterns are being computed in this case.

Thirdly, you might need to experiment with the *output layer* configuration of the LSTM. In the examples above, I'm directly predicting a single scalar value representing the weekly outcome. You could consider predicting multiple values – perhaps a forecast for each day of the following week – and then aggregate these predictions to get your overall weekly forecast. This might provide a more detailed picture and allow the network to learn intra-week dependencies better.

Here’s how you would need to change the model and the sequence creation to predict 7 values which can then be aggregated:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

def create_sequences_weekly_output(data, seq_length, week_offset):
  xs, ys = [], []
  for i in range(len(data) - seq_length - week_offset):
    x = data[i:(i + seq_length)]
    y = data[i + seq_length : i + seq_length + week_offset]
    xs.append(x)
    ys.append(y)
  return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)


daily_data = np.random.rand(365)
seq_len = 7
week_offset = 7
X, y = create_sequences_weekly_output(daily_data, seq_len, week_offset)
X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1))


model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(seq_len, 1)),
    Dense(week_offset) #output 7 day prediction
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)


new_week_start = daily_data[-seq_len:]
new_week_start = new_week_start.reshape((1,seq_len,1))
prediction = model.predict(new_week_start)
weekly_prediction = np.sum(prediction, axis=1)

print(f"Predicted weekly outcome (sum of daily predictions): {weekly_prediction[0]}")

```

In this version, the target variable is seven days, and we sum the predictions to get the total weekly outcome.

For further study and reference material, I highly recommend looking into *"Time Series Analysis" by James D. Hamilton*. This book is a standard in the field and provides a strong theoretical foundation for time series data and techniques. You should also review the various examples on time series processing available in the Keras documentation, specifically around LSTM and time series preprocessing which will be a great practical resource. Also, the paper, *"Long Short-Term Memory"* by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber is the fundamental study for LSTMs which will also improve your overall understanding.

In conclusion, achieving accurate weekly predictions using an LSTM trained on daily data requires careful data preparation, feature engineering, and experimentation with output configurations. It's a process, not a single function call, and requires iterative refinement based on how well your model performs on unseen data. Remember to use appropriate validation and testing methods to truly evaluate the quality of your model.
