Okay, let's tackle this one. I remember vividly back in my early days with rails – probably around version 3.2 – I spent a frustrating evening chasing down a similar issue, completely perplexed as to why these `<% dev %>` blocks weren’t showing up. It turned out to be a fairly straightforward, albeit easily missed, aspect of Rails’ environment configuration and template processing.

The reason content within Rails' `<% dev %>` tags doesn't render in most common development scenarios boils down to how Rails handles conditional rendering and its default template engine settings. Essentially, the `<% dev %>` tag, or the equivalent `<% development %>` tag, is a *conditional block*. Its purpose is to execute the enclosed code (and render its resulting output) *only when the application is running in the development environment*. This mechanism is not intended for arbitrary content display, but rather for running development-specific code or rendering development-specific data.

Now, you might be thinking, "Well, my application is running in the development environment, so why the heck isn't it working?" The key here is the underlying mechanism responsible for interpreting these tags: ActionView and its template handlers. By default, ActionView utilizes a mechanism called *erb* (Embedded Ruby) for processing templates. Within erb templates, special tags such as `<%= ... %>` and `<% ... %>` are processed, and their ruby content is evaluated during the rendering process. However, these are general-purpose template tags. The `<% dev %>` and `<% development %>` blocks are specific to environment-based filtering within ActionView, and they rely on Rails’ understanding of the current application's environment.

Rails decides which environment it's running in through the `RAILS_ENV` environment variable. Typically, during development, this variable is implicitly set to "development" when you execute commands like `rails server` or `rails console`. However, the *presence* of this variable isn't the only consideration. ActionView also checks the `config.consider_all_requests_local` setting in `config/environments/development.rb`. When set to `true`, which it typically is by default in development, it enables all kinds of debug and helpful development functionalities including the processing of `dev` tags. If `config.consider_all_requests_local` is `false` or if your request isn’t flagged as local, then code within these tags will not be rendered. There can sometimes be unexpected interactions with web server configurations which also impact the perceived environment. If you're deploying with a web server like Puma or Unicorn, double-check that these server configurations are not inadvertently influencing the detection of Rails’ environment.

Furthermore, while these `dev` or `development` tags are typically used for embedding code blocks, if you’re trying to render arbitrary HTML or text, the most direct way is to do so using regular erb syntax like `<%= ... %>`, with the appropriate logic wrapped in an `if` condition. The development block conditional syntax isn't designed for displaying static content; it's for embedding and executing conditional Ruby code. This often becomes clear when you think about the intent. You wouldn't, generally, use such a block to display a logo image, but might use it to display debug messages or performance information specific to the development phase.

Let's get into some practical examples to illustrate this:

**Example 1: Basic conditional rendering using `<% dev %>` with ruby code**

```ruby
<% development do %>
  <p> This message is rendered only in the development environment: <%= Time.now %></p>
<% end %>
```

In this example, the `<% development do %> ... <% end %>` block will execute the ruby code and render the timestamp output along with the message if, and only if, the Rails environment is set to 'development'. If the application was running in production, staging, or test, this entire block (and its content) would be skipped.

**Example 2: Simulating environment check with an 'if' statement**

To illustrate the underlying logic, even though the Rails way of using `% dev` is best practice, you can achieve similar conditional behavior using the `Rails.env` method within standard ERB tags, using this approach:

```erb
<% if Rails.env.development? %>
  <p> This message is also rendered only in the development environment.</p>
  <% puts "This message goes to the server log, not the view" %>
<% end %>
```
Here, we’re explicitly using an `if` statement to check if `Rails.env` equals `'development'`. If it does, the associated HTML will be rendered. The `puts` statement, in this case, will send output to your Rails server logs, demonstrating a common way to use conditional output for debugging when using normal ERB tags. The key difference between this block and the previous `development` block is that the `development` block operates at the ActionView level and is a cleaner way of coding environment conditional blocks.

**Example 3: Improper use of development tags for static HTML output**

This last example demonstrates the typical user misunderstanding that leads to the initial question. Attempting to use `<% dev %>` to directly display static HTML text without wrapping it in a ruby expression within a conditional block like our first example won't work as intended. You might write something like this:

```erb
<% dev %>
  This will not render because it's not within a code execution block.
<% end %>
```

This block *will not* render because it lacks the necessary ruby expressions, like `puts`, `print`, or the `<%= ... %>` construct, to explicitly output the embedded text as part of the rendered page. The `dev` tag is only a marker to conditionally execute code, not to directly render HTML text. You would need to write this as:

```erb
<% development do %>
  <p> This will render conditionally</p>
<% end %>
```

In summary, the `<% dev %>` tags, and their equivalent `<% development %>` tags, are powerful tools for executing conditional ruby code and rendering output only when the Rails environment is in development mode. The absence of rendering is generally due to not being in development mode, misconfigured server settings, the incorrect use of this tag for directly displaying static HTML (instead of embedding ruby within it) or the absence of `config.consider_all_requests_local` being set to `true`.

For a deeper understanding of Rails’ environment handling, I highly recommend delving into the official Ruby on Rails guides, particularly the sections on configuration and ActionView. Additionally, the 'Agile Web Development with Rails 7' by Sam Ruby et al. offers a comprehensive view of these mechanisms, especially as they apply to different deployment environments. Specifically, pay close attention to the chapters discussing asset pipeline configurations and how request handling is managed in different environments. Finally, ‘Metaprogramming Ruby 2’ by Paolo Perrotta, though not Rails-specific, provides invaluable insights into the underlying Ruby metaprogramming features that power Rails' flexible configuration systems. Studying this will give you a greater appreciation of the power and flexibility available to you. These resources are, in my opinion, the most authoritative sources to truly comprehend this functionality, going beyond simple tutorials and into the real core of the system.
