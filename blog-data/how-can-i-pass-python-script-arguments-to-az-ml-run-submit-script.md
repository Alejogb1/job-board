Okay, let's get into this. I recall a project a few years back where we were heavily leveraging Azure Machine Learning for model training, and the need to parameterize those training scripts was absolutely crucial. We had different datasets, hyperparameters, and even model architectures we wanted to experiment with. Hardcoding these into the scripts was a non-starter; we needed a robust way to pass arguments. The `az ml run submit-script` command, while powerful, can feel a little opaque if you're not familiar with the nuances of its argument handling. Here’s how I've approached this, and how you can too.

The primary mechanism for passing arguments to your Python script when using `az ml run submit-script` revolves around the `--script-params` parameter. This parameter expects a space-separated string of arguments, which are then interpreted by your Python script as if they were supplied via the command line during local execution. Let’s break down why this works and how to use it effectively.

When your script runs on the remote compute target managed by Azure ML, it receives the parameters exactly as they are provided in `--script-params`. The core logic is that these parameters are exposed to your Python script through `sys.argv`, the standard way command line arguments are passed. It's essential, therefore, that your Python script utilizes a robust argument parsing library. I have found `argparse` from Python’s standard library is generally sufficient for most needs and I'll use that in my examples.

Let’s begin with a simple demonstration. Imagine a scenario where I want to train a model with a specific learning rate and the path to a dataset. Here’s how we could structure this:

```python
# train_script_1.py
import argparse
import sys

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Train a model with specified parameters.")
    parser.add_argument('--learning_rate', type=float, help="Learning rate for the training process", default=0.001)
    parser.add_argument('--dataset_path', type=str, help="Path to the training dataset")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    print(f"Learning rate: {args.learning_rate}")
    print(f"Dataset path: {args.dataset_path}")

    # Your training logic would go here, using args.learning_rate and args.dataset_path
    print("Model training has started...")


if __name__ == "__main__":
   main()
```

Now, when submitting with `az ml run submit-script`, the command would look something like this:

```bash
az ml run submit-script --source-directory . --script train_script_1.py --experiment my_experiment --compute my_cluster --script-params "--learning_rate 0.01 --dataset_path data/my_training_data.csv"
```

In this example, `az ml` will package the source directory, transmit it to `my_cluster`, and then execute `train_script_1.py` using python, effectively equivalent to if we were calling it like `python train_script_1.py --learning_rate 0.01 --dataset_path data/my_training_data.csv` from the command line locally. The key is that the strings inside the `--script-params` are passed directly to the script's argparser.

Let's consider a slightly more complex scenario. Suppose you have more nuanced arguments, some with flags that enable certain behaviours. It's equally manageable:

```python
# train_script_2.py
import argparse
import sys

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Train model with boolean flags")
    parser.add_argument('--learning_rate', type=float, help="Learning rate for the training process", default=0.001)
    parser.add_argument('--dataset_path', type=str, help="Path to the training dataset")
    parser.add_argument('--use_augmentation', action='store_true', help='Enable data augmentation during training')
    parser.add_argument('--debug_mode', action='store_true', help='Enable debug mode for more verbose output')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    print(f"Learning rate: {args.learning_rate}")
    print(f"Dataset path: {args.dataset_path}")
    print(f"Use data augmentation: {args.use_augmentation}")
    print(f"Debug mode enabled: {args.debug_mode}")

    # Your training logic would go here, using the provided arguments
    if args.use_augmentation:
        print("Data augmentation routines...")
    if args.debug_mode:
      print("Debug print statements enabled...")
    print("Model training has started...")


if __name__ == "__main__":
   main()
```

The corresponding command for this scenario could be:

```bash
az ml run submit-script --source-directory . --script train_script_2.py --experiment my_experiment --compute my_cluster --script-params "--learning_rate 0.005 --dataset_path data/my_train_data.csv --use_augmentation --debug_mode"
```

Notice that boolean arguments are specified without a value; simply including the flag enables it via `action='store_true'` which allows a more succinct syntax when submitting the script. If we wanted to disable them, we would simply remove them from the `--script-params` string.

Now, you might be asking, "what if I need more control, or deal with a myriad of parameters that are best handled outside a single long string?" One useful tactic, especially with numerous parameters, is to combine the above with a configuration file, for example in JSON format.

Here’s a modification that implements such a strategy, with the Python script loading the configuration:

```python
# train_script_3.py
import argparse
import sys
import json

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Train model with external configuration")
    parser.add_argument('--config_file', type=str, help="Path to the configuration file")
    args = parser.parse_args()


    try:
        with open(args.config_file, 'r') as f:
            config = json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: Configuration file not found: {args.config_file}")
        return
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
      print(f"Error: Failed to decode configuration file at {args.config_file}")
      return

    learning_rate = config.get('learning_rate', 0.001)
    dataset_path = config.get('dataset_path')
    use_augmentation = config.get('use_augmentation', False)
    debug_mode = config.get('debug_mode', False)

    print(f"Learning rate: {learning_rate}")
    print(f"Dataset path: {dataset_path}")
    print(f"Use data augmentation: {use_augmentation}")
    print(f"Debug mode enabled: {debug_mode}")

    # Your training logic would go here
    if use_augmentation:
        print("Data augmentation routines...")
    if debug_mode:
      print("Debug print statements enabled...")
    print("Model training has started...")


if __name__ == "__main__":
   main()
```

Now we have `train_script_3.py` load the parameters from a file, passed as an argument. And let’s assume we have a file called `config.json` containing the following:

```json
{
  "learning_rate": 0.002,
  "dataset_path": "data/another_dataset.csv",
  "use_augmentation": true,
  "debug_mode": false
}
```

The command to submit this script would be:

```bash
az ml run submit-script --source-directory . --script train_script_3.py --experiment my_experiment --compute my_cluster --script-params "--config_file config.json"
```

With this method you can maintain a library of different configurations, providing a lot of flexibility in your runs. The benefit of a configuration file is that these arguments could be arbitrary key-value pairs, not limited to command-line arguments directly; the application's logic then determines how to interpret the key-value pairs, increasing flexibility.

For further in-depth study on best practices in command-line parsing in Python, I recommend reviewing the `argparse` documentation directly, alongside sections on command-line interfaces in the official Python documentation. Furthermore, “Effective Python” by Brett Slatkin provides useful guidance for the proper use of the standard libraries, including `argparse`, which I highly recommend. For further understanding of Azure ML specifically, documentation from Microsoft is an invaluable resource.

These strategies have served me well over multiple projects, ranging from simple hyperparameter tweaks to complicated data handling pipelines. By using `argparse` and a configuration file structure, you gain the control necessary to pass your parameters into remote scripts with precision. Always ensure proper error handling in your code and test your parameter passing locally before moving to remote computation to avoid unnecessary failures in remote runs.
