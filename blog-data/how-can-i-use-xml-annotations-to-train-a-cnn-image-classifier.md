Alright, let’s tackle this. I remember a project back in '18, working on defect detection in a manufacturing line. We were using computer vision, and training our convolutional neural networks (CNNs) initially felt like trying to herd cats. The challenge, of course, was labeling the data, and that's where xml annotations came into play. Specifically, they allowed us to provide precise bounding box coordinates for each defect within the images, rather than just relying on global labels. It made a considerable difference in the classifier's performance, and its ability to generalize. Let’s explore how you can achieve this.

At its core, using xml annotations for CNN training boils down to converting the information contained within those xml files into a format that’s digestible by your model. These annotations, commonly found in formats like Pascal VOC or similar, typically provide bounding box coordinates (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax), alongside the class label for each object within an image. The training pipeline has two primary components: parsing these XML files and transforming that information into a suitable format for your training framework (e.g., tensorflow, pytorch).

Firstly, let's discuss parsing. The xml documents are hierarchical. We need to traverse the structure, extract the file path, bounding box coordinates and associated class name. This can be achieved quite effectively with standard python libraries like `xml.etree.ElementTree`. Here’s a brief example of how to accomplish that:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import os

def parse_xml_annotation(xml_file):
    tree = ET.parse(xml_file)
    root = tree.getroot()
    objects = []
    filename = root.find('filename').text
    for obj in root.findall('object'):
        name = obj.find('name').text
        bbox = obj.find('bndbox')
        xmin = int(bbox.find('xmin').text)
        ymin = int(bbox.find('ymin').text)
        xmax = int(bbox.find('xmax').text)
        ymax = int(bbox.find('ymax').text)
        objects.append({'name': name, 'bbox': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]})
    return filename, objects

# example usage
xml_file_path = 'path/to/your/example.xml'
file, labels = parse_xml_annotation(xml_file_path)

print(f"file: {file}")
print(f"labels: {labels}")
```

This snippet showcases a straightforward function to read the xml structure and output the relevant information. Notice how the function returns a dictionary with the class `name` and `bbox` coordinates. We have to parse `xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, and `ymax` to integers as they're stored as strings initially in the XML file. The filename string is also returned. This is step one and it's quite essential.

Now, the parsed annotations alone are not ready for consumption by the CNN. The bounding box information has to be converted into a suitable format for our selected framework. This is where the second piece comes into play: data transformation. In the case of object detection tasks using CNNs, labels are commonly represented as a tensor, sometimes referred to as 'ground truth' or target.

The structure of this tensor depends on the specific detection architecture chosen. For instance, if you're working with a standard bounding box detection model, you might need to output tensors containing the bounding box coordinates in normalized form (e.g., relative to the image dimensions) and the corresponding class ID.

Here’s a more elaborate code snippet showing how to perform this transformation:

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

def process_image_and_annotations(image_path, annotation_path, class_map):
    filename, objects = parse_xml_annotation(annotation_path)

    image = Image.open(os.path.join(image_path, filename)).convert('RGB')
    image_width, image_height = image.size

    boxes = []
    class_ids = []

    for obj in objects:
        name = obj['name']
        bbox = obj['bbox']

        xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = bbox
        boxes.append([xmin / image_width, ymin / image_height, xmax / image_width, ymax / image_height])
        class_ids.append(class_map[name]) # convert string label to int representation

    return np.array(image), np.array(boxes), np.array(class_ids)

# Example usage
image_dir = "path/to/images/"
annotation_dir = "path/to/xml/"
class_mapping = {'defect_a':0, 'defect_b':1} # you should define this

# Get an image from image folder and its xml from xml folder based on index
example_xml_path = os.path.join(annotation_dir,"example.xml") # or by name, etc.
example_image_path = image_dir # we'll use only image dir in this instance as we are opening with image filename from the xml file
image, bounding_boxes, class_labels = process_image_and_annotations(example_image_path, example_xml_path, class_mapping)

print(f"image shape: {image.shape}")
print(f"bounding box coordinates: {bounding_boxes}")
print(f"class ids: {class_labels}")
```
This code snippet expands upon the previous parsing example. The `process_image_and_annotations` function takes image and annotation file paths as input. It loads the image, parses the xml, calculates the bounding boxes coordinates relative to image dimensions, and converts string labels into corresponding integer representations. A `class_mapping` dictionary is used to maintain a class string to int mapping. We return the image as a NumPy array, and bounding box and class id arrays. Notice how the bounding boxes are normalized between 0 and 1 based on image width and height.

The critical thing here is, the output needs to match the input expected by your neural network. If you're using a predefined architecture through a library like TensorFlow's model garden or PyTorch's torchvision models, understanding their input format is essential for proper integration. Many of them expect tensors directly as the output of a custom `Dataset` or generator. Therefore, we must prepare that data appropriately for those frameworks' expectations.

Finally, let’s talk about preparing a dataset class or generator, given that the format and structure of your model input is now established. Here is an example of how we might do that with a python generator (note: these can be very easily converted to a PyTorch or tensorflow dataset):

```python
import os
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def parse_xml_annotation_generator(xml_file):
    tree = ET.parse(xml_file)
    root = tree.getroot()
    objects = []
    filename = root.find('filename').text
    for obj in root.findall('object'):
        name = obj.find('name').text
        bbox = obj.find('bndbox')
        xmin = int(bbox.find('xmin').text)
        ymin = int(bbox.find('ymin').text)
        xmax = int(bbox.find('xmax').text)
        ymax = int(bbox.find('ymax').text)
        objects.append({'name': name, 'bbox': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]})
    return filename, objects


def image_annotation_generator(image_path, annotation_path, class_map):
   for filename in os.listdir(annotation_path):
        if filename.endswith(".xml"):
             full_xml_path = os.path.join(annotation_path, filename)
             image_file, annotations = parse_xml_annotation_generator(full_xml_path)
             image = Image.open(os.path.join(image_path, image_file)).convert('RGB')
             image_width, image_height = image.size
             boxes = []
             class_ids = []

             for obj in annotations:
               name = obj['name']
               bbox = obj['bbox']
               xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = bbox
               boxes.append([xmin / image_width, ymin / image_height, xmax / image_width, ymax / image_height])
               class_ids.append(class_map[name])
             yield np.array(image), np.array(boxes), np.array(class_ids)

# Example usage
image_dir = "path/to/images/"
annotation_dir = "path/to/xml/"
class_mapping = {'defect_a':0, 'defect_b':1} # you should define this


data_generator = image_annotation_generator(image_dir,annotation_dir,class_mapping)

for image, bounding_boxes, class_labels in data_generator:
    # here you would do your model training logic
    print(f"image shape: {image.shape}")
    print(f"bounding box coordinates: {bounding_boxes}")
    print(f"class ids: {class_labels}")
    break #just use one example for demonstration
```

The `image_annotation_generator` now traverses the files in the annotation directory. It processes each xml and associated image through the same logic as before, returning a tuple with the image, bounding boxes, and class labels. This function is a generator, that uses the yield keyword, which makes it suitable for feeding training data in batches.

For learning more about this, I highly recommend checking out the original Pascal VOC paper, “The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge”. It details the xml format, along with specifics on evaluation metrics. Also, for an in depth understanding of object detection using deep learning, research papers from the COCO (Common Objects in Context) datasets are exceptionally helpful. Further, “Deep Learning with Python” by François Chollet provides a practical look into deep learning concepts, including computer vision, using Keras which often pairs well with this kind of work. Lastly, textbooks like "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron offer step-by-step approaches for building these kinds of systems, too.

Remember, the exact implementation details might vary, particularly with different model architectures or frameworks, but the fundamental idea of parsing the xml annotations and transforming them into suitable input for your training pipeline remains consistent. The examples above should give you a solid foundation for this. Good luck!
