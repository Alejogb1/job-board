Alright, let's talk project paths in JetBrains IDEs. I’ve certainly encountered this a few times over the years, usually when dealing with complex multi-module projects or enforcing consistent directory structures across teams. It's less about “changing” the default project path globally for all new projects and more about specifying the location *when* you create a new project, and then managing configurations for existing ones.

First, it’s essential to distinguish between the ‘project’ directory and the IDE’s settings directory. The project directory is where all your source code, resources, and build artifacts live. It’s what you’ll commit to version control and where your day-to-day development happens. The IDE settings directory, on the other hand, stores preferences, keyboard shortcuts, plugin configurations, and so forth. It’s located outside of your project structure, and we won't be altering that here.

The initial step of specifying a new project path is rather straightforward: it occurs at project creation. During this process, whether you’re creating a new maven project, a python one, or any other type, JetBrains prompts you for the project's location. This dialog is where you designate the base directory. There's no single, overarching setting to pre-define where all new projects should live in general. Instead, the IDE uses the last-selected location as a default when the dialog opens again.

Now, things become a tad more intricate when dealing with existing projects. Specifically, you might want to move a project to a new directory entirely, or you might want to alter how project files are organised internally when using multi-module setups. That’s where configuration files come into play.

Let's explore a common scenario I experienced a few years back. My team was migrating a large Java application to a new repository structure and needed to refactor all the modules to align with the new structure. We had several multi-module Maven projects where each module was, quite frankly, a haphazard collection of files inside the project directory. The goal was to get everything into a logical `src` directory.

Here’s how we tackled that, piece by piece. First, we started with modifying the root-level pom.xml (assuming a maven project).

**Code Snippet 1: Maven Root Pom Configuration**

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>parent-project</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <packaging>pom</packaging>

    <modules>
        <module>module-a</module>
        <module>module-b</module>
    </modules>

   <build>
        <sourceDirectory>src</sourceDirectory>
        <resources>
            <resource>
                <directory>src/resources</directory>
            </resource>
        </resources>

      <plugins>
          <plugin>
              <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
              <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>3.8.1</version>
              <configuration>
                 <source>1.8</source>
                 <target>1.8</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
   </build>

</project>
```

In this root `pom.xml`, note the `<sourceDirectory>src</sourceDirectory>` entry within the `build` section. This tells maven that our source code is under a `src` directory at the root level, not directly under the root of the project folder. Similarly, I've configured the `resources` to be located under `src/resources`. Every sub module will now implicitly inherit these directories unless they override the setting themselves.

Secondly, we had to configure individual module projects to follow this setup and avoid any build issues.

**Code Snippet 2: Maven Module Pom Configuration**

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <parent>
        <groupId>com.example</groupId>
        <artifactId>parent-project</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </parent>

    <artifactId>module-a</artifactId>

    <build>
        <sourceDirectory>src/main/java</sourceDirectory>
        <resources>
            <resource>
                <directory>src/main/resources</directory>
            </resource>
        </resources>

    </build>
</project>

```

In the `module-a`'s `pom.xml` file, we specify `<sourceDirectory>src/main/java</sourceDirectory>` under the `build` section. Again, similar to resources directory, the source files for the module must now be placed inside the specified directory. This structure lets us organize files on a per-module basis, which makes locating and managing resources easier for larger projects.

These changes aren’t just about the project directory as seen in the IDE; they’re also about how Maven understands where to find the source code. If your build tools (gradle, sbt etc..) are not setup correctly, then the IDE could mark files and directories as invalid.

Finally, for non-Maven projects like python or javascript, the concept is the same, but you interact with specific settings for those build tools. As an example, here’s how you would configure the source directories in a typical Django project in a `settings.py` file.

**Code Snippet 3: Python Django `settings.py` example**
```python
import os

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

# Application definition

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'my_app' # assuming your app resides within src folder
]

# Define the location for static files, media files, etc.
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'src/static')
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'src/media')


# Example of how to define a template directory within the src folder
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'src', 'templates')],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]
```

In this Python snippet, `BASE_DIR` points to the root of your project, and we’re defining locations for static files, media files and templates inside the `src` folder. While these files are not directly used for compilation, you need to configure them so that Django knows where to look for them. This follows the same principle of explicitly defining resource locations.

So, while there isn’t a global setting to change all project paths at once in JetBrains IDEs, you manage the paths in two ways: At project creation through the new project dialog, and later using your project's configuration files. This often involves build tools’ configurations (like in `pom.xml` for Maven) or settings specific to your framework (like in `settings.py` for django).

If you want to go deeper on the nuances of build system configurations, specifically for maven, I would recommend starting with "Maven: The Complete Reference" by Sonatype.  For a more general understanding of project layouts in software engineering, "Code Complete" by Steve McConnell has great chapters dedicated to this, while "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin is beneficial for structuring well organized code that is easy to maintain.  Finally, the Django documentation itself is quite detailed on how to manage configurations like `MEDIA_ROOT` and `STATIC_ROOT`.

Understanding this distinction, the difference between project paths and IDE settings, and knowing how to modify build configurations, will give you control over your projects’ structure within your JetBrains IDEs. Hopefully, these examples and explanations clarify how to effectively organize your projects in JetBrains IDEs.
