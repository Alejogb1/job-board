Alright, let's unpack this peculiar behavior with Rails and devise. It's not uncommon to scratch your head when you see updates persisting even when your devise forms are throwing validation errors. I've certainly been there, troubleshooting late nights after encountering this exact scenario. It’s a frustrating puzzle, but thankfully, the underlying logic is quite understandable once you examine the flow of events.

The core issue stems from how Rails handles form submissions and parameter processing, combined with how devise manages user authentication and object persistence. Essentially, the controller’s update action proceeds to *attempt* the update, even if devise’s validation checks fail to validate the provided data *before* it’s passed to the database layer. This is an important distinction: devise validation failure doesn’t automatically halt the controller update itself.

To break it down, let’s consider the typical request lifecycle in a Rails application using devise. A user submits a form, typically with their updated credentials, aiming for the `update` action in your users controller (which devise often sets up). The request passes through the standard Rails middleware stack, including parameter parsing. Once inside the controller action, devise's helper methods try to locate the user with the id and then starts to process the passed parameters. Device performs initial validations, such as password confirmation mismatch, and sets errors accordingly within the user object. However, **the update method is still called on this user object**, irrespective of the errors being present at this point.

It's crucial to remember that `update` in active record doesn't immediately save to the database, it just changes the object in memory and returns a boolean indicating success of change of record data, not successful database write. If no changes happened, like in the situation when the user object is already in the same state, the update call returns false. But, if the attributes have changed, the update method returns true, however the changes to record are *not* yet saved. This can be easily overlooked when diving into the problem. After the `update` call, the controller typically saves the record using the `save` method. At that point, active record triggers its own validation logic which can throw errors if data doesn't pass those validations, and if no error exists, a write to database follows. In short, devise errors *do not directly prevent* the controller’s `update` action from being invoked, or from changing attributes of the record in memory. Devise sets up errors that are usually based on required fields or password validation, before the main active record validations are ran.

Here’s why this is important: the `update` method is called, so the model’s internal state *does* change. While it's not yet persisted, those changes exist on your in-memory object, and *can* be observed in debuggers or server logs. Then, when `save` is called, the model will attempt to write changes to the database. If there are other active record validations that are also failing and you are using active record validations, the `save` method will not trigger a database write and the record won't be written into the database.

Let’s look at a few code examples to illustrate this behavior.

**Snippet 1: A Basic User Update Controller**

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def edit
    @user = current_user
  end

  def update
    @user = current_user
    if @user.update(user_params)
      redirect_to @user, notice: 'User was successfully updated.'
    else
      render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:email, :password, :password_confirmation)
  end
end
```

In this controller, the `update` action fetches the current user, attempts to apply the submitted parameters using `@user.update(user_params)`, and only then attempts to save to db with the condition to execute a redirection only when the save is a success and there are no active record validations that are failing. Even if the user provides a password that doesn’t match the confirmation, the `@user.update(user_params)` call still sets the password attributes and *changes the object* in memory but if validation fails at a later step then a database write is not completed. If no error is present then changes to the user object will be written into database, which means the behavior may seem inconsistent, and depending on the validations that exist on the record, the behavior can be misleading when debugging.

**Snippet 2: Inspecting the User Object**

```ruby
def update
  @user = current_user
  Rails.logger.debug "Before update: #{@user.inspect}"
  if @user.update(user_params)
    Rails.logger.debug "After successful update: #{@user.inspect}"
     redirect_to @user, notice: 'User was successfully updated.'
   else
     Rails.logger.debug "After update with errors: #{@user.inspect}"
     render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
   end
end
```

Adding these debug statements, even with failing password validation you can see that the user record in memory has had its attributes changed, despite the overall action failing to update the record in the database. If you have active record validations that also fail, the database write won't occur and that's the reason for the confusion, you would have set attributes on your user record object but the database write never happens.

**Snippet 3: Ensuring only saved changes are used**

```ruby
def update
  @user = current_user
  if @user.assign_attributes(user_params) && @user.valid?
    if @user.save
      redirect_to @user, notice: 'User was successfully updated.'
    else
      render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  else
    render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end
```

This modification addresses the issue. We first apply the parameters with `assign_attributes` and then perform `.valid?` check to see if the record object is valid prior to actually attempting a database write by using `save` function. If the object is valid, then the save method is invoked, if it isn't, we render the edit page with errors that exist in the user object. With this approach we ensure that the record's attributes are only applied if the validation is successful.

To further delve into the nuances, I’d highly recommend examining the source code for devise's `RegistrationsController` (or whichever controller you are extending), and reading the documentation for active record's validation mechanisms. Understanding the specifics of how ActiveRecord handles updates and validations is vital. Also, David Heinemeier Hansson's "Agile Web Development with Rails" offers comprehensive insight into these mechanics. More specifically, check chapters on active record validations and form handling. If you want to understand the internal mechanism of Rails, "Rails 5 way" by Obie Fernandez provides great clarity on this subject.

In my experience, this behavior can be a source of subtle bugs if not properly handled. It’s tempting to think that if devise throws an error, the update is never going to happen. However, remember, that in memory representation of the object *is* changed even if devise is not able to successfully validate the incoming attributes, and only the write to the database does not occur if the save method returns false based on validations. Understanding the complete flow of data and validations is vital in achieving predictable and secure outcomes in your Rails applications. The examples here provide a good starting point to understand the specific case described in the question.
