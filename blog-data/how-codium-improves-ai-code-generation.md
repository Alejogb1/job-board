hey dude so i just watched this killer talk about ai code generation and man it was a wild ride lemme tell you  it's all about codium this company making an ide plugin that's supposedly better than chatgpt and copilot which is a pretty bold claim right

the whole point of the talk was to spill the beans on how they built this thing and why it's so supposedly awesome the main secret sauce apparently is their approach to "context awareness"  they're not just throwing your code at a giant language model and hoping for the best  they're doing some seriously clever stuff to make sure the model only sees the *relevant* bits  they spent like half the talk explaining how traditional methods kinda suck and why they had to build everything from scratch which is a story in itself lol

okay so picture this three main ways people usually deal with context in code generation  the first one is "long context"  think of it like stuffing your entire codebase into the prompt  easy to understand in theory but practically impossible  he mentioned gemini which takes like half a minute to process a small codebase  imagine doing that with a real-world project  it'd take forever

second method  "fine-tuning"  that's where you tweak the model itself to be super familiar with a specific codebase it's like training a custom model for each client  sounds amazing but it's insanely expensive and resource-intensive  way too much for most companies

then there's embeddings  the guy called them a "relatively proven technology" which is funny cuz he was about to tear them apart  embeddings are like tiny summaries of code snippets  you can search them super fast but the problem is you lose a ton of detail  it's like trying to understand a whole novel by reading only the chapter summaries  you'll get the gist but miss all the nuances

here's where it gets interesting they talked about a common benchmark for embedding search  it's basically a "needle in a haystack" problem  can you find one specific relevant piece of code  but that's not how real-world coding works  when you're building a react component you need a bunch of different things buttons inputs styles etc  a single relevant snippet just isn't enough  so codium came up with their own metric "recall 50"  it's about how many of the *top 50* most relevant items are actually useful  this is a way more realistic measure for real code search

the guy even showed a github pull request as an example of how they built a dataset that reflects real-world coding  brilliant  they used commit messages to see which files were changed and used that to create a massive dataset for testing it's like creating a training dataset directly from production data

another key idea was this thing called "m-query"  this is where things got bonkers  instead of relying on embeddings to find relevant code they basically run their llm on *every* relevant file in parallel  imagine running chatgpt on thousands of files simultaneously to see which ones are useful  it's ridiculously expensive but because they've built their own infrastructure from the ground up it's apparently affordable for them

that's a pretty big deal right this kind of parallel processing is nuts  here's a tiny glimpse of what that might look like in python  it's a highly simplified example but illustrates the concept:

```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

def process_file(filepath):
    # Simulate processing a single file with an LLM
    time.sleep(1) # Simulate processing time of 1 second
    print(f"Processed: {filepath}")
    return filepath # Replace with actual LLM output

def main():
    files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt", "file4.txt"]
    start_time = time.time()
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
      results = executor.map(process_file, files)
    end_time = time.time()
    print("Processing Time:", end_time - start_time)
    print("Processed Files:", list(results))
if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

this demonstrates how you can process multiple files concurrently using threads in python. this speeds up execution significantly compared to processing them sequentially but it's only a conceptual example  a real-world implementation would replace the `time.sleep()` with the actual llm interaction and would involve much more sophisticated error handling and data management

here's another little code snippet to illustrate embedding search  this one uses a simple cosine similarity calculation:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Sample embeddings (replace with actual embeddings from your model)
embedding1 = np.array([0.2, 0.5, 0.3])
embedding2 = np.array([0.1, 0.6, 0.4])
embedding3 = np.array([0.8, 0.1, 0.1])
query_embedding = np.array([0.2, 0.5, 0.3]) # Example query embedding

# Calculate cosine similarity
similarities = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], [embedding1, embedding2, embedding3])

# Print results
print(similarities)
print(f"Most similar embedding: {np.argmax(similarities)}")
```

this shows how to compute the similarity between embeddings using cosine similarity in numpy  this is a pretty basic example and the way you'd actually use embeddings in a real-world app would be way more complex  you'd need to use a vector database like pinecone or weaviate to efficiently search and retrieve the embeddings

and finally heres some pseudocode that loosely illustrates the mquery architecture  the actual implementation would be waaaay more intricate

```python
function mquery(query, codebase) {
  // parallel processing of codebase files
  results = parallelForAllFilesIn(codebase, function(file) {
    // run llm on each file to get relevance score
    score = llm.assessRelevance(query, file);
    return {file: file, score: score};
  });

  // sort results by score in descending order
  results.sortByScore(descending = true);

  // return top n results (n=50)
  return topN(results, n = 50);
}
```

this code outlines the high-level steps of the mquery architecture  it's conceptual and doesn't represent the exact implementation details  building this would require using a distributed computation framework and sophisticated llm interaction techniques

so yeah that's the gist of it  codiumâ€™s approach to context retrieval is a pretty significant departure from the norm it's expensive but they claim their vertical integration lets them offer it at scale  the talk was super interesting i mean this is pretty bold to claim you've made some massive breakthroughs in code generation  but the whole thing was very compelling  it's certainly an interesting development in the world of ai-assisted coding  i'm downloading their plugin to try it for myself lol
