Let’s tackle this. Having spent quite a bit of time fine-tuning Wav2Vec 2.0 models for various speech-related tasks, I’ve certainly bumped into the challenge of identifying inquiry sentences within the model's output. It’s not always straightforward, as the raw transcript alone often lacks the explicit markers we need to reliably classify questions. Let me walk you through some techniques I’ve found effective, combining both linguistic analysis and practical coding implementations.

The fundamental issue here is that Wav2Vec 2.0, as a speech-to-text model, primarily focuses on accurate transcription of spoken words. It's not inherently designed to understand the *intent* behind those words, like whether a sentence is a statement, a question, or a command. Consequently, simply looking at the final punctuation mark—or the lack thereof—is insufficient. A statement can end with a question mark in informal speech, and questions can sometimes be phrased as declarative sentences, particularly in languages other than English.

My approach involves a blend of post-processing techniques. We can’t rely on just one method; rather, we often need a combination. Firstly, **keyword spotting** is a crucial element. We’re looking for interrogative words—the 'who,' 'what,' 'when,' 'where,' 'why,' and 'how' family, but also auxiliary verbs like 'is,' 'are,' 'do,' 'does,' 'can,' 'could,' 'should,' 'would,' and so on when they appear at the beginning of the sentence. These signal possible questions. I wouldn’t focus on absolute position alone; context matters, and they can appear later in the sentence too.

Secondly, the **analysis of sentence structure and word order** plays a significant role. In many languages, including English, a typical question often involves subject-auxiliary verb inversion, such as "Are you going?" compared to "You are going." Although this is not a universal rule across all question types or languages, recognizing these patterns can certainly improve detection accuracy. However, this does require understanding part-of-speech (POS) tagging and dependency parsing which, depending on the complexity, might add overhead.

Thirdly, we can explore **intonation analysis** to some extent, though this is more intricate. If we have access to the raw audio along with the transcripts, we could analyze prosodic features such as pitch patterns and rising intonation at the end of the sentence, which are common, but not always present, in questions. Although Wav2Vec 2.0 itself doesn't provide this directly, libraries like librosa can extract these features from the audio. However, this is the most costly route in terms of computation and requires an audio component.

Let's look at some concrete code examples to illustrate these points, working with Python. These examples are simplified but can demonstrate the core concepts.

**Example 1: Keyword Spotting**

```python
import re

def is_question_keyword(text):
    question_keywords = r'\b(who|what|when|where|why|how|is|are|do|does|can|could|should|would)\b'
    if re.search(question_keywords, text.lower()):
        return True
    return False

example_text1 = "What is the meaning of this?"
example_text2 = "The answer is in the documentation."
example_text3 = "You should try harder."

print(f"'{example_text1}' is a question: {is_question_keyword(example_text1)}")
print(f"'{example_text2}' is a question: {is_question_keyword(example_text2)}")
print(f"'{example_text3}' is a question: {is_question_keyword(example_text3)}")
```
This example uses regular expressions for finding keywords. While simple, it has proven reasonably effective for basic detection. Note the `\b` word boundary markers; without them, `'how'` in the middle of a word would also trigger a match.

**Example 2: Subject-Auxiliary Inversion Detection**

For more structured analysis, I've found that the spaCy library is invaluable:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def is_question_inversion(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    if len(doc) == 0:
        return False
    first_token = doc[0]
    if first_token.tag_ in ["VBZ", "VBP", "MD", "VBD"]:
        # VBZ: verb, 3rd person singular present; VBP: verb, non-3rd person singular present;
        # MD: modal; VBD: verb, past tense. Often auxiliary verbs in questions.
        # check if any 'Wh' word is in sentence
        for token in doc:
            if token.tag_ in ["WDT", "WP", "WP$","WRB"]:
                return True
        if doc[1].dep_ == 'nsubj' or doc[1].dep_ == 'nsubjpass': #next token should be noun, subject
            return True
    return False


example_text4 = "Are you ready to begin?"
example_text5 = "You are ready to begin."
example_text6 = "Why are you going?"


print(f"'{example_text4}' is a question: {is_question_inversion(example_text4)}")
print(f"'{example_text5}' is a question: {is_question_inversion(example_text5)}")
print(f"'{example_text6}' is a question: {is_question_inversion(example_text6)}")
```

This example uses POS tagging and dependency parsing. The `is_question_inversion` function checks for inversion of the initial verb and the subject. This can be refined further by considering additional rules, such as specific question-word positions. Note that this assumes the text is primarily in English.

**Example 3: Combining Keyword and Structure Analysis**

For a more robust solution, we can combine the two previous approaches:

```python
def is_question_combined(text):
    if is_question_keyword(text) or is_question_inversion(text):
        return True
    return False

example_text7 = "The meeting is over, isn't it?"
example_text8 = "You are late."

print(f"'{example_text7}' is a question: {is_question_combined(example_text7)}")
print(f"'{example_text8}' is a question: {is_question_combined(example_text8)}")

```

This final example shows how combining detection methods can improve accuracy. This example captures both direct and some forms of indirect questions, although more sophisticated patterns require more complex parsing.

These are by no means exhaustive solutions, but they illustrate the practical approaches I've found most reliable when working with Wav2Vec 2.0 outputs. The choice of method and their combination depends on the specific task, language, and desired trade-off between speed and accuracy.

For further reading and a deeper understanding of the techniques I mentioned, I’d recommend looking at these resources:

1.  **"Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin:** This is an incredibly comprehensive textbook that covers everything from basic text processing to more advanced techniques like POS tagging, parsing, and semantic analysis. It is crucial for linguistic context.
2.  **"Natural Language Processing with Python" by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper:** This book, while slightly older, is excellent for getting a hands-on understanding of practical NLP tasks using the NLTK library. It offers a good foundation for anyone learning about NLP.
3.  **spaCy's official documentation:** The spaCy library’s documentation is an excellent resource to learn about advanced NLP concepts. They offer detailed guides and examples for everything from tokenization to complex dependency parsing. It's crucial for implementing rule-based systems.
4.  **Papers on prosodic analysis for speech recognition:** While specific papers might be niche, searching for research on "intonation for question detection," "prosody in speech recognition," or similar topics will reveal relevant academic studies if intonation-based analysis is crucial for your task.

Remember that no single technique is perfect. The best approach involves experimenting and adapting these methods to the specifics of your use case. You might need a combination of these methods, potentially with the addition of machine learning approaches, to build a reliable question detection system, as this is an ongoing research area in NLP.
