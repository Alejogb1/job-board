Let's jump right in, shall we? It's not uncommon to see a Deep Q-Network (DQN) struggle with Atari games, despite its seeming simplicity and early success stories. I've personally spent countless hours debugging DQN implementations, banging my head against the wall when the agent remained resolutely clueless. The frustrating truth is, several interconnected factors can contribute to this learning failure, and it often isn’t one single culprit but rather a confluence of challenges. Let’s explore them.

Firstly, the issue often isn’t with the core DQN algorithm itself but rather the environment's complexity and the inherent limitations of the approach. Atari games, despite appearing relatively basic to us, possess high-dimensional state spaces when rendered as raw pixel data. The sheer volume of input information requires a neural network with considerable capacity to effectively extract relevant features. We're often dealing with input vectors with tens of thousands of dimensions, and this alone can lead to convergence issues if not handled properly. The network might simply struggle to generalize from observed states and fail to form useful abstractions. This challenge is compounded by the temporal nature of the game play; a single frame alone means little without context from previous frames.

Secondly, there's the issue of unstable learning. DQN, as a form of temporal difference learning, is susceptible to divergence if not carefully controlled. Consider the classic Q-learning update: `Q(s, a) <- Q(s, a) + alpha * (r + gamma * max_a' Q(s', a') - Q(s, a))`. It is inherently recursive; the target `r + gamma * max_a' Q(s', a')` depends on the current Q values, creating a moving target. This can lead to oscillations or even divergence of the Q-value function. This instability is heavily exacerbated by the use of deep neural networks. Remember that early experiments struggled until experience replay and target networks were introduced. These innovations help to mitigate the instability caused by correlations in sampled data (replay) and by fixing the target Q values for a specific period (target network). However, even with these safeguards, the network might still fail to converge properly if the network architecture isn't well-suited for the task or the hyperparameters are poorly tuned.

Thirdly, exploration versus exploitation becomes a critical hurdle. In the context of Reinforcement Learning, we require the agent to thoroughly explore its environment, discovering potential rewarding states and actions. However, the DQN uses an epsilon-greedy policy, which makes the agent randomly explore with a probability epsilon and exploit its knowledge with a probability (1-epsilon). If epsilon decays too quickly, the agent may not have sufficiently explored the state space, leading to a sub-optimal policy. Conversely, if epsilon remains high for too long, the agent may take non-optimal actions and learn inefficiently. This epsilon-greedy policy also can have problems; if you have long-tailed action distributions, even if you have explored correctly, exploitation of low-probability actions may be very slow due to the low number of samples in training. This is a major factor that is commonly overlooked during experimentation, and many of the failures of RL algorithms stem from this difficulty, as was shown in "On the Difficulty of Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning."

Finally, I've encountered issues with insufficient reward signals. Some Atari games provide sparse reward signals, especially in the beginning of a training cycle. The agent may not encounter a single reward event in a series of game frames, making it very difficult for the learning algorithm to discover the connection between states and future rewards. The agent might wander aimlessly for a considerable amount of time without receiving informative feedback. Moreover, a single positive reward might not be sufficient to backpropagate the signal across several time steps, particularly if the discount factor (gamma) is too low. A large gamma implies that future rewards are deemed more important and can assist with spreading of reward information across several time steps, and it is something that is often optimized for in RL algorithm training.

Let’s illustrate these points with code examples. Consider a standard DQN update.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

# Fictional setup
class DQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        super(DQN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 128)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, action_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

state_size = 84 * 84 # For demonstration purposes, assume a flattened input
action_size = 4
learning_rate = 0.001
gamma = 0.99

model = DQN(state_size, action_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()


# Sample transition data (s, a, r, s', done) - a random transition
state = torch.rand(1,state_size) # a random state input
action = torch.randint(0, action_size, (1,))
reward = torch.rand(1)
next_state = torch.rand(1,state_size)
done = False

def train_step(state, action, reward, next_state, done):
  model.train()
  q_values = model(state)
  next_q_values = model(next_state).detach()
  max_next_q_value = torch.max(next_q_values, dim=1)[0]
  target_q_value = reward + gamma * max_next_q_value * (1 - done)
  target_q_value = target_q_value.reshape(1,-1)
  predicted_q_value = q_values.gather(1, action.reshape(1,-1)).reshape(1,-1)

  loss = criterion(predicted_q_value, target_q_value)
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()

train_step(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
```

This basic code demonstrates the standard DQN update. But, it doesn't handle crucial aspects such as experience replay, target networks, and hyperparameter tuning, all of which are critical for stable learning. Now, let's visualize a scenario demonstrating the impact of an inadequate replay buffer, a crucial component in DQN, and also demonstrate target networks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import random

class DQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        super(DQN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 128)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, action_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.buffer = []
        self.position = 0

    def push(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        if len(self.buffer) < self.capacity:
            self.buffer.append(None)
        self.buffer[self.position] = (state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        self.position = (self.position + 1) % self.capacity

    def sample(self, batch_size):
        batch = random.sample(self.buffer, batch_size)
        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)
        return torch.stack(states), torch.stack(actions), torch.stack(rewards).reshape(-1,1), torch.stack(next_states), torch.stack(dones).reshape(-1,1)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.buffer)

state_size = 84 * 84
action_size = 4
learning_rate = 0.001
gamma = 0.99
batch_size = 32
replay_capacity = 1000
update_frequency = 100

model = DQN(state_size, action_size)
target_model = DQN(state_size, action_size)
target_model.load_state_dict(model.state_dict()) # synchronize target model with the main model
target_model.eval() # set to eval to disable gradient calculations
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
replay_buffer = ReplayBuffer(replay_capacity)

state = torch.rand(1,state_size) # initial state

for i in range(10000):
    # Create a random transition
    action = torch.randint(0, action_size, (1,))
    reward = torch.rand(1)
    next_state = torch.rand(1,state_size)
    done = False
    replay_buffer.push(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
    state = next_state
    if len(replay_buffer) > batch_size and i % update_frequency == 0:
      states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
      model.train()
      q_values = model(states)
      with torch.no_grad(): # target network doesn't need gradients
        next_q_values = target_model(next_states)
      max_next_q_value = torch.max(next_q_values, dim=1)[0]
      target_q_value = rewards.squeeze() + gamma * max_next_q_value * (1 - dones.squeeze())
      target_q_value = target_q_value.reshape(-1,1)

      predicted_q_value = q_values.gather(1, actions.reshape(-1,1))
      loss = criterion(predicted_q_value, target_q_value)
      optimizer.zero_grad()
      loss.backward()
      optimizer.step()
      target_model.load_state_dict(model.state_dict())

```

This code shows the experience replay buffer along with the target network. These are key components required to achieve learning in DQN, and shows that without them the algorithm often fails to converge. Finally, let's illustrate a poor exploration policy through epsilon-greedy exploration.

```python
import random
import numpy as np

class EpsilonGreedyPolicy:
    def __init__(self, epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.01, decay_rate=0.0001):
        self.epsilon_start = epsilon_start
        self.epsilon_end = epsilon_end
        self.decay_rate = decay_rate
        self.epsilon = epsilon_start

    def select_action(self, q_values, action_size, training_mode = True):
      if training_mode:
        if random.random() < self.epsilon:
          action = random.randint(0,action_size-1)
        else:
          action = np.argmax(q_values)
        self.decay_epsilon()
        return action
      else:
        return np.argmax(q_values)
    def decay_epsilon(self):
        self.epsilon = max(self.epsilon_end, self.epsilon - self.decay_rate)


policy = EpsilonGreedyPolicy(epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.01, decay_rate=0.00001)
action_size = 4
q_values = np.random.rand(action_size)
# Simulate many actions
for i in range(1000):
    action = policy.select_action(q_values, action_size)
    print(f"Action: {action}, Epsilon: {policy.epsilon:.4f}")

```

This example shows how epsilon decreases over time, a typical approach, however this rate can affect the learning performance in unexpected ways, as discussed. These code examples underscore the points I've mentioned. In conclusion, DQN’s failure in Atari games usually comes from a combination of high-dimensional state spaces, unstable learning due to temporal difference learning, and inadequate exploration and reward signals. To dig deeper into these issues, I’d highly recommend studying "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Mnih et al. (2013) for the original DQN framework, and "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning" (2015), the nature paper. For a deep dive into exploration strategies, the paper “On the Difficulty of Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning” is fundamental, and for a more theoretical grounding on reinforcement learning in general "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton and Barto is a must-have. These resources, combined with hands-on experimentation, will significantly clarify the challenges you face with DQN.
