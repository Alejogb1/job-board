,  I recall a particular project back in '08; we were dealing with raw image processing on embedded systems. We noticed some rather peculiar discrepancies between allocated memory blocks and the intended image dimensions, especially around powers of two, and this problem, dimensions 252 and 256 specifically, was a recurring head-scratcher. The short, somewhat unsatisfying answer is they are unequal because, well, they *are* different numbers. But you’re asking for a deeper look into *why* that difference matters in computer systems, specifically in areas like memory alignment, data structures, and, to some degree, performance. Let’s break it down.

The apparent simplicity of 252 and 256 masks underlying complexities that can heavily influence how data is stored and accessed in computer memory. The number 256, being a power of two (2^8), often aligns very neatly with memory structures. This is no accident. Hardware is frequently designed to operate optimally on data organized in powers of two. This includes address buses, cache lines, and data transfers. When a processor retrieves data, it typically does so in blocks, often sizes that are power-of-two multiples (e.g. 4, 8, 16, 32 bytes, etc.) that correspond to its architecture. This facilitates faster and more efficient operations. Memory allocation routines on many systems (both high-level and embedded) prefer to allocate blocks that are multiples of power-of-two sizes. This minimizes fragmentation and enhances access speeds.

The number 252, conversely, while close, is not a power of two. Thus, it may trigger different kinds of treatment in algorithms and memory management. Let me illustrate that with a few code snippets.

**Example 1: Array Alignment and Padding**

Consider the need to allocate arrays in memory. Many systems might try to align the beginning of each array on a memory boundary that is a power of two. The problem doesn’t arise with simple arrays of integers, which are typically a fixed size, but more frequently with structures or objects. Here's a simple demonstration in c++:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

struct MyData_252 {
    uint8_t data[252];
};

struct MyData_256 {
    uint8_t data[256];
};


int main() {
    std::cout << "Size of MyData_252: " << sizeof(MyData_252) << " bytes" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of MyData_256: " << sizeof(MyData_256) << " bytes" << std::endl;

    MyData_252 data252;
    MyData_256 data256;
    
    std::cout << "Address of data252.data: " << static_cast<void*>(data252.data) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Address of data256.data: " << static_cast<void*>(data256.data) << std::endl;


    return 0;
}
```
If you run this you may see that on many systems, *sizeof(MyData_252)* would likely be 252, while *sizeof(MyData_256)* would be 256. However, observe the output addresses, specifically when allocating arrays dynamically. Depending on the allocator, you might find that it will often align memory blocks on boundaries that are power of two multiples. For instance, on systems with 64-bit memory addressing, aligned memory may allocate starting addresses that are aligned to multiples of 8 or 16 bytes. Thus an allocation of 252 bytes might get rounded up or result in padding to adhere to memory access rules. An allocation of 256 bytes, however, perfectly fits a power-of-two alignment. While this isn't always explicit in simple code, the underlying mechanisms are at play, and are much more apparent when dealing with custom allocators, memory mapping and DMA.

**Example 2: Image Data and Memory Layout**

In image processing, this distinction becomes more pronounced. If we’re creating image data structures or bitmaps, having row lengths that are powers of two simplifies many algorithmic optimizations, specifically when the system is also dealing with textures or memory that is optimized to be accessed in power-of-two chunks. Imagine we have images whose row size happens to be 252 pixels wide, let’s assume each pixel is one byte. If we allocate a single contiguous buffer for the pixel data, there are challenges for systems that are optimized for multiples of power of two, since we cannot simply split the image row into power of two chunks. Let's look at a basic example of allocation for image data:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void allocate_image_data(int width, int height) {
    std::vector<uint8_t> image_data;
    image_data.resize(width * height);
    std::cout << "Allocated " << width * height << " bytes of image data" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    allocate_image_data(252, 100);
    allocate_image_data(256, 100);
    return 0;
}
```
While this doesn't directly showcase the issue, imagine you're reading and processing this image data with SIMD operations. These operations typically work on vectors of data of 16 bytes, 32 bytes, or even larger multiples. A width of 256 pixels fits much more naturally into this processing model. We could optimize that by using an image width of 256 to fill up those SIMD vectors for processing. 252, on the other hand, will leave unused slots and more overhead in such cases. This means extra logic is needed to handle partial vector loads, which can hurt efficiency and increase code complexity.

**Example 3: Data Transfer and Caching**

Finally, think about data transfer rates and caching. When working with Direct Memory Access (DMA), which is quite common in embedded systems, power of two aligned memory blocks can be transferred much more efficiently. The reason is simple: a DMA controller’s data transfers will often be optimized for the system’s memory bus width and cache line sizes. For example, if a cache line is 64 bytes long and you’re working with a block of data that's a multiple of 64 bytes, the controller can load the entire cache line efficiently. When the data sizes don't match a power-of-two, the memory controller or the CPU might have to perform additional operations to deal with these less than perfect blocks of data which can slow down transfers and processing.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <cstring>

void copy_memory(uint8_t* source, uint8_t* dest, size_t size) {
  std::memcpy(dest, source, size); // simulate data transfer
}

int main() {
    const size_t size252 = 252 * 1024; // 252 KB
    const size_t size256 = 256 * 1024; // 256 KB

    uint8_t* source252 = new uint8_t[size252];
    uint8_t* dest252 = new uint8_t[size252];
    uint8_t* source256 = new uint8_t[size256];
    uint8_t* dest256 = new uint8_t[size256];
    
    auto start252 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    copy_memory(source252, dest252, size252);
    auto end252 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double> duration252 = end252 - start252;
    std::cout << "Time for 252KB transfer: " << duration252.count() << " seconds" << std::endl;

    auto start256 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    copy_memory(source256, dest256, size256);
    auto end256 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double> duration256 = end256 - start256;
      std::cout << "Time for 256KB transfer: " << duration256.count() << " seconds" << std::endl;
    
    delete[] source252;
    delete[] dest252;
    delete[] source256;
    delete[] dest256;


    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet just simulates data transfer using *memcpy*. Although simplistic, even here you might observe slight timing differences depending on your system's architecture and bus operations. The performance difference is more obvious when dealing with hardware DMA controllers in embedded applications.

To really solidify your understanding, I'd recommend exploring resources like "Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach" by Hennessy and Patterson; it provides an extensive deep dive into the hardware aspects. Furthermore, for practical memory allocation and efficiency topics, "Effective C++" by Scott Meyers has some really illuminating sections on how to use memory efficiently. For image processing specifics, you'll find "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez and Woods a very valuable resource.

In conclusion, while the numbers 252 and 256 might seem trivially different, their impact on system design, particularly concerning memory access, cache utilization, and hardware optimizations is far from trivial. 256, as a power of two, plays to the strengths of hardware design, whereas 252 might introduce additional overheads due to less-than-ideal data structures and access patterns. My experience has shown that these seemingly small differences can become significant roadblocks to performance if not well understood and planned for from the outset.
