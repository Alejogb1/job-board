,  It's a situation I've encountered a few times, usually right when you think everything is set to run smoothly. Debugging data not loading in SageMaker is frustrating, and it often comes down to a few common culprits rather than some singular, catastrophic failure. Let’s break it down systematically, based on what I've seen and resolved over the years.

The core issue, more often than not, isn’t some fundamental flaw in SageMaker itself, but rather a mismatch in how the debug configuration is specified or how the underlying training process is interacting with the debug hook. I’ll focus on the most prevalent scenarios. First, let's look at the configuration. Typically, we use the `DebuggerHookConfig` within our SageMaker estimator. The path where debugging data is saved needs to be correct and properly accessible by both the training job and the subsequent analysis job, which in many cases is your notebook instance or local machine. Incorrect configuration here can lead to SageMaker unable to locate or retrieve debug data.

Let's imagine a previous project I worked on, a deep learning model for time-series forecasting. Initially, the debugging data never showed up. The code initially looked something like this:

```python
from sagemaker.debugger import DebuggerHookConfig
from sagemaker.estimator import Estimator
import sagemaker

sagemaker_session = sagemaker.Session()
role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
image_uri = 'your_ecr_image_uri' # This should be your image

debugger_hook_config = DebuggerHookConfig(
        s3_output_path='s3://your-bucket/debug-output',
        collection_configurations=[
            'weights',
            'gradients'
        ]
    )

estimator = Estimator(
    image_uri=image_uri,
    role=role,
    instance_count=1,
    instance_type='ml.m5.xlarge',
    debugger_hook_config=debugger_hook_config,
    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session
)

estimator.fit({'training': 's3://your-bucket/training-data'})
```

At first glance, everything seems fine. The `DebuggerHookConfig` is initialized correctly, or so I thought. The problem was that the `collection_configurations` were not defined with sufficient detail or correct collection names. SageMaker's debugger requires specific names for the tensors or operations you wish to collect. In many frameworks, this requires a more verbose configuration that specifies precisely which tensors to target.

The key fix was to be more explicit about what I wanted to monitor. I discovered that merely specifying 'weights' and 'gradients' wasn't enough without the appropriate framework details for the tensors. Using the correct naming convention from the deep learning framework being used (in that case, PyTorch), the code was updated to include specific tensor names:

```python
from sagemaker.debugger import DebuggerHookConfig
from sagemaker.estimator import Estimator
import sagemaker

sagemaker_session = sagemaker.Session()
role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
image_uri = 'your_ecr_image_uri'

debugger_hook_config = DebuggerHookConfig(
        s3_output_path='s3://your-bucket/debug-output',
        collection_configurations=[
            {
                "collection_name": "layer_weights",
                "parameters": {
                    "include_regexes": [
                        r"conv.weight", r"dense.weight" # specific to the layer names in the network
                    ]
                }
            },
            {
                "collection_name": "layer_gradients",
                "parameters": {
                   "include_regexes": [
                        r"conv.weight.grad", r"dense.weight.grad" # specific to the gradients of those layers
                    ]
                }

             }
        ]
    )

estimator = Estimator(
    image_uri=image_uri,
    role=role,
    instance_count=1,
    instance_type='ml.m5.xlarge',
    debugger_hook_config=debugger_hook_config,
    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session
)

estimator.fit({'training': 's3://your-bucket/training-data'})
```

This granular control allowed the debugger to capture what I needed. The `include_regexes` are very powerful and allows you to filter the debugging output from the training process. Always check the specific documentation for your deep learning framework to ensure these match your tensor names correctly.

Another scenario, and one I see quite frequently, involves incorrect permissions or issues related to network configurations, especially when your data is stored in a different AWS account or a secure private S3 bucket. If the IAM role used by the SageMaker training job doesn't have the necessary permissions to write to the specified S3 path or the notebook instance doesn't have the correct permissions to read, you simply won't get your data. Similarly, if the training job runs within a VPC and the S3 bucket isn't accessible through the VPC endpoint, the debugging output won’t materialize in S3. To illustrate this, consider an example using a training script that *should* be working, but fails silently due to incorrect IAM permissions.

Imagine a second instance, different from the first example. This time, the debugging config is technically correct, but it still doesn’t work:

```python
from sagemaker.debugger import DebuggerHookConfig
from sagemaker.estimator import Estimator
import sagemaker

sagemaker_session = sagemaker.Session()
role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
image_uri = 'your_ecr_image_uri'

debugger_hook_config = DebuggerHookConfig(
        s3_output_path='s3://different-account-bucket/debug-output',
         collection_configurations=[
            {
                "collection_name": "layer_weights",
                "parameters": {
                    "include_regexes": [
                        r"conv.weight", r"dense.weight"
                    ]
                }
            },
             {
                "collection_name": "layer_gradients",
                "parameters": {
                   "include_regexes": [
                        r"conv.weight.grad", r"dense.weight.grad"
                    ]
                }

             }
        ]
    )

estimator = Estimator(
    image_uri=image_uri,
    role=role,
    instance_count=1,
    instance_type='ml.m5.xlarge',
    debugger_hook_config=debugger_hook_config,
    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session
)

estimator.fit({'training': 's3://your-bucket/training-data'})
```

Here the problem is not the debug configuration, but the `role` specified for the `estimator` does not have the correct permissions to write to 's3://different-account-bucket/debug-output'. When debugging issues like this, always make sure that the training job's IAM role has write access to your debugging S3 bucket, and that any reading analysis instance also has read access to the debugging location. If there's a VPC, make sure the correct S3 endpoints are in place. The error messages here can be non-obvious which makes this a common scenario. I generally use the aws CLI to check if I have permissions to write to the bucket `aws s3 ls s3://different-account-bucket/debug-output` or a simple python script via boto3 before launching the estimator.

Finally, a less frequent but still noteworthy issue comes with custom training scripts not correctly integrating with the SageMaker debugger. In these cases, you’ll likely find an issue with how the debugging hooks are explicitly implemented, or the framework needs specific configurations. This often comes up in scenarios where frameworks other than TensorFlow or PyTorch are being used, or when your training script needs specific changes to make the data visible to the debug hook. The `SMDebug` python package needs to be installed and configured to monitor your metrics, and any custom training loop will need to call these hooks.

To illustrate this, imagine a hypothetical training loop for a framework that is not natively supported by SageMaker and the `SMDebug` hooks:

```python
import smdebug.pytorch as smd
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class CustomModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

def train(model, data, criterion, optimizer, hooks):
    for epoch in range(10):
        for input, target in data:
           output = model(input)
           loss = criterion(output, target)
           optimizer.zero_grad()
           loss.backward()
           optimizer.step()
           for hook in hooks:
                if hook.has_hook:
                    hook.mark_step()
    return None


if __name__ == "__main__":
   model = CustomModel()
   data = [(torch.rand(10), torch.randint(0, 2, (1,)).float()) for _ in range(100)]
   criterion = nn.MSELoss()
   optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
   hooks = [smd.Hook.create_from_json_file()] if smd.is_smdebug_enabled else []
   train(model, data, criterion, optimizer, hooks)
```

The `create_from_json_file` looks for a standard sagemaker config for debugging hooks. This can sometimes be tricky to set up, and if done incorrectly, then the custom training loop doesn’t properly write debugging data. The `mark_step()` command is very important to ensure data is written out at the right interval. Debugging these scenarios require checking the logs of your training job very carefully to see if the `SMDebug` hook has been loaded and the data is being captured.

In summary, when you encounter this 'no debug data' issue, start with the configuration: scrutinize the `DebuggerHookConfig` and the tensor names you are requesting. Double-check IAM permissions and VPC configurations. Ensure your training script (especially custom ones) is correctly integrated with the `smdebug` package.

For deep dives into these topics, I would highly recommend the official AWS SageMaker documentation, particularly the sections on debugging and profiling. Papers such as “Debugging Neural Networks with Visualization” by Karpathy offer great insights into debugging deep neural networks in general, while reading through the source code of the `smdebug` package on GitHub can be incredibly helpful for custom scenarios. Also, the book "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville provides a solid foundation on the underlying mathematics and concepts. Approaching the problem methodically with a combination of debugging logs and the right references will resolve these issues faster than you might think.
