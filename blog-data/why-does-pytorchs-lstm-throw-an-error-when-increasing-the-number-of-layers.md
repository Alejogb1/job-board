,  I've seen this particular head-scratcher pop up in projects more often than I'd like, particularly back when I was deeply involved in a large-scale natural language processing project involving complex sequence-to-sequence models. We were transitioning from single-layer LSTMs to deeper architectures to better capture long-range dependencies, and that's when we started banging our heads against the wall with these layer-related errors. It's usually not about just *any* increase in layers, but rather, specific mismatches in the shapes of your input or the hidden state, and this is often exacerbated when you're dealing with different batch sizes during the training versus the testing/evaluation phase.

The core issue often stems from a misunderstanding of how the hidden state is propagated between LSTM layers. When you instantiate a multi-layer LSTM in PyTorch, it internally stacks multiple LSTM cells. Each cell in a given layer processes the output from the previous layer, or, for the first layer, the raw input sequence. Critically, each layer maintains its *own* hidden state. The hidden state `(h_n, c_n)` returned by `torch.nn.LSTM` corresponds only to the *last layer* of your stacked LSTM. This is where people sometimes get tripped up.

The shape of the hidden state at each layer needs to match the expected input shape for the subsequent layer. For a single layer LSTM, the shape of the hidden state `(h_n, c_n)` will be `(num_directions * num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)` as described in the PyTorch documentation. When you increase the layers, you might expect that each layer's initial hidden state is automatically handled; however, the `initial hidden state` is expected to have the same dimensions as `h_n`, specifically, that `num_layers` dimension is important. If you are using a single hidden state that is not properly shaped it will lead to shape mismatch errors, or if you attempt to modify dimensions manually you are likely going to create errors.

Let's dive into the common scenarios and then look at some illustrative examples. The root cause often boils down to two main suspects:

1. **Initial Hidden State Mismatch:** The initial hidden state passed to the LSTM should have the dimensions that match the number of layers. Specifically, its shape needs to be `(num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)` where `num_directions` is typically 1 for a unidirectional LSTM and 2 for a bidirectional one. If you’re supplying a hidden state that’s only appropriate for one layer (e.g., when you initialize with `torch.zeros(1, batch_size, hidden_size)`) and then increase the `num_layers` parameter without adjusting your initial hidden state, you’ll trigger an error.

2. **Incorrect State Propagation/Handling:** After each training step, we need to propagate the hidden state to the next training step, especially if you have sequences which are longer than the batch size. We should be careful to only feed the last state to the next step. It's easy to make errors by unintentionally passing states that were only meant for the lower layers or not using the correctly shaped state.

To make it clearer, let's examine some code examples. First, a simple error-prone implementation:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Example 1: Error due to incorrect initial hidden state

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_layers = 2
batch_size = 3
seq_length = 5

# Simulate input data
input_seq = torch.randn(seq_length, batch_size, input_size)

# Incorrect initial hidden state (only for one layer)
h0 = torch.zeros(1, batch_size, hidden_size)
c0 = torch.zeros(1, batch_size, hidden_size)

# Instantiate LSTM
lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers)

# Attempting to pass in the incorrect hidden state will cause an error.
# Uncomment to test
# try:
#    output, (h_n, c_n) = lstm(input_seq, (h0, c0))
# except Exception as e:
#    print(f"Error in Example 1: {e}")

print("Example 1 skipped. Showing only error code.")
```

In Example 1, I've intentionally commented out the part that would cause an error. Notice how the shape of the initial hidden state `h0` and `c0` does not account for the `num_layers` parameter. Now let’s fix this and demonstrate the correct instantiation.

```python
# Example 2: Correct initial hidden state

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_layers = 2
batch_size = 3
seq_length = 5

# Simulate input data
input_seq = torch.randn(seq_length, batch_size, input_size)

# Correct initial hidden state
h0 = torch.zeros(num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)
c0 = torch.zeros(num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)

# Instantiate LSTM
lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers)

output, (h_n, c_n) = lstm(input_seq, (h0, c0))
print(f"Example 2: Output shape: {output.shape}, h_n shape: {h_n.shape}, c_n shape: {c_n.shape}")
```

In Example 2, you can observe that we correctly initialize the hidden and cell states with shapes `(num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)`. This allows for seamless processing with the LSTM. Crucially, the output and `h_n`, `c_n` shapes now have the required number of layers represented.

Finally, let's consider a slightly more involved case, where we’re handling sequences that require sequential calls to the LSTM. Notice that only the last hidden state from the previous call is used to initialize the next.

```python
# Example 3: Sequence handling with hidden state propagation

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_layers = 2
batch_size = 3
seq_length = 5

lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers)

# Correct initial hidden state initialization for first sequence
h_t = torch.zeros(num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)
c_t = torch.zeros(num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)


for i in range(2): #Process 2 input sequences
    # Simulate input data, different input for each iteration
    input_seq = torch.randn(seq_length, batch_size, input_size)

    output, (h_t, c_t) = lstm(input_seq, (h_t, c_t))
    print(f"Example 3: Output shape: {output.shape}, h_t shape: {h_t.shape}, c_t shape: {c_t.shape} after {i+1} iteration(s)")


```

Example 3 showcases how to properly propagate the last hidden and cell states (`h_t`, `c_t`) to successive LSTM steps in a training procedure where sequences are passed sequentially. This is the correct way to handle recurrent calculations where we need to keep track of the last states.

If you want to deepen your understanding, I strongly suggest going through the relevant sections of the official PyTorch documentation on `torch.nn.LSTM`. Specifically, scrutinize the dimensions of inputs, outputs, and hidden states. A good textbook reference would be "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, especially the section on recurrent neural networks. They detail the mechanics of LSTMs and how these states function and are propagated in detail. Furthermore, if you’re interested in how the hidden state operates from a mathematical perspective I'd recommend "Understanding LSTM Networks" by Christopher Olah.

In closing, remember that the error you're likely seeing is not just because you added more layers, but rather due to a mismatch of the dimensions of your initial hidden state or due to improper state handling. Make sure your initial hidden states are correctly shaped and, in a sequence setting, are being appropriately propagated. By paying close attention to these nuances you should be able to utilize multi-layer LSTMs effectively.
