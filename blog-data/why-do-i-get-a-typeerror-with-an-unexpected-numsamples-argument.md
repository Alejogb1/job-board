Alright, let’s tackle this `TypeError` regarding an unexpected `num_samples` argument. I've bumped into similar issues countless times, often in the thick of model training or data manipulation pipelines, and it's almost always a case of a misunderstanding about method signatures or how objects are designed to be used. Let me walk you through the common culprits and how to diagnose them.

The core problem, as implied by the error itself, is that you’re passing a `num_samples` argument to a method or function that doesn't expect it. This usually stems from one of these three scenarios: you’re either dealing with an object that wasn’t designed to use sampling in the way you’re trying; you’re calling a method on the wrong object; or, perhaps, you’ve confused a function with a different one having a slightly different API. My experience, especially with machine learning libraries, tends to lean towards the first and third cases.

Let’s start with scenario one: the object itself doesn't support sampling with `num_samples`. Imagine a case early in my career while working on audio processing. I was trying to extract a fixed number of spectrograms from variable-length audio files, using a library I was less familiar with. I had incorrectly assumed that calling a method, let’s call it `get_spectrograms`, with `num_samples` would do the trick.

Here’s a simplified version of what was happening, almost identical to the actual issue:

```python
import numpy as np

class AudioProcessor:
    def __init__(self, sampling_rate):
        self.sampling_rate = sampling_rate

    def get_spectrograms(self, audio_data):
        # In reality, this would do much more, but for simplicity
        # it just returns the length of the data
        return len(audio_data)  # Not actually doing spectrogram computation

audio_data = np.random.rand(10000) # Simulate some audio data
processor = AudioProcessor(44100)

# Incorrect attempt to sample:
try:
    spectrograms = processor.get_spectrograms(audio_data, num_samples=10)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"TypeError: {e}")
```

This code generates a `TypeError: get_spectrograms() got an unexpected keyword argument 'num_samples'`. This is because, in the class definition, the method `get_spectrograms` only accepted `audio_data` as a positional parameter and did not expect `num_samples`, confirming the diagnosis. The resolution in such cases is straightforward: check the documentation carefully for expected arguments, or adjust your workflow if sampling is not a baked-in feature of this particular object. For audio processing specifically, if a fixed number of samples is needed, you'd first manipulate your raw audio data to have the desired number of sample points *before* feeding it to a function like `get_spectrograms`. Sometimes, sampling is not a feature of the object itself, but a distinct preprocessing step.

Next, let’s look at scenario two: calling a method on the wrong object. This tends to happen when you're working with a complex library that has several classes with similar interfaces. Consider this example where I mistakenly attempted to call a sampling function on an instance of a vector instead of an object related to data batching.

```python
import numpy as np

class DataBatcher:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def sample_batch(self, num_samples):
        indices = np.random.choice(len(self.data), size=num_samples, replace=False)
        return self.data[indices]

vector_data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
batcher = DataBatcher(vector_data)

# Incorrect attempt to sample:
try:
    sampled_vector = vector_data.sample_batch(num_samples=5)
except AttributeError as e:
     print(f"AttributeError: {e}") # Note the error here will be different
```

In this case, we get an `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'sample_batch'`. Even though the intention was correct to sample the vector, the sampling method lives under the `DataBatcher` object, *not* under the numpy `ndarray` itself. This illustrates a common oversight: applying methods that belong to a different class or context. The correct way to perform sampling in this instance would be `batcher.sample_batch(num_samples=5)`. This error isn't a direct `TypeError` about an unexpected argument, but the underlying reasoning is identical—you are calling a function where it was not intended. It’s an incorrect expectation about object methods and their availability. The practical advice here is to verify that the object *you are acting on* has the method or function you expect it to have, especially if you are using multiple objects with similar names. Careful review of the library documentation is always helpful.

Finally, there's the case where you may have confused similar functions within a package. I remember spending hours scratching my head trying to understand why a sampling method I was using wasn’t working the way I had thought it would. I later discovered that I was using a method from an older version of a library, and the new one had a totally different API.

Let’s try to mimic this error, this time more clearly related to the question:

```python
import numpy as np

def old_sampling_function(data):
  # older version of sampling library doesn't take num_samples
  # it just takes full dataset
  return data[np.random.choice(len(data), size=5, replace=False)]


def new_sampling_function(data, num_samples):
  # newer version takes num_samples
  return data[np.random.choice(len(data), size=num_samples, replace=False)]


data = np.arange(20)

# Incorrect attempt to call the old function with the new function's parameters:
try:
    sampled_data = old_sampling_function(data, num_samples=10)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"TypeError: {e}")

# Correct approach
sampled_data = new_sampling_function(data, num_samples=10)
print(sampled_data)
```
Here, the `old_sampling_function` didn’t accept `num_samples` as a parameter, therefore invoking it as if it *did* leads to a `TypeError`. It's similar to our first example, but highlights that even within a library or an application, different versions can implement the same concept with wildly different interfaces, which can be a silent killer. The fix is not just verifying documentation of the library, but also verifying the specific version you have installed and are using, as well as cross-checking with any migration guides the author may have provided.

In terms of reference material for further investigation, I always suggest starting with the official documentation for the library causing the issue. Beyond that, when working with numerical libraries, “Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing” by Press et al. is an invaluable reference. For a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts, "Probability and Statistics for Computer Science" by David Forsyth is a useful resource that covers sampling methodologies. When exploring advanced techniques and specifically the issues described within machine learning, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron is a gold standard.

To summarize, if you get a `TypeError` related to `num_samples` being unexpected, re-examine the object you are working with, the method you're calling, and the library version you’re using. The root cause is always a misalignment between what your code assumes the API to be, and what it actually is. Debugging such errors involves methodical verification, referring back to documentation, and a good understanding of the object-oriented nature of most modern codebases.
