Let's tackle this. I’ve certainly been down that rabbit hole with LXC container journal mount errors more times than I care to recall. It’s a frustrating issue, usually rearing its head when you’re expecting smooth sailing and the logs are crucial for debugging. Let me walk you through my typical approach, distilled from a few particularly memorable evenings.

The error itself, at its core, stems from the container’s inability to properly mount the host's journal directory. This prevents the container from logging information to the host’s journald system, which is used by many services, making tracking errors and general system activity within that container practically impossible. The first step always involves understanding *why* this is occurring; it's rarely a one-size-fits-all fix. Often, it comes down to discrepancies in how the container and the host are configured to handle systemd, or permission issues surrounding the journal directory.

A prime culprit I’ve observed is that the container is configured to run its own instance of systemd (often as PID 1), and it’s expecting to communicate directly with the host's journald, which might not be accessible due to namespace isolation or conflicting settings. This can happen after an unexpected power cycle, a less-than-graceful container upgrade, or even because of a subtly tweaked configuration file that slipped past code review. On another occasion I had a situation where the host system had upgraded systemd, but the LXC template used for my containers had not, leading to version mismatch complications.

Here’s the breakdown, with a few snippets of code, which I’ve sanitized from actual configurations that caused me some grief:

**1. Check Container Configuration:**

The initial point of investigation is always the LXC configuration file. Usually found in `/var/lib/lxc/<container_name>/config`. Specifically, you're looking for any lines pertaining to `lxc.mount.*` or `lxc.apparmor.*`. Improper mounting definitions or restrictive apparmor profiles can cause these journal mount errors.

Here’s an example of a problematic configuration that *didn’t* work in one of my old projects (sanitized, of course):

```
# Problematic config snippet
lxc.mount.entry = /run/log/journal run/log/journal none bind,rw,create=dir 0 0
lxc.mount.entry = /var/log/journal var/log/journal none bind,rw,create=dir 0 0
lxc.apparmor.profile = lxc-container-default
```

The issue here is that while it appears to mount the journal directory, it doesn't necessarily map the host's journald path to what the container expects. It's trying to create new directories *inside* the container, which aren't connected to the host's logging system. Additionally the default apparmor profile may prevent this particular bind mount from functioning properly, resulting in access denied errors.

**2. Implement Correct Mount:**

The most reliable method I’ve found involves directly mounting the host's journal directory using the correct path and ensuring the apparmor profile allows it. This involves precise binding of the host's journal path. Here's a corrected snippet that *does* work, ensuring the container access the host journal:

```
# Corrected config snippet
lxc.mount.entry = /run/systemd/journal/socket run/systemd/journal/socket none bind,rw 0 0
lxc.apparmor.profile = unconfined

```

Note that the mount point is changed to `/run/systemd/journal/socket`, which is where `journald` usually exposes its socket for communication. This is the crucial difference; it's not enough to simply map the directories; you have to use the *socket* to link correctly to the systemd journal daemon on the host. Also, for testing purposes, switching to an unconfined apparmor profile can be helpful; however, for a production environment, it’s better to configure a specific profile that includes the necessary permissions, rather than completely disabling it.

**3. Systemd Within the Container:**

A subtle point often missed is how the container handles systemd. If your container has its own init system that *isn’t* systemd, that's a different, more complex issue. However, if you’re running a systemd instance within the container, you need to ensure the `journald.conf` settings match what you expect. This is usually found in `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`.  Here's an example of a basic configuration, however your configuration needs may differ based on your needs, and some additional changes may be required based on the host operating system.

```
# journald.conf within the container.

[Journal]
Storage=auto
SystemMaxUse=50M
RuntimeMaxUse=50M
```
While this config won't directly solve your mount issue, ensuring systemd within your container is configured properly can alleviate further unexpected behavior. Typically, for most containers, default settings for journald work fine once the mount problem is resolved. However, for specific log management strategies, you may wish to tailor this file to suit your needs. Remember that the *host's* `journald.conf` also has significant influence on where logs are written, and how they are rotated. Therefore, inconsistencies between host and container configurations could impact troubleshooting this problem.

**Troubleshooting Steps and Further Considerations**

After implementing these fixes, rebooting the container is usually necessary for the changes to take effect and for systemd to pick up the new mount. You can also try restarting the systemd-journald service within the container for good measure (although sometimes this won’t work until the container is rebooted).

If you still face issues, always confirm that the directory you're trying to mount exists on the host. Double-check the path. Additionally, review the journal logs on the *host* for any errors related to journald. You can use `journalctl -xe` on the host system to identify if the host is reporting any issues related to container journal access. The `-e` option displays the journal messages starting with the most recent, and provides more detailed explanations. If it reports apparmor denials, you will need to investigate your apparmor profiles further.

Furthermore, ensure the `lxc-tools` package on the host machine is up to date. Sometimes older versions may contain bugs or not function as expected with the latest versions of systemd.

For a deeper dive into these topics, I highly recommend:

1.  **"Understanding the Linux Kernel" by Daniel P. Bovet and Marco Cesati**: This provides a thorough foundation for understanding the underlying kernel mechanisms, including namespaces and mount points, which is crucial for debugging LXC container issues.
2.  **"Systemd by Example" by Christine Hall**: This book provides real-world scenarios and configuration examples for systemd which helps in resolving issues like incorrect configuration and helps understand how systemd interacts with logging.

3. **The *systemd* man pages**: While perhaps not the most approachable, the `systemd-journald.service` and `journalctl` man pages are definitive resources for learning how `journald` works and how to query and troubleshoot it. They often contain details that aren't found elsewhere.

These resources, combined with hands-on experimentation, helped me navigate these LXC journal mounting challenges. My advice: meticulously check configurations, pay attention to the mount points, and never underestimate the power of the host's logs for troubleshooting. It's an annoying error, yes, but with a systematic approach, it's almost always resolvable.
