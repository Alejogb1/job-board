Alright, let’s tackle this. I’ve seen this exact scenario play out more times than I care to remember, and it's usually a combination of a few common culprits rather than one glaring error. You've got your Rails 6 application running smoothly on your local machine with OmniAuth humming along, but the moment you push to Heroku, it all falls apart. It's frustrating, I get it. Let me walk you through the most probable reasons, focusing on practical debugging and solutions that I've applied in similar situations.

First and foremost, the core issue often boils down to configuration differences between your local development environment and the Heroku production environment. These aren't always immediately obvious. On your local setup, you're likely using the `development` environment configuration. On Heroku, it defaults to the `production` environment, and that's where subtle discrepancies arise. Specifically, differences in environment variables and callback URLs are the most frequent culprits.

Let’s start with environment variables. Locally, you might be relying on a `.env` file or some other method of setting your OmniAuth provider’s credentials (client id, client secret). Heroku, on the other hand, requires you to set these variables directly in its configuration settings (via `heroku config:set`). If those variables are missing or misconfigured on Heroku, the authentication will fail. This isn't because OmniAuth is inherently broken on Heroku but because it's receiving incomplete or incorrect data.

To verify this, hop into your Heroku dashboard or use the Heroku CLI. Specifically, use the command `heroku config` to inspect your set environment variables. Ensure that the variables you're using in your local `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` are present and correctly defined on Heroku. A common mistake is a misplaced character or a misspelled variable name. This seemingly tiny error will result in a failed authentication attempt. Let me illustrate with a brief example.

```ruby
# config/initializers/omniauth.rb (local, likely correct for local testing)

Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :google_oauth2, ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'],
    {
        :scope => 'email, profile',
        :prompt => 'select_account'
    }
end
```

Now, imagine the Heroku config is missing `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` or contains it with a typo, that’s your issue. Double check this configuration. If you have the sensitive keys committed to your version control, that is another potential security flaw. Be sure to use Heroku's secure configuration functionality.

The second major area of concern is your callback URL. In OmniAuth, the provider needs to redirect users back to your application after successful authentication. Locally, this is typically `http://localhost:3000/auth/provider_name/callback`, or something of that nature. However, on Heroku, your application is running on a Heroku-provided domain (e.g., `your-app.herokuapp.com`), and that's where the mismatch happens. This is especially relevant with providers like Google, which strictly enforce callback URL validation. You need to explicitly register your Heroku application's full URL (including the protocol, typically https) with the authentication provider as an authorized callback URL. If this is incorrect, the provider will redirect to an unauthorized URL, which leads to an authentication failure.

Here is an example of a simple but often overlooked issue: you are using http locally, but https is mandatory on Heroku for a service such as Google:

```ruby
# config/initializers/omniauth.rb (local, may need adjustment)

OmniAuth.config.full_host = "http://localhost:3000" # Inaccurate for production


# corrected config, this should be set dynamically based on environment.
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :google_oauth2, ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'],
    {
        :scope => 'email, profile',
        :prompt => 'select_account',
        :callback_path => '/auth/google_oauth2/callback'
    }
end
# The OmniAuth.config.full_host should be set in production like so (in an initializer or environment config file)
if Rails.env.production?
  OmniAuth.config.full_host = "https://your-app.herokuapp.com" # This must match the callback URL configured on the provider
end
```

Notice here that the value of `OmniAuth.config.full_host` is hardcoded for development. This will cause an issue when your callback URL is something such as `https://your-app.herokuapp.com/auth/google_oauth2/callback`. The provider would be redirecting to a different address than what was authorized. It is best to have this configuration variable depend on the current Rails environment.

Here’s another related case I often encounter: In some cases, especially with providers like Facebook, your callback URL might need an exact match. If your Heroku app redirects via a custom domain, you'll need to use that custom domain in the callback URL configuration. I’ve seen issues where users deploy with default Heroku subdomain and then bind a custom domain later and forget to update the OmniAuth settings.

Furthermore, it's worthwhile to inspect your Heroku logs (using `heroku logs --tail`) for any errors during the authentication process. These errors often provide specific clues regarding configuration or authentication issues. You'll see messages related to the OmniAuth provider (like Google, Facebook, GitHub), error codes, or hints about missing parameters. This is often more useful than just guessing. Here’s an example of how to properly generate a callback URL, often overlooked with dynamic deployments:

```ruby
# application_controller.rb

def omniauth_callback_url(provider)
  "#{request.protocol}#{request.host_with_port}/auth/#{provider}/callback"
end


# Within a controller action, for a redirect
def redirect_to_provider(provider)
  redirect_to "/auth/#{provider}"
end

# A better implementation using a helper method
def generate_callback_url(provider)
  uri = URI::HTTP.build(host: request.host, scheme: request.protocol[0..-4], path: "/auth/#{provider}/callback").to_s
end

# Then, during configuration of OmniAuth

  provider :google_oauth2, ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'],
    {
        :scope => 'email, profile',
        :prompt => 'select_account',
        :callback_url => generate_callback_url(:google_oauth2) # Dynamically generated URL
    }
```

The `generate_callback_url` function here is a more correct approach for handling your callback URLs, especially in environments that can be either http or https. Avoid hardcoding hostnames and protocols unless absolutely necessary.

Finally, a note about gem versions. While unlikely, a version mismatch between your development and production environments could cause unexpected behavior. Run `bundle list` both locally and on Heroku (`heroku run bundle list`) to ensure consistency in gem versions. While this is not usually the issue when the problem only appears on Heroku, it does add a layer of assurance.

To enhance your understanding of the concepts outlined, I'd recommend delving into a few resources. Specifically, the official OmniAuth documentation is a must-read for mastering the intricacies of authentication workflows. Additionally, "Ruby on Rails Tutorial" by Michael Hartl has an excellent chapter on deployment strategies and configuration that might shed light on how environment variables are handled in various contexts. Furthermore, “The Well-Grounded Rubyist” by David A. Black will provide you with a robust understanding of Ruby mechanics, which could be useful when debugging obscure issues. Lastly, the documentation of the specific authentication providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.) is crucial for understanding their callback URL requirements and other specifics.

In short, this is less about OmniAuth being broken and more about configuration and environment discrepancies. Verify environment variables, check callback URLs, inspect your logs, ensure gem version consistency, and consult authoritative resources, and you’ll likely resolve this issue without much further frustration. I’ve been through this process so often, it's nearly second nature now. You've got this.
