Alright, let's unpack this one. It's a scenario I've encountered more times than I care to remember, particularly during the early days of a rather ambitious project that involved complex data pipelines and asynchronous operations in Vue.js. You'd think, logically, that once a component is unmounted—destroyed, if you will—its code would simply cease execution. However, the asynchronous nature of javascript, combined with Vue's lifecycle management, can lead to situations where code associated with a destroyed component continues to run. The 'why' behind this phenomenon is nuanced but boils down to a few key factors.

Firstly, and perhaps most commonly, we're dealing with pending asynchronous operations. Let's say, for example, a component makes an api call in its `mounted` hook to fetch some data. If the component is unmounted *before* that api call resolves (or rejects), the callback function associated with that promise *will still execute*. This execution isn't directly tied to the component lifecycle; it's bound to the promise object itself. Vue dispatches events during its lifecycle, but once it hits `beforeDestroy` or `destroyed`, it no longer manages the internal timers and callbacks created by javascript primitives or browser apis.

Secondly, consider event listeners. If you’ve attached event listeners directly to the *window* or the *document* within the component, these listeners will often persist even after the component is destroyed. Vue's reactivity system isn't directly involved here, so it doesn't automatically handle the cleanup. These events are registered on the browser object, and thus will continue to trigger the attached callback functions, even if that callback refers to methods or data inside a component that no longer exists.

Thirdly, there are cases related to shared state and closure. If a component sets up a timer or another process that closes over variables in the component's scope, the callback for that process retains access to that closed-over scope. Even if the component is destroyed, the timer’s callback can still modify those variables because the closure still points to the same memory location where those variables were initially defined.

Let’s look at some examples. In the first case, we'll focus on the asynchronous operation:

```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    Component Example
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  mounted() {
    console.log("Component mounted!");
    this.fetchData();
  },
  beforeDestroy() {
    console.log("Component about to be destroyed!");
  },
  destroyed() {
    console.log("Component destroyed!");
  },
  methods: {
    async fetchData() {
      try {
        console.log("Starting fetch operation...");
        const response = await new Promise(resolve => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Data fetched after 2 seconds!");
          }, 2000);
        });
        console.log(response); // This might still execute after destroy
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
      }
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

In this snippet, if the component is unmounted before the 2-second timeout completes, the `console.log(response)` within the `fetchData` method will still execute, printing to the console after the 'Component destroyed!' message. This highlights the asynchronous operation continuing after component destruction.

Now, for an example concerning event listeners:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    Component with Event Listener
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
    data() {
      return {
        clicks: 0
      }
    },
  mounted() {
    window.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick);
  },
  beforeDestroy() {
    console.log("Removing click listener")
    window.removeEventListener('click', this.handleClick);
  },
   destroyed() {
    console.log("Component destroyed!");
  },
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      this.clicks++;
      console.log('Clicked! Clicks: ' + this.clicks);
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

Notice that within `beforeDestroy`, we explicitly remove the event listener. If we hadn't implemented that cleanup, the `handleClick` would still fire on subsequent window clicks after the component was destroyed, despite `this.clicks` referring to a data property that no longer exists. This would lead to errors or unexpected behavior, depending on what `handleClick` was intended to do. Without the `window.removeEventListener('click', this.handleClick);` line, the console would be flooded with click events after the component is gone.

Finally, the example concerning closures:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
     Closure example
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
        myValue: 0
    };
  },
  mounted() {
     console.log("Component mounted, myValue is", this.myValue);
     this.startTimer();
  },
  beforeDestroy() {
    console.log("Component about to be destroyed");
    clearInterval(this.timer); // Clear the timer
  },
   destroyed() {
    console.log("Component destroyed!");
  },
  methods: {
    startTimer() {
      this.timer = setInterval(() => {
        this.myValue++;
        console.log('Timer Tick! myValue:', this.myValue);
      }, 1000);
    }
  }
};
</script>

```

Here, the `setInterval` callback closes over `this.myValue`. Even after component destruction, if the timer is not explicitly cleared with `clearInterval` in `beforeDestroy`, the callback would continue to increment and log `myValue`. The closure keeps the context alive for that callback to update `this.myValue`. Thus, you'd see the console logs even though the component is no longer on screen. The `clearInterval(this.timer)` call in `beforeDestroy` prevents this leak.

The key takeaway is the importance of meticulous cleanup in Vue components. Failing to address asynchronous operations, remove event listeners, or handle closures can lead to what appears to be zombie code— logic associated with components that no longer exist still chugging along.

To deeply understand Javascript's event loops and asynchronous behaviour, I'd recommend reading *You Don’t Know JS: Async & Performance* by Kyle Simpson. For an authoritative text on Javascript core concepts, including closures and scope, *JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* by David Flanagan is an excellent resource. For Vue specifics, the official Vue documentation is of course very helpful, but for a more in-depth understanding of the rendering lifecycle and the intricacies of cleanup, look for articles that discuss Vue's implementation details, or the source code itself.
Understanding this behaviour isn't just about avoiding bugs; it's about building maintainable and performant applications. We need to be aware of how asynchronous operations interact with a component’s lifecycle, and be diligent in our code to make sure we are properly cleaning up after ourselves. It's a lesson I've learned the hard way a few times, and it's a crucial aspect of mastering reactive frameworks like Vue.
