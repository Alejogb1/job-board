Okay, let's unpack this. I've seen this particular scenario come up more than a few times, often with developers new to the reactive paradigm or those trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of their Vue applications. The short answer is: generally, no, it's not a good idea to directly trigger async functions inside a Vue computed property, and I’ll explain why with some specific examples. It's a pattern that tends to lead to complications that might not be immediately obvious.

The core issue revolves around the intended purpose of computed properties. Computed properties in Vue are designed to be *synchronous* functions that return a derived value based on reactive data. They're intended to be pure functions – meaning that given the same inputs, they should always produce the same output, and they should have no side effects. Async operations, by their very nature, introduce side effects and temporal dependencies. They are not synchronous, and they don’t immediately return a value.

Let’s consider a situation where I was tasked with building a user profile page some time ago. The profile had a list of user-created content, and that content count needed to be updated in real-time as the user interacted with the page. A junior colleague, in an attempt to simplify things, proposed this pattern:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Total Content Items: {{ totalContentCount }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const userId = ref(123);

    const fetchContentCount = async (id) => {
        // Assume this is some API call. For simplicity, we use a mock.
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
        return id * 10;  // Mocking a count based on ID
    };

    const totalContentCount = computed(async () => {
        return await fetchContentCount(userId.value)
    });

    return {
      totalContentCount
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

This looks almost reasonable at first glance, but here's where it falls apart. Vue's computed properties don't handle the promise returned by the async function directly. What this actually returns is a *promise* object, not the resolved value from the promise. That’s why in the template it would most likely display `[object Promise]` instead of the integer we expect. Moreover, it could lead to unpredictable behavior because the computed property's dependencies don't get updated correctly when the promise resolves and thus the value is not correctly reflected on the view.

A better approach involves using reactive variables and a `watch` effect or potentially a method that updates the count when it's needed. Here's how I refactored it:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Total Content Items: {{ totalContentCount }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, watch, onMounted } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const userId = ref(123);
    const totalContentCount = ref(0);

    const fetchContentCount = async (id) => {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
        return id * 10;
    };

      const updateContentCount = async () => {
      totalContentCount.value = await fetchContentCount(userId.value);
    }


    watch(userId, async () => {
          updateContentCount();
    }, { immediate: true });



    return {
        totalContentCount
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

In this refactored snippet, I've moved the asynchronous operation to a separate function and used `watch` to trigger the update function when the `userId` changes or on component initialization, ensuring that we have data ready at the start, by passing `{ immediate: true}` as the third argument of `watch`. The `totalContentCount` is now a ref that can correctly render its value in the view. This approach is cleaner and maintains the reactive data-flow.

A further scenario that I've seen, where triggering an async function in computed *might* seem reasonable but really isn't, is where people try to use it for data caching. Suppose you have a list of items that you fetch from an API and you want to cache it to avoid redundant API calls. You might be tempted to do something like this:

```vue
<template>
  <ul>
    <li v-for="item in cachedItems" :key="item.id">{{ item.name }}</li>
  </ul>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const cachedData = ref(null);

    const fetchItems = async () => {
      // Simulate API call delay
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
      return [{ id: 1, name: 'Item A' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item B' }];
    };

    const cachedItems = computed(async () => {
      if (!cachedData.value) {
          cachedData.value = await fetchItems();
      }
      return cachedData.value;
    });

    return {
      cachedItems
    };
  }
};
</script>
```
Again, this won’t work as intended. Similar to the first example, because computed properties are synchronous, `cachedItems` will return a promise, which is not what we need to display in the UI. Also, the computed value is not going to be cached correctly because the value of `cachedData` is going to be `null` when it's run the first time. In essence, every time the component rerenders, the async function would be called.
A more reliable way to achieve caching with async operations is to fetch the data on component mounting and cache the result on a ref, as I would do here:

```vue
<template>
    <ul>
        <li v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">{{ item.name }}</li>
    </ul>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';

export default {
    setup() {
        const items = ref([]);

        const fetchItems = async () => {
            // Simulate API call delay
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
            return [{ id: 1, name: 'Item A' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item B' }];
        };


        onMounted(async () => {
           items.value =  await fetchItems();
        });

        return {
            items,
        };
    },
};
</script>
```

Here, the data is fetched once when the component mounts, and the result is stored in the `items` ref. This prevents multiple API calls and ensures our data is available for rendering as soon as it is retrieved, avoiding unnecessary re-fetches.

These examples highlight the central problem. Computed properties are meant for synchronous calculations, not asynchronous operations. Directly calling async functions within them leads to unexpected behavior and makes your code harder to debug.

For further reading on this and related topics, I would highly recommend checking out the official Vue.js documentation, which is excellent and constantly updated. Additionally, “Eloquent JavaScript” by Marijn Haverbeke provides an excellent, detailed, and deep dive into the underpinnings of JavaScript and its asynchronous aspects. For a deeper understanding of reactive programming patterns, “Reactive Programming with JavaScript” by Jafar Husain provides a very valuable perspective as well. Understanding the foundational concepts in those resources will equip you to effectively manage asynchronous operations in Vue applications and design for reactivity more effectively.
In summary, while the temptation to use computed properties for async operations might seem like an elegant shortcut, it's a practice best avoided. Stick to using reactive data and `watch` effects or methods for these types of scenarios, and your code will be easier to understand, maintain, and perform as expected.
