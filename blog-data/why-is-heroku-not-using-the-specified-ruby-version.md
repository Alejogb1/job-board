,  I've certainly seen my share of "unexpected ruby versions" on Heroku deployments. It's a common hiccup, and usually stems from a few core issues. We can unpack this systematically. My experience with it actually goes back to a particularly stubborn legacy app we were migrating – quite the headache at the time.

The first thing to understand is how Heroku manages Ruby versions. It relies heavily on your application's `Gemfile` and, crucially, the associated `Gemfile.lock`. This lock file is *the* source of truth for dependency versions, including Ruby itself. Heroku reads the `ruby` declaration specified inside, not just what might be in a `.ruby-version` file or environment variable – though those can certainly affect your local setup. Essentially, if there's no explicit ruby version in your gemfile or lockfile, Heroku defaults to a version its platform currently supports which may not be your desired target, leading to unexpected outcomes.

The most frequent problem I've encountered is an outdated or incorrect `Gemfile.lock`. Let's say, hypothetically, you’ve just upgraded your ruby version locally, edited your `Gemfile` and ran `bundle install`. Now you're pushing to Heroku. If you forget to commit the *updated* `Gemfile.lock`, Heroku will still use the old one, which specifies the old Ruby version. The system sees a mismatch, and defaults to what it's configured to use for that lockfile, which again, isn't necessarily the latest and greatest or what you want. Think of `Gemfile.lock` as a precise recipe; if it's not updated with the right ingredients after you've made changes, you won't get the desired result. It's crucial to make sure both `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` are consistently updated and committed *together* after any dependency modifications.

Here's an example of a problematic scenario:

```ruby
# Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'
ruby '3.2.2' # Let's say you just changed this from 3.0.0

gem 'rails', '~> 7.0'
# Other gems here
```

Now, if your `Gemfile.lock` still has references to ruby 3.0.0, Heroku will, more often than not, try to use it (or a Heroku default, if 3.0.0 is no longer supported), causing issues.

The second common reason involves buildpack behavior. Heroku uses buildpacks to prepare your application for execution. The standard ruby buildpack will read the ruby version from the lockfile, and set up the correct environment before running your application. However, occasionally there might be subtle issues with the buildpack itself or specific buildpack versions. If your Gemfile is missing or your lockfile is not present, or corrupted the default Heroku Ruby version, configured within that buildpack is used. Or, less commonly, sometimes a change in Heroku's platform may cause a conflict if the specified ruby version has been deprecated, and a buildpack upgrade may be needed.

To ensure your gems are compatible and your ruby version is correct, you should check your build logs in the Heroku dashboard, or using the heroku cli (`heroku logs --tail`). This is especially crucial if you're facing build errors, and will usually pinpoint if there is a ruby version mismatch or dependency issue. It's also a good idea, when updating ruby, to perform a full clean build using the buildpack cache clearing command (`heroku buildpacks:clear`) to prevent any residue from impacting your build process. This is especially pertinent if you're upgrading your Ruby version significantly. You can also explicitly state your desired ruby version directly within the `Gemfile`, which will make it explicit, instead of relying on a default.

Here's an example of explicitly setting a ruby version in the `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'
ruby '3.2.2', :patchlevel => '198' # Specifying patch level too can help consistency

gem 'rails', '~> 7.0'
# Other gems here
```

By being more specific, you leave no room for interpretation, leading to more predictable builds.

A third, less prevalent issue, stems from the fact that Heroku uses a combination of buildpacks and container-based deployments, especially with its most modern environments. When working with container deployments or advanced buildpack configurations you might mistakenly rely on a locally installed ruby version not present in the build environment. I've seen this happen with custom docker setups for example, and it requires ensuring your build process accurately reflects the dependency configuration found in the Gemfile and lockfile, and those requirements are mirrored in the docker images, if applicable.

Here's a brief example of what I mean. Imagine a docker configuration, where we might have:

```dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.3.0-slim # This could cause a version conflict

WORKDIR /app
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN bundle install --jobs=4

COPY . .

CMD ["bundle", "exec", "rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
```

In this hypothetical scenario, if the `Gemfile.lock` specifies a ruby version less than `3.3.0`, you will have a conflict. You need to ensure that the ruby version set during build *matches* what's specified in your gemfile and lockfile.

**Recommendations:**

To avoid these problems, keep a meticulous approach:

1.  **Always commit `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` together:** Ensure they are consistently updated before each deploy. This is the bedrock of resolving ruby version mismatches.
2.  **Explicitly specify the ruby version:** Include the `ruby` directive in your `Gemfile`, specifying the patch level if possible. This reduces ambiguity.
3.  **Monitor build logs:** Use `heroku logs --tail` to identify and diagnose version conflicts and other issues promptly.
4.  **Clear buildpack caches:** Use `heroku buildpacks:clear` prior to significant ruby version changes, ensuring a fresh build environment.
5.  **Docker configurations require scrutiny**: Double check dockerfiles and related configuration when you use custom container deployments.

**Further Reading:**

For deeper understanding, I highly recommend consulting these resources:

*   **Bundler Documentation:** The official Bundler documentation is invaluable for learning more about managing Gemfiles and lockfiles. Pay particular attention to the sections dealing with lockfiles.
*   **Heroku Buildpack Documentation:** The Heroku documentation for its buildpacks – specifically the Ruby one – details how it determines the ruby version and how to debug issues.
*   **"Effective Ruby" by Peter J. Jones:** This book has a section that details best practices around dependency management and avoiding environmental inconsistencies, highly relevant to the topic.

In closing, while the "wrong ruby version" issue can seem confounding, it’s usually a case of misaligned configurations. By adhering to best practices regarding `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`, and by carefully monitoring your build process, these challenges become quite manageable. I hope this clarifies things and helps you in your Heroku deployments.
