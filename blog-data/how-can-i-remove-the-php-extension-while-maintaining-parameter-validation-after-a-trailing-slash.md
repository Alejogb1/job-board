Let’s dive into this. I’ve certainly tangled with this scenario a few times over the years, and while it might seem trivial at first glance, maintaining parameter validation while removing file extensions and handling trailing slashes requires a bit of careful configuration, particularly within the context of web server setups. Essentially, we’re aiming for clean, user-friendly urls, think `example.com/products/123` instead of `example.com/products.php?id=123`, while still making sure that `123` is indeed a valid product id before executing any queries.

The core of the solution boils down to leveraging URL rewriting capabilities provided by your web server, often implemented using something like `.htaccess` files for Apache or the equivalent configuration blocks for Nginx, and then adjusting your application code to handle the "clean" urls. The trick is to ensure that the rewriting doesn’t simply hide the php extension but also correctly passes parameters along and doesn’t break any validation mechanisms that you’ve already put in place. We will address this by going through common approaches using Apache and then demonstrate how the validation should be handled in your php application.

First, let’s look at an Apache configuration using `.htaccess`

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /

  # Redirect requests with a trailing slash for folders to remove the slash
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.+)/$
  RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ /$1 [L,R=301]

  # Rewrite requests for existing files to themselves to avoid conflicts
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
  RewriteRule ^ - [L]


  # Rewrite everything else to the .php file, ensuring parameters are passed
  RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/([0-9]+)$ $1.php?id=$2 [L]
  RewriteRule ^([^/]+)$ $1.php [L]

</IfModule>
```

In this snippet, `RewriteEngine On` activates the rewrite engine. `RewriteBase /` specifies the base directory for relative rewrites. We’ve established two core patterns: one to remove trailing slashes for existing directories (`RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d`) to reduce the chance of getting duplicate content from the url with or without a slash, and second, to rewrite the urls without extensions. The crucial part is the `RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/([0-9]+)$ $1.php?id=$2 [L]` rule. This rule states that, if there is a url string with a single word character or a series of word characters, followed by a slash, and a number after, rewrite the url to include the name of the series of characters with the .php extension, and to assign the number as an `id` GET parameter. For example, a request to `/products/123` gets rewritten to `/products.php?id=123`. Note that the `[L]` flag means “last rule”, meaning if this condition is met no more rules need to be checked. This handles both the removal of the extension and the parameter passing.

Next, let’s explore a similar scenario but using a slightly more advanced example where we have not only a simple id but also an optional page number.

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /

  # Redirect requests with a trailing slash for folders to remove the slash
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.+)/$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ /$1 [L,R=301]

  # Rewrite requests for existing files to themselves to avoid conflicts
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
  RewriteRule ^ - [L]


    # Rewrite rule for pageable resources
  RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/([0-9]+)/page/([0-9]+)$ $1.php?id=$2&page=$3 [L]

    #Rewrite rule for regular resource with id
    RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/([0-9]+)$ $1.php?id=$2 [L]
    #Rewrite rule for pages without parameters
    RewriteRule ^([^/]+)$ $1.php [L]


</IfModule>
```

In this example, we’ve added another rule: `RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/([0-9]+)/page/([0-9]+)$ $1.php?id=$2&page=$3 [L]`. This covers cases where a resource can have a page number such as `/products/123/page/2`, and it correctly translates it to `/products.php?id=123&page=2`. The rest of the rules are kept as before, first handling trailing slashes, skipping rewrites if the requested resource is an existing file or directory, and rewriting simple extensions. The order of these rules matters as the more specific rules like the one with pagination should come before more generic ones.

The final, critical piece lies within your php application itself. You must ensure that after rewriting, parameters are validated. Here's a basic example using php, assuming that we're processing a `products` request like in our example:

```php
<?php
// products.php
// function to validate the id
function validate_product_id($id) {
    // In a real app you'd query your database
    // or do other checks to validate the id exists
    // A simple numeric check is a basic example here
    return is_numeric($id) && $id > 0;

}

function validate_page_number($page) {
  return is_numeric($page) && $page > 0;

}
$product_id = $_GET['id'] ?? null;
$page_number = $_GET['page'] ?? null;

if ($product_id) {
    if (validate_product_id($product_id)) {
        // Product ID is valid; Proceed to fetch data or process the request
        if ($page_number){
            if (validate_page_number($page_number)){
                echo "Valid product id: " . htmlspecialchars($product_id) . ", on page number ". htmlspecialchars($page_number);
            }
            else{
              http_response_code(400);
               echo "Error: Invalid Page Number.";
            }

        }else{
              echo "Valid product id: " . htmlspecialchars($product_id);
        }


    } else {
        // Product ID is invalid. Return a 400 or redirect
      http_response_code(400);
      echo "Error: Invalid Product ID.";
    }
} else {
    // No product ID specified. Show a list or a homepage
    echo "Showing product list";
}

?>
```

This code fetches the `id` and `page` parameters from the `$_GET` array. Critically, it uses `validate_product_id()` and `validate_page_number()` functions, which, in a full-scale application, would involve database lookups or other sophisticated checks. This example uses a basic `is_numeric()` check, but you could expand it for more advanced validation as you see fit. If you are expecting a certain set of values you can query a db table and check the value against a column.

Crucially, the `htmlspecialchars` functions ensure output is safe and not susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS). This is a general security practice, and you should use it each time you are displaying an output on your page. This illustrates the basic structure to validate inputs.

For deeper understanding of URL rewriting, I recommend examining the official Apache `mod_rewrite` documentation. For a broader knowledge of web security practices, 'The Tangled Web' by Michal Zalewski offers excellent insight. To familiarize yourself with general web server configurations, consider 'High Performance Web Sites' by Steve Souders. For the php side, “Modern PHP” by Josh Lockhart should provide you with all the information needed to understand best practices for the language.

In summary, the process involves setting up your web server to rewrite urls while correctly passing parameters, and then, importantly, you must implement thorough input validation on the server-side to verify the data. The approach I've shown has proven effective in a variety of projects over the years, and with these resources, you should be well-equipped to address this in your project.
