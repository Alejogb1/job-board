Alright, let’s dive into plotting learning curves with the `neuralnet` package in R. I've been through this particular process quite a few times, and it’s something that often comes up when you’re trying to refine a neural network model. It's less about straightforward plotting functions within `neuralnet` itself and more about extracting and visualizing the training progress, often involving a bit of manual setup. Specifically, `neuralnet` doesn't inherently output a learning curve object like some other libraries might. So, we have to craft our own.

My experience typically stems from scenarios where I'm tuning a model, perhaps for a time-series prediction or a classification problem. I might initially start with a fairly simple network and then observe its performance during training. The visual representation of this learning process, the learning curve, allows for quick insights into underfitting, overfitting, and how different parameters affect model training. We're going to focus on methods that allow you to get this information out of the neural network training process.

To elaborate, a learning curve generally plots the performance of a model – think of metrics such as error or accuracy – against the number of training epochs or the amount of training data it has seen. This allows us to see how training and validation performance evolves over time, assisting in making judgments about the bias-variance tradeoff of the model. The `neuralnet` package in R offers its core functionality, but it doesn't directly give you a plot function for learning curves. Therefore, the strategy boils down to tracking performance manually during the training process and then feeding that information to your preferred plotting library (like `ggplot2` or even R’s base graphics).

Let's break this down into concrete steps, and I will provide code examples to illustrate my points. We’ll go through three distinct scenarios and address the specifics of how to plot the resulting learning curve from the information that we collect.

**Scenario 1: Tracking Error Per Epoch Manually**

In this scenario, we'll manually keep tabs on the error at each epoch during training. This is common and provides essential information. We’ll accomplish this by modifying the `neuralnet` call within a loop.

```R
library(neuralnet)

set.seed(123) # For reproducibility

# Generate some example data
data <- data.frame(x1 = runif(100, 0, 10), x2 = runif(100, 0, 10))
data$y <- 2*data$x1 + 3*data$x2 + rnorm(100, 0, 2)

# Prepare the formula
formula <- y ~ x1 + x2

# Initialize lists to track error at each epoch
epoch_errors <- list()
epochs <- 100 # Set number of training iterations

# Training Loop
for(i in 1:epochs){
  nn <- neuralnet(formula, data=data, hidden = c(5,3), linear.output = TRUE,
                lifesign = 'none', stepmax = 1, startweights = nn$weights)
  epoch_errors[[i]] <- nn$result.matrix[1,1]  # Extract the error (SSE)
}

# Create a data frame for plotting
df <- data.frame(epoch = 1:epochs, error = unlist(epoch_errors))

# Plot with base R
plot(df$epoch, df$error, type = 'l', xlab="Epoch", ylab="Sum of Squared Error", main="Learning Curve")

```

In this example, we are essentially running the `neuralnet` function `epochs` number of times, saving the calculated sum of squared errors (SSE) from each epoch. `lifesign = 'none'` and `stepmax = 1` are important to control the behavior within the loop and not train multiple steps per iteration; we’re aiming for incremental steps here. We plot the results using the base plot function which you can change according to preference.

**Scenario 2: Tracking Training and Validation Error with Split Data**

A crucial enhancement to our previous approach involves adding validation error tracking. This lets us understand if the model is overfitting. I often use a dedicated split for validation during my work.

```R
library(neuralnet)

set.seed(123) # For reproducibility

# Generate some example data
data <- data.frame(x1 = runif(150, 0, 10), x2 = runif(150, 0, 10))
data$y <- 2*data$x1 + 3*data$x2 + rnorm(150, 0, 2)

# Split into training and validation sets
train_indices <- sample(1:nrow(data), 100)
train_data <- data[train_indices, ]
val_data <- data[-train_indices, ]

# Prepare the formula
formula <- y ~ x1 + x2

# Initialize tracking lists
train_errors <- list()
val_errors <- list()
epochs <- 100

# Training Loop
for (i in 1:epochs) {
    nn <- neuralnet(formula, data = train_data, hidden = c(5,3),
                 linear.output = TRUE, lifesign = 'none', stepmax = 1, startweights = nn$weights)
    
    train_errors[[i]] <- nn$result.matrix[1,1] # Track training error
    
    val_pred <- compute(nn, val_data[, c("x1", "x2")])$net.result # Use the same network to validate
    val_error <- sum((val_data$y - val_pred)^2) # Calc SSE on validation data
    val_errors[[i]] <- val_error
}

# Create dataframe for plotting
df <- data.frame(epoch = 1:epochs, train_error = unlist(train_errors), val_error = unlist(val_errors))

# Plot using ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(df, aes(x=epoch)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = train_error, color = "Training Error")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = val_error, color = "Validation Error")) +
  labs(title = "Training vs. Validation Error", x = "Epoch", y = "Sum of Squared Error", color = "Error Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Here, we've extended our code to also compute and save the validation error. We are training on the training data and using the validation data purely to compute the performance, which is plotted together for comparison. I often prefer ggplot2 for the visuals, it has a higher customization capability.

**Scenario 3: Using a Custom Error Function and Tracking it**

Sometimes, you want to track a specific error metric, not just the sum of squares which `neuralnet` gives. In these cases, I utilize a custom evaluation function. The following showcases that concept:

```R
library(neuralnet)

set.seed(123) # For reproducibility

# Generate some example data
data <- data.frame(x1 = runif(100, 0, 10), x2 = runif(100, 0, 10))
data$y <- 2*data$x1 + 3*data$x2 + rnorm(100, 0, 2)

# Prepare the formula
formula <- y ~ x1 + x2

# Custom mean absolute error (MAE) function
mae <- function(actual, predicted) {
  mean(abs(actual - predicted))
}

# Initialize list for errors
epoch_maes <- list()
epochs <- 100

# Training loop
for (i in 1:epochs) {
  nn <- neuralnet(formula, data = data, hidden = c(5,3),
                linear.output = TRUE, lifesign = 'none', stepmax = 1, startweights = nn$weights)
  
  predictions <- compute(nn, data[, c("x1", "x2")])$net.result
  current_mae <- mae(data$y, predictions)
  epoch_maes[[i]] <- current_mae
}

# Create plotting data frame
df <- data.frame(epoch = 1:epochs, mae = unlist(epoch_maes))

# Plot with base R
plot(df$epoch, df$mae, type = 'l', xlab="Epoch", ylab="Mean Absolute Error", main="Learning Curve (MAE)")
```

In this instance, we calculate the MAE after each epoch, demonstrating the flexibility to track whatever performance metric is relevant to your project. The key here is to extract predictions from the trained model at the end of each iteration, then use these predicted values along with your true values to calculate the error metric of your choice.

**Further Resources:**

For gaining a deeper understanding, I'd recommend looking into these resources:

*   **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This is the go-to text for comprehensive deep learning concepts. Understanding the mathematical underpinnings of neural networks enhances interpretation of learning curves significantly.

*   **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron:** While focusing on Python libraries, the book contains an excellent discussion on evaluating models using various metrics and provides many practical examples, which helps understand error evaluations and training dynamics.

*   **Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Martin Wainwright:** This book delves deep into model tuning and regularization, which is extremely valuable when analyzing learning curves and dealing with over or underfitting.

In conclusion, plotting learning curves with `neuralnet` requires a more hands-on approach. You must collect the relevant performance metrics and then use your preferred plotting tool to visualize the training progress. By applying the concepts and code examples I’ve laid out, you will gain a better understanding of your models behavior and learn how to refine neural networks more effectively. This practical, iterative method has always proven to be essential throughout my work with neural networks.
