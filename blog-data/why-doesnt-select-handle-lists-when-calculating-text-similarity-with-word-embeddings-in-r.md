,  It's a question that resonates with me, having spent a good chunk of my career elbow-deep in natural language processing and R, specifically. I recall back in '19, working on a project aiming to classify customer reviews, we faced similar headaches trying to directly utilize `select()` with text data structured as lists of embeddings. The issue, fundamentally, isn't with `select()` itself, but rather with how it's designed to interact with list-structured data and the underlying mechanics of text similarity calculations using word embeddings.

The `dplyr::select()` function, as we know, is primarily designed for data frame manipulation, particularly selecting columns based on their names or positions. When we're working with text, it’s common practice to convert words into numerical vectors – the aforementioned word embeddings – which can be further stored within a data frame. Now, the problem arises when each cell in this data frame contains not a single numerical value, but a *list* of numerical values (the word embeddings). `select()`, expecting a single value, struggles with this kind of nested structure. It is not vectorized to operate directly on lists of this kind.

Essentially, we have a structural mismatch. `select()` doesn’t inherently understand how to extract or manipulate elements within these lists. It's geared towards column selection, not list element selection. The function will either select the entire list-column as is or will not select it based on column name/index, but won't perform a reduction or specific operation on the list elements within.

Text similarity, using word embeddings, frequently involves operations that would be applied *within* these lists. We might, for instance, want to calculate cosine similarity between each pair of embeddings or compute an average embedding for a document. `select()` isn't meant for that. It doesn't possess the required logic to "reach inside" the list structures to perform mathematical computations at the element level. Instead, we need specialized functions and operations explicitly designed to process these list structures and handle numeric vector computations.

To illustrate, consider these code snippets:

**Example 1: Showing how `select()` operates on standard column structure vs a list-based structure**

```R
# Example 1: Dataframe with regular columns
df1 <- data.frame(id = 1:3, name = c("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
selected_df1 <- dplyr::select(df1, name)
print("Normal data frame example:")
print(selected_df1)

# Example 2: Dataframe with a list column
df2 <- data.frame(id = 1:3, embeddings = list(c(1,2,3), c(4,5,6), c(7,8,9)))
selected_df2 <- dplyr::select(df2, embeddings)
print("Dataframe with list column example:")
print(selected_df2)
```

In the first part, `select()` works as expected, grabbing the "name" column. In the second, it also works, selecting the column "embeddings". However, we're not able to calculate anything on the content of the lists themselves. `select()` treats the entire column as a single entity containing a list. It doesn’t try to compute anything on each element, as we might desire when performing similarity calculations. It won't, for instance, automatically calculate the average vector within the `embeddings` column, or calculate cosine similarities between any two of the vectors in that column.

**Example 2: Calculating cosine similarity without using select, requiring specific list handling**

```R
# Assuming vectors are in a list structure, like the embeddings column
embeddings <- list(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6), c(7, 8, 9))

# Function to calculate cosine similarity
cosine_similarity <- function(vec1, vec2) {
  numerator <- sum(vec1 * vec2)
  denominator <- sqrt(sum(vec1^2)) * sqrt(sum(vec2^2))
  return(numerator / denominator)
}

# Calculate similarity between first two embeddings
similarity <- cosine_similarity(embeddings[[1]], embeddings[[2]])
print(paste("Cosine similarity between first two: ", similarity))

# calculate similarity using a for loop to iterate through the list
for (i in 1:(length(embeddings) - 1)) {
  for (j in (i+1):length(embeddings)){
    similarity <- cosine_similarity(embeddings[[i]], embeddings[[j]])
    print(paste("Cosine similarity between embeddings", i, "and", j, ": ", similarity))
  }
}

```

Here, instead of trying to use `select()`, we directly address the list structure, performing calculations using indexing and the custom `cosine_similarity` function. Notice, we are directly accessing the elements within the `embeddings` list using `embeddings[[1]]`, `embeddings[[2]]` and so on. This manual iteration and element access is the essence of handling lists containing vectors.

**Example 3: Example of averaging of word embeddings in a list structure using `lapply` instead of `select`**

```R
# Let's create a list of word embeddings. Each list element is a numerical vector.
word_embeddings <- list(
  c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3),
  c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6),
  c(0.7, 0.8, 0.9),
  c(0.2, 0.3, 0.4)
)

# Function to calculate the average of a list of embeddings
average_embedding <- function(embeddings_list) {
   Reduce("+", embeddings_list) / length(embeddings_list)
}

# Calculate the average embedding of the list
average_vector <- average_embedding(word_embeddings)
print("Average embedding of a list:")
print(average_vector)
```

In this example, we're calculating the average embedding by first creating a function that adds all vectors in the list (using `Reduce("+",...)`), and then divides by the number of vectors to average it. It is another example where functions are required to operate on the list elements and `select` cannot be used in this way. Functions like `lapply` and `sapply` can also be used to apply a function on every element of the list. Again, this illustrates that `select` is insufficient, and we must use different tools to compute on the data.

The crux of the matter lies in understanding the fundamental types and structures of your data. `select()` is designed for manipulating data frames and selecting columns, not for processing lists of vectors. For working with text embeddings, we require tools that can understand how to apply functions to list elements, iterate through them, and perform necessary vector operations like averaging, cosine similarity computation, and more, all within the structure of the data itself.

For further study, I highly recommend exploring resources dedicated to *functional programming in R*, especially those focusing on list manipulation techniques. "Advanced R" by Hadley Wickham is an excellent starting point. Furthermore, research in natural language processing often features these specific manipulations, with resources like "Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin serving as a solid foundation on the theory and implementation surrounding word embeddings. Look also at libraries like `text2vec`, `quanteda`, and even the `keras` packages in R, they will show how lists of embeddings are handled in practical projects. Pay close attention to the use of functions like `lapply`, `sapply`, and the `apply` family of functions for working with list-like structures within dataframes. These are the tools that bridge the gap that `select()` cannot cross when faced with list structures. They provide the necessary mechanics for performing meaningful calculations at the element level within those lists.
