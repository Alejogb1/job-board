Alright,  I've certainly been down that rabbit hole of baffling Rails routing issues more times than I care to remember. It’s one of those areas where things can seem straightforward on the surface, but quickly become complex when unexpected behavior surfaces. The core problem usually isn't a broken `routes.rb` file (though that's *always* worth double-checking), but rather a combination of misunderstanding the routing engine's priorities, subtle code errors, or sometimes even caching issues that can lead to these redirection problems.

For me, the most common culprits tend to fall into these categories: incorrect verb matching, ambiguous route definitions, and the often-overlooked middleware layer interfering with the redirection process. Let's break each of those down.

**1. Incorrect Verb Matching: Method Mismatches**

One frequent source of confusion is a mismatch between the HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) used in your request and the verb defined in your Rails route. This might seem obvious, but it's easy to make mistakes, particularly when dealing with forms. I recall a particular project where I spent a good hour staring at the `routes.rb` file, convinced that I had defined the route correctly for a form submission, only to realize that my form was using a `POST` request but the route was defined for a `GET`.

Consider this common scenario: you want to create a new user. Your form is submitting a `POST` request to `/users`, but the `routes.rb` may include this faulty definition:

```ruby
# Incorrect route setup
get '/users', to: 'users#create'
```

In this setup, any `POST` request to `/users` would be ignored. It simply wouldn't match the defined route. The solution is quite straightforward:

```ruby
# Correct route setup
post '/users', to: 'users#create'
```

The other side of this coin is when you're expecting a `GET` request, say to load a resource, but something is sending a `POST`, resulting in a mismatch, and again, no redirection occurs. Always double-check your request method matches the route defined for that endpoint. Browser developer tools can be crucial here. I'd highly suggest getting familiar with their "network" tab to understand the requests the browser is actually sending. You’ll often find that the problem wasn't in your routing, but in the form, JavaScript, or client-side code that initiates the request.

**2. Ambiguous Route Definitions: The Order Matters**

Rails routes are evaluated in the order they are declared in your `routes.rb` file. The first matching route wins. This means that if you have a generic route defined before a more specific one, the generic route might be matched instead of the one you intended. This is a mistake I’ve made more often than I’d like to admit.

For example, consider this erroneous setup:

```ruby
# Incorrect ambiguous routing
get '/:id', to: 'pages#show' #Generic wildcard
get '/users/:id', to: 'users#show'
```

In this case, if you try to visit `/users/123`, the first route ( `get '/:id'`, pointing to the `pages#show` action ) will be matched before the specific `/users/:id` route, so you'll end up on the page controller instead of the user controller. The fix here is simple: order your routes with the most specific at the top and the more general ones at the bottom. The correct way to define those routes would be:

```ruby
# Correct ordering
get '/users/:id', to: 'users#show' # Specific route comes first
get '/:id', to: 'pages#show' # Generic wildcard last
```

It's a surprisingly common error and a great example of how understanding how the Rails router works is crucial. Always keep the routing logic in your mental model as a cascading "first match wins" style operation. Be extremely mindful of wildcard characters and how they can cause issues.

**3. Middleware Layer Interference: Redirection Interception**

Sometimes, the issue isn't with the routes themselves but with middleware that intercepts or alters requests. Authentication middleware, especially custom ones, is a prime example. It's common for authentication systems to redirect unauthenticated users. If your code is intended to redirect but another middleware layer intercepts the request first, the original redirection might be overridden or lost.

For example, imagine you're using a custom authentication middleware that checks for an active session. This middleware may be set up to redirect to a `/login` route if the user isn't logged in, *before* your intended application-level redirection can occur. Here's a skeletal example of what this middleware might look like (simplified for clarity):

```ruby
# simplified middleware example

class AuthenticationMiddleware
  def initialize(app)
    @app = app
  end

  def call(env)
    request = Rack::Request.new(env)
    unless user_logged_in?(request) # Dummy function
      return [302, {'Location' => '/login'}, ['Redirecting to login']]
    end
    @app.call(env)
  end

  private

  def user_logged_in?(request)
    #logic to check user session
      false
  end
end
```

This type of middleware, if not implemented carefully and understood thoroughly, could interfere with your redirection plans. If, for example, you were trying to redirect users from say `/old_path` to `/new_path` after the successful update of a resource, your middleware might redirect to `/login` if they are not logged in first and thus override your desired behavior.

The solution here is meticulous debugging. You'll want to examine your application's middleware stack – this can usually be seen in your application's configuration or by using `Rails.application.middleware`. Check the order of your middleware and how they might interact. I strongly recommend experimenting by commenting out middleware layers one at a time and seeing if the correct redirection then takes place, to identify potential culprits. Logging from inside custom middleware can also pinpoint whether your middleware is redirecting or interfering and allow you to determine the path to the issue.

To deepen your understanding, I highly recommend the following resources. For a solid grounding in the principles of web development, and specifically for request routing and http verbs, the classic "HTTP: The Definitive Guide" by David Gourley and Brian Totty is invaluable. Specifically for Rails, the official Rails guides are the source of truth for understanding the inner workings of the routing engine and middleware stacks. Finally, examining "Crafting Rails Applications" by José Valim provides a practical and in-depth look into best practices and the subtleties of routing, middleware, and the other core components of a Rails application.

These are just a few of the more common issues that can lead to redirection problems. Debugging these problems takes time, and a systematic approach is crucial. Be patient, meticulously check your route definitions, consider your middleware stack, and make sure you’re using the correct HTTP verb, and you’ll get there. Remember, experience counts, and you’ll get better at spotting these errors.
