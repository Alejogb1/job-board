Let's tackle this directly; it's a common point of confusion for those venturing into Ruby's syntax, especially when dealing with hashes, symbols, and keyword arguments. I've personally tripped over this a few times in my early days working on a large Rails application that relied heavily on dynamic configurations, so trust me, I understand where the questions stem from.

The key here lies in understanding the *context* in which each of these `id` variations appears, as they represent different things despite seeming superficially similar. We're talking about hash keys, symbol notation, and lastly, parameter declaration in method definitions.

First, let's discuss `:id`. This notation, starting with a colon, signifies a *symbol*. Symbols are immutable, lightweight strings often used as keys in hashes or as identifiers. You might be tempted to think of them as merely strings, but they're not. Symbols are unique objects, which means that `:id` will always refer to the same object in memory, whereas `"id"` could create multiple string objects with identical content. This makes them efficient for comparisons and hash lookups. I remember optimizing a particularly slow configuration parser by switching from string keys to symbol keys, which resulted in a noticeable speed increase.

Here’s an example illustrating the use of symbols as hash keys:

```ruby
user = { :id => 1, :name => "Alice", :email => "alice@example.com" }
puts user[:id] # Output: 1
puts user[:name] # Output: Alice
```

In this code, `:id`, `:name`, and `:email` are symbols. Notice the `=>` operator which explicitly links the symbol key to its corresponding value within the hash literal.

Now, let's move to `id:`. This form is used primarily when defining or using *keyword arguments* in Ruby methods. It's essentially a shorthand syntax for defining a method parameter that can be passed using a key-value pair. Ruby then internally handles it as a symbol key-value pair behind the scenes. When calling the method with keyword arguments, you specify the argument name (`id` in this case) followed by a colon and the value.

Here is an illustrative example showing how this works in a method declaration and call:

```ruby
def find_user(id:, name: nil, email: nil)
  puts "Finding user with id: #{id}"
  puts "Name: #{name}" if name
  puts "Email: #{email}" if email
end

find_user(id: 2, name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com") # output: Finding user with id: 2 Name: Bob Email: bob@example.com
find_user(id: 3) # output: Finding user with id: 3
```

In `def find_user(id:, name: nil, email: nil)`, `id:`, `name:`, and `email:` define keyword arguments with their default values. Notice that we call the `find_user` method providing the arguments using the same `id: value` syntax. This form improves code readability by explicitly labeling the purpose of each parameter passed to the method. This is a significant improvement over using traditional positional arguments, especially for methods that accept numerous parameters, and it has saved me from countless bugs caused by misplaced arguments.

Finally, simply `id` without a colon can take multiple roles, and the role depends on the context within the code. In its simplest form, when not acting as part of a hash key or keyword argument, it will usually refer to a *variable name* or a *method call*. It's crucial to look at the surrounding syntax to understand exactly what it is doing.

Consider this extended example demonstrating a variety of use cases:

```ruby
class User
  attr_accessor :id, :name

  def initialize(id, name)
    @id = id
    @name = name
  end

  def print_details
    puts "User ID: #{id}" # Refers to the instance variable via the attr_accessor getter
    puts "User Name: #{@name}" # Instance variable access through the direct notation
  end
end

user_id = 4
my_user = User.new(user_id, "Charlie")
my_user.print_details  # Output: User ID: 4 User Name: Charlie
puts my_user.id # Output: 4 (Method call)

another_user = { id: 5, name: "Diana" } # id: used as a shorthand symbol key notation in a hash

puts another_user[:id] # Output: 5 (Accessing a hash with symbol notation)
puts another_user["id"] # Output: nil (Attempting string-based key lookup when it's a symbol)

def greet(user_param) # variable name used in a method parameter declaration
  puts "Hello, #{user_param.name}"
end

greet(my_user)  # Output: Hello, Charlie
```

Here we can observe `id` as an instance variable (`@id`), as a method call with `user.id` via the getter, and in the method parameter in `def initialize(id, name)`. We also see `id` used as a key shorthand for a symbol in the hash literal. Finally, the last example shows that a method definition has a variable named `user_param` which will contain the value passed when calling the method.

In summary, the key differentiator is context. Symbols, represented as `:id`, serve as unique identifiers often used as keys in hashes and as method parameters for keyword arguments. Keyword argument declarations take the form `id:` in a method signature. Plain `id` represents a variable name, a method call, or a reference to an instance variable based on its context.

For a deeper understanding, I’d recommend delving into the official Ruby documentation on Symbols, Hashes, and Method definitions, specifically paying close attention to the section on keyword arguments. “Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide” by Dave Thomas et al. is an excellent resource. You could also look into ‘Eloquent Ruby’ by Russ Olsen, as it offers practical and clear explanations on Ruby’s syntax and design decisions. Further reading could include the source code for Ruby's parser which is a challenging but informative way to truly see how these different forms are handled at the lowest level. These resources helped me immensely when I was starting out, and they still provide value today. It's all about understanding the nuanced ways Ruby handles these variations.
