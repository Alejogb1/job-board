Alright, let's tackle this. Building a series of neural networks in `R` using the `neuralnet` package is something I've dealt with quite a bit, particularly back in my days working on that time-series forecasting project for the energy sector. It involved sequentially modeling electricity consumption patterns, each network trained on slightly different time windows to enhance predictive power across multiple segments. It wasn’t just about cranking out models, though; it was about understanding the process, limitations, and best practices.

The `neuralnet` package provides a fairly straightforward interface for single network creation, but when you're stringing multiple networks together – whether for ensemble learning, hierarchical modelling, or simply segmenting your data – you need a bit more control and systematic approach. Here’s how I typically handle it, broken down into logical steps with some code examples.

First, understand that `neuralnet` works by creating a feedforward neural network through formula specification. This means you define how input variables relate to the output variable. When moving to multiple networks, the approach is similar, but now we need to manage data splitting, network configuration, and potentially even model evaluation more deliberately.

**The Core Workflow: Data Preparation, Network Design, and Evaluation**

Typically, my workflow begins with data preparation. For sequential networks, ensuring your data is segmented, preprocessed, and properly formatted is crucial. Let's assume you have some data and want to train three different neural networks using the same set of input features but slightly modified or different target variables:

```R
# Example Data Setup (replace with your own dataset)
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  feature1 = rnorm(100),
  feature2 = rnorm(100),
  feature3 = rnorm(100),
  target1 = rnorm(100, mean = 2),
  target2 = rnorm(100, mean = -1),
  target3 = rnorm(100, mean = 0.5)
)

# Splitting data (for training, validation)
train_indices <- sample(1:nrow(data), 0.7 * nrow(data))
train_data <- data[train_indices,]
test_data  <- data[-train_indices,]

```

Here, I’ve created a sample dataset and split it into training and testing sets. Real data would obviously require more substantial cleaning, feature engineering, and possibly normalization or standardization – techniques well documented in resources like 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow' by Aurélien Géron.

The next step is defining the network architectures. Because `neuralnet` uses formula-based specification, this is where we'll specify the relationship between inputs and outputs. I typically use a list to store networks, it helps with organization.

```R
# Install and load if necessary
# install.packages("neuralnet")
library(neuralnet)

# Define network formulas and configurations
formulas <- list(
  net1 = target1 ~ feature1 + feature2 + feature3,
  net2 = target2 ~ feature1 + feature2 + feature3,
  net3 = target3 ~ feature1 + feature2 + feature3
)

network_configurations <- list(
  net1 = list(hidden = 5, linear.output = FALSE),
  net2 = list(hidden = c(10,5), linear.output = TRUE), # Note two layer hidden
  net3 = list(hidden = 3, linear.output = TRUE)
)


# Initialize an empty list to store the neural networks
neural_networks <- list()

# Loop through formulas and configs, training each network.
for (i in seq_along(formulas)){
  net_name <- names(formulas)[i]

  # Train the neural network
  neural_networks[[net_name]] <- neuralnet(formulas[[i]],
                                          data = train_data,
                                          hidden = network_configurations[[i]]$hidden,
                                          linear.output = network_configurations[[i]]$linear.output
  )


}

```

In this example, I've set up three networks, each with a slightly different formula and configuration. Notice that each configuration specifies a different hidden layer design and linear output parameter, which allows flexibility in model construction.

Finally, to get predictions and assess model performance we can iterate through the networks and predict on the test data:

```R
# Predict on test data
predictions <- lapply(names(neural_networks), function(net_name) {
    predict(neural_networks[[net_name]], newdata = test_data)
  })

names(predictions) <- names(neural_networks)

# Evaluation metrics (example with root mean squared error RMSE)
eval_metrics <- lapply(names(predictions), function(net_name){
  predicted_vals = as.vector(predictions[[net_name]])
  actual_vals    = test_data[, gsub("~.*", "", as.character(formulas[[net_name]]))]

  rmse = sqrt(mean((predicted_vals - actual_vals)^2))
  return (rmse)
})
names(eval_metrics) = names(predictions)

print("Root mean squared error for each network:")
print(eval_metrics)
```

This code snippet demonstrates a straightforward way to generate predictions for each network and evaluate it via the RMSE. The exact evaluation metric you use should align with the specific problem you’re tackling. Books like 'Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning' by Christopher Bishop would give you a great in-depth understanding about this subject.

**Key Considerations for Working with Multiple Networks**

*   **Data Sharing and Dependencies**: Think carefully about whether the networks are independent, sequential, or interdependent. In the electricity project, networks were trained on overlapping time windows, so we carefully managed time offsets and handled edge cases to prevent data leakage, an often-overlooked aspect that can lead to artificially good-looking results.

*   **Parameter Tuning:** The `neuralnet` package allows you to set parameters like `stepmax` (maximum number of steps for optimization), `threshold` (tolerance for stopping condition), and various learning parameters via the `algorithm` argument. I would suggest, at the very least, using cross validation to choose appropriate hyperparameters for each network, as these often are not transferable among networks trained on different problems.

*   **Model Persistence and Versioning:** In practical setups, models need to be saved and versioned. I typically use `saveRDS` to serialize models and maintain a system for model tracking. Something like `dvc` is great for more advanced, collaborative work, as it allows to keep track of model artifacts in a more rigorous manner.

*   **Computation**: Training multiple neural networks can be demanding. Consider using parallel computation via the `foreach` package or similar tools. Also, be mindful of the fact that `neuralnet` does not run on GPUs, so, in case the networks become very large, you might want to consider using other libraries.

*   **Ensemble Techniques:** If the ultimate goal is prediction, instead of simply applying a sequence of networks, think about techniques like bagging or boosting with neural networks. This would allow to use multiple models to make a final improved prediction.

**In Conclusion**

Building multiple neural networks in `R` using `neuralnet` isn’t complex in itself, but requires careful planning and a systematic approach. The example I provided outlines a basic approach, but remember to tailor your workflow to the specific requirements of your task. Always, always begin by understanding your data deeply. Don’t rush to apply neural networks; instead, start with simpler methods to get a sense of the structure and underlying nature of your data. Finally, remember to properly validate your results, and use performance metrics that accurately reflect the desired characteristics of your trained models. The resources mentioned will provide additional technical details for your data science journey.
