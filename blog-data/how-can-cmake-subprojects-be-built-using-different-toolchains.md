Alright, let's talk toolchains with cmake subprojects, something I've definitely navigated a few times, especially back when we were migrating our embedded systems build to a more modular approach. The basic problem, as you've probably encountered, isn't *if* you can use different toolchains—cmake, thankfully, provides the mechanisms—but *how* to do it gracefully and consistently. The trick lies in understanding how cmake manages build configurations, especially when dealing with external projects included through `add_subdirectory`. The first, and probably most common, approach involves leveraging cmake toolchain files.

A toolchain file, for those not overly familiar, is essentially a script that tells cmake about the compiler, linker, archiver, and related tools needed to build for a specific platform or target. We're not just talking about `gcc` vs `clang` here; we could be dealing with cross-compilation scenarios where you're building on an x86_64 host for, say, an arm-based embedded system. Now, the key here is to avoid setting global toolchain options, which is where many trips up. You want to define those on a per-subproject basis.

Let's say you have a main project structure like this:

```
project/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── subproject_a/
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── source_a.c
└── subproject_b/
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    └── source_b.c
```

In the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, you would *not* directly specify a toolchain file. Instead, your main `CMakeLists.txt` might look something like:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(main_project)

add_subdirectory(subproject_a)
add_subdirectory(subproject_b)

# do nothing else related to compilers here
```

Now, in each subproject, you use cmake variables to manage the toolchain. For instance, in `subproject_a/CMakeLists.txt`, you would configure your specific toolchain:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(subproject_a)

# This assumes you have a toolchain file named 'toolchain_a.cmake'
set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/toolchain_a.cmake" CACHE PATH "Toolchain file for subproject A")

add_executable(sub_a source_a.c)

# Do sub-project-specific setup for build files...
```

Similarly, in `subproject_b/CMakeLists.txt`, you'd specify a potentially different toolchain:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(subproject_b)

# This assumes you have a toolchain file named 'toolchain_b.cmake'
set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/toolchain_b.cmake" CACHE PATH "Toolchain file for subproject B")

add_executable(sub_b source_b.c)

# do sub-project-specific setup
```

Here's the first code snippet for context, which is `subproject_a/CMakeLists.txt` again:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(subproject_a)

# This assumes you have a toolchain file named 'toolchain_a.cmake'
set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/toolchain_a.cmake" CACHE PATH "Toolchain file for subproject A")

add_executable(sub_a source_a.c)

# Do sub-project-specific setup for build files...
```

The crucial point here is that the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable is set *locally* within each subproject, using the `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` to make the path relative. The `CACHE` keyword ensures that the toolchain file path is remembered for subsequent cmake runs and can be configured using the cmake gui, if needed. This lets each subproject know exactly which toolchain it should use when it is included and prevents global settings interfering. When building `main_project`, cmake will process these `CMakeLists.txt` files in order, applying the toolchains as they are encountered.

Now, let's consider a more advanced scenario where you might want to dynamically select toolchains, perhaps based on command-line arguments. I had this exact requirement once when we were building software that had to target multiple embedded platforms in the same build process, for testing and analysis purposes. Instead of relying on cached variables, you can use conditional logic to set toolchain files based on options. In your top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, you could add something like this:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(main_project)

option(TARGET_PLATFORM "Target Platform for build" "host")

if(TARGET_PLATFORM STREQUAL "arm")
  set(SUBPROJECT_A_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subproject_a/toolchain_arm.cmake")
  set(SUBPROJECT_B_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subproject_b/toolchain_arm.cmake")
elseif(TARGET_PLATFORM STREQUAL "mips")
  set(SUBPROJECT_A_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subproject_a/toolchain_mips.cmake")
  set(SUBPROJECT_B_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subproject_b/toolchain_mips.cmake")
else()
  set(SUBPROJECT_A_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "")
  set(SUBPROJECT_B_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "")
endif()

add_subdirectory(subproject_a)
add_subdirectory(subproject_b)

```

Then, in each of the subproject cmake files, you simply read in the pre-defined variable:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(subproject_a)

if(DEFINED SUBPROJECT_A_TOOLCHAIN_FILE AND SUBPROJECT_A_TOOLCHAIN_FILE)
    set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${SUBPROJECT_A_TOOLCHAIN_FILE}" CACHE PATH "Toolchain file for subproject A")
endif()

add_executable(sub_a source_a.c)

# Do sub-project-specific setup for build files...
```

Here’s the second illustrative code block, which is `subproject_a/CMakeLists.txt` modified to work with this approach:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(subproject_a)

if(DEFINED SUBPROJECT_A_TOOLCHAIN_FILE AND SUBPROJECT_A_TOOLCHAIN_FILE)
    set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${SUBPROJECT_A_TOOLCHAIN_FILE}" CACHE PATH "Toolchain file for subproject A")
endif()

add_executable(sub_a source_a.c)

# Do sub-project-specific setup for build files...
```
This approach offers considerably more flexibility. When building from the command line you can run `cmake -DTARGET_PLATFORM=arm ..` to build everything for the arm toolchain. The option is also exposed via the cmake gui. In this case, the toolchain variable isn't stored in the cache, and it must be set at each cmake execution. If no platform is provided the sub-projects will use their default toolchains (if specified, otherwise it will build against the host machine) which is a good way to default to a local, cross-platform target.

Now, the third scenario I want to describe relates to dependencies. What happens when your subprojects depend on each other, and they need to be built using different toolchains? This situation occurred when I was working on a project where the core library needed to be built with a more mature, stable toolchain, while specialized subcomponents could use newer, more experimental ones. The key in this scenario is to make sure that dependencies are linked properly regardless of toolchain.

Let's assume that `subproject_b` depends on `sub_a`. Your `subproject_b/CMakeLists.txt` could now look like:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(subproject_b)

if(DEFINED SUBPROJECT_B_TOOLCHAIN_FILE AND SUBPROJECT_B_TOOLCHAIN_FILE)
    set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${SUBPROJECT_B_TOOLCHAIN_FILE}" CACHE PATH "Toolchain file for subproject B")
endif()

add_executable(sub_b source_b.c)

target_link_libraries(sub_b sub_a) # this is how you consume the other library

# Do sub-project-specific setup for build files...
```

Finally, the third code snippet is the `subproject_b/CMakeLists.txt` example from above.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(subproject_b)

if(DEFINED SUBPROJECT_B_TOOLCHAIN_FILE AND SUBPROJECT_B_TOOLCHAIN_FILE)
    set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${SUBPROJECT_B_TOOLCHAIN_FILE}" CACHE PATH "Toolchain file for subproject B")
endif()

add_executable(sub_b source_b.c)

target_link_libraries(sub_b sub_a) # this is how you consume the other library

# Do sub-project-specific setup for build files...
```

Note that `add_subdirectory` is sufficient to ensure that the library generated in sub_a is then available to sub_b. The trick here is that CMake is smart enough to understand that a dependency like `sub_a` must be built using the toolchain that `sub_a` specified, even though it’s being consumed by `sub_b` which has a different toolchain. This allows you to have a core library that must use the stable arm-gcc suite and a separate component built with clang for analysis or testing.

For further reading on this, I recommend diving into the official cmake documentation, specifically the section on toolchain files. The book "Professional CMake: A Practical Guide" by Craig Scott is also an exceptional resource, covering these concepts and many more with in-depth explanations. Furthermore, the cmake mailing list is a great place to review past discussions and find solutions for particular problems that people have already solved. For a more theoretical understanding, I recommend examining the concept of 'domain-specific languages' as toolchains can be thought of as one approach to configure a build using a specific domain language. It also may be helpful to read about meta-build systems or build system engineering papers.

In conclusion, managing different toolchains in cmake subprojects isn't particularly challenging when you have a firm understanding of toolchain files, variable scope, and how cmake manages dependencies. Avoiding global settings and using either cached variables or conditional logic based on command-line options, as shown, are key to maintainability and flexibility in your build system. Good luck.
