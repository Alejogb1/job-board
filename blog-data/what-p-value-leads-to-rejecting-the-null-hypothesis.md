A p-value is fundamentally the probability of observing data as extreme, or more extreme, than the observed data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This value is not a measure of the magnitude of the effect, nor does it measure the probability of the null hypothesis being true. Instead, it serves as an indicator to decide whether the observed data is statistically incompatible with the null hypothesis. The threshold for rejection, often denoted as alpha (α), is a pre-determined significance level.

A null hypothesis (H₀) usually represents a default position, typically that there is no effect or difference. For example, when comparing two groups, H₀ might state that there is no difference in their means. The alternative hypothesis (H₁) proposes that there is an effect. In practice, I've frequently encountered situations where researchers interpret rejecting H₀ as proof of H₁, which isn't correct. Rejecting H₀ merely indicates that the observed data is unlikely given H₀. It does not automatically prove the alternative.

The specific p-value that leads to rejection is dependent on the chosen alpha level. Common alpha values are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.1. These values reflect the probability of rejecting H₀ when it is actually true (Type I error). A p-value less than or equal to the chosen alpha (p ≤ α) leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis. The decision to use a specific α is often a balance between limiting Type I error (false positive) and Type II error (false negative, failing to reject a false H₀). The choice is highly context-dependent, and lower α values, such as 0.01, are used in fields where making a false positive is more serious than missing a true effect.

Let's examine some concrete examples with Python. The SciPy library provides many functions for statistical hypothesis testing:

```python
import scipy.stats as stats
import numpy as np

# Example 1: One-sample t-test
# H0: Mean is equal to 5, H1: Mean is not equal to 5

data1 = np.array([4.5, 5.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.6, 4.9])
t_statistic, p_value1 = stats.ttest_1samp(a=data1, popmean=5)

print(f"Example 1: T-statistic = {t_statistic:.3f}, P-value = {p_value1:.3f}")
alpha = 0.05
if p_value1 <= alpha:
   print("Reject the null hypothesis in Example 1")
else:
  print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis in Example 1")
```
In this example, a one-sample t-test is performed. The `stats.ttest_1samp` function from `SciPy` computes the t-statistic and the corresponding p-value based on the dataset (`data1`) and the proposed population mean (5). If the p-value is less than or equal to the pre-determined alpha of 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected.

```python
# Example 2: Two-sample t-test
# H0: Means are equal, H1: Means are not equal

data2_a = np.array([22, 25, 23, 26, 28])
data2_b = np.array([18, 20, 19, 21, 23])
t_statistic, p_value2 = stats.ttest_ind(a=data2_a, b=data2_b)

print(f"Example 2: T-statistic = {t_statistic:.3f}, P-value = {p_value2:.3f}")

alpha = 0.01
if p_value2 <= alpha:
   print("Reject the null hypothesis in Example 2")
else:
   print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis in Example 2")
```
Here, we're using an independent two-sample t-test through `stats.ttest_ind`. The data is divided into two groups `data2_a` and `data2_b`, and the null hypothesis claims their means are equal. We then evaluate if we can reject that given the data, against an alpha of 0.01. This more stringent alpha makes it harder to reject the null.

```python
# Example 3: Chi-square test for independence
# H0: Variables are independent, H1: Variables are not independent
observed_values = np.array([[10, 20], [30, 40]])
chi2_statistic, p_value3, dof, expected_values = stats.chi2_contingency(observed=observed_values)
print(f"Example 3: Chi-square Statistic = {chi2_statistic:.3f}, P-value = {p_value3:.3f}")
alpha = 0.05
if p_value3 <= alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis in Example 3")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis in Example 3")
```
Finally, a Chi-square test for independence is performed using `stats.chi2_contingency`. This evaluates if two categorical variables are independent based on an observed contingency table. The null hypothesis of independence is tested against the observed data.

For further understanding, resources like "Statistical Methods for Psychology" by David C. Howell and "All of Statistics" by Larry Wasserman offer detailed theoretical explanations of statistical hypothesis testing. Furthermore, online courses from platforms like Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy provide practical tutorials and interactive exercises. Textbooks specializing in specific statistical methods, such as econometrics or biostatistics, are also beneficial depending on one’s domain.

A comparative table of alpha values and p-value cutoffs:

|------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alpha = 0.01 | Strict threshold for rejecting H₀    | Lower probability of Type I Error      | High-stakes medical trials; verifying critical safety protocols; where false positive results have severe consequences. | Increased risk of Type II Error (failing to reject false H₀); Requires stronger evidence |
| Alpha = 0.05 | Standard threshold for rejecting H₀ | Moderate probability of Type I Error    | Social sciences research; marketing studies; engineering experiments; commonly used across most domains.          | Risk of both Type I and Type II Errors are balanced but not minimized                      |
| Alpha = 0.1  | Lax threshold for rejecting H₀     | Higher probability of Type I Error      | Exploratory research; early-stage drug discovery; when missing a true effect is more problematic than false positives. | Increased risk of Type I Error (false positive); Easier to find statistically significant effects, even when they may not be real |

In summary, the decision about which p-value constitutes rejection (i.e., choice of α) depends heavily on the context of the problem.  For scenarios where a false positive carries serious implications, such as verifying medical treatments, a lower alpha (e.g., 0.01) is preferred despite the increase in the risk of a false negative. Conversely, for initial exploratory investigations, a higher alpha (e.g., 0.1) may be acceptable as the consequence of a false positive is lower and the goal is identifying potential signals, understanding that those might need further validation. Ultimately, a value of 0.05 strikes a reasonable balance for many scientific fields and is often a standard default, but researchers should explicitly justify their chosen alpha. The p-value alone provides evidence relative to the null, and the choice of alpha translates that into a decision given the inherent trade-offs.
