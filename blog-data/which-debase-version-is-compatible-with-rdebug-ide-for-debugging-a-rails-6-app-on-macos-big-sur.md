Let's tackle this head-on; it's a question I've certainly encountered more than once. The intersection of debugging tools, ruby versions, and the ever-evolving macOS can often feel a bit like navigating a complex maze. The short answer is: compatibility is finicky, and pinning down the “perfect” debase version for `rdebug-ide` with Rails 6 on Big Sur requires a bit of investigation and sometimes, a bit of trial and error.

My personal experience with this issue dates back to a particularly challenging migration of a medium-sized legacy application. We had just upgraded to Rails 6, and some members of the team were on Big Sur, and others on Catalina. The debugging experience was… inconsistent, to say the least. We realized that the root cause was often a version mismatch between `debase`, the underlying debugger gem, and the expectations of `rdebug-ide`.

The core problem stems from how `debase` interfaces with the ruby runtime. Older versions of `debase`, particularly those that relied on deprecated C extension APIs within the ruby core, can experience instability or simply fail to initialize correctly. This manifests most often as `rdebug-ide` failing to attach to the debugger process, resulting in breakpoints being ignored.

For Rails 6 applications, it’s essential to use `debase` versions that support the ruby version you’re using. Now, since you didn't explicitly mention *which* ruby version you're using, I’ll assume a relatively common scenario: ruby 2.7.x, or potentially ruby 3.0.x. The ruby version is, in fact, critical. Older rubies, such as 2.5 or 2.6, are not fully supported by current `debase` versions. This means you might find even a "compatible" `debase` version failing to operate with your older ruby on big sur.

Here’s what I've learned based on those experiences and continued research. For ruby 2.7.x, I've consistently found that `debase` version `0.2.5` (or higher) is the most stable. For ruby 3.0 and above, `debase` version `0.3.0` (or later) is generally the way to go. The key, however, is not just *having* the correct `debase`, but also ensuring it's *properly installed*. This is where some issues arise, particularly around compilation of native extensions. On macOS, especially with Big Sur, the compilation of these extensions can sometimes fail if the developer toolchain isn’t correctly set up.

Let me illustrate what I mean by using a code example – a simplified Gemfile snippet:

```ruby
# Gemfile snippet
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '~> 6.1.0'  # Or your specific rails version
gem 'rdebug-ide'

group :development, :test do
  gem 'debase', '>= 0.2.5'  # For ruby 2.7.x
  # or gem 'debase', '>= 0.3.0' # For ruby 3.0+

end

```

In this snippet, we explicitly specify a `debase` version. This isn't just 'good practice', it is practically a requirement for consistent debugging. Failure to specify a version can lead to Bundler picking a very old `debase` by default.

Now, after updating your gemfile with a compatible `debase` version and running `bundle install`, you might encounter another issue – compilation errors related to the C extensions of the gem. Here’s where it is really beneficial to have your xcode command line tools set up correctly.

Let’s demonstrate a potential workaround for compilation problems related to `debase` which we used in our problematic migration mentioned earlier. While the actual command depends on what specifically is wrong, this highlights the process of ensuring your dev tools are present:

```bash
# Terminal command (ensure xcode commandline tools are installed)
xcode-select --install

# Or if already installed, and still failing to compile:
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

The above commands ensure that the command-line toolchain is available and selected by xcode. It can resolve a vast majority of compile errors for the `debase` gem. In my experience, ensuring this step alone resolves a considerable number of issues.

However, sometimes, the problem is not within `debase` itself, but in how your environment variables are set up, or how `rdebug-ide` is launched. Therefore, it's important to isolate the problem by starting rdebug-ide manually to see if it is in fact the launch or a configuration. Let’s do another hypothetical scenario where `rdebug-ide` isn't connecting properly:

```ruby
# Example of running rdebug-ide manually in terminal for isolation purposes

# start the rails server
rails s -b 0.0.0.0

# start a new terminal session in same directory

# attach to the debugger process with rdebug-ide
rdebug-ide --port=1234 --host=0.0.0.0 # note the same host from when the server started.


```

This snippet demonstrates a command line approach to debugging. Replace 1234 with whatever port you are configured to use in your debugger. The idea is to sidestep your IDE to determine if the core debugging components work.

Moving beyond just version numbers and error messages, I'd recommend a deeper dive into some of the resources available. First, the documentation for `debase` itself is invaluable, though sometimes a little cryptic. You can find that by examining the gem’s repository on rubygems.org. Pay particular attention to the issues section of that repository as often times other developers have run into the same problems. Second, the official Ruby documentation regarding C extensions would be helpful in comprehending the underlying issues in terms of extension compilation failures. Third, the Ruby core source code gives an exhaustive list of the APIs that `debase` relies on. Understanding that may seem advanced but it is very helpful for diagnosing the root cause of problems.

In summary, for a Rails 6 app on macOS Big Sur with ruby 2.7.x, aim for `debase` version `0.2.5` or higher; for ruby 3.0 or above aim for `debase` version `0.3.0` or higher. Ensure your development toolchain is properly installed, and do not hesitate to run commands in the terminal to isolate the issue. Finally, check the open issues on both `debase` and `rdebug-ide` github pages for common pitfalls. Compatibility can be a moving target, so staying informed of gem updates is a good preventative strategy. While frustrating, following these guidelines should steer you toward a more stable debugging environment. Good luck.
