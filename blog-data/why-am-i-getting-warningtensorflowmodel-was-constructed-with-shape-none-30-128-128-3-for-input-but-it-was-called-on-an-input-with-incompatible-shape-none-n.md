Okay, let's unpack this. I've seen this type of tensorflow shape mismatch pop up more times than I care to remember, and it's almost always traceable back to a fundamental disconnect in how the model expects its input versus what's actually being fed to it. It's a bit like trying to plug a three-prong plug into a two-prong socket – it's just not going to work, no matter how hard you try.

The core of your issue lies in the discrepancy between the shape defined during the model construction `(None, 30, 128, 128, 3)` and the shape of the actual input at runtime `(None, N)`. Let’s break this down.

The `(None, 30, 128, 128, 3)` indicates a five-dimensional tensor. `None` is a placeholder for the batch size, meaning your model can handle any number of input samples at once. The `30`, `128`, `128`, and `3` represent the subsequent dimensions. Often, this setup signals that the model was designed to handle sequences of images. For instance, it could be processing 30 frames of a video, each frame being a 128x128 RGB image (3 color channels).

On the other hand, your error message states that the model is being called with a shape of `(None, N)`. This indicates a two-dimensional tensor. Again, `None` represents the batch size, and `N` represents the length of your data for a single element in the batch. This shape suggests that you’re feeding in a vector, possibly the flattened version of the expected image data or an unrelated dataset.

Here's where it usually goes sideways. When building a model in tensorflow, especially using something like the keras api, you often need to explicitly define the input layer. For convolutional neural networks (cnns) or sequence models, this input definition often corresponds to the expected shape of the data you're ultimately going to feed it. This initial specification is important. If this shape definition isn't consistent with the data you're actually passing to the model during training, evaluation, or prediction, then the engine throws up the warning that you're seeing.

Here are three concrete scenarios with examples illustrating common reasons for this issue and how to fix them:

**Scenario 1: Flattened Image Data Instead of Original Shape**

Imagine I once worked on a project where we were trying to do object tracking in a video stream. We initially loaded our frames correctly (30 frames of 128x128x3 images), but then someone, in a well-intentioned attempt to speed up preprocessing, flattened each image before passing it to the model. So instead of a (30, 128, 128, 3) tensor, we were passing a single flattened vector of size (30 * 128 * 128 * 3), which comes out to (1474560). So, here is a code snippet that simulates this, along with the correction:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the model with expected shape (None, 30, 128, 128, 3)
model_input_shape = (None, 30, 128, 128, 3)
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=model_input_shape[1:])
flattened = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(input_layer)  # example, not using correct model for example
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(flattened) # example, not using correct model for example
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

# Incorrect data preparation
# Simulate a single input, with shape that matches the flattened data
incorrect_input_data = np.random.rand(1, 30*128*128*3) # batch size is 1
print(f"Incorrect input data shape: {incorrect_input_data.shape}")

# This next line will generate the warning
# model(incorrect_input_data) # will cause error

# Correct data preparation (simulate a mini batch)
correct_input_data = np.random.rand(2, 30, 128, 128, 3) # batch size is 2
print(f"Correct input data shape: {correct_input_data.shape}")

output = model(correct_input_data) # Correct now
```

The problem is that the model's initial layer expected five dimensions. We flattened everything into one vector of size 1,474,560. The solution was to ensure the input maintains the (30, 128, 128, 3) structure when feeding it into the model.

**Scenario 2: Feeding Non-Image Data**

Another time, I saw someone trying to train a convolutional model designed for image classification on tabular data. The model's input was defined as (None, 30, 128, 128, 3) but the data loaded was a two dimensional CSV array. This resulted in a shape mismatch. The correction for this would be to use the correct model, or more specifically a multilayer perceptron (mlp) that takes a flattened data vector as the input.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define an image processing model with expected shape (None, 30, 128, 128, 3)
image_input_shape = (None, 30, 128, 128, 3)
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=image_input_shape[1:])
conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv3D(32, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu')(input_layer)
pool1 = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool3D((2, 2, 2))(conv1)
flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(pool1)
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(flatten)
image_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)


# Define an MLP for tabular data, expected input (None, N)
mlp_input_shape = (None, 100) # N = 100 for demonstration
mlp_input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=mlp_input_shape[1:])
dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(mlp_input_layer)
output_mlp = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(dense1)
mlp_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=mlp_input_layer, outputs=output_mlp)


# Incorrect data (tabular data passed to image model)
incorrect_input_data_tab = np.random.rand(1, 100) # batch size 1, N = 100
print(f"Incorrect tabular data shape: {incorrect_input_data_tab.shape}")

# This next line will generate the warning
# image_model(incorrect_input_data_tab) # will cause an error

# Correct data (Image data passed to the image processing model)
correct_input_data_img = np.random.rand(2, 30, 128, 128, 3) # batch size 2
print(f"Correct image data shape: {correct_input_data_img.shape}")
image_model(correct_input_data_img) # Correct

# Correct data (tabular data passed to MLP)
correct_input_data_tab = np.random.rand(2, 100)
print(f"Correct tabular data shape: {correct_input_data_tab.shape}")
mlp_model(correct_input_data_tab)

```

The fix here wasn’t just about reshaping data, but also required recognizing the type of data used and using an appropriate model, in this case an MLP.

**Scenario 3: Incorrect Batch Handling During Prediction**

Finally, I recall an instance where the model was trained correctly, but the prediction pipeline messed things up. During training, we fed mini-batches, but during prediction, the code was only sending a single data instance without a batch dimension. The prediction logic was expecting input data with batch size of `1` and input shape of (30, 128, 128, 3), but was getting a shape of (30, 128, 128, 3) where batch size was not set correctly.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define model with the expected input shape (None, 30, 128, 128, 3)
model_input_shape = (None, 30, 128, 128, 3)
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=model_input_shape[1:])
conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv3D(32, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu')(input_layer)
pool1 = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool3D((2, 2, 2))(conv1)
flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(pool1)
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(flatten)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

# Simulate a correct training mini-batch input
training_data = np.random.rand(32, 30, 128, 128, 3) # batch size 32
model(training_data) # works during training

# Simulate incorrect single sample input for prediction
incorrect_prediction_data = np.random.rand(30, 128, 128, 3)
print(f"Incorrect prediction data shape: {incorrect_prediction_data.shape}")
# This next line will cause an error
# model(incorrect_prediction_data) #will cause error


# Correct the shape for prediction (add the batch dimension)
correct_prediction_data = np.expand_dims(incorrect_prediction_data, axis=0) # batch size of 1
print(f"Correct prediction data shape: {correct_prediction_data.shape}")

prediction = model(correct_prediction_data) # Works now
```

The solution was to add the batch dimension using `np.expand_dims` or reshape the data before calling the model for prediction.

To conclude, the warning you’re encountering points to a mismatch between the input shape your tensorflow model expects and what it's receiving. This can stem from flattening data, feeding the wrong type of data, or incorrect batch size management. The key is to thoroughly inspect your data pipeline and ensure consistency between the input shape defined in your model and the data shape you're providing at runtime.

For further reading, I recommend consulting the tensorflow documentation on input layers for `tf.keras` models, particularly for convolutional layers, and exploring the `numpy` documentation for array manipulation. The book "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet provides a solid foundation for understanding these concepts, and the original tensorflow white paper is worth reviewing as a foundational document.
