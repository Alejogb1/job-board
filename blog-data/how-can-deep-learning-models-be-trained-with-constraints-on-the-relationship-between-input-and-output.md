Let’s tackle this then. I remember back in '17 working on a fairly complex multi-modal system. The challenge wasn’t just getting the deep learning models to learn, but ensuring they learned *specific* relationships between the varied inputs and outputs. It's not enough to simply toss data at a network; sometimes, you need to enforce that the mapping respects certain real-world constraints, which isn’t always inherent in the dataset or loss function. This is where constrained learning really shines.

Fundamentally, training deep learning models with input-output constraints involves modifying the training process to encourage the model to learn not just any mapping, but one that respects these imposed conditions. We often approach this via two primary avenues: modified loss functions and architecture-based constraints.

Let’s start with loss functions. Imagine we're building a model where the output should always be within a specific range. A typical mean squared error (mse) loss will only care about minimizing the distance between predictions and actual values, regardless if it violates the output boundary. To enforce this, we modify our loss function, adding a penalty term for violations. This is akin to telling the model: “yes, accuracy is important, but you *also* need to stay within these specific bounds.” This is achieved through adding regularization terms to the loss.

Here's a snippet of how you might implement it in Python using TensorFlow, assuming `y_pred` is the predicted output and `y_true` is the target:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def constrained_loss(y_true, y_pred, lower_bound, upper_bound, penalty_factor=1.0):
    mse_loss = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(y_true, y_pred)

    violation_lower = tf.maximum(lower_bound - y_pred, 0) # positive if y_pred < lower_bound
    violation_upper = tf.maximum(y_pred - upper_bound, 0) # positive if y_pred > upper_bound

    constraint_violation_loss = tf.reduce_sum(violation_lower + violation_upper)
    total_loss = mse_loss + penalty_factor * constraint_violation_loss

    return total_loss
```

In this example, `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` represent the permissible output range. If the predicted value falls outside these boundaries, a non-zero penalty (scaled by `penalty_factor`) is added to the mse loss, pushing the model to learn to stay within bounds. This technique is versatile; for instance, for monotonicity constraints, you could similarly penalize situations where the output decreases given an input increase, based on the relationship expected between them.

Another frequent situation arises where we want some input feature to influence the output in a predetermined way, irrespective of the underlying data relationship. Suppose you have a simulation model and the input `x_feature` directly influences the `y_output` by a factor of `k`. If your dataset’s training instances does not faithfully represent this, simply feeding the data might fail to create this relationship. Here we can introduce a layer inside the network designed to enforce the expected behavior before the final prediction. Let’s imagine that, after passing through the regular neural network layers, the prediction `z` is obtained. Now, let’s say `z` represents the base behavior, and the output `y_pred` should be dependent on `x_feature` times a known factor `k`. We can achieve this by passing `z` through the following specialized “constraint layer”.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ConstraintLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, k, **kwargs):
        super(ConstraintLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.k = tf.constant(k, dtype=tf.float32)

    def call(self, z, x_feature):
        # Apply constraint: y_pred = z + k * x_feature
        y_pred = z + self.k * x_feature
        return y_pred
```

Here, `k` is our constraint factor, which is known beforehand. This layer takes the network’s output `z` and combines it with `x_feature` by the factor `k`. For more complex constraints, this layer could itself be more involved, with additional trainable parameters or non-linearities, but always operating to enforce the imposed input-output behavior. This “constrained layer” could then become part of a sequential model.

Lastly, consider scenarios where we want the model’s representation to exhibit certain symmetries or invariances. That is, we want the model’s latent representation to be less sensitive to some transformation on the input. These constraints can often be implemented by explicitly crafting the network architecture itself, making them less reliant on post-hoc modifications to the loss function. Siamese networks are one approach; however, that might not always be feasible if there are other architecture considerations. In such cases, we can use a form of adversarial learning to enforce invariance. Let's say that the input `x` is transformed to `x_transformed` by a known process. We want our model’s latent representation to be the same regardless of which input we give. This could be achieved by including an additional discriminator which is trained to distinguish between latent representations based on the source input and a generator trying to make these indistinguishable.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Model

def build_encoder():
  # Assuming x_input is the original input.
    inputs = layers.Input(shape=(input_dim,)) #input_dim is specific to your problem
    x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(inputs)
    encoded = layers.Dense(latent_dim, activation='relu')(x)
    return Model(inputs, encoded)


def build_discriminator(latent_dim):
    inputs = layers.Input(shape=(latent_dim,))
    x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
    outputs = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)  # Binary classification
    return Model(inputs, outputs)

def adversarial_training_step(x_original, x_transformed, encoder, discriminator, encoder_optimizer, discriminator_optimizer, bce_loss):
  with tf.GradientTape() as enc_tape, tf.GradientTape() as disc_tape:
    z_original = encoder(x_original)
    z_transformed = encoder(x_transformed)

    disc_logits_orig = discriminator(z_original)
    disc_logits_trans = discriminator(z_transformed)


    disc_loss_orig = bce_loss(tf.ones_like(disc_logits_orig), disc_logits_orig)
    disc_loss_trans = bce_loss(tf.zeros_like(disc_logits_trans), disc_logits_trans)

    discriminator_loss = disc_loss_orig + disc_loss_trans
    generator_loss = bce_loss(tf.ones_like(disc_logits_trans), disc_logits_trans)

  disc_gradients = disc_tape.gradient(discriminator_loss, discriminator.trainable_variables)
  discriminator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(disc_gradients, discriminator.trainable_variables))

  enc_gradients = enc_tape.gradient(generator_loss, encoder.trainable_variables)
  encoder_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(enc_gradients, encoder.trainable_variables))


  return discriminator_loss, generator_loss
```

Here, the discriminator attempts to distinguish between the representations produced from the original input, `x_original`, and its transformed version, `x_transformed`. Simultaneously, the encoder is trained to generate indistinguishable representations. The result is that the encoder’s latent space becomes increasingly insensitive to the specific transformation applied to the input.

Implementing these types of constraints often isn't a simple task; it requires careful consideration of what those constraints *really* mean within the context of your specific problem. It also requires some experimentation to determine the optimal weights for each loss or penalty term as this can greatly affect convergence. But, by understanding these methodologies—modified loss functions, specialized layers, and architecture-based constraints—we can steer our models towards more meaningful and reliable solutions. For a more comprehensive exploration, I’d recommend checking out “Deep Learning” by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville; specifically, chapters covering regularization and optimization. Also, papers on adversarial training and constraint satisfaction problems within machine learning, particularly in the context of physics-informed neural networks, can provide very helpful insights.
