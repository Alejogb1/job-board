AI is totally changing healthcare right now  it's helping doctors diagnose diseases faster and more accurately  imagine a system that can analyze medical images like x-rays and CT scans  that's what AI can do  and it's even helping develop new treatments and drugs  think machine learning algorithms  they can sift through massive datasets of patient information to identify patterns  this is a huge deal for drug discovery  and AI-powered chatbots are making healthcare more accessible  they can answer patient questions and provide basic medical advice  it's like having a virtual assistant that's always available  

Here's a quick example of how AI is used in medical imaging  

```python
# Load the image
image = load_image("patient_xray.jpg")

# Preprocess the image
processed_image = preprocess_image(image)

# Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the image
prediction = cnn_model.predict(processed_image)

# Print the predicted diagnosis
print(f"Predicted diagnosis: {prediction}")
```

This code snippet shows how a CNN can be used to classify medical images  it's a powerful tool for diagnosing diseases  the search term "convolutional neural network medical image classification" can help you learn more about it
