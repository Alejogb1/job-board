Hey so you're trying to train FP8 models without that fancy dynamic scaling stuff right  That's a cool challenge  It's definitely trickier than using dynamic scaling which basically acts like an automatic gain control for your activations keeping everything nicely behaved  Without it you gotta be way more careful about how you manage your gradients and activations to avoid overflow or underflow  It's like riding a bike without training wheels more exhilarating but also potentially more face-planting

The main problem is FP8's limited range  It only has 8 bits so you have a tiny space to represent numbers compared to FP16 or FP32  This means your activations and gradients can easily explode or vanish  Dynamic scaling helps prevent that by adjusting the scale on the fly  But if you're ditching that you need strategies to ensure stability

One approach is careful initialization  Instead of using the usual random initialization schemes you might want to use something more tailored to FP8's limited precision  Think about looking into papers on initialization techniques for low-precision training  There's probably some research on that especially in the context of quantization  Check out papers on weight initialization for quantized neural networks  There are probably some good recommendations there for how to initialize weights and biases in a way that prevents them from causing issues with a small precision space

Another key aspect is gradient scaling  You'll almost certainly need to scale your gradients down during backpropagation to prevent them from exceeding the FP8 range  This is often done using a fixed scaling factor  You need to carefully tune this factor it's a bit of a black art really  Too small and your gradients are too weak resulting in slow training too big and they overflow  You could explore different scaling methods maybe try a learning rate schedule which also adjusts the scale of the gradients dynamically but without the per-layer adjustment that dynamic scaling provides  

Also consider gradient clipping  This limits the magnitude of the gradients to a predefined maximum value  It's like putting a safety belt on your gradients to prevent them from going completely nuts  It's a common practice in training neural networks in general but even more important in low-precision training   You'll find plenty of mentions of gradient clipping in pretty much any deep learning textbook or any paper about training very deep networks for example  You can look at the standard deep learning books like Goodfellow's Deep Learning or even papers on training recurrent neural networks and you'll see gradient clipping techniques mentioned  Gradient clipping is really useful for avoiding explosive gradients

Another thing is activation scaling  You also have to consider scaling your activations  Similar to gradient scaling but this happens before the activation function gets applied  You could add another scaling factor here or explore different activation functions more tolerant of the limited precision like those designed for quantized networks  Searching for papers on quantized activation functions is a good starting point  A lot of research focuses on this aspect  There could be some interesting findings on how to design activation functions for FP8 specifically

Let's look at some code snippets to illustrate these ideas Remember these are simplified examples and might need adjustments depending on your specific model and framework


**Example 1 Gradient Scaling**

```python
import torch

# Assume you have your model and optimizer defined

def train_step(model, optimizer, inputs, targets, scale_factor):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets) #Your loss function
    loss.backward()
    for param in model.parameters():
        param.grad.data *= scale_factor #Scaling down the gradients 
    optimizer.step()
```

Here weâ€™re just scaling down the gradient by a constant factor  `scale_factor` You'd need to experiment to find a good value for this  This is a very basic way to implement gradient scaling  You can probably find much more sophisticated techniques

**Example 2 Gradient Clipping**

```python
import torch

#Assume model optimizer and inputs/targets are defined

def train_step(model, optimizer, inputs, targets, clip_value):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), clip_value) #Gradient clipping
    optimizer.step()
```

This uses PyTorch's built-in gradient clipping function to limit the L2 norm of the gradients to `clip_value`  Experiment with different clip values to find what works best for your model


**Example 3  Custom Activation Function (Illustrative)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ScaledReLU(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, scale_factor):
        super().__init__()
        self.scale_factor = scale_factor

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.clamp(x * self.scale_factor, min=0) #Scaling and ReLU

#In your model definition replace standard ReLU with ScaledReLU
model = nn.Sequential(
   nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
   ScaledReLU(scale_factor=0.5), #Example scale factor 
   nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
)
```

Here we're creating a custom activation function that scales the input before applying a ReLU  The `scale_factor` helps control the range of the activations  Note that this is very basic and a more sophisticated activation function might be needed to handle FP8's constraints more robustly  


Remember to experiment extensively with different scaling factors clip values activation functions and initialization schemes  There's no magic bullet  It's likely to involve a fair amount of trial and error  You might even need to combine several of these techniques for optimal results  Think of it as a puzzle you need to piece things together  

Also  look into literature on mixed-precision training  Even though you're sticking with FP8  insights from mixed-precision training (using FP16 and FP32 together) could be valuable in informing your strategies for FP8  They often use similar gradient scaling techniques and loss scaling techniques for managing numerical stability  Again those deep learning textbooks are a great source

Good luck and have fun  It's a challenging but rewarding project  Let me know if you have more questions  I'm always happy to chat about this stuff  It's a good learning experience even if you don't get perfect results right away  The process itself teaches you a lot about numerical stability in training deep learning models
