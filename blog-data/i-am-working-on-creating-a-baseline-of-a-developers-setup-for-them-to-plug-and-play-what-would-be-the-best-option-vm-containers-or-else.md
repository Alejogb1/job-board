alright, so you're aiming for that sweet spot of a 'plug and play' dev environment, huh? i get it. been there, done that, and got the t-shirt (multiple actually, they keep sending them at conferences, i have enough to start a small clothing business). seriously though, this is a common problem, and there's no single silver bullet, but let's break down your options: vm's, containers, and… 'else'. that 'else' is where things can get interesting, but let's start with what you've laid out.

virtual machines, the classic approach. i've been in the industry long enough to remember when these were the *only* viable way to do this sort of thing. back in '08, i was tasked with setting up dev environments for a team of 20, and we went full vmware esxi. the learning curve was steep, and let me tell you, the resources those things ate... it was like feeding a pack of very hungry wolves. we ended up with a server farm just for development machines, each one a full os with its own allocated ram and cpu. talk about overhead.

the upside, though, was isolation. complete separation of the dev environment from the host os. mess something up royally? no problem, just revert to a snapshot. this saved our collective bacon more times than i care to count. plus, you can tailor the environment to be *exactly* like production. if production was running windows server 2003 with a specific service pack, you could mirror it. this eliminated the "it works on my machine" issue (well, mostly).

but the downsides were real. vm's are heavy, man. they take time to boot, they chew through disk space, and they're not the easiest to distribute. trying to get 20 new devs up and running with pre-configured vm images took hours, sometimes even a full day, and that’s without mentioning network setup headaches. it was a logistical nightmare. plus, updating them, patching them… it became a project in itself. here's a snippet of what a vm provisioning script might have looked like back then, all in powershell:

```powershell
$vmName = "dev-vm-01"
$isoPath = "\\server\share\windows_server_2003.iso"
$vm = New-VM -Name $vmName -MemoryStartupBytes 2GB -NewVHDPath "C:\vms\$vmName.vhd" -NewVHDSizeBytes 40GB

New-VMDvdDrive -VMName $vmName -Path $isoPath

Start-VM $vmName
```

that's a simplified version, naturally. real-world scripts were much more complex. you can clearly see the file paths involved and general instructions on dealing with a .iso file.

then, along came containers. oh, containers. the promise of lightweight, portable, and reproducible environments was too good to pass up. i started experimenting with docker around 2014, and it was a revelation. gone were the days of full operating systems for each development environment. now, we were talking about sharing the host kernel, and just bundling the necessary dependencies and configurations.

initially, it was tricky. the learning curve of docker and its ecosystem wasn't trivial. understanding layers, images, and registries required some brainpower. and getting our older applications to work in containers? that took some refactoring, to be honest. but the benefits? massive. spin up a dev environment in seconds, not minutes or hours. share images easily. and significantly reduce resource consumption. here is a basic dockerfile example for you:

```dockerfile
from ubuntu:latest
run apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
workdir /app
copy requirements.txt .
run pip3 install -r requirements.txt
copy . .
cmd ["python3", "app.py"]
```

this is a common setup for python. it basically instructs docker on how to create a small image of your code with python 3 dependencies.

nowadays, i rarely use vm’s for local development. containers are just so much more efficient and versatile. and i've seen the container ecosystem mature, with tools like kubernetes for orchestration, making complex setups much easier to manage. but i still see value in vm’s when you need very low level specific system calls or custom kernel modules.

now, about the 'else'. this is where you get to the more bespoke solutions. one thing i've seen work well is a hybrid approach. you might have some containers for application development, but a lightweight vm for specific services or tools that are harder to containerize (like a really old legacy database). it's also common to see use of "cloud-based" development environments where everything is executed remotely using services like codespaces or gitpod (these are not containers or vm’s, but they use a mixture of the two under the hood).

another 'else' option is using virtual environments (like venv for python). these are incredibly useful for isolating project dependencies without using containers, particularly for simple setups. you keep your base operating system clean, and each project can have its own requirements. its kind of a low level containerization. its lightweight and great for isolating specific packages for your project. if you need to get a project up and running super fast, this is the perfect option, and avoids all the extra overhead that containers and vm's have.

```python
# example use of venv with python
python3 -m venv my_project
source my_project/bin/activate
pip3 install requests
# run your python code here
```

in this python example, we create a new virtual environment called my_project, activate it, install the 'requests' package, and that's it. now, any other python code you execute will have access to that dependency, and it won't interfere with any other python environments in your system.

so, which option is the *best*? it really depends. if you’re after extreme isolation and need to mirror production exactly, vm's *might* be the answer, but you will suffer with resource consumption and complexity. if you need quick, reproducible, and lightweight environments for most types of application development, containers are definitely the way to go. and if you have simple python projects, venv is a good choice. if you need extreme flexibility and want a bit of a mix of everything, then the cloud solutions might be the best option, it depends if you want to keep everything on your local machine, or not.

if you ask me for my personal preference, i would go for container-based solutions, they are the most efficient in the long run. but that’s not the whole picture. it’s like asking what's the best screwdriver; it depends on the screw. you'll probably end up using multiple solutions.

if you are interested to do a deep dive on this i would recommend books like "container security" by liz rice, or papers such as "an updated performance comparison of virtual machines and containers" for a more academic perspective.

to finish, and this is optional, a joke i heard once about containers... a container walks into a bar and says "i'll take whatever the host is having". ok, i know, my jokes need some improvement. but hope this helps with your dilemma! good luck!
