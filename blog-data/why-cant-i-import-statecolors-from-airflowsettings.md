Alright, let's unpack this. I remember dealing with this exact issue back when we were transitioning our Airflow setup to a more modular architecture. It's a head-scratcher until you understand the underlying design choices Airflow makes. The short answer is: `STATE_COLORS` isn't intended to be a direct import from `airflow.settings`. The `airflow.settings` module is primarily for configuring Airflow itself, not exposing runtime constants like task state colors. Think of it as a control panel for Airflow's engine, not its dashboard.

The problem here stems from how Airflow manages its internal structures and how configuration is handled versus how runtime values are made available. Attempting to import `STATE_COLORS` from `airflow.settings` directly implies a misunderstanding of that division of concerns. `airflow.settings` primarily deals with, as the name suggests, configuration parameters loaded from `airflow.cfg` and environment variables. These settings govern Airflow's overall behavior, including database connections, executor configurations, and web server settings. The visual aspects, like task state colors, are generated and managed elsewhere, specifically within the web server component or the UI. These are more like visual output rules rather than core settings.

Now, let's delve into *why* this is the case. `STATE_COLORS` and similar visual configurations are typically located within the Airflow webserver code. These elements are not meant to be constants available for direct manipulation in your DAGs or custom operators. Rather, they are part of the rendering logic that translates a task's state into a visual representation within the web UI. Making these constants directly importable would introduce unnecessary coupling between the core of Airflow and its UI presentation, which is usually not desirable in modular software design. Modifying these would typically involve customizing the UI or web server code, not importing static values. It also helps with upgrades. When the UI is revised in newer versions of Airflow, it means that the core application is not tightly coupled with how it is rendered, allowing flexibility with those changes.

To get access to the `STATE_COLORS` and other related UI elements, you need to approach it from within the context of a web-server customization. Airflow does provide mechanisms for extending the web server. This usually involves creating a custom Flask blueprint that extends the default web UI. If you wish to modify the colors, that’s where you would do it.

Let me give you some concrete examples of approaches rather than direct imports:

**Example 1: Accessing `STATE_COLORS` within Webserver Customization**

This is not something that is typically done, but I am giving you an example to illustrate how they are available in the webserver’s context. I would never do this in production, but for conceptual clarity, it helps.

```python
from flask import Blueprint, render_template

def create_custom_blueprint():
    custom_bp = Blueprint('custom_blueprint', __name__, template_folder='templates')

    @custom_bp.route('/custom_page')
    def custom_page():
        from airflow.www import utils as www_utils
        from airflow.utils.state import State
        # Accessing state colors via utils.
        state_colors = www_utils.get_state_color_mapping()
        # Convert to dictionary for easy access in jinja.
        state_colors_dict = {state.value: color for state, color in state_colors.items()}

        return render_template('custom_template.html', state_colors=state_colors_dict, State=State)
    return custom_bp
```

In this hypothetical example, we are creating a Flask blueprint which would be integrated with the Airflow webserver. The code accesses `state_colors` using `airflow.www.utils` functions. The `state_colors` are then converted to a dictionary, which is passed to a jinja template. This is, again, not something you would generally do. I use it to show you how these values are accessible within the webserver context. The crucial part here is importing `www.utils` from airflow, not `airflow.settings`.

**Example 2: Using `airflow.utils.state.State` Enum**

This is more of a common approach if you are working with states, since you wouldn't hardcode the string values.

```python
from airflow.utils.state import State

def analyze_task_state(task_instance):
    task_state = task_instance.current_state()

    if task_state == State.SUCCESS:
        print("Task was successful!")
    elif task_state == State.FAILED:
        print("Task failed.")
    elif task_state == State.RUNNING:
       print("Task is running.")
    else:
        print(f"Task in state: {task_state}")

    return task_state
```

Here, instead of trying to import color directly, we're working with the enumerated `State` values, which are available from `airflow.utils.state`. You'd use these states throughout your DAG, custom operators, sensors, etc. To retrieve task states, for example, you would access `task_instance.current_state()`, which would then allow you to use these enumerations.

**Example 3: How to Extend the Web UI (Concept)**

This is the approach if you wanted to modify how the UI looks. We're not diving into the exact implementation details here, but just the conceptual approach.

```python
# Example (Conceptual) - Webserver customization approach

from airflow.www import app as application
from airflow.www.extensions.init_appbuilder import init_appbuilder
from airflow.www.extensions.init_authmanager import init_authmanager
from flask import Flask

def create_custom_airflow_app():
    custom_app = Flask(__name__)

    custom_app.config.from_object(application.config)
    init_appbuilder(custom_app)
    init_authmanager(custom_app)

    from custom_views import custom_blueprint # Example blueprint
    custom_app.register_blueprint(custom_blueprint)

    return custom_app
```

This shows a high-level approach to create a custom Flask application, load the Airflow configuration, and then register a custom blueprint. In `custom_views.py` (not included for brevity) you’d extend Airflow's UI and potentially alter state colors there. This is complex, so if you do this, research the latest Airflow webserver extensibility. This approach lets you control the state colors and related UI elements, if you want full customisation.

**Resource Recommendations**

To understand Airflow’s internals and the division of concerns more deeply, I'd recommend the following resources:

1.  **The Official Apache Airflow Documentation:** Start with a thorough reading of the official Airflow documentation, especially the sections on architecture, configuration, and webserver extensions. This is your authoritative guide.

2. **"Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow" by Bas P. Geerdink:** This book is a practical guide on building data pipelines using Airflow. It provides good context on Airflow’s architecture and how different components interact.

3. **Source Code:** Explore Airflow's source code on GitHub. Specifically, look at the `airflow/settings.py` for core settings, and the `airflow/www` and `airflow/utils` directories for webserver and utilities components respectively. This helps illustrate the actual structure and intent.

In conclusion, you're not going to find `STATE_COLORS` directly available from `airflow.settings`. They are located and handled inside of the webserver code. It is part of the UI, not core engine settings. If your task is to use task states in your DAG, you will leverage `airflow.utils.state.State`. If you want to modify UI elements, that would involve webserver customization. I hope that clarifies why you can't import `STATE_COLORS` directly and provides you with a better idea of how to achieve what you want. Let me know if anything’s unclear.
