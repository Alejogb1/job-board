Alright, let’s tackle this. The need to access data from past Ethereum blocks is surprisingly common, and while it might seem straightforward on the surface, there are a few nuances to understand, particularly when you’re dealing with a live blockchain. I've personally bumped into this multiple times over the years, most notably when troubleshooting issues with smart contract migrations where we needed to audit states at specific points in the past. Let’s break down how to retrieve data by block number, and why it’s not as simple as just asking the current node.

At its core, accessing past block data revolves around interacting with an Ethereum node that has the necessary historical information. This generally means your node needs to have been running and syncing for a while (or it needs to be accessing a full archive node). The data you get back will be the raw block data, which needs further processing to extract exactly what you need - be it transaction data, state variables, or logs. The standard interfaces for this are through JSON-RPC calls, particularly the `eth_getBlockByNumber` method. This method is the backbone for retrieving a block by its number or by a specific tag, like 'latest' or 'pending'.

The first consideration when doing this is the kind of node you’re connecting to. If you're using a basic Ethereum client, like Geth or Nethermind, you might only have access to the most recent history, and this configuration is sometimes referred to as a "pruned" node. In such a case, your request for older blocks will likely fail. To retrieve historical data, you'll need either an archive node, which stores all historical data, or to use a service that provides access to historical state data. Archive nodes are substantially more resource intensive than their pruned counterparts and require significant storage.

Let's look at some examples in different programming languages.

**Example 1: Python (with Web3.py)**

```python
from web3 import Web3

# Replace with your Infura project ID or archive node endpoint
INFURA_URL = 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(INFURA_URL))

def get_block_data_by_number(block_number):
    try:
        block = w3.eth.get_block(block_number)
        if block:
          print(f"Block Hash: {block['hash'].hex()}")
          print(f"Block Timestamp: {block['timestamp']}")
          # For example, print each transaction hash in the block
          if block['transactions']:
             for tx_hash in block['transactions']:
              print(f"Transaction hash: {tx_hash.hex()}")
          else:
             print("No Transactions in this block.")
        else:
          print(f"Could not retrieve block: {block_number}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example use case, request for block number 100000
    block_number_to_fetch = 100000
    get_block_data_by_number(block_number_to_fetch)
```

In this python example using `web3.py`, the `w3.eth.get_block(block_number)` function retrieves the block object given its number. Pay attention to the error handling which is vital when dealing with network connections. We’re printing only basic properties, but the `block` dictionary contains much more information that you could extract. This illustrates retrieving block data directly and displaying the most pertinent information.

**Example 2: JavaScript (with ethers.js)**

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

// Replace with your Infura project ID or archive node endpoint
const INFURA_URL = 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID';
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(INFURA_URL);

async function getBlockDataByNumber(blockNumber) {
  try {
    const block = await provider.getBlock(blockNumber);
    if (block) {
        console.log(`Block Hash: ${block.hash}`);
        console.log(`Block Timestamp: ${block.timestamp}`);
        // Iterate through the transaction hashes if they exist
        if (block.transactions && block.transactions.length > 0) {
          block.transactions.forEach(txHash => {
            console.log(`Transaction Hash: ${txHash}`);
          });
        }
         else {
          console.log("No Transactions in this block.")
        }
    } else {
      console.log(`Could not retrieve block: ${blockNumber}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`An error occurred: ${error}`);
  }
}

async function main() {
  // Example use case: request for block number 100000
  const blockNumberToFetch = 100000;
  await getBlockDataByNumber(blockNumberToFetch);
}

main();
```

This JavaScript example, using `ethers.js`, showcases the asynchronous nature of these operations. As you can see, the retrieval of the block is an async operation and we need to `await` its completion. Again, it illustrates fetching basic block properties, including transaction hashes which are vital for more detailed analysis.

**Example 3: Go (with go-ethereum)**

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"math/big"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common"
)

func main() {

    // Replace with your Infura project ID or archive node endpoint
	client, err := ethclient.Dial("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	blockNumber := big.NewInt(100000) // block number
    block, err := client.BlockByNumber(context.Background(), blockNumber)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
    if block != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Block Hash: %v\n", block.Hash().Hex())
		fmt.Printf("Block Timestamp: %v\n", block.Time())
        // Print each transaction hash
        if len(block.Transactions()) > 0 {
          for _, tx := range block.Transactions(){
             fmt.Printf("Transaction Hash: %v\n", tx.Hash().Hex())
          }
        } else {
          fmt.Println("No Transactions in this block.")
        }

	} else {
		fmt.Printf("Could not retrieve block: %v\n", blockNumber)
    }
}

```

Here we see how to accomplish the same thing using Go and the official `go-ethereum` library. We use the `BlockByNumber` function to obtain block data and the handling of `big.Int` is a good illustration of working with Ethereum's integer representations. The error handling is also crucial, as it avoids potential crashes if the data is not available.

For deeper understanding of Ethereum’s data structures and interactions, I highly recommend reading through the official Ethereum documentation itself. This includes the yellow paper, which provides a detailed mathematical specification of the Ethereum protocol. Additionally, "Mastering Ethereum" by Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood is an excellent resource. For those seeking a more hands-on, technical deep-dive into web3, you can also consult the official documentation of `web3.py`, `ethers.js`, and `go-ethereum`, respectively. These will offer detailed usage patterns and best practices. The key takeaway is that accessing historical block data is feasible, but dependent on the type of Ethereum node you’re interacting with. Understanding your data retrieval requirements will guide you to choosing the right resources and code design patterns. Don't hesitate to experiment with these examples and adapt them for your own specific data extraction needs.
