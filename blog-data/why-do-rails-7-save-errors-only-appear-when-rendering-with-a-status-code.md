Alright, let's talk about Rails 7 save errors and their peculiar habit of only surfacing when you're rendering with a status code. It's a behavior I've definitely encountered – and frankly, tripped over – a few times in past projects, so I can speak to the practical realities of this. It's not magic, it's a nuanced interaction between how Rails handles validation errors and how it responds to different kinds of requests.

The crux of the matter lies in the difference between rendering a response with a status code and rendering a response without explicitly defining one. When you render a view without specifying a status code (e.g., simply `render :new`), Rails infers that everything is going swimmingly and defaults to a `200 OK` status. In such situations, Rails often hides the errors that occur during model validation (prior to save) – those errors are there in the object, of course, accessible through `model.errors`, but they are not actively presented in the response unless you explicitly extract and utilize them. It’s a bit like having a detailed error log quietly available, but not printed out in big letters unless specifically asked for.

However, when you explicitly set a status code, especially an error-related status like `422 Unprocessable Entity` or `400 Bad Request`, Rails alters its behavior. It implicitly assumes that if you’re sending a status code signifying an issue, you’ll also want to see the details of *why* that issue happened. Therefore, it will generally include those validation errors in the rendered output. This design choice serves a clear purpose: it provides immediate and actionable feedback to the client, often a browser, an API consumer, or even the frontend JavaScript consuming your JSON responses.

Let’s illustrate with some code examples. Imagine a simple Rails model called `User`, which includes a validation that the email must be unique:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
end
```

Now, consider a controller action that creates a new `User`. Here’s our first example of failing silently:

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    if @user.save
      redirect_to @user, notice: 'User was successfully created.'
    else
       render :new # Default 200 OK, error messages not explicitly handled
    end
  end

  private
  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
  end
end
```

If you send a `POST` request with a duplicate email, the user object *will* have validation errors (`@user.errors` will be populated), but they *won't* be presented in the rendered view unless you explicitly pull them out. You’ll get a 200 OK response and the errors will be subtly hidden, perhaps causing head-scratching moments if you are not carefully examining the object.

Here’s the second example, demonstrating the errors being exposed when we return a different status:

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
     @user = User.new(user_params)
     if @user.save
      redirect_to @user, notice: 'User was successfully created.'
     else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity # Explicit 422, error messages exposed
     end
  end

  private
  def user_params
     params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
  end
end
```

Now, with that `status: :unprocessable_entity`, when a duplicate email occurs, the error messages associated with `@user` will be passed to the view and, assuming you’re using form helpers like `form_with` or `form_for` (which typically check for these errors), these errors will be displayed back to the user. This change in status signals to Rails that something has gone wrong and that these detailed errors should be part of the response. This is what we expect from an api based backend as well. We need clear error codes and error messages to be consumable on the front end.

Finally, let's look at a third example, showing how to handle errors if you are doing an AJAX request and you are not using the rails provided form helper tags. In the case of an AJAX request, you most likely won’t be rendering a view, but sending back a json response. So here’s a way to do just that:

```ruby
# app/controllers/api/v1/users_controller.rb
class Api::V1::UsersController < ApplicationController
    def create
      @user = User.new(user_params)
      if @user.save
         render json: { user: @user }, status: :created
      else
        render json: { errors: @user.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity
      end
    end
  
    private
    def user_params
      params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
    end
 end
```

In this final example we see that we are handling the error by inspecting `user.errors` explicitly and we’re sending back a json object containing the error messages with the correct 422 status code. This allows a Javascript front end to consume these errors and handle them as needed. This method allows flexibility over the views handling the error messages, as it gives control to the programmer, rather than relying on the rails form helpers to pull out the error messages.

This behavior is a design choice, designed to facilitate both rapid development and graceful error handling. When you explicitly set a non-`200` status code, it indicates an exceptional situation. Rails responds by making sure that validation error information, which is generally the key to diagnosing and correcting the issue, is part of the response. This behavior aligns with the principle of providing helpful feedback to the requester, be it a user interacting with a browser or a remote application communicating with your Rails API.

If you want to dive deeper into this behavior, I’d recommend taking a look at the source code of ActionController::Metal and ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper, where you will find how Rails processes responses and errors. A deep dive into the Rails guides on form handling and error messages will also provide valuable context. Specifically, look for resources explaining the interplay between model validations, controller responses, and form helpers. It’s useful to also delve into the HTTP specifications surrounding response codes as they provide a great deal of context to why Rails chooses to handle errors like this. Finally, the book “Crafting Rails Applications” by José Valim offers some really insightful explanations of many Rails internal mechanisms, which is highly recommended for a deeper understanding.

It can be a bit perplexing when you first encounter it, but once you recognize the underlying logic, it becomes a powerful feature of the framework. I personally found it crucial in more complex applications, where errors that are silently suppressed during development would eventually become very hard to debug. Understanding how and why these errors only seem to appear with certain status codes can significantly speed up development and improve the user experience, which, in the end, is what we are all trying to achieve.
