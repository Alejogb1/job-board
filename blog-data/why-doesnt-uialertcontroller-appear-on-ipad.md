, let's address this. I've seen this one trip up even experienced developers, and it's often less about a bug and more about understanding the subtle nuances of how `UIAlertController` is designed to work on iPad versus iPhone. Let me frame it with a bit of history - I remember dealing with a particularly frustrating case involving a modal sequence a few years back. The app, initially designed for iPhones, was being ported to iPad. We tested everything on the simulator, looked fine. Then, during user acceptance testing, the alerts just vanished. They weren't being dismissed early, they simply weren't visible.

The core problem isn’t that `UIAlertController` *can’t* appear on iPad, it’s that its presentation is context-dependent. Specifically, it transitions to a popover style instead of the traditional full-screen modal presentation we're accustomed to on iPhones. On an iPad, an alert needs an anchor, a point in the view hierarchy from which to display. If you're not providing this anchor, the system doesn't know where to place the popover, and therefore, it doesn’t display it.

The critical property to understand here is `popoverPresentationController` which is available on the `UIAlertController` instance. It's nil when running on an iPhone, as alerts always appear modally. On an iPad, however, you need to set this up to define the anchor point. Without it, the `present(_:animated:completion:)` call will effectively be ignored, and you’ll see nothing.

Let's walk through some scenarios and code examples, because that's usually the best way to solidify this:

**Scenario 1: Basic Incorrect Presentation (no anchor)**

This is the most common scenario: assuming the alert will just appear like it does on an iPhone.

```swift
func showAlertWithoutAnchor() {
    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Test Alert", message: "This alert won't appear correctly on iPad.", preferredStyle: .alert)
    let okAction = UIAlertAction(title: "", style: .default, handler: nil)
    alertController.addAction(okAction)
    present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

If you execute this code on an iPad, nothing will appear. The `present(_:animated:completion:)` method is executed, but the system just ignores it due to the missing anchor.

**Scenario 2: Correct Presentation using a UIBarButtonItem**

Suppose you're triggering the alert from a `UIBarButtonItem`. This is a typical pattern and a good illustration of how to provide a suitable anchor.

```swift
func showAlertFromBarButtonItem(sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Alert From Button", message: "This alert is anchored to the bar button.", preferredStyle: .alert)
    let okAction = UIAlertAction(title: "", style: .default, handler: nil)
    alertController.addAction(okAction)

    if let popoverController = alertController.popoverPresentationController {
        popoverController.barButtonItem = sender
    }

    present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}

//In your UIViewController class, you'd typically call it like this for example
//let barButton = UIBarButtonItem(title: "Show Alert", style: .plain, target: self, action: #selector(showBarButtonAlert))

//and then the selector function
//@objc func showBarButtonAlert(sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
//    showAlertFromBarButtonItem(sender: sender)
//}
```

In this example, the `popoverPresentationController` is accessed and the `barButtonItem` property is set to the `UIBarButtonItem` that triggered the alert. This tells the system where to anchor the popover, making it appear correctly on iPad. If called from a UIButton instead, you must anchor on the view of that button instead.

**Scenario 3: Correct Presentation using a UIView (e.g. a button)**

Now, what if we trigger the alert from, say, a regular `UIButton` that's not in the toolbar? Here, we anchor to the button’s frame.

```swift
func showAlertFromView(sender: UIView) {
    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Alert From View", message: "This alert is anchored to the button view.", preferredStyle: .alert)
    let okAction = UIAlertAction(title: "", style: .default, handler: nil)
    alertController.addAction(okAction)

    if let popoverController = alertController.popoverPresentationController {
        popoverController.sourceView = sender
        popoverController.sourceRect = sender.bounds //The area to anchor to within the view itself, usually bounds
        popoverController.permittedArrowDirections = .any //Optional: you can configure the arrow direction here
    }

    present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
//In your UIViewController class, for example, inside of a IBAction:
//@IBAction func myButtonTapped(sender: UIButton) {
//   showAlertFromView(sender: sender)
//}
```

Here, instead of a `barButtonItem`, we set `sourceView` to the button (`sender`), and `sourceRect` to its bounds. `permittedArrowDirections` lets you control the popover arrow's direction. Note the `sourceRect` will usually be the `bounds` of your view.

These examples highlight the necessity of using `popoverPresentationController` correctly. The system doesn’t assume the anchor. You have to explicitly define it for an iPad.

To deepen your understanding, I highly recommend studying the documentation around `UIPopoverPresentationController` and the relevant sections in Apple's *View Controller Programming Guide for iOS*. Also, the *Effective Objective-C 2.0* by Matt Galloway contains very useful design pattern considerations that apply to this issue, specifically around the topic of view controllers and their presentation. The *iOS Animations by Tutorials* from Ray Wenderlich is also useful for the more visual parts of iPad layout and presentation considerations.

In summary, the reason an `UIAlertController` doesn't appear on iPad is usually because its presentation is handled via popovers, requiring an anchor point to be explicitly defined using `popoverPresentationController`. If you understand how to properly set either the `barButtonItem` or `sourceView`/`sourceRect`, you’ll overcome this hurdle. Remember this distinction, and you'll avoid this particular trap in your future iPad development.
