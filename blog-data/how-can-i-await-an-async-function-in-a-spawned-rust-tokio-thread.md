Okay, let’s tackle this. It's a common pitfall, and one I've certainly stumbled over myself a few times, particularly when initially embracing the asynchronous paradigm in Rust with tokio. The issue isn't with the concept itself, but rather how futures, and especially `async` functions, interact with the threading model. Let's break it down.

Essentially, when you spawn a thread using `tokio::spawn`, you’re creating a new execution context that *doesn't* inherently understand the asynchronous runtime within which your main program is running. An `async` function, at its core, returns a future. This future needs to be polled by an executor to actually make progress. When you directly call an `async` function within a spawned tokio thread and expect it to magically complete, you're often met with a future that’s simply…waiting. It's not being driven by an active tokio runtime. The spawned thread doesn’t have its own.

The solution centers around ensuring the future returned by your `async` function is executed within the correct context. Instead of directly awaiting within the spawned thread, we need to use a secondary tokio runtime, specifically tailored for that thread. I remember debugging a rather frustrating data pipeline a couple years ago. I'd made the mistake of throwing asynchronous operations directly into worker threads without understanding the need for a local executor, and the results were…less than ideal. Lots of hanging operations and a general feeling of inadequacy.

Now, the core of making this work effectively is using the `tokio::runtime::Runtime` struct. We’ll create a runtime within the scope of the spawned thread, then use `runtime.block_on()` to drive the future to completion. This effectively creates a localized executor specifically for that particular thread.

Let's illustrate this with some code examples:

**Example 1: The Incorrect Approach (and why it fails)**

```rust
use tokio::task;

async fn my_async_task() -> i32 {
    println!("Starting async task");
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    println!("Async task complete");
    42
}

fn main() {
    tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap().block_on(async {
        task::spawn(async {
            println!("Thread started");
            // This will NOT work as expected, the future will never resolve
            let result = my_async_task().await;
            println!("Result from thread: {}", result);
            println!("Thread finished");
        }).await.unwrap();

        println!("Main task done");
    });
}

```

If you run this, you'll notice the spawned thread gets stuck; `my_async_task` never completes within that thread's context. This is because there's no `tokio::runtime` managing the execution of that future within the spawned thread.

**Example 2: The Correct Approach using `block_on`**

```rust
use tokio::task;
use tokio::runtime::Runtime;


async fn my_async_task() -> i32 {
    println!("Starting async task");
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    println!("Async task complete");
    42
}


fn main() {
    tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap().block_on(async {
      task::spawn(move || {
            let rt = Runtime::new().unwrap();
            rt.block_on(async {
                println!("Thread started");
                let result = my_async_task().await;
                println!("Result from thread: {}", result);
                println!("Thread finished");

            });

        }).await.unwrap();

        println!("Main task done");
    });
}

```
Here, each spawned thread now has its own dedicated `tokio::runtime::Runtime` instantiated via `Runtime::new()`. This allows `my_async_task` to correctly complete within that thread’s context. I used to pass the root runtime, but creating one per thread leads to much cleaner behavior as you start building more complex applications.

**Example 3: A slightly more robust version utilizing a dedicated async block**
```rust
use tokio::task;
use tokio::runtime::Runtime;


async fn my_async_task() -> i32 {
    println!("Starting async task");
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    println!("Async task complete");
    42
}


async fn thread_task() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    println!("Thread started");
    let result = my_async_task().await;
    println!("Result from thread: {}", result);
    println!("Thread finished");
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap().block_on(async {
      task::spawn(move || {
            let rt = Runtime::new().unwrap();
            rt.block_on(thread_task()).unwrap();
        }).await.unwrap();

        println!("Main task done");
    });
}
```
This version introduces the helper `async fn thread_task()`.  This allows easier management of any potential errors and keeps the `block_on` method cleaner.  It emphasizes modularity when dealing with asynchronous tasks inside threads. I find it makes the code a bit easier to read when those thread tasks grow in complexity.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Thread Pools:** Be mindful of how many threads you're spawning. Excessive threads can negatively impact performance due to context switching overhead. In real-world applications, employing a well-configured thread pool, rather than spawning threads indiscriminately, is often the better approach.
*   **Error Handling:** Remember to handle any potential errors that might arise during the creation of the `Runtime` or execution of the async code within the thread. The examples above use `unwrap()` which is fine for demonstrating, but in production code, you’d use proper error handling (as shown in the third example).
*   **Resource Management:** Creating a runtime per thread might seem wasteful; However, in scenarios where there are a small and well-defined number of threads running independent async operations it is typically fine and easier to manage.

**Further Reading:**

For a deeper understanding, I'd recommend delving into these resources:

*   **"Programming Rust" by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora F.S. Tindall:** This provides a comprehensive understanding of Rust’s features, including async and concurrent programming, which will put this explanation in context with the broader language.
*   **The official tokio documentation:**  A must-read resource for anyone using tokio. It covers the nuances of the framework in depth and addresses the challenges and solutions to asynchronous tasks. The asynchronous section is particularly relevant to this discussion.
*   **"Concurrency in Programming Languages" by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten van Steen:** While not focused specifically on Rust, this textbook gives strong foundational knowledge about concurrency concepts that are vital when dealing with async operations. It will greatly help you understand *why* the local runtime is necessary.

In summary, awaiting an async function within a spawned tokio thread requires careful consideration of execution contexts. Remember to create a dedicated tokio runtime for each thread and to use `block_on()` to drive the future to completion. By understanding these principles, and diving deeper into the recommended resources, you'll be able to effectively harness the power of async concurrency within your Rust applications, avoiding many of the issues I ran into when I started. I hope this is helpful and provides some insight into best practices.
