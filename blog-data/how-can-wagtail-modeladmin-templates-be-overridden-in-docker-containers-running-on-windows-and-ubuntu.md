Alright, let’s delve into this. From experience, I can tell you that overriding Wagtail’s ModelAdmin templates within a dockerized setup, especially when juggling different host operating systems like Windows and Ubuntu, isn’t always straightforward. It usually stems from the way file paths are handled between the container and the host machine, which can become particularly fussy with volume mounting. I've personally spent a few frustrating evenings debugging this very issue, and it primarily boils down to understanding the interplay of how Docker, Wagtail, and your file system view interact.

The core challenge isn’t inherently within Wagtail's template mechanism itself, but rather about ensuring the Docker container has access to the custom templates and that Wagtail knows where to find them. When running a Docker container, especially with bind mounts (that’s what we typically use for development), paths inside the container might look slightly different from those on the host machine. This disparity can cause Wagtail to fail in finding the overridden templates. To navigate this, let's examine how we typically organize our project and how that interacts with Docker.

First, let's presume you have a Wagtail project setup similar to this structure:

```
my_wagtail_project/
├── my_app/
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── admin.py
│   └── templates/
│       └── wagtailadmin/
│           └── my_model/
│               ├── create.html
│               ├── edit.html
│               └── index.html
├── static/
├── media/
├── manage.py
├── requirements.txt
└── Dockerfile
```

Here, `my_app` is your Wagtail app, and within its `templates/wagtailadmin/my_model/` directory you've placed customized template files like `create.html`, `edit.html`, and `index.html` which are meant to override the default ModelAdmin views for a model named 'my_model'. Now, the key is how you've configured your Dockerfile and docker-compose setup.

Let’s dissect the core steps to ensure that template overriding works consistently across both Windows and Ubuntu host environments. It's about consistent pathing and explicitly mapping your template directories within the container.

**1. Explicit Volume Mounts in `docker-compose.yml`:**

The docker-compose file is our primary control over path mappings between the host and the container. Critically, we need to explicitly mount the `templates` directory of your app. Here's a snippet:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    volumes:
      - ./my_app:/app/my_app
      - ./static:/app/static
      - ./media:/app/media
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:14
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: youruser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: yourpassword
      POSTGRES_DB: yourdb

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

In this snippet, the relevant line is `- ./my_app:/app/my_app`. This mounts your application directory directly into the `/app/my_app` directory inside the container. This includes the templates folder. Because we have included the root directory of the my_app application, the `/app/my_app/templates` directory and all it's subdirectories and files will also be included.
**Important:** Ensure there isn't any confusion about user permissions within the container if you encounter issues; often default Docker users can have write access challenges and it is worth exploring how you're configuring user permissions within your docker container.

**2. Wagtail Settings Configuration (`settings.py`):**

Make absolutely certain you've included `my_app` within your `INSTALLED_APPS`. This tells Django to look for templates within this application's `templates/` directory.

```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'wagtail.contrib.forms',
    'wagtail.contrib.redirects',
    'wagtail.embeds',
    'wagtail.sites',
    'wagtail.users',
    'wagtail.snippets',
    'wagtail.documents',
    'wagtail.images',
    'wagtail.search',
    'wagtail.admin',
    'wagtail',
    'modelcluster',
    'taggit',
    'my_app', # Ensure this is included.
]
```

**3. Ensure the ModelAdmin is correctly registered**

Confirm you have correctly registered your ModelAdmin with Wagtail and have correctly defined the required models. Here's an example of how the `admin.py` file would look.

```python
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.options import ModelAdmin, modeladmin_register
from .models import MyModel

class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    model = MyModel
    menu_label = "My Models"
    menu_icon = "snippet"
    list_display = ("field1", "field2",)  # Replace with fields in your model
    list_filter = ("field1",)  # Replace with fields in your model
    search_fields = ("field1", "field2",) # Replace with fields in your model

modeladmin_register(MyModelAdmin)
```

**Code Examples:**

Let’s illustrate this with simplified code snippets.

**Snippet 1: Basic ModelAdmin in `admin.py`**

```python
# my_app/admin.py
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.options import ModelAdmin, modeladmin_register
from .models import MyModel

class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    model = MyModel
    menu_label = 'My Custom Model'
    menu_icon = 'form'
    add_to_settings_menu = False  # Adjust as needed

modeladmin_register(MyModelAdmin)
```
This snippet defines a minimal ModelAdmin for a model named `MyModel`. The critical part is that, without further settings, Wagtail will look for templates in the conventional `templates/wagtailadmin/mymodel` directory.

**Snippet 2: A simplified `create.html` override template**

```html
<!-- my_app/templates/wagtailadmin/mymodel/create.html -->
{% extends "wagtailadmin/pages/create.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Custom Create View</h1>
  {{ block.super }}
{% endblock content %}
```

This simple override template provides a quick check to see if your overrides are working. If you see ‘Custom Create View’ above the Wagtail create form, then the override is working.

**Snippet 3: Example of a `docker-compose.yml` configuration**
```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    volumes:
      - ./my_app:/app/my_app
      - ./static:/app/static
      - ./media:/app/media
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:14
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: youruser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: yourpassword
      POSTGRES_DB: yourdb

volumes:
  pgdata:
```
This docker-compose yaml configuration mounts the current directory's `my_app` folder into the `/app/my_app` folder within the container, thus ensuring template files are accessible.

**Troubleshooting Points:**

1.  **Cache Issues:** Wagtail template caching can sometimes cause issues with updates to templates not showing correctly. Clearing the cache and restarting the container might be needed after making changes. You could explore Wagtail’s cache settings if this is a consistent problem.
2.  **File Permissions:** Ensure that the user within your docker container has adequate permissions to access and read your files within `/app/my_app/templates`. If not, adjust the Dockerfile.
3.  **Typographical errors** Double-check all pathnames and spelling of directory names and files within your project. These kinds of errors are incredibly common and difficult to identify if not looked at closely.
4.  **Overriding Order:** Confirm the `templates` folder path is correct, and that there are no other template directory sources interfering with the correct override of the correct templates.

**Recommended Reading:**

For deeper understanding, I highly recommend reading the official Docker documentation on volume mounting as well as Django’s template loading documentation. Also, the Wagtail documentation on the ModelAdmin interface is crucial. For a more thorough understanding of Docker in development workflows, I'd suggest checking out "Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton. Finally, for a deeper dive into Django's templating system, "Two Scoops of Django 3.x" by Daniel Roy Greenfeld and Audrey Roy Greenfeld provides excellent insights. These resources collectively form a strong base for handling this and other similar deployment challenges.

In essence, the key to consistent and reliable template overriding across platforms lies in the meticulous configuration of Docker volumes, ensuring that the container always sees the application's template directory in the way that Wagtail expects. Avoid relying on implicit behaviour; explicitly define paths. My experiences with numerous Wagtail and Docker projects underscore the importance of these steps to prevent frustrating debugging sessions, which can often be avoided with careful setup and awareness of the underlying mechanics.
