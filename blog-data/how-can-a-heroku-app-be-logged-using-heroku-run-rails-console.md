Okay, let's talk about logging within the context of a Heroku application when interacting with `heroku run rails console`. This isn't always as straightforward as one might expect, and I’ve certainly had my share of troubleshooting sessions with this particular scenario back in my days working on several deployment pipelines. The challenge often stems from the nature of the `heroku run` command, particularly how it interacts with standard output streams and the way your Rails application handles logging under different execution environments.

The core issue is that `heroku run rails console` spawns a one-off dyno, essentially a fresh isolated environment, to execute your console session. This new environment might not behave identically to your web dynos where the actual application runs. Specifically, standard output and standard error streams that your application might use for logging aren't automatically aggregated and made visible in your Heroku logs in the same way they are in persistent dynos. When you're using standard `Rails.logger` methods, you're typically relying on the configured Rails logger to redirect output – and, often, these logs are set to a particular file or a dedicated logging service in production. But this configuration isn't necessarily in play when running a console command.

Here's a breakdown of the problems and practical solutions based on my experience:

First, let’s acknowledge that the standard output of your `rails console` session is indeed visible on your terminal where you're running the `heroku run` command. The issue arises when you try to use standard Rails logging methods *within* that console session and expect those log messages to appear in your general Heroku logs, viewable with `heroku logs --tail`. They won't.

**Problem 1: The Disconnect between Console Logs and Heroku's Log Aggregation:**

The logging infrastructure within your running web application and the detached console session are not directly coupled. The `Rails.logger` object in the console session often writes to `STDOUT` or perhaps to a development-specific file if you are in that environment, and these outputs are not typically sent to Heroku's log aggregator.

**Solution 1: Explicitly Directing Output to `STDOUT` in the Console:**

One straightforward approach, especially for debugging, is to make sure your logger within the console is explicitly using `STDOUT`. While this doesn't solve the issue of seeing those logs *later* via `heroku logs --tail`, it makes them visible in the terminal where you're running the console, which can be invaluable. In production environment configurations, you might need to modify your logger's configuration dynamically within the console session. This would look something like this:

```ruby
# Within heroku run rails console:

Rails.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT) # Direct the logger to standard out
Rails.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG # Set your desired logging level
Rails.logger.debug("This log message will be visible in the terminal.")

User.first # Perform some action
Rails.logger.info("User fetched.") # Log the result
```

This will display those log messages within your current console session on the terminal where you are running the command. This method has its limits, naturally. You are only able to view the output in your console, and it does not persist.

**Problem 2: Persisting Log Output From the Console Session:**

While seeing logs in your current terminal helps immediate troubleshooting, we often need persistent logs for later inspection. The problem with a one-off dyno is it's transient; the logs do not go to Heroku’s standard aggregated logging.

**Solution 2: Redirecting Logger output to Heroku’s Logplex:**

To get those logs into your Heroku log stream you need to make sure the output is directed to `STDOUT` and that the environment is configured to send it over. The easiest way to ensure output is sent to `STDOUT` is setting your environment variable for `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true`. In addition you might want to explicitly configure the logger. The example code is as follows:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb (or your appropriate environment file):
Rails.application.configure do
  if ENV['RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT'] == 'true'
    config.logger = ActiveSupport::Logger.new(STDOUT)
    config.logger.formatter = config.log_formatter
    config.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
  end
end

#Within heroku run rails console
Rails.logger.info("Now this log message should be visible using heroku logs --tail.")
#...perform some operation that also triggers log messages
```

When running `heroku run rails console` ensure you have `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true` within your environment. You can achieve that by setting it as part of the command, like so: `heroku run RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true rails console` or by using `heroku config:set RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true` to store the environment variable for all dynos and subsequent `heroku run` commands. Now, messages that would be logged by `Rails.logger` to standard output are captured by Heroku and sent to Logplex. You can then view them with `heroku logs --tail`.

**Problem 3: Ensuring consistent format and log level across all environments:**

The previous solution helps persist the console logs, but it is very likely that you'll still face logging format discrepancies between environments if you have specific formatters in place. The key here is to align your console logging to use a consistent formatter and log level that mirrors your production setup to ensure all your logs are written in the right format and level.

**Solution 3: Centralized logging configuration using an initializer:**

To further refine this and avoid scattering logic, I’ve found it best to put this configuration into an initializer file, ensuring your logging is standardized across all executions and consistent with your application’s main configuration. This also allows you to customize log formatting if needed:

```ruby
# config/initializers/logging.rb
if ENV['RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT'] == 'true'
  Rails.logger = ActiveSupport::Logger.new(STDOUT)
  Rails.logger.formatter = proc do |severity, datetime, progname, msg|
    "[#{datetime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%L %Z')}] #{severity}: #{msg}\n"
  end
  Rails.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG # or another level based on your needs.
end

#Within heroku run RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true rails console:
Rails.logger.info("Centralized logging initializer in action!")
```
With this initializer in place, your logging will be consistent whether you are running web dynos or a one-off console session. The key aspect to note is the use of `ENV['RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT']`, which allows for a flexible logging configuration. If that variable is not set, then your logger will most likely be writing to a log file, or whatever the default behavior your application has set.

It is good practice to review the excellent work of *Martin Fowler* and *Kent Beck* in "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" to ensure your changes in your logging system do not introduce subtle problems. Another excellent resource that will help you understand logging, its intricacies and design choices is the book “Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software” by *Michael T. Nygard*, it tackles best practices in software architecture.

In summary, debugging Heroku applications via console logging requires a good grasp of environment variables, the different execution contexts of dynos, and an awareness that console sessions do not automatically pipe their logs to Logplex. By explicitly routing your logger's output to standard out using environment variables and potentially configuring a consistent formatter through an initializer, you gain much better visibility into what's happening within your application, even during those one-off `heroku run` debugging sessions.
