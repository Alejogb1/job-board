Hey so you're looking for Ogilvy's AI copywriting workshop stuff right  That's a cool area  I haven't stumbled across a direct recording or official handout from a specific workshop labeled "AI Copywriting" by Ogilvy himself  The guy was a legend but remember this was before the current AI boom  His insights though super relevant even today  they translate really well to this new landscape

Think about it his whole thing was about understanding the consumer  creating compelling narratives  and crafting persuasive messages  AI just helps automate and scale those processes  It's not a replacement for the core Ogilvy principles its more like a supercharged tool

So instead of a specific workshop let's talk about where his wisdom intersects with modern AI copywriting  We can find the essence of his teachings in a few places and we can look at how we can use that in conjunction with AI tools

First off grab a copy of *Ogilvy on Advertising*  It's like the bible of advertising  Seriously go get it  He lays out his philosophy on research consumer understanding and creating resonant messages  All those principles form the foundation for effective AI copywriting too  You won't find AI specifically mentioned but the underlying principles are timeless

For example he stressed the importance of strong headlines  This translates directly to prompt engineering for AI tools  You feed the AI a great headline prompt and it helps you expand on that  It's not the AI coming up with the headline from scratch it's assisting you in crafting better copy faster

Here's a simple Python example using the `transformers` library to generate variations on a headline  You'd need to install it first  `pip install transformers`


```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')

headline = "New revolutionary gadget changes everything"

variations = generator(headline, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=3)

for variation in variations:
    print(variation['generated_text'])
```

This is super basic  You'd improve it by fine-tuning a model on advertising data maybe even Ogilvy's own work if you could find a digitized version  But the key is the headline  The AI is just a tool to expand and refine it following the Ogilvy approach


Second  Ogilvy was obsessed with data and research  He wanted to understand his audience  This perfectly aligns with using AI for copywriting  You can use AI tools to analyze audience sentiment  predict what kind of copy will resonate best and even A/B test different versions  It's not replacing human understanding its augmenting it  Making it faster and more efficient


Third his emphasis on storytelling is crucial  AI can help you create different story variations faster and more effectively than ever before  Ogilvy would approve of this efficiency


For this lets look at a simple example using a different approach  We can use some NLP techniques to analyze existing successful ads and try to identify patterns in the storytelling  You can try something like topic modeling  I don't wanna go deep into code but the idea would be to  collect a bunch of successful ads maybe use something like spaCy to preprocess them  then use Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA to find underlying topics and themes  This is helpful for understanding what kinds of stories resonate with your audience


Here's a conceptual outline not actual runnable code because this is more of a process  You'd need to integrate with libraries like spaCy and gensim

```python
#Conceptual Outline - Topic Modeling for Story Analysis

#1 Data Collection  Gather text from successful ads

#2 Preprocessing  Clean text using spaCy remove stop words stemming etc

#3 Topic Modeling  Use LDA from gensim to identify dominant topics in the ads

#4 Analysis  Interpret the identified topics to understand common narrative themes

```

You can find relevant info on NLP in books like *Speech and Language Processing* by Jurafsky and Martin  It's a classic text that will walk you through all the techniques I just mentioned  Gensim is a fantastic library for topic modeling check out its documentation


Finally  Ogilvy's emphasis on clarity and simplicity remains vital  AI can help you refine your copy  making it more concise and impactful  But you'll need to guide it  Its not about letting the AI write everything from scratch  It's about using AI to improve what you already have


To demonstrate this I'll show you a small example using some basic string manipulation techniques in Python to shorten a piece of text


```python
text = "This is a long and somewhat rambling sentence that could use some shortening to improve clarity and conciseness"

words = text.split()

shortened_text = " ".join(words[:7]) + "..." #Keep only the first 7 words

print(shortened_text)
```

This is basic but you can get more sophisticated  using techniques from natural language processing to identify less important words and remove them  or to rewrite sentences for better clarity


In summary  you won't find a specific Ogilvy AI copywriting workshop but his core principles remain completely relevant  Use his books and the resources I mentioned to get a handle on the fundamentals  then use AI tools to enhance your workflow not replace your thinking  It's a powerful combination remember  Ogilvy would have loved it if he could have seen it
