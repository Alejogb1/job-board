,  I’ve bumped into this exact scenario more times than I care to remember, usually when dealing with some complex relationship in our data models and wanting to leverage FactoryBot's convenience without bending over backward. You’re asking about passing a transient array to FactoryBot, and while it's not a feature explicitly spelled out in the documentation, there are definitely well-established patterns to accomplish this elegantly. The core idea lies in using transient attributes combined with either `after(:build)` or `after(:create)` hooks within your factory definitions.

The challenge arises because FactoryBot, by default, manages attribute assignments through an immutable hash. Direct array manipulation during factory creation just isn't designed into its core. However, transient attributes offer a workaround by allowing us to define variables that don’t directly correspond to database columns but are available within the factory's evaluation context.

Let’s break down the process with a couple of real-world examples, reflecting my experience building a system that had a user model and an associated list of skill objects. I remember having to seed our database for testing various scenarios where user skill sets varied dynamically and where factory creation needed to reflect those.

**Example 1: Passing an Array of Strings for Simple Attributes**

In my experience, the first and simplest use case arises when you want to assign a series of values from an array to a specific attribute during factory creation, assuming your model handles the assignment correctly. The model might iterate through the passed in list. This is where transient attributes come in handy. I’ll illustrate using a 'user' factory, where we pass in an array of string for skills.

```ruby
# model: user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_skills
  has_many :skills, through: :user_skills

  def assign_skills(skill_names)
    skill_names.each do |name|
      skill = Skill.find_or_create_by(name: name)
      user_skills.create(skill: skill)
    end
  end
end

# model: skill.rb
class Skill < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_skills
  has_many :users, through: :user_skills
end

# model: user_skill.rb
class UserSkill < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :user
    belongs_to :skill
end

# factory: user.rb
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :user do
    sequence(:email) { |n| "user#{n}@example.com" }
    username { "test_user" }

    transient do
      skill_names { [] } # Define the transient array
    end

    after(:create) do |user, evaluator|
      user.assign_skills(evaluator.skill_names)
    end
  end
end
```

In the above example, `skill_names` is our transient attribute. When you call the factory, like so:
```ruby
  create(:user, skill_names: ['Ruby', 'Rails', 'SQL'])
```

FactoryBot will create the user, pass the array of skills to the transient attribute, and then the `after(:create)` hook will be executed where we handle the logic to create the skills and the intermediary user_skills relationships.  Note that I’m using `after(:create)` since I need persistence to create associations. If you are just building an in-memory object, `after(:build)` would be sufficient.

**Example 2: Passing an Array of Attributes for Associated Models**

Often, the use case is more complex. Instead of merely assigning strings, you might want to pass an array of attribute hashes to create associated models. In our case, let's say the requirements shifted and now we needed the skills to have a proficiency level, and that level is passed when creating the skill. I encountered this as our system grew more complex and needed more detailed representation of user proficiencies.

```ruby
# model: user.rb (same as previous example)
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_skills
  has_many :skills, through: :user_skills

  def assign_skills_with_proficiency(skills_data)
    skills_data.each do |skill_data|
      skill = Skill.find_or_create_by(name: skill_data[:name])
      user_skills.create(skill: skill, proficiency: skill_data[:proficiency])
    end
  end
end


# model: skill.rb (same as previous example)
class Skill < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_skills
  has_many :users, through: :user_skills
end

# model: user_skill.rb
class UserSkill < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :skill
  attribute :proficiency, :string
end

# factory: user.rb (updated)
FactoryBot.define do
    factory :user do
      sequence(:email) { |n| "user#{n}@example.com" }
      username { "test_user" }
      transient do
        skills_data { [] } # Array of hashes
      end

      after(:create) do |user, evaluator|
        user.assign_skills_with_proficiency(evaluator.skills_data)
      end
    end
  end
```

Here, our transient attribute `skills_data` expects an array of hashes, and the `after(:create)` block processes those to create the associated records. Now, you create a user with skills like this:
```ruby
  create(:user, skills_data: [{ name: 'Ruby', proficiency: 'Expert' }, { name: 'Rails', proficiency: 'Intermediate' }])
```

This becomes powerful since you’re not restricted by FactoryBot's native handling of attributes. Instead, the transient attribute is just an intermediary that facilitates customization.

**Example 3: Passing an Array of Pre-existing Records**

Finally, sometimes you want to pass an array of pre-existing records. This can be especially useful when creating tests where dependencies have already been set up or you want to reuse existing data structures. Building on the previous example, I’ve used this frequently when there were pre-seeded data I wanted my tests to leverage, which reduces test setup overhead and helps in focusing tests to their intended scope. This is also essential when creating complex relationship graphs for testing.

```ruby
# model: user.rb (same as previous example)
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_skills
  has_many :skills, through: :user_skills

  def assign_skills_from_records(skill_records)
    skill_records.each do |skill|
      user_skills.create(skill: skill)
    end
  end
end


# model: skill.rb (same as previous example)
class Skill < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_skills
  has_many :users, through: :user_skills
end

# model: user_skill.rb (same as previous example)
class UserSkill < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :skill
end

# factory: user.rb (updated)
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :user do
    sequence(:email) { |n| "user#{n}@example.com" }
    username { "test_user" }

    transient do
      skill_records { [] } # Array of Skill records
    end

    after(:create) do |user, evaluator|
      user.assign_skills_from_records(evaluator.skill_records)
    end
  end
end
```
In this case, we pass pre-created skills to the transient `skill_records`. You'd then call it something like:

```ruby
  skills = create_list(:skill, 2) #creates 2 skills using the skill factory
  create(:user, skill_records: skills)
```
This will then use those two existing skills to create the intermediate user_skill records.

**Key Takeaways**

*   **Transient Attributes are your allies**: Use them for holding data that's not directly an attribute of your model.
*   **`after(:build)` and `after(:create)`**: Utilize these hooks to process your transient data after the factory creates (or builds) the model. Choose `after(:build)` if you only need to operate on in-memory object, use `after(:create)` when you need the model to be persisted.
*   **Flexibility is the point**: You are in charge of how the transient data is handled within these hooks. This enables complex customizations.
*   **Read the code**: The core FactoryBot documentation on transient attributes is your starting point, but always examine the factory-bot source code to get a deeper understanding of how it works.

For further information, I'd recommend reviewing "The RSpec Book" by David Chelimsky and Dave Astels. It offers excellent practical advice on testing methodologies that directly interact with FactoryBot’s design. Also, looking into the source code for FactoryBot itself on github, available in the repository of the same name. Understanding its internal structure will enhance how efficiently you use the tool. There's a lot of depth to it. The key is to think of factory bot as a tool that needs to be tailored to the specific need, rather than a magical blackbox that automates everything for you. Hopefully, these examples give you the insight and direction you need to properly utilize transient array with FactoryBot.
