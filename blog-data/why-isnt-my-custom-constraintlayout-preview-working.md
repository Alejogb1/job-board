,  It's a frustration I've encountered more times than I care to recall, particularly in the early days of ConstraintLayout. You’ve built what seems like a perfectly reasonable layout using a custom `ConstraintLayout`, and yet the preview is showing…nothing, or something completely unexpected. I've been there; spent hours staring at XML, convinced I was losing my mind, only to discover a seemingly minor detail was the culprit. The issue is rarely a single, universally applicable cause, but rather a confluence of factors, often centered around how you’ve wired up your custom view within the ConstraintLayout ecosystem.

Firstly, let’s talk about the core mechanism. `ConstraintLayout` relies heavily on its internal solver to resolve the positioning and sizing of its children based on the constraints you define. This solver needs accurate information about the views it's handling. When you introduce a custom view, the framework is essentially unaware of how this view should participate in the constraint calculations unless you provide explicit guidance. This guidance typically comes in the form of how you've overridden your custom view's `onMeasure` method and how you've defined attributes for use within the `ConstraintLayout`. If any of this is lacking, or incorrect, the preview (and sometimes runtime behavior) will predictably fall apart.

One common scenario, particularly when starting out with custom views and `ConstraintLayout`, is the absence of proper measurement specification. If your custom view doesn't correctly handle different measure specs (e.g., `MeasureSpec.AT_MOST`, `MeasureSpec.EXACTLY`, `MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED`), the layout solver may not be able to determine its dimensions, or worse, get incorrect size information. This can lead to a view collapsing to zero size or expanding inappropriately, rendering it effectively invisible. The preview in Android Studio attempts to simulate the layout behavior, and if it fails to measure the custom view, it won't be visible. Remember, the previewer relies on the same layout engine as runtime, so errors here are indicative of a broader underlying issue.

Secondly, let's consider how custom attributes are handled. You might have defined custom attributes intended to control the appearance of your custom view, which you’re trying to wire up through the `ConstraintLayout` in your XML. If those attributes are not correctly declared in your `attrs.xml` file and are not being retrieved and used properly within your custom view's code, the layout might fail to render as expected. Moreover, remember that these custom attributes need to be made available to the constraint layout solver to work. Missing styleable declarations or misreading the attribute values during instantiation will lead to problems with layout and can make debugging a frustrating task.

Finally, the way your custom view interacts with the constraint system is crucial. If your custom view has specific logic within it that doesn’t respect the constraints applied to it or if the view manipulates its own dimensions (after the initial layout pass) in a way that conflicts with these constraints, things will get unpredictable. The constraint engine relies on a single measure and layout pass to resolve the entire layout. Any modification by your view after this pass can easily cause layout inconsistencies. It's critical to ensure that your view behaves correctly during the initial measurement and layout phase.

Here are three snippets to demonstrate these points, using a hypothetical `CircularProgressBar` view as our custom view.

**Snippet 1: Correctly Handling `onMeasure`**

This example showcases a basic `onMeasure` implementation that handles different measure specs.

```java
import android.content.Context;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Paint;
import android.util.AttributeSet;
import android.view.View;
import android.view.View.MeasureSpec;

public class CircularProgressBar extends View {
    private Paint paint;

    public CircularProgressBar(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
        init();
    }

    private void init() {
        paint = new Paint();
        paint.setColor(0xFF00FF00); // Green
        paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE);
        paint.setStrokeWidth(10);
    }


    @Override
    protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
        int desiredSize = 100;
        int width = resolveSize(desiredSize, widthMeasureSpec);
        int height = resolveSize(desiredSize, heightMeasureSpec);
        setMeasuredDimension(width, height);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
        super.onDraw(canvas);
        float centerX = getWidth() / 2f;
        float centerY = getHeight() / 2f;
        float radius = Math.min(centerX, centerY) - paint.getStrokeWidth() /2f;
        canvas.drawCircle(centerX, centerY, radius, paint);
    }
}
```
Here, we are ensuring the view handles `MeasureSpec` properly, returning the `desiredSize` if the spec allows it or ensuring a valid dimension if not. This allows the `ConstraintLayout` to understand the view's size. Without this, the view wouldn't know how to size itself.

**Snippet 2: Using Custom Attributes Correctly**

Here, we show how to declare and use custom attributes.

*attrs.xml*
```xml
<resources>
   <declare-styleable name="CircularProgressBar">
        <attr name="progressColor" format="color"/>
   </declare-styleable>
</resources>
```

*CircularProgressBar.java*
```java
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.res.TypedArray;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Paint;
import android.util.AttributeSet;
import android.view.View;

public class CircularProgressBar extends View {
    private Paint paint;
    private int progressColor;

   public CircularProgressBar(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);

        TypedArray a = context.getTheme().obtainStyledAttributes(attrs,
                R.styleable.CircularProgressBar, 0, 0);
        try {
            progressColor = a.getColor(R.styleable.CircularProgressBar_progressColor, 0xFF00FF00);

        } finally {
            a.recycle();
        }
        init();
    }

    private void init() {
        paint = new Paint();
        paint.setColor(progressColor); // Set Color from attribute
        paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE);
        paint.setStrokeWidth(10);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
        int desiredSize = 100;
        int width = resolveSize(desiredSize, widthMeasureSpec);
        int height = resolveSize(desiredSize, heightMeasureSpec);
        setMeasuredDimension(width, height);
    }


    @Override
    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
        super.onDraw(canvas);
        float centerX = getWidth() / 2f;
        float centerY = getHeight() / 2f;
        float radius = Math.min(centerX, centerY) - paint.getStrokeWidth() / 2f;
        canvas.drawCircle(centerX, centerY, radius, paint);

    }

}
```

Here, the view now properly reads the `progressColor` custom attribute from XML, demonstrating that if you want the previewer to display a specific colour of your custom view, it needs to be present as a custom attribute.

**Snippet 3: Ensuring proper constraint behavior (avoiding post-layout modifications)**

This snippet highlights how to handle layout within `onDraw` without altering view dimensions post layout, which `ConstraintLayout` does not like.

```java
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.res.TypedArray;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Paint;
import android.util.AttributeSet;
import android.view.View;

public class CircularProgressBar extends View {
    private Paint paint;
    private int progressColor;
    private float progress = 0.5f;


   public CircularProgressBar(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);

        TypedArray a = context.getTheme().obtainStyledAttributes(attrs,
                R.styleable.CircularProgressBar, 0, 0);
        try {
            progressColor = a.getColor(R.styleable.CircularProgressBar_progressColor, 0xFF00FF00);

        } finally {
            a.recycle();
        }
        init();
    }

    private void init() {
        paint = new Paint();
        paint.setColor(progressColor); // Set Color from attribute
        paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE);
        paint.setStrokeWidth(10);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
        int desiredSize = 100;
        int width = resolveSize(desiredSize, widthMeasureSpec);
        int height = resolveSize(desiredSize, heightMeasureSpec);
        setMeasuredDimension(width, height);
    }


    @Override
    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
        super.onDraw(canvas);
        float centerX = getWidth() / 2f;
        float centerY = getHeight() / 2f;
        float radius = Math.min(centerX, centerY) - paint.getStrokeWidth() / 2f;


        canvas.drawArc(centerX-radius, centerY-radius, centerX +radius, centerY+radius, -90, 360 * progress, false, paint);
    }


    public void setProgress(float progress) {
         this.progress = progress;
         invalidate();
    }

}

```
Notice that the drawing of the arc in `onDraw` does not change the dimensions of the view, instead it just draws a fraction of the circle and will not affect layout. We would use `invalidate()` which will cause a redraw after a change. Avoid things like view resizing or additional layout calculations after `onMeasure` and `onLayout` as this would make the constraint system confused and result in display issues.

In summary, debugging these issues often comes down to a systematic approach. Double check the handling of measurement spec, custom attributes and ensure that there are no unexpected calculations that alter view dimensions after the initial layout phase within your custom views. For further reading, I recommend you consult the official Android documentation on creating custom views, specifically paying attention to `onMeasure` and `onDraw` lifecycles. Also, "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" offers a good, practical explanation of custom view development and can help you internalize these important concepts. "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch provides general tips on proper object lifecycle that can be indirectly beneficial. Remember, building good custom views is an iterative process, so persistence and methodical troubleshooting are key.
