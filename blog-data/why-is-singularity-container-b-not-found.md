Okay, let's tackle this. "Singularity container 'B' not found"—that's a classic error, and frankly, one I've seen more times than I care to remember over the years. It usually points to a few specific culprits, and based on my experience, let's break down why this might happen, along with some solutions I’ve used. It's rarely just a random hiccup.

The most common reason you’re facing this issue is, simply put, the container image isn’t where Singularity is looking for it. Singularity, unlike some other container solutions, doesn't have a central registry that it automatically pulls from unless explicitly instructed. Instead, it operates on the principle of a file-based system, primarily working with `.sif` (Singularity Image Format) files. Think of it like trying to run an executable – it needs to be in a directory, accessible, and have the correct permissions.

Several paths can lead to this outcome. First, there’s the matter of **the path**. If you're trying to execute a container named `B`, you likely specified it either as a direct file path (e.g., `/home/user/containers/B.sif`) or by just the name `B` and assuming that Singularity would be able to find it. If you specify only the name `B`, Singularity will search in the working directory where you execute the command. But if the `B.sif` isn't there, you'll get this error. Similarly, if you give an absolute or relative path to a file, and that file doesn’t exist or is mis-named, Singularity will tell you it's “not found.” A simple typo in the file path is an easy thing to miss, especially in late-night coding sessions. I've spent more hours than I want to recall on that one over the years.

The next common reason is related to the **container format and location**. Singularity can work with more than just `.sif` files but that's generally the recommended format for performance. If your container `B` exists in another format (like a Docker image or a sandbox directory, for example), you won't be able to use it directly with a basic `singularity run B` command. You might need to build it into a `.sif` file or use specific Singularity commands for different formats.

Another crucial point relates to **user permissions and mount points.** If your container is located on a storage volume or a network file system that you don’t have the proper read permissions for, Singularity will report that the container is not found. Even if the `.sif` file physically exists, your user account might not have the necessary access. Further, any mounts inside the container might also throw errors later, but the “not found” error is generally about the initial accessibility of the container image file. This, combined with user-level permission issues on the host itself, are a frequent source of this error.

Finally, and this is less common, there's always the possibility of a **corrupted container file**. Sometimes, during the image creation process or copying it over network, a `.sif` file can be corrupted, rendering it unusable. Singularity may then identify that file as being non-existent.

To show this, consider the following scenarios and code snippets that I have actually implemented in various projects:

**Scenario 1: Incorrect Path**

Assume the `B.sif` file is located in `/home/user/my_containers/`.

```bash
#Incorrect, assumes B.sif in working directory
singularity run B

#Correct: Provide the full path
singularity run /home/user/my_containers/B.sif
```

This example illustrates a basic pathing issue. I have seen this in HPC environment countless times, where users upload their images to a dedicated directory, but forget to use full paths when running commands.

**Scenario 2: Incorrect Format or Missing File**

Suppose you have a folder called `B` which contains the image's layers (i.e., a sandbox directory), or your file was incorrectly named, say `B.sif.tar`

```bash
#Incorrect: B is actually a directory, not the .sif file.
singularity run B

#Also incorrect: you might have missed the file type, or made a typo
singularity run B.sif.tar

#Correct: Create the sif from the sandbox
singularity build B.sif B
singularity run B.sif
```

This scenario shows how a different format or a typo will cause a 'not found' message. The resolution in these cases is usually creating the correct `.sif` file or correcting the typo.

**Scenario 3: Permissions Issues**

Assume the `B.sif` is in a location where the user running the `singularity` command has no permissions to read the file:

```bash
#This assumes that the B.sif file is in a directory not readable by current user
#Incorrect: This will likely cause a "not found" error if the user lacks access
singularity run /data/shared_containers/B.sif

#Correct: Ensure the user running singularity has read access
chmod +r /data/shared_containers/B.sif # or other path
singularity run /data/shared_containers/B.sif
```

This demonstrates how file permissions can block Singularity from accessing the container image.

**Recommendations for Further Learning**

To deepen your understanding, I highly recommend a couple of resources. First, the official Singularity documentation is an invaluable resource. It’s well-structured and provides comprehensive details about all aspects of Singularity, from basic usage to more advanced features. Look into the specific sections on the image format (.sif), how Singularity interacts with image locations, and the different ways to work with other container formats. It's a living document, so it's the best source for updates as well.

Secondly, for a good practical guide and theoretical background, I suggest reading “Containerizing Applications with Docker & Singularity” by Ken Finnigan. This book covers both Docker and Singularity, helping you understand the differences and overlaps, and has dedicated sections on managing images, permissions and security that will help you resolve these kind of issues effectively. I found the chapters on image management and permissions especially helpful. It might be a bit old (it covers the 2.x versions of Singularity), but the fundamental principles are the same for most part, and it does a wonderful job in explaining containerization concepts.

Finally, pay close attention to your user environment and working directory when running Singularity commands. A bit of careful examination of file paths, permissions, and using `ls -l` to confirm file locations can often save a significant amount of time. The “not found” error, while frustrating, is usually a straightforward one to resolve with systematic debugging and a bit of attention to detail.
