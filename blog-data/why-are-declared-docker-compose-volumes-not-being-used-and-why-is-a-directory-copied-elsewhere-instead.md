, let's unpack this. It's a situation I've encountered more times than I care to remember, often during those late nights chasing a ghost in a containerized setup. The issue where you declare a volume in your `docker-compose.yml` but your data seemingly gets copied to some other, unexpected location rather than using the volume is almost always down to one thing: the build process and its interplay with volume mounts. It's less of a docker problem itself, and more about the timing and how the docker build context is handled.

Specifically, what's happening is that during the `docker-compose up` process, particularly when you are also building images, the build context (the folder or files specified during `docker build .`) is being used first. If your dockerfile includes a `copy` instruction that is intended to populate the container with initial data, and this instruction precedes mounting the volume inside the container, then the build process essentially "wins" over your intended volume mapping, resulting in copied data rather than volume usage during the container run.

The problem arises because the docker build operation does not understand (nor should it) about volumes. It executes sequentially, according to the instructions within the `dockerfile`. Consequently, `copy` commands operate on the *build context*. When the container later starts up, any changes made to the mounted volume will not be reflected in the files that were populated by the copy command, because they reside elsewhere within the filesystem. You can think of it like this: the files exist twice – once in the copied location inside the container image, and then again, or potentially anew, on the mounted volume on your host machine.

This often leads to unexpected behavior, especially if the volume is also mapped to the build context: you might see data that looks like it is "there," but it's not the data on your host machine that you expected to interact with. That's because the container is presenting what was baked into the image during the build, rather than what's present in the volume you declared. It's a crucial distinction and a classic source of confusion.

To clarify, a declared docker-compose volume represents a storage location that can be mounted into one or more containers. It’s designed for persistent storage and data sharing. Volumes are created and managed separately from the container's filesystem. Conversely, the docker build process is concerned with generating a *static* image, based on the provided `dockerfile` instructions. Copying files is an essential part of that image creation. This fundamental difference explains the disconnect.

The solution, typically, involves understanding this order of operations. The simplest approach is to structure the `dockerfile` such that the `copy` instruction, if you need one at all, does *not* populate the same directory that your volume will be mounted to. Alternatively, if the content being "copied" is actually what you want on the volume, you can mount a volume at start-up, and the target directory (inside the container) would be populated with whatever is on the actual mapped directory. If the volume is initialized empty, it will not overwrite the content from your build operation. The order matters!

Let's look at some examples to clarify these points:

**Example 1: The Wrong Way (Data Copying Instead of Volume Usage)**

Here's a `dockerfile` that demonstrates the problem, along with a corresponding `docker-compose.yml`.

`Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
from ubuntu:latest

workdir /app

copy ./data /app

cmd ["sleep","infinity"]
```

`docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  my-app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ./my-data:/app
```

And let's assume we have a directory structure:

```
.
├── data
│   └── initial.txt
├── docker-compose.yml
└── Dockerfile
```

In this case, when `docker-compose up` is executed, the data folder's content, `initial.txt` file (present in the build context) is copied into the container's `/app` directory *during the build process*. Then, when the container starts up, a *new*, empty volume is mounted at the `/app` directory, *replacing* the data that was just copied from the build context. Therefore, `initial.txt` is not within the mounted volume and changes made within `/app` won't be seen by the data directory.

**Example 2: Correct Way (Volume Usage as Intended)**

Here's a refined `dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` illustrating the correct usage of volumes.

`Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
from ubuntu:latest

workdir /app

cmd ["sleep","infinity"]
```

`docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  my-app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ./my-data:/app
```

With this setup, during the build, no initial data is copied. When the container starts, the volume at `./my-data` is mounted to `/app`. Now any changes made to `./my-data` on the host will be reflected inside the container, and vice versa. The volume is now working as expected. If you already had data in `./my-data`, it would be present inside the container.

**Example 3: Initial Copy Then Volume Usage (Controlled Initial Data)**

In some cases, you might need initial data *and* you still want the volume to be active. Here is a method to accomplish that. We will use a second directory for initial copies. This example uses the same `docker-compose.yml` from example 2, but the `dockerfile` is modified:

`Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
from ubuntu:latest

workdir /app

copy ./initial-data /initial-data

cmd ["sh", "-c", "cp -r /initial-data/* /app && sleep infinity"]

```

This example shows how to copy data to a specific folder during the build process, then copy this initial data into the volume during the container start-up. In this scenario, the initial copy is done inside the container, then all the content will be copied to the volume. The initial data is copied to `/initial-data` at build time, and when the container starts, the `cp` command moves the initial files to `/app`, which now correctly interacts with the mounted volume. This gives you flexibility, and ensures a clean separation.
**Key Takeaways & Recommended Reading**

To recap: the core issue arises from the difference between image build steps and container runtime volume mounts. It's about the sequence of events and how the build context interacts with your intended data mappings. If you're populating a directory during the build process using `copy` which is then intended to be mounted as a volume, you'll often encounter this situation, resulting in copied, not mounted data.

For deeper dives into docker and docker compose, I'd highly recommend:

*   **"Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton:** This is an excellent book for understanding the fundamentals of Docker, its architecture, and its internal mechanisms. It's very comprehensive and provides a strong foundational understanding that will make these concepts clearer.
*   **The official Docker documentation:** Seriously, read through it. The official docs are very well-written and cover all the nuances of Docker compose and volumes in detail. Specifically, the sections on `docker build` and `docker-compose.yml` are vital.

Lastly, experimentation is key. I encourage you to try the examples above, or create simplified variations of them, and observe the results yourself. This hands-on approach will reinforce your understanding more than any explanation alone. Debugging these situations is easier with a good grasp of fundamental concepts, and a keen eye for the details of your Docker files and compose setups. I’ve certainly been there, it's all part of the process.
