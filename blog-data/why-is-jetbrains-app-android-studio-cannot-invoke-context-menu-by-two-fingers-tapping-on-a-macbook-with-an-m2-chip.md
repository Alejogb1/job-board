alright, 

so, you're hitting an issue with android studio on your macbook m2, specifically the context menu not popping up with a two-finger tap. that's… annoying, i get it. i've spent way too many hours debugging similar kinds of input weirdness myself, so let's unpack this.

from my experience, it's rarely a "one size fits all" explanation, but there are some usual suspects when it comes to touchpad input and java based applications, like android studio. sometimes it's the combination of the java virtual machine (jvm) and how it interacts with the os's input system, sometimes it's a configuration thing, and sometimes it's even a bug that hasn't been patched yet. believe me, i’ve been there with older versions of eclipse and swing apps back in the day; those were dark times for touchpad gestures, i tell you.

first off, let's start with the basics and rule out some simple things. is the two-finger tap working in other applications on your mac? like, say, in the finder or in a browser? if it's not working anywhere, then the issue is likely with your mac's touchpad settings. you can go to system settings > trackpad and double check if two-finger tap is enabled for secondary click. it may sound like a dumb thing to ask, but i can't even count the times i've missed the most trivial step and ended up losing half a day with something stupid, and then after that facepalming myself.

if two-finger tap *is* working everywhere else except android studio, then we're probably dealing with something specific to how android studio is handling input. since android studio is built on the intellij platform, which is java-based, there are some quirks you may run into.

now, let's go a bit more in deep. there’s this java system property called `awt.multiClickInterval` which is supposed to control the time interval for multiple click events. in some rare situations, this might cause issues with interpreting the two-finger tap as a multiple click instead of a right click or context menu event. this is a long shot, but i saw something related to this in an old bug report about swing apps. you can try to adjust it with the following code. (note that you can execute it in the "edit custom vm options" menu of your android studio installation):

```java
import java.awt.Toolkit;
import java.util.Properties;

public class MultiClickInterval {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = System.getProperties();
        String clickInterval = props.getProperty("awt.multiClickInterval");

        if (clickInterval != null) {
            System.out.println("Current awt.multiClickInterval: " + clickInterval);
        } else {
            System.out.println("awt.multiClickInterval property is not set.");
        }

        // Attempt to change the value, you may need to use the jvm property to set it.
        // this just prints the current value, if you use a jvm option like -Dawt.multiClickInterval=100 then it will change it.
        
        // props.setProperty("awt.multiClickInterval", "100");
        // System.out.println("Changed awt.multiClickInterval to 100");

         if (clickInterval != null) {
             System.out.println("New awt.multiClickInterval: " + System.getProperty("awt.multiClickInterval"));
         }
    }
}

```

this code snippet simply prints the property. you can use -dawt.multiClickInterval=100 as a jvm option in the aforementioned file to set it. try this and see if it makes any difference. i know it's a long shot, but sometimes those small tweaks can help. the default value is typically 300 (milliseconds).

another thing that sometimes affects input is the java version being used by the application. different java versions sometimes handle input differently, or they might have bugs related to native libraries. go to android studio preferences, search for "java" or "jre", and check what version is being used. if you can, try switching to a different java version if you have one installed. i remember one time i had a strange issue on a gui app where a specific button was completely unresponsive; turns out, that was just because i was using some pre-release jvm version and the ui framework had a compatibility problem with that jvm.

also, in my experience, some accessibility settings can sometimes interfere with input. have you played around with anything in the accessibility options of your mac? for example, sometimes mouse keys or other input manipulation features can sometimes prevent expected touchpad behavior.

let’s try another bit of code. this next code snippet will try to read the system properties related to mouse devices. it might give some information on what is being recognized by the jvm. this doesn’t change anything, just gives more insight.

```java

import java.awt.*;
import java.util.*;
public class MouseInfo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Properties systemProperties = System.getProperties();
        
        System.out.println("System Properties related to mice/input:");
        systemProperties.forEach((key, value) -> {
             if (key.toString().toLowerCase().contains("mouse")
                 || key.toString().toLowerCase().contains("input")
                || key.toString().toLowerCase().contains("touch")
              ){
                 System.out.println(key + ": " + value);
             }
         });

         GraphicsEnvironment ge = GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment();
         GraphicsDevice[] gs = ge.getScreenDevices();

        for(GraphicsDevice device : gs) {
            System.out.println("Device id: "+ device.getIDstring());
        }

         PointerInfo mouseInfo = MouseInfo.getPointerInfo();
        if (mouseInfo != null) {
            System.out.println("Pointer Location: " + mouseInfo.getLocation());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Could not obtain pointer information.");
        }


        // get mouse id.
        java.awt.MouseInfo info = java.awt.MouseInfo.getPointerInfo();
        if( info != null ) {
            GraphicsDevice device = info.getDevice();
            System.out.println("Device id (using java.awt.MouseInfo): "+ device.getIDstring());
        }

    }
}


```

this might provide information about the mouse devices recognized by java or show some unexpected values.

also, you didn’t mention if you tried restarting android studio or your mac, right? i know, it's the "did you turn it off and on again" advice, but sometimes it fixes weird stuff. also, sometimes a reinstall of android studio is needed. it clears out some cached settings and files that could cause these issues.

if it's a bug specific to the intellij platform, jetbrains usually releases updates that addresses these things. have you checked for any available updates to android studio? they often include fixes for input issues that people have reported. they do not always mention this in the changelog or release notes, sometimes it's a bit buried.

i’ve seen a similar issue once in a visual tool i wrote in java that used a custom mouse listener. it turned out that the `MouseListener` i implemented wasn’t correctly interpreting touch events. it worked fine with the regular mouse but not with the touchpad’s two-finger tap. this made me think you can also try to enable some “show touches” option of the mac os just to check if the two finger tap is being recognised at all in the system. if you don’t have this on, then it might be a hardware problem, but since you say it works everywhere else i doubt it, maybe you have a ghost in your machine.

let's see one more code, this time using swing to make sure the events are being caught correctly, this should give more insight into the event being sent, so if there is any weird interaction with the touchpad it should be caught by this.

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;
import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;

public class TouchpadTest extends JFrame {

    private JTextArea eventArea;

    public TouchpadTest() {
        setTitle("Touchpad Event Tester");
        setSize(400, 300);
        setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

        eventArea = new JTextArea();
        eventArea.setEditable(false);
        JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(eventArea);
        add(scrollPane, BorderLayout.CENTER);

        addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
                logEvent("Mouse Pressed: " + e.getButton() + ",  " + e.getClickCount() + " " + e.getModifiers() + " " + e.getX() + " " + e.getY() );
            }
        });

         addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) {
                 logEvent("Mouse Released: " + e.getButton() + ",  " + e.getClickCount()+ " " + e.getModifiers() + " " + e.getX() + " " + e.getY());
            }
        });
        
        
         addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
                 logEvent("Mouse Clicked: " + e.getButton() + ",  " + e.getClickCount() + " " + e.getModifiers() + " " + e.getX() + " " + e.getY());
            }
        });

        
        setVisible(true);
    }
    private void logEvent(String event) {
        eventArea.append(event + "\n");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(TouchpadTest::new);
    }
}

```

this simple swing app catches mouse events to see what is the correct event being triggered when doing the two finger tap. if you are getting a button 2 or 3 then it's correctly sending the right event. check the `modifiers` that is printed there, it should be equal to 16 or 17 depending on the modifier keys you are pressing, also try with shift and control. if it's getting a modifier like the control, then it may be triggering some other shortcut in the app, if it's not even triggering events then it's a low level driver problem, so you might have to update mac os or have a look at some system preferences.

as for resources, i would recommend reading the documentation on awt (abstract window toolkit) from oracle if you are inclined to go deep. look into the java swing documentation and look into input events. there's some documentation on multi-touch gestures that may also be useful. the book "core java" by cay s. horstmann is also a decent option that explains how the jvm works and touches on the awt and swing libraries. and of course, keep an eye on the jetbrains' bug tracker. you might find that someone else has already reported this issue, and maybe even a workaround or fix for it.

anyway, that’s what comes to mind after encountering similar problems in the past. it’s a process of elimination, and i’m sure you’ll crack it. now, if you’ll excuse me, i have to go back to dealing with some other strange bug. i swear, sometimes i feel like the universe is trying to tell me to take up pottery instead of coding, maybe i should... just kidding (or maybe not). good luck.
