Okay, let's dissect this. Field validation in Ruby, specifically after object creation, isn't a singular process. It's more about applying a set of techniques and choices tailored to the specific needs of your application and the lifecycle of your model objects. I've dealt with this countless times, from simple blog platforms to complex enterprise systems, and it’s never a one-size-fits-all. The crucial point is understanding *when* and *how* you want to validate that a field is present.

At its core, "presence" usually means a field isn't `nil` or, in the case of strings, that it's not an empty string or just whitespace. But it can get more nuanced. For instance, you might consider a zero value for an integer to be 'present,' or you might have a boolean where `false` is considered a legitimate value.

Ruby doesn't magically validate presence after creation on its own. This is usually an active step, implemented by you, or via some framework or library. Most commonly, you’ll encounter these validation mechanisms within the context of Rails models using Active Record, or a similar ORM layer. However, we're tackling a broader perspective than just ActiveRecord validations; think about pure Ruby objects, too.

The common methods to enforce field presence after creation involve a combination of explicit checks, custom validation methods, and utilizing the power of libraries when applicable. I'll walk you through a few approaches, showcasing them with some actual code. Remember, choosing the "best" approach always depends on the particular situation.

First, let's look at explicit checks. This is something I used often before frameworks came into the picture, particularly with non-database backed models, or when integrating with external services that don't always comply with our expected data format.

```ruby
class User
  attr_accessor :name, :email

  def initialize(name: nil, email: nil)
    @name = name
    @email = email
    validate_presence! # Validate immediately after initialization
  end

  def validate_presence!
    raise ArgumentError, "Name cannot be nil or empty" if @name.nil? || @name.strip.empty?
    raise ArgumentError, "Email cannot be nil or empty" if @email.nil? || @email.strip.empty?
  end
end

# Example
begin
  user = User.new(name: "  ", email: "test@example.com")
rescue ArgumentError => e
  puts "Error: #{e.message}" # => Error: Name cannot be nil or empty
end

user = User.new(name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com")
puts "User created with: name = #{user.name}, email = #{user.email}"
```

In the snippet above, the `validate_presence!` method is called during object initialization. This method explicitly checks if the `@name` and `@email` instance variables are `nil` or empty after stripping whitespace. It throws an `ArgumentError` if either of these conditions isn’t satisfied. I've seen this approach used in situations where you need immediate, early validation and don't want to wait till a save operation or later method call, such as when constructing objects from complex data structures, for instance, json parsing. It gives you instant feedback during object creation, which can simplify debugging.

Next, we often want to separate validation logic from the object’s primary logic. This is where a custom validation method can be useful, especially if you've got more intricate validation requirements. I've had projects where complex business rules would necessitate this separation. Here’s an example:

```ruby
class Product
  attr_accessor :title, :price, :sku

  def initialize(title: nil, price: nil, sku: nil)
    @title = title
    @price = price
    @sku = sku
  end

  def valid?
    validate_presence.empty?
  end

  def validate_presence
      errors = []
      errors << "Title cannot be blank" if @title.nil? || @title.strip.empty?
      errors << "Price must be a positive number" unless @price.is_a?(Numeric) && @price > 0
      errors << "SKU cannot be blank" if @sku.nil? || @sku.strip.empty?
      errors
  end

  def errors
    @errors ||= validate_presence
  end
end


# Example Usage:

product = Product.new(title: "Laptop", price: -10, sku: nil)
puts "Is Product Valid?: #{product.valid?}" # => Is Product Valid?: false
puts "Errors: #{product.errors}" # => Errors: ["Price must be a positive number", "SKU cannot be blank"]

product2 = Product.new(title: "Tablet", price: 200, sku: "TAB123")
puts "Is Product 2 Valid?: #{product2.valid?}" # => Is Product 2 Valid?: true
puts "Errors for Product 2: #{product2.errors}" #=> Errors for Product 2: []
```

In the `Product` class, a `validate_presence` method accumulates errors into an array if conditions aren't met. The `valid?` method simply checks if the error array is empty, providing a concise way to determine validity, and the `errors` method memoizes the validation results. I often found this to be the preferred pattern when having to pass a bunch of data via the constructor, where I do not want to raise exceptions directly there, because an object with invalid data may still be usable in a given context (for instance, a database import process, where we want to record each error). The object’s construction doesn’t raise errors, but we can always check for errors after the creation. This separates object creation from validation which can result in more manageable code.

Finally, when using Active Record within the Rails ecosystem, validations are often defined on the model itself. While the original question did not directly specify Rails, the prevalence of Active Record within ruby development makes it impossible to ignore it. This method makes handling data coming from HTTP requests, SQL databases or any form of data persistence more reliable. Here's a quick example of a Rails-like validation within a model context:

```ruby
# A model-like example (not actually a Rails model, but similar behavior)

class Order
  attr_accessor :order_number, :customer_id, :order_date, :total_amount

  include ActiveModel::Validations # mimic Rails behaviour

  validates :order_number, presence: true
  validates :customer_id, presence: true
  validates :order_date, presence: true
  validates :total_amount, presence: true, numericality: { greater_than: 0 }


  def initialize(order_number: nil, customer_id: nil, order_date: nil, total_amount: nil)
    @order_number = order_number
    @customer_id = customer_id
    @order_date = order_date
    @total_amount = total_amount
  end


  def save
    if valid?
      puts "Order saved successfully!" # Simulate saving to a database or service
      true
    else
      puts "Order validation failed, errors: #{errors.full_messages}"
      false
    end
  end
end


# Example:

order = Order.new(customer_id: 123, order_date: Date.today, total_amount: -10)
order.save # => Order validation failed, errors: ["Order number can't be blank", "Total amount must be greater than 0"]

order2 = Order.new(order_number: 'ORD-200', customer_id: 456, order_date: Date.today, total_amount: 120)
order2.save # => Order saved successfully!
```
In this example, I’ve used `ActiveModel::Validations` to mimic Rails-like model behavior. The `validates` method simplifies the validation rules, checking presence and even numerical constraints. This is commonly used when you want to keep validation logic declarative, where validations are specified as rules on properties, and you don't need to manually specify the validations in a dedicated method. In this context, `valid?` checks if all validations pass, providing a familiar API for folks used to Rails. Usually, in a Rails application you would not implement the validation logic inside `save`, but this example makes it more explicit for demonstration purposes.

For further in-depth understanding of validation within a Rails environment, check out the "Agile Web Development with Rails" book, it covers all of this in meticulous detail. If you’re interested in exploring more about general object-oriented programming patterns in ruby, including validation, then “Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer” by Sandi Metz is highly recommended. Furthermore, understanding ruby metaprogramming techniques can also enable a deeper level of customization to fit your needs, for which the “Metaprogramming Ruby” book by Paolo Perrotta is worth looking into.

In conclusion, validating field presence in Ruby post-creation hinges on your specific needs. You might prefer explicit checks, custom validation methods, or, when relevant, a framework like Active Record. The key is picking the strategy that best aligns with your application’s requirements and coding style, ensuring that your models represent clean, valid data.
