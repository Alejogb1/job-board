Alright, let's tackle this. I recall a rather complex project back in '18 where we were dealing with exactly this problem – fusing multi-level sequential models using flatten layers. It was a multi-modal analysis system for predicting user engagement based on both textual data (chat logs) and temporal behavioral patterns (user interaction sequences). This led me down quite the rabbit hole in terms of how to best combine these varying data representations.

The core challenge, as you’ve rightly pointed out, revolves around taking the output of multiple sequential models—which are inherently variable in dimensionality and structure—and effectively combining them before feeding the result into a downstream model (such as a classifier or a regression network). Each sequential model, whether it’s a recurrent neural network like an lstm or a convolutional layer with a 1d kernel, outputs a sequence of hidden states that are often temporally significant. Now, simply concatenating these variable-length outputs can cause issues, particularly during gradient propagation and can lead to an enormous parameter space in the combined model. That's where flatten layers come in handy.

Essentially, a flatten layer, in this context, acts as a dimensionality reduction tool that transforms the multi-dimensional output of a sequential layer (e.g., a batch of sequences where each sequence is a series of feature vectors) into a single, flat vector. It does this by effectively unraveling the tensor. For example, a tensor with the shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` would be transformed into `(batch_size, sequence_length * hidden_size)`. Now, while simple, the implications are huge. We are, by flattening the output of our sequences, removing any notion of sequence from the representation. This is critical because now we have vectors of consistent shape. The flattened representation is now compatible with dense layers, which are generally used in the model's decision-making stage.

This approach allows us to take the outputs of different types of sequential models, which might have varying sequence lengths and hidden dimensions, flatten them independently, and then concatenate these flattened vectors. The resulting combined vector can then be fed to a feedforward neural network, allowing us to perform various tasks, like prediction, classification, or even further processing to generate embeddings. The flattening itself doesn't do any learning per se, but it’s the key step to make the sequential outputs combinable.

Let me illustrate this with some code snippets using TensorFlow/Keras for clarity, which is the environment I have a lot of practical experience with:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Conv1D, Flatten, Dense, Concatenate
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Example 1: Combining LSTM and Conv1D
def build_model_example_1(input_text_shape, input_behavioral_shape, hidden_units_lstm, filters_conv, kernel_size_conv):
    # Textual Model
    text_input = Input(shape=input_text_shape, name='text_input')
    lstm_out = LSTM(hidden_units_lstm, return_sequences=False)(text_input)
    flattened_text = Flatten()(lstm_out)

    # Behavioral Model
    behavioral_input = Input(shape=input_behavioral_shape, name='behavioral_input')
    conv_out = Conv1D(filters=filters_conv, kernel_size=kernel_size_conv, activation='relu')(behavioral_input)
    flattened_behavior = Flatten()(conv_out)

    # Fusion Layer
    merged = Concatenate()([flattened_text, flattened_behavior])

    # Prediction Layer
    output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged) # Example classification

    model = Model(inputs=[text_input, behavioral_input], outputs=output)
    return model

# Example usage:
model1 = build_model_example_1(input_text_shape=(50, 128), input_behavioral_shape=(100, 64), hidden_units_lstm=100, filters_conv=64, kernel_size_conv=3)
model1.summary()
```

In this first example, I’m combining an LSTM that processes textual information with a 1D Convolutional layer analyzing behavioral sequences. Notice the `return_sequences=False` argument for the LSTM. This ensures we obtain a single vector representing the entire sequence and not the hidden states at each time step. Both outputs are then flattened before being concatenated and passed into a dense classification layer.

Now, let's consider a slightly more sophisticated example, where we use two different LSTMs with different sequence lengths:

```python
# Example 2: Combining two LSTMs with varying sequence lengths
def build_model_example_2(input_seq1_shape, input_seq2_shape, hidden_units_lstm1, hidden_units_lstm2):
    # LSTM Model 1
    seq1_input = Input(shape=input_seq1_shape, name='seq1_input')
    lstm1_out = LSTM(hidden_units_lstm1, return_sequences=False)(seq1_input)
    flattened_seq1 = Flatten()(lstm1_out)


    # LSTM Model 2
    seq2_input = Input(shape=input_seq2_shape, name='seq2_input')
    lstm2_out = LSTM(hidden_units_lstm2, return_sequences=False)(seq2_input)
    flattened_seq2 = Flatten()(lstm2_out)

    # Fusion Layer
    merged = Concatenate()([flattened_seq1, flattened_seq2])

    # Prediction Layer
    output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged) # Example multi-class classification

    model = Model(inputs=[seq1_input, seq2_input], outputs=output)
    return model

# Example usage:
model2 = build_model_example_2(input_seq1_shape=(30, 64), input_seq2_shape=(70, 32), hidden_units_lstm1=60, hidden_units_lstm2=40)
model2.summary()
```

Here, we have two LSTMs taking input sequences of different lengths. By flattening the respective outputs, we ensure we can concatenate them without issues. Again, notice how after the flatten, we have vectors of a specific size. That vector is what is input to our dense layers.

Lastly, here’s an example where we have multiple convolutional layers followed by flattening which could represent multi-channel data processing:

```python
# Example 3: Combining multiple Conv1D outputs
def build_model_example_3(input_shape, filters_conv1, kernel_size_conv1, filters_conv2, kernel_size_conv2):
    # Input Layer
    input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape, name='input')

    # Conv1D Layer 1
    conv1_out = Conv1D(filters=filters_conv1, kernel_size=kernel_size_conv1, activation='relu')(input_layer)

    # Conv1D Layer 2
    conv2_out = Conv1D(filters=filters_conv2, kernel_size=kernel_size_conv2, activation='relu')(conv1_out)

    # Flattening
    flattened_conv = Flatten()(conv2_out)

    # Prediction Layer
    output = Dense(5, activation='relu')(flattened_conv)

    model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output)
    return model

# Example usage:
model3 = build_model_example_3(input_shape=(150, 10), filters_conv1=32, kernel_size_conv1=5, filters_conv2=64, kernel_size_conv2=3)
model3.summary()

```

This example showcases how we can apply a series of convolutional layers. The important point here is that even though the sequential data is processed with multiple conv1d layers, we apply the flattening at the end to then create that fixed-size vector to move onto the dense layers.

It’s important to note that flattening, while effective for unifying dimensions, does lose all sequential information and can make the combined representation less sensitive to order. However, it is critical for fusing sequential outputs with fixed-length input layers. If the order information needs to be maintained, something such as attention mechanisms or additional recurrent layers might need to be introduced *after* this flattening fusion, to regain temporal awareness.

In practice, I've found that the best approach often involves experimenting with a combination of model architectures, tuning hyperparameters (like the number of hidden units, filters, and kernel sizes), and utilizing regularization techniques (like dropout) to prevent overfitting. It's never a one-size-fits-all solution, and the ideal approach depends on your data and objectives.

For further exploration, I highly recommend diving into "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. For a more detailed look into sequence modeling and lstms, papers like "Long short-term memory" by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber or "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" by Sutskever et al. will be invaluable. These materials provide the theoretical underpinnings and practical insights necessary to understand and effectively implement multi-level sequential model fusion.
