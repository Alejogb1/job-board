Alright, let’s tackle this. You’re encountering a fairly common frustration with Google Document AI, specifically its apparent reluctance to consistently return the stylistic nuances, such as font family, size, and other text formatting details. I’ve personally spent more than a few hours debugging similar situations across different projects, so I understand where you're coming from.

The crux of the issue lies in how Google Document AI (and most optical character recognition, or OCR, services, for that matter) is primarily optimized for *content extraction*, not precise stylistic replication. While Document AI *can* sometimes provide hints about text style, it's not its core function and, frankly, shouldn’t be relied on for robust styling information. Think of it as a highly effective reader, not a perfect photocopier.

Document AI’s primary workflow is to ingest image-based or PDF-based documents, detect the visual text elements, and convert these into machine-readable text strings, including their bounding box coordinates on the source image or page. This process is already complex, involving intricate image processing, sophisticated text detection algorithms, and contextual analysis. Trying to simultaneously extract style information robustly adds a considerable degree of complexity, especially considering the variations in fonts, rendering, and document quality we encounter in the real world.

The internal models are trained to prioritize accurate text transcription and spatial layout understanding, which are far more vital in most use cases. For example, think about automatically extracting data from invoices: it’s far more critical to correctly identify the invoice number and amount than whether the total is in Arial or Times New Roman. Font and style information, while potentially useful, are considered secondary.

Moreover, the level of available style information varies depending on the document input itself. For example, a digitally generated PDF often provides more stylistic details within its underlying structure than, say, a scan of a hand-written document or an old, low-resolution scan of a printed page. In the latter cases, the OCR engine might just not *see* enough clear data to deduce the formatting attributes.

Now, let’s talk about what you *can* get and how to work with it. Document AI does return `TextAnchor` objects, which contain offsets and `Page` details, allowing you to precisely locate extracted text on the original document image. This is where you need to focus your efforts if you need spatial/layout and approximate style information.

I've found that the most reliable approach is to use the positional information alongside the *raw* document image. Here is how one can achieve this in practice with the python client:

```python
from google.cloud import documentai_v1 as documentai

def extract_text_and_positions(project_id, location, processor_id, file_path):
    client = documentai.DocumentProcessorServiceClient()
    name = f"projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/processors/{processor_id}"

    with open(file_path, "rb") as image:
        image_content = image.read()

    document = client.process_document(
        request={
            "name": name,
            "document": {"content": image_content, "mime_type": "application/pdf"},
        }
    ).document

    extracted_data = []
    for page in document.pages:
        for block in page.blocks:
            for paragraph in block.paragraphs:
                for word in paragraph.words:
                    word_text = "".join([symbol.text for symbol in word.symbols])
                    vertices = [vertex for vertex in word.layout.bounding_poly.normalized_vertices]
                    extracted_data.append({
                        "text": word_text,
                        "vertices": vertices,
                        "page_number": page.page_number
                        })
    return extracted_data

# example call
# extracted_info = extract_text_and_positions("your-gcp-project", "us-central1", "your-processor-id", "path/to/your/document.pdf")
# print(extracted_info)

```

This snippet provides the extracted text of each word, along with its positional bounding box coordinates on the page. This becomes our raw data for any further analysis.

Next, we can use libraries like Pillow (PIL) in Python to access pixel-level data of the document image at those specific regions. By analyzing the RGB color values and spatial patterns at the word’s bounding box region, we can *approximate* style information like boldness, font color, and potentially even font family, if you implement a trained model. Here's a sample using Pillow:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
import io
import numpy as np

def analyze_word_style(document_path, extracted_data):
    image = Image.open(document_path)
    styles = []
    for item in extracted_data:
        vertices = item['vertices']
        page_number = item['page_number']

        if page_number != 1 :
            continue #PIL does not support multi-page processing so just work with first page.

        x_coords = [vertex.x * image.width for vertex in vertices]
        y_coords = [vertex.y * image.height for vertex in vertices]
        x_min, x_max = min(x_coords), max(x_coords)
        y_min, y_max = min(y_coords), max(y_coords)

        cropped_image = image.crop((x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max))
        
        # basic analysis. Can be vastly improved.
        average_color = np.array(cropped_image).mean(axis=(0, 1))

        #simplified is_bold approximation
        is_bold = np.std(np.array(cropped_image).mean(axis=2)) > 15

        styles.append(
            {
              "text":item["text"],
              "is_bold": is_bold,
              "average_color": average_color.tolist(),
            })
    return styles


# styles = analyze_word_style("path/to/your/document.pdf", extracted_info)
# print(styles)

```

This example is deliberately basic. For a robust solution, one would need to incorporate more sophisticated image analysis techniques and likely machine learning models to classify fonts effectively. Consider also that text skew, the source image's resolution, and the quality of the rendering of the text within the PDF/image will heavily impact how accurately the code is able to deduce the style of the text.

Finally, if you're working with a document that you *know* is a modern PDF, or an HTML document converted to a PDF, you have the option to extract the style information directly from the document’s *internal representation*. PDF libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber often expose text with their formatting attributes. Similarly, if your document is actually HTML, it's even simpler to parse with libraries like BeautifulSoup. Let's look at a basic example with pdfplumber:

```python
import pdfplumber

def extract_pdf_style(pdf_path):
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        all_data = []
        for page in pdf.pages:
            for char in page.chars:
                all_data.append({
                    "text": char['text'],
                    "fontname": char.get('fontname', "Unknown"),
                    "fontsize": char.get('size', "Unknown"),
                     })

    return all_data


# pdf_style = extract_pdf_style("path/to/your/document.pdf")
# print(pdf_style)
```

This snippet illustrates how you can retrieve the declared font name and size of characters directly from the PDF's metadata. This approach, if available, will be *far* more accurate than any analysis performed on a raster image.

In summary, Google Document AI, while incredibly powerful for content extraction, is not designed for perfect style replication. Instead, I’ve found it best to think of it as an excellent first step. The positional information it provides, combined with careful analysis of the raw image using libraries like Pillow, can enable you to *approximate* style details. Further, if you can access the *internal* document metadata (as with PDFs, often), that will likely yield far more accurate style details directly.

For further reading on this, I recommend looking into research papers on OCR error correction and enhancement techniques, especially those focusing on style preservation. Also, a comprehensive textbook on image processing techniques is useful, such as “Digital Image Processing” by Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods. Finally, exploring the source code for libraries like `pdfplumber` or `PyPDF2` will provide a deeper understanding of document parsing. Be prepared for the complexity of working with the inconsistencies of real world documents, but these methods, in my experience, are the most likely way to get usable style information.
