Okay, let's tackle this persistent layout issue—horizontal overlap in `UITableViewCell` items on iOS with Swift 5. It's a common frustration, and I've spent more than a few late nights tracking down the root causes. I remember one particular project, an e-commerce app, where the product descriptions kept bleeding into the price labels—absolute chaos. So, let me share what I've learned, breaking it down into manageable chunks with some practical examples.

The core issue typically stems from how `UITableViewCell` manages its content and how we, as developers, configure its layout. Cells are essentially view containers, and like any view, they operate within constraints and frame dimensions. When elements overlap, it's almost always due to a misconfiguration of these aspects. Think of it as a carefully orchestrated ballet; one wrong move, and everything is out of sync.

The first common culprit is neglecting to set proper constraints when using auto layout. If you're not pinning your subviews (labels, images, etc.) to the cell's content view or to each other with appropriate margins or spacing, they can easily overlap, especially when the cell needs to accommodate different text lengths or image sizes. If we fail to explicitly specify that the price label needs to be positioned *to the right of* and with some space *from* the product name label, they can quite literally pile on top of each other.

Here's a very simplified example in code to illustrate that point. Notice the absence of constraints.

```swift
import UIKit

class OverlappingCell: UITableViewCell {
    let productNameLabel = UILabel()
    let priceLabel = UILabel()

    override init(style: UITableViewCell.CellStyle, reuseIdentifier: String?) {
        super.init(style: style, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
        setupViews()
    }

    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }

    private func setupViews() {
        contentView.addSubview(productNameLabel)
        contentView.addSubview(priceLabel)

        // no constraints specified
        productNameLabel.text = "Long Product Name Goes Here"
        priceLabel.text = "$99.99"
    }
}

//Example usage in UITableViewController's cellForRowAt method:

//cell.productNameLabel.text = "Short Product Name"
//cell.priceLabel.text = "$10"
//return cell
```

In this rudimentary setup, both labels are added to the content view but without constraints; their positioning is essentially decided by their inherent size and the order they were added, resulting in the potential for overlap, especially with longer product names.

The second significant factor is the reliance on frame calculations without considering the cell's content view's actual size or its dynamically calculated height. Manually setting frames can become a nightmare to manage, particularly when dealing with dynamic content or variable cell heights. When the cell's content height changes, or device orientation affects width, those static frame calculations will not adjust, frequently resulting in overlapping content.

Let's examine an example of this, even a little more sophisticated than the first, but still flawed, using static frame sizes that will not respond to dynamic content changes.

```swift
import UIKit

class FrameBasedCell: UITableViewCell {
    let productNameLabel = UILabel()
    let priceLabel = UILabel()

    override init(style: UITableViewCell.CellStyle, reuseIdentifier: String?) {
        super.init(style: style, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
        setupViews()
    }

    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }

    private func setupViews() {
        contentView.addSubview(productNameLabel)
        contentView.addSubview(priceLabel)

        // Manually setting frames (bad approach)
        productNameLabel.frame = CGRect(x: 10, y: 10, width: 200, height: 20)
        priceLabel.frame = CGRect(x: 220, y: 10, width: 80, height: 20)
        productNameLabel.text = "A product description."
        priceLabel.text = "$50"
    }
}

//Example usage in UITableViewController's cellForRowAt method:

//cell.productNameLabel.text = "A Very Long and Unwieldy Product Name";
//return cell
```

Here, both labels have explicit frame dimensions. Even if there is no initial overlap, change the product name to a lengthier string, and that name label will absolutely overstep its boundaries and intrude into the space designated for the price label. This scenario is the core of most cell overlapping issues.

The solution, of course, lies in embracing auto layout and its power to handle these dynamic layout scenarios efficiently. Properly configured constraints dynamically adjust the positioning of views based on the cell's available space and the size of the content within those views. This gives the cells flexibility to deal with different text lengths, font changes, and device screen sizes, all while maintaining the visual integrity.

So, let’s look at a revised example that correctly applies auto layout with constraints:

```swift
import UIKit

class ConstraintBasedCell: UITableViewCell {
    let productNameLabel = UILabel()
    let priceLabel = UILabel()

    override init(style: UITableViewCell.CellStyle, reuseIdentifier: String?) {
        super.init(style: style, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
        setupViews()
    }

    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }

    private func setupViews() {
        contentView.addSubview(productNameLabel)
        contentView.addSubview(priceLabel)

        productNameLabel.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        priceLabel.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false

        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            productNameLabel.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: contentView.leadingAnchor, constant: 10),
            productNameLabel.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: contentView.topAnchor, constant: 10),
            productNameLabel.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: priceLabel.leadingAnchor, constant: -10),
            priceLabel.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: contentView.topAnchor, constant: 10),
            priceLabel.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: contentView.trailingAnchor, constant: -10)

        ])

          productNameLabel.numberOfLines = 0
           productNameLabel.text = "A product description."
           priceLabel.text = "$50"

    }

}

//Example usage in UITableViewController's cellForRowAt method:
//cell.productNameLabel.text = "A Very Long and Unwieldy Product Name";
//return cell
```

Here, we've disabled `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` because we’re taking over with the modern auto layout system. We've used `NSLayoutConstraint.activate` to define constraints. Note how the `productNameLabel` is constrained to the leading and top edges, but importantly, its *trailing* edge is tied to the *leading* edge of the `priceLabel`, preventing it from overlapping. The `priceLabel` is right-aligned to the cell’s trailing edge. We’ve also told the `productNameLabel` to accommodate a variable number of lines (`numberOfLines = 0`), so that it can grow vertically without breaking the overall layout.

Furthermore, if your cells are more complex, consider using a `UIStackView` to manage the layout of elements within a cell, especially for horizontally arranged components. Stack views handle the spacing and sizing efficiently, reducing the likelihood of overlap. Just remember to make sure the stack view itself is properly constrained to the cell's content view.

For a deep dive into auto layout, I highly recommend the "Auto Layout by Tutorials" series from Ray Wenderlich and Apple's own documentation on the subject. Also, "Programming iOS 16" by Matt Neuburg, although not solely focused on layout, provides a very solid foundational understanding of view hierarchy and rendering. These resources delve into the nuances of constraints and the underlying mechanisms, ultimately enabling you to handle complex layouts with relative ease and avoid those dreaded overlaps. The key here is embracing the dynamic nature of user interfaces and leveraging layout techniques designed to handle them efficiently.
