, let’s tackle this. It’s not uncommon to encounter situations where your meticulously crafted Rails AJAX request just refuses to display the results as expected. Been there, debugged that, and it’s rarely a single issue. More often, it's a confluence of small, interconnected problems. In my past life, I remember spending a particularly frustrating late night chasing this exact beast on a complex inventory management system we were building. Turns out, it wasn't a glamorous bug, but a series of overlooked details that, in combination, caused the AJAX response to seemingly vanish into thin air.

The first and most crucial aspect is to verify the integrity of the request itself. Are you actually sending the AJAX request? The most common culprit here is a faulty javascript selector, or a syntax error in your javascript. I have personally spent a considerable chunk of time debugging javascript errors in the developer console, so ensure this is the first place you check. Sometimes an error will prevent the ajax request from being triggered. I’d recommend opening the developer tools network tab in your browser. Look for the request and ensure that the ajax call has been made, the status is '200 ok', and the content-type header is set as either 'application/json', 'text/javascript', or 'text/html'.

Let's assume the network request is present and successful; that shifts the focus to what is happening server side. First, the corresponding Rails controller method needs to be correctly handling the AJAX request. A standard GET or POST request won’t cut it. You need to explicitly respond to the request with an appropriate format. The most common responses are either `respond_to :js`, `respond_to :json`, or `respond_to :html`. If the request is an ajax request via `remote: true` in rails, it expects a javascript response, so the default `respond_to :html` method in your controller will not suffice. I recommend using `respond_to` instead of rendering views directly in ajax calls, because they are cleaner and less verbose.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the correct controller structure with `respond_to :js`:

```ruby
# app/controllers/items_controller.rb
class ItemsController < ApplicationController
  def update_item
    @item = Item.find(params[:id])
    if @item.update(item_params)
      respond_to do |format|
        format.js { render 'update_item.js.erb' } # or format.json { render json: @item }
      end
    else
      respond_to do |format|
          format.js { render 'update_item_error.js.erb' }
      end
    end
  end

  private
  def item_params
      params.require(:item).permit(:name, :description)
  end
end
```

The corresponding javascript, usually in a `.js.erb` file should look like this:

```erb
// app/views/items/update_item.js.erb
$("#item-<%= @item.id %>").html("<%= j render @item %>");
```

This response searches the element with the ID `item-<%= @item.id %>` and replaces the inner HTML with the content of a partial view. This uses the `<%= j %>` helper in Rails to escape any special characters, which is critical for proper handling of data within javascript.

In the controller, if the action responds to json format, the response data might look something like this:

```ruby
# app/controllers/items_controller.rb
class ItemsController < ApplicationController
  def get_item_data
      @item = Item.find(params[:id])
    respond_to do |format|
        format.json { render json: @item }
    end
  end
end
```

Then in your javascript code, you would need to extract and work with the json response:

```javascript
// assets/javascripts/items.js
$(document).ready(function() {
    $('.item-fetch').on('click', function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
      $.ajax({
        url: $(this).attr('href'),
        dataType: 'json',
        success: function(data) {
          $('#item-details').html('Item Name: ' + data.name); // Example update
        },
        error: function(xhr, status, error) {
          console.error("Ajax request failed:", status, error);
        }
      });
    });
  });
```

This code snippet fetches the json data from the server, and updates the HTML of the `#item-details` element with the `item.name`. Note that the code also has an `error` function. This error function is very important, as it allows you to see errors that may occur during the ajax call, including but not limited to network issues or server errors.

Finally, a common mistake stems from incorrect HTML handling on the client-side. You might get a response containing the expected data, but fail to update the DOM properly. Always double check your javascript selectors to ensure you're targeting the correct element. I’ve lost hours staring at seemingly functional code, only to realize I was trying to modify an element that didn’t exist, or one that was dynamically rendered after page load. Ensure that your event listeners are correctly attached, using event delegation, to elements that may not be in the DOM during page load.

Here’s an example of how you might use event delegation to handle dynamically rendered elements:

```javascript
// assets/javascripts/items.js
$(document).on('click', '.dynamic-item-button', function() {
    $.ajax({
        url: $(this).data('url'),
        method: 'get',
        dataType: 'js',
        success: function(data) {
          console.log("ajax successful");
        },
        error: function(xhr, status, error) {
            console.error("Ajax request failed:", status, error);
          }
    })
})
```

This attaches a click handler to any element with the class `dynamic-item-button` inside the document, regardless of whether it existed on initial page load, which is a very common use case for Rails AJAX updates.

To fully understand the ins and outs of AJAX, I would recommend consulting "Ajax on Rails" by Scott Raymond for practical applications of AJAX in Rails and a deep dive on relevant javascript. For more in-depth knowledge about javascript event handling and selectors, I strongly recommend Douglas Crockford's "JavaScript: The Good Parts" and "Eloquent Javascript" by Marijn Haverbeke. These are not quick reads, but invaluable resources for developers that often encounter these problems. And of course, the official Ruby on Rails documentation is crucial. Finally, take advantage of the Chrome/Firefox developer tools, specifically their network tab and javascript console, and you will be able to identify the root of the issue.

In summary, issues with Rails AJAX not displaying the results are almost always caused by one or a combination of these points: issues with the ajax request, improperly formatted server responses, or incorrect DOM manipulation within the client-side javascript. Thoroughly debugging these aspects systematically will guide you to the cause of the problem. This approach, informed by a few past late-night debugging sessions, has proven useful to resolve these types of situations in my experience.
