let's get into it. it's a question i've definitely pondered over, especially after a few late nights debugging some model i was building from scratch. i think i understand what you're getting at with why pytorch tensors don't have methods that are part of the `nn.module` class and it does come down to a pretty fundamental architectural decision in pytorch. it's not just a quirk, there are some solid reasons behind this.

the core thing to understand here is the separation of concerns in pytorch. the `torch.tensor` class is all about data storage and manipulation. think of it as your raw numerical data in a fancy, multidimensional array. it's got methods for reshaping, transposing, basic arithmetic, and some other low-level operations. a tensor just holds numbers, it doesnt inherently know anything about neural networks or gradients. it's a fundamental building block.

on the other hand, `nn.module` is the base class for any layer, operation, or an entire neural network. it’s all about managing the trainable parameters – the weights and biases. these parameters, which are themselves stored as tensors, are what the learning process modifies through gradient descent and backpropagation. the `nn.module` class keeps track of these tensors that have `requires_grad=true`. it's not that `nn.module` is manipulating the data, it is more like a structure managing the parameters that affect the data during the computation. it handles the entire computation graph construction, and the backpropagation to update these parameters. `nn.modules` methods are forward operations and are not the fundamental operations themselves which is a job for tensors.

when you think about it that way, it's clear that these two are designed for different purposes. if a tensor had methods to do forward passes like linear or convolutions, it would need to track a parameter tensor, construct a computation graph, and all those things, which is definitely not the job of the raw data storage. a tensor should be low-level, fast, and only manage data. `nn.module` methods are about making models and doing training and computation in them.

the design choice allows pytorch to be flexible and extensible. imagine if every tensor could act as a neural network layer. it would become very hard to add new modules or combine them in complex ways. instead, by keeping the tensor a simple data container, the developers provide a lot of freedom to build neural networks without making the tensor class bloated with unnecessary operations. you build `nn.modules` on top of tensors.

here's a simple way to illustrate this. i remember once building a basic multi-layer perceptron, from scratch, just as a way to really get my hands dirty. the forward pass looked something like this:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MLP, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

# example usage
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
model = MLP(10, 5, 2)
output = model(input_data)
print(output)

```

here, the `linear`, and `relu` are `nn.modules`. we are not using any tensor operations at all, directly. the tensors are there under the hood, doing the mathematical operations inside the modules. the forward method in the `mlp` itself uses these modules as building blocks to construct the operations that act on the data. the data is represented by a tensor `x`. and we use the model `forward` method that makes use of the `nn.module` methods.

another good illustration would be if we are using convolutions:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x

# example usage
input_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32) # 1 batch, 3 channels, 32x32
model = SimpleCNN(3, 16)
output = model(input_image)
print(output.shape) # torch.size([1, 16, 32, 32])
```

here again we are using `nn.modules` to build a convolutional layer and an activation. again not using any tensor methods to do these tasks, instead these methods are encapsulated in the forward pass of the `nn.modules`.

i had an interesting case when i was debugging a custom transformer module, i was using a custom linear layer and i made a mistake, i was trying to directly operate on the tensors and i kept getting a weird result, that didn't have the gradients attached and it took me a while to realize i had to encapsulate those into `nn.module` and after that, all the problems got solved. it highlights the separation between the operations and the parameters.

to make this even clearer, take a look at how a simple tensor operation is different from `nn.module`:

```python
import torch

# tensor operations
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y.sum()
z.backward()
print(x.grad)

# equivalent nn.module operation
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiplyByTwo(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.multiplier = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(2.0))

    def forward(self, x):
        return x * self.multiplier

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
m = MultiplyByTwo()
y = m(x)
z = y.sum()
z.backward()
print(x.grad)
print(m.multiplier.grad)
```

see the difference? in the first snippet, we use a simple multiplication on a tensor. we use the `requires_grad=true` to make sure the operation is tracked for gradient calculation. whereas, in the second example we used an `nn.module` to do a multiplication, and the multiplier is a parameter of the module. in the first one we don't have a 'parameter' and we operate on the tensor directly.

in the second one, we see that the gradients are calculated both for `x` and for the `multiplier` parameter. the fundamental difference is that `nn.module` keeps track of the gradients for its parameters.

if you are interested to go deeper into these kinds of things, there are tons of papers and good books. for a broad understanding of deep learning, i'd recommend the "deep learning" book by goodfellow et al., and for a specific understanding of pytorch, you can delve into the official documentation and tutorials. there are several articles in research sites, such as arxiv and paperswithcode. and by reading the source code of pytorch you can learn a great deal. by doing this you'll be able to understand how pytorch works from the ground up and it will help you design your own modules and operations.

there are also some interesting implications of this architectural choice, like in distributed training, you can have multiple devices training the model, because the tensors operations are done in each device on their own without having to know about the module itself. each device operates on the data locally, and the gradients are handled later during the backpropagation. this is why pytorch is efficient and scalable. i remember one time i was doing distributed training on a project, and i was so confused as to how the gradients were getting updated correctly on multiple devices, i had to actually read some research papers to figure out the process and how it is all connected.

the separation also allows for more optimized tensor operations because the library developers can focus on making these low-level operations fast and efficient for tensors. instead of doing both low-level optimizations and managing parameters. one time, i was optimizing a custom loss function, and i was trying to use `nn.module` methods for the tensor operations, that was a bad choice, and i had to redo everything because i was wasting my time doing something that already exists and that is way more efficient in pytorch itself.

it might seem a bit confusing at first, especially when you're transitioning from other libraries that might blur these lines but pytorch's design keeps things clean and allows for a lot of customization and flexibility, with very clear responsibilities. it does take a while to learn these nuances but once you get them things will get way easier.

and as a programmer my self, i always say, that the best way to learn is through coding it yourself, by making your own mistakes, and it doesn't matter how many good books or papers you read, nothing will replace that hands on experience, so keep coding, and you'll get it sooner rather than later.
