Yeah, scaling inference on CPUs is a bit tricky. You're basically limited by the number of cores and the speed of your machine. For smaller models, you can usually get away with just a single core, but for larger models, you'll need to distribute the workload across multiple cores. 

One way to do this is using threading, which allows you to run multiple threads of code concurrently on different cores. You can use a library like `multiprocessing` in Python to achieve this. Here's a simple example:

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def process_data(data):
  # Your inference logic here
  # ...
  return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
  data = [data_1, data_2, ...]
  with Pool(processes=4) as pool:
    results = pool.map(process_data, data)
```

This code creates a pool of 4 worker processes and maps the `process_data` function to your data, distributing the workload across the cores.

Another option is using batching, where you group your data into batches and process each batch independently. This can help improve performance by taking advantage of vectorization and other optimizations that can be applied to larger sets of data. 

For really large models, you might need to consider using GPUs. They offer significantly more compute power than CPUs and are well-suited for deep learning workloads. You can find a lot of resources on using GPUs for inference by searching for "GPU inference" or "TensorFlow GPU inference."
