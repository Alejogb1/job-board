,  I recall wrestling with cross-origin frame access issues back in my early days managing a web application that integrated content from various partner sites. It’s a frustrating, but ultimately necessary, security feature of modern browsers. Essentially, what you're experiencing is the browser's same-origin policy at work.

The same-origin policy is a cornerstone of web security, preventing malicious scripts from one website from accessing sensitive data or manipulating the content of another website. This applies to frames (iframes) just as much as it does to direct network requests. A 'cross-origin' frame, in simple terms, is an iframe where the page loaded inside it has a different origin (protocol, domain, or port) than the page hosting the iframe.

The "why" is straightforward: imagine if a malicious website could embed your banking page in an iframe, and then use javascript to read your account details or manipulate transactions. The same-origin policy exists to prevent exactly this scenario. So, when your browser detects that a script within your page is attempting to access content from an iframe that has a different origin, it blocks that access by throwing a security exception. You might see errors like "blocked a frame with origin '...' from accessing a cross-origin frame" in your browser's console.

How can this be resolved? Well, there isn't a single magic bullet. The solution depends heavily on the specific situation and control you have over the cross-origin frame's content. I'll go through the main options I've used in the past, along with example code.

First, the most preferred and secure solution is using postMessage for communication. This is ideal if you control both the parent window and the iframe. postMessage provides a controlled, secure mechanism for exchanging data between windows with different origins. The mechanism involves sending messages between the two frames and setting up event listeners to handle the received messages.

Here’s a sample snippet for the parent window:

```javascript
// parent.html
const iframe = document.getElementById('myIframe');
iframe.onload = function() {
  iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({type: 'init', message: 'Hello from the parent!'}, 'https://example.com');
};


window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
    if (event.origin !== 'https://example.com') return;

    if(event.data.type === 'response'){
      console.log('Parent Received:', event.data.message);
    }
});

```

And here's the corresponding code for the iframe content:

```javascript
// iframe.html (loaded from https://example.com)
window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
    if (event.origin !== 'https://yourdomain.com') return;

    if(event.data.type === 'init'){
     console.log('Iframe Received Init:', event.data.message);
     event.source.postMessage({type:'response', message: 'Hello from the iframe!'}, 'https://yourdomain.com');
    }
});

```

Key aspects here: *event.origin* is checked in the message event listeners to verify the messages are coming from the expected source; also *event.source* is used for the return message. It’s crucial to specify the target origin when using `postMessage` for security. You'll see `'https://example.com'` and `'https://yourdomain.com'` used respectively in each snippet which makes the whole cross-domain communication possible. The target origin parameter ensures the message is only sent if the source window matches that origin, improving security.

Second, if you have control over the server that serves the iframe's content, setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header offers a viable solution. This header, returned by the server, tells the browser which origins are allowed to access resources on the server. For example, if the iframe content is served from `https://example.com` you could set this header:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://yourdomain.com
```

This would allow scripts from `https://yourdomain.com` to access the iframe’s content. If you need to allow any origin (which is generally not recommended due to security implications), you can set:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

However, using `*` should only be done in controlled development environments or with careful consideration of the potential security implications. I'd only recommend it when you can’t use postMessage and you know the security implications of allowing any origin.

Here’s example in Python Flask for setting the header on the server that serves the `iframe.html`:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/iframe.html')
def iframe_page():
    resp = make_response(render_template('iframe.html'))
    resp.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = 'https://yourdomain.com'
    return resp

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

And the same iframe.html file from the previous example can be served here with the header.

Finally, there are a few other less common approaches, such as server-side proxying or using document.domain (which has limitations), I would actively discourage their use unless there is no other alternative, and I never had the need to use them in my career. Proxying can introduce a performance hit since your requests will go through a middle-man. `document.domain` is deprecated in modern browsers and should be avoided where possible.

To go deeper on this subject, I highly recommend consulting the following resources. For a solid foundation on the same-origin policy, the documentation provided by the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) on this topic is essential. Regarding the `postMessage` API, the HTML Standard specification includes in-depth details of how it should function along with examples. Also, if you are working a lot with CORS issues, the Fetch Standard by WHATWG provides all you need.

My experience has shown me that the most robust solution is almost always a combination of server configuration and postMessage. For most practical scenarios, focusing on those two solutions will cover your needs. While the same-origin policy can initially seem like an obstacle, it’s a vital component of web security, preventing malicious scripts from compromising sensitive data. Understanding and working with the postMessage API and Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers will solve most of your cross-origin frame access problems, provided you have control over the relevant domains. Remember that security should be a cornerstone of your implementation, and cutting corners here can lead to potential vulnerabilities.
