alright, so, seeing just one row of news in google news search, yeah, that's definitely a head-scratcher, and i've been there, pulling my hair out trying to figure out what's going on. been dealing with this sort of thing for, oh, seems like forever, probably since the early days of rss feeds actually, you'd think by now we'd have this figured out.

it's not typically a straightforward "google broke" scenario, although hey, even giants stumble. usually, it points to something a little more nuanced in how google's news algorithm decides what to show and how. it's like trying to debug someone else’s heavily commented code except the comments are just vibes and the debugger is a magic 8 ball. let me break down how I've seen this sort of thing happen and how i've tackled it, and what we can check.

first off, it's crucial to understand google news isn’t just a simple database dump of recent articles. they've got this whole spidering, indexing, and ranking system that's ridiculously complex, it’s a black box, pretty much. it pulls content from thousands of sources, and then it tries to figure out what's most relevant and what users want to see, this includes things like personalization based on search history and the user’s location.

so why just one row, well let's take a look at typical culprits and how they might lead to this single-row-of-news situation:

**1. query specificity:**

sometimes, a very narrow search query might just not have enough relevant results to warrant multiple rows. imagine you’re looking up "news on a left-handed purple stapler release in antarctica", google might indeed find a single article, or maybe, just maybe, that weird manufacturer's blog post. the algorithm isn’t trying to be a jerk, it’s just that there isn’t a wealth of news to display. in the case it cannot find, it defaults to the most relevant thing it can find and shows the single row.

how to fix it? start with broader terms, then narrow things down if needed, think ‘zooming out’ first. here is a bit of python code that can help you make more query combinations:

```python
def generate_queries(base_terms, modifiers):
    queries = []
    for base in base_terms:
        queries.append(base)
        for modifier in modifiers:
          queries.append(f"{base} {modifier}")
    return queries

base_terms = ["ai", "machine learning", "artificial intelligence"]
modifiers = ["ethics", "regulation", "impact", "development"]
queries = generate_queries(base_terms, modifiers)

for query in queries:
    print(query)
```
this will help you create variations of the same query, helping find if the issue is with the keyword itself.

**2. personalization gone wild:**

google's personalization, it's a blessing and a curse. it tries to predict what you want based on your past search history, location, etc. but it might get it wrong and might filter out tons of stuff because it thinks you won’t care. i've had instances where i would search for a broad topic and get back results based on niche interest of mine from weeks ago, it was infuriating, it was like being stalked by my own search history.

how to fix it? you might want to try clearing your browser's history and cookies. using a different browser or an incognito window to see if it makes a difference. or even better, logging out of your google account to rule out personalizations. in cases like that, i'd have to get out a secondary machine, do the search, log out everywhere and get back to my main machine to finally see what everyone was seeing, a huge pain.

**3. regional or language issues:**

google news is very location-aware. if you're searching from a region where there aren't many news providers in a specific topic, the results could be severely limited. it's also possible that the language of the search query mismatches what news is available. i remember one time working for a small media site that only published in welsh, we kept seeing 0 impressions on our content until we realized that google was looking for it as english content and that it was a language settings issue.

how to fix it? check your google news settings, there's usually an option to select your country and language, make sure those are correct and match what you’re looking for. you can also append `&gl=us` or `&hl=en` at the end of the search url for example, to force a specific country or language, this might help finding if there’s a regional issue.

**4. potential technical errors or indexing hiccups:**

this is a rare one, but it happens, although unlikely, google’s indexers do hiccup and temporarily have issues, especially with new content. or there might be some weird glitch that causes an indexer to miss whole segments of content. i once saw a whole range of a specific topic news articles just disappear for a day, it was like a news black hole, only to reappear in full force the day after. it was so bizarre, that for a moment i thought i’d been affected by the Mandela effect.

how to fix it? if it's a google glitch, there is very little you can do except wait it out. sometimes, refreshing the search or trying again in some hours might help. if it’s your own content, ensure that your site is properly indexed using google search console, this tool is essential to identify those cases and make sure that your sitemaps are working and being read. this tool is essential for all web developers.

**5. algorithmic filtering and duplicate content:**

google tries very hard to weed out duplicate content and tries to rank news based on authority and originality of content. a lot of sources just repeat news and so it will only show the ‘first’ and ‘most complete’ one. this might also be a reason for getting only a single row of content. i once had to deal with an issue with a site that was aggregating content, we had to rewrite everything to make it original and not just copy and paste from other sources, it was very annoying but it solved the issue.

how to fix it? check the sources you're looking for and see if they are original and different from others, or if you have your own content, ensure there is no duplicate content and that the content is properly attributed if it’s a compilation. if google thinks the source isn't original or relevant, it will filter it out.

**6. google news settings:**

less common, but worth mentioning, users can change the settings for google news in the app or on their google account, changing the topics shown or filtering out a lot of information.
i've seen users complain that they weren’t seeing specific news, and it was just their own settings. i even had a coworker complaining about not seeing sports news until i pointed out that he had hidden the sports topic.

how to fix it? double check the google news settings page to see if any unwanted topics are hidden or filtered. it's usually very easy to change but often overlooked by users.

now, here is an example on how to use the google api to check a potential cause for the issue, usually the results returned by the api are less filtered than the results shown on the news page:

```python
import requests
from urllib.parse import urlencode

def search_google_news_api(query, api_key):
    base_url = "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything"
    params = {
        "q": query,
        "apiKey": api_key,
        "language": "en",  # you can change it to your preference
        "pageSize": 10  # adjust it based on what you need
    }
    url = base_url + "?" + urlencode(params)
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
       data = response.json()
       if data['status'] == 'ok':
           print(f"found {len(data['articles'])} articles")
           for article in data['articles']:
                print(f"title: {article['title']}")
                print(f"url: {article['url']}")
       else:
          print(f"Error {data['message']}")
    else:
        print(f"error: could not connect with api: {response.status_code}")


# replace this with your actual api key (you need to get one from newsapi.org)
api_key = "your_newsapi_key_here"
search_query = "your query here, like ai ethics"
search_google_news_api(search_query, api_key)
```

(note: to use the code, you will need to replace `your_newsapi_key_here` with your actual api key) and `your query here, like ai ethics` with your actual query.

if you’re seeing one row in google news, don't panic. it’s rarely some huge catastrophe. it's usually a combo of these factors. start broad, then narrow down. i can almost guarantee, after you check these steps, you'll find that silly setting or a weird filter that was causing it.

if the problem is something that cannot be solved with these steps, my suggestion is to dive deeper into documentation regarding the structure of google news data, there's also great resources that you can check out, one i would personally recommend is "search engine optimization" by eric enge, stephan spencer, and jessie stricchiola. it covers a lot of ground on how search engines work and can give you a broader view of how google indexes, ranks, and filters news.

another good resource is "information retrieval: implementing and evaluating search engines" by stefan buttcher, charles l.a. clarke, and gordon v. cormack, it has lots of information regarding how search engines work and might give you a different view on the problem. also, there’s an infinite array of papers regarding the topic of web scraping that you should look for, they are extremely useful when handling different kinds of web results.

also, and if you're a web developer, it's crucial that you dive into google's search console documentation to understand how google sees your site, and that can be a lifesaver to understand these indexing issues.

finally, for anyone that has read this wall of text, i have a joke for you, why did the developer quit his job? because he didn’t get arrays!

let me know if you need more help, or if there’s more information that you can give me. good luck!
