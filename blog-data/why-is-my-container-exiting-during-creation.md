Let’s tackle this. It’s a scenario I've encountered more times than I care to recall, often late on a Friday. A container unexpectedly exiting during creation – frustrating, definitely, but almost always traceable to a few key culprits. We're not talking about magic here; it's about understanding the container's execution flow and what it needs to function correctly. Let’s break this down systematically.

Firstly, containers are essentially isolated processes that are designed to run a specific application. If that application fails to start, or finishes immediately, the container itself will terminate, exiting with a corresponding code. This often occurs before you even get a chance to `docker logs` anything meaningful. My experience with this began years ago, when I was deploying a microservice architecture and frequently dealt with misconfigurations that caused these instant exits, usually revealed by a cryptic “exited (137)” in my `docker ps -a` output. It's crucial to approach this with a methodical diagnostic mindset.

There are several reasons for this immediate exit, and pinpointing the specific one for your situation will depend on the container’s configuration and the application you're trying to run. Let’s go through the primary suspects:

1.  **Application Errors:** The most frequent reason is a failure within your application’s startup process. This can range from missing dependencies, misconfigured environment variables, code that crashes on startup, or even just incorrect command-line arguments. If your application expects a specific database connection and it's not there, for instance, you'll often see an immediate exit. Essentially, the container runs your specified command, it fails, and the container ceases to exist.

2.  **Insufficient Resources:** Containers require compute resources, specifically memory and cpu. if you've limited the container's resources via docker settings or your orchestration system like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, and your application attempts to use more than that, the container will be abruptly terminated, often by the out-of-memory (OOM) killer. This often presents a somewhat subtle issue initially. It will look like the application is trying to start normally until the resource limit is exceeded and then is killed. This is a good case for closely monitoring resource usage using tools like `docker stats`.

3.  **Incorrect Entrypoint/Command:** The `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` instructions in your Dockerfile dictate how the container will start. An incorrect or missing `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD`, or specifying the incorrect path for the command to start, will lead to an error when docker tries to start the container, and the container exits without any meaningful output. It's like trying to start a car with no key or an incorrect ignition sequence; it simply won’t work.

4.  **Permissions Issues:** This is common when volumes are involved. If the user inside your container lacks the necessary permissions to read or write files in a volume, the startup process can fail. For instance, mounting a directory on the host and trying to have an app write there, when the internal user doesn't have write access can lead to the container immediately exiting.

5.  **Health Checks Failing Immediately:** If you have health checks configured for the container, and they fail right away, the container orchestration system, like kubernetes, will restart the container. This can make it look like the container is exiting right after creation. It’s crucial to verify your health checks have sufficient grace time.

Now, let’s look at some code examples illustrating these points.

**Example 1: Application Error – Missing Dependency**

Imagine a Python application that requires the `requests` library. If the Dockerfile doesn't include the necessary `pip install requests`, the application will crash when it's executed.

*Dockerfile:*
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY app.py .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

*app.py:*
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://www.example.com")
print(response.status_code)
```

*Result: Container will exit immediately due to a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'`.*

To fix this we would add:
*Dockerfile:*
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY app.py .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
*requirements.txt*
```txt
requests
```
Now the module is installed at build and the container will start without error.

**Example 2: Insufficient Resources – OOM Killer**

If your application requires a lot of memory but isn't allocated enough, the container will be killed by the OOM killer. Here's a hypothetical, albeit simplistic, demonstration (in reality it would more likely be a large data processing app):
```bash
docker run --memory="10m" --rm  python:3.9-slim  -c "x = [0]*1000000; print('hello')"
```

*Result: Container will exit with code 137, indicating an OOM kill.*

If we increase the memory:
```bash
docker run --memory="100m" --rm python:3.9-slim  -c "x = [0]*1000000; print('hello')"
```
*Result: Container starts and prints "hello"*

**Example 3: Incorrect Entrypoint/Command**

If your `CMD` is pointing to the wrong script, your container will crash when the command doesn't exist.
*Dockerfile:*
```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
COPY start.sh /
CMD ["/start_script.sh"]
```
*Result: Container will exit immediately because the file `/start_script.sh` does not exist.*

To correct this, we would correct the `CMD` instruction:

*Dockerfile:*
```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
COPY start.sh /
CMD ["/start.sh"]
```

In my experience, diagnosing this specific type of container issue requires a thorough, step-by-step approach. First, always check the `docker logs <container_id>` even if it appears that the container immediately exited. Often there are useful clues there. Also, carefully examining your Dockerfile and the application’s logs is paramount. If using an orchestration platform, examine it’s logs as well, to see if there are error messages related to the container starting. I would also suggest starting your container with the `--interactive` and `--tty` flags so you can gain access and execute commands inside of the container. This helps you to inspect the environment.

For more in-depth knowledge, I strongly recommend these resources:

*   **"Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton:** This is a comprehensive guide to Docker, covering everything from the basics to more advanced topics such as container networking and storage. It helped me solidify my understanding of how Docker operates under the hood.
*   **"Kubernetes in Action" by Marko Luksa:** While not directly about Docker, understanding Kubernetes will often help you understand why a container is exiting in a complex deployment. Luksa's book provides a solid foundation for Kubernetes, which often manages Docker containers in production.
*   **The official Docker documentation:** The Docker documentation is incredibly detailed and covers nearly every aspect of Docker. It's an invaluable resource for understanding the intricacies of Docker.

These resources can be pivotal in your journey of debugging this common issue. It's rare that an exit during container creation is truly "mysterious." More often it's a logical error on our part, and by systematically examining these primary areas mentioned above, you will be able to resolve most issues related to containers exiting during creation.
