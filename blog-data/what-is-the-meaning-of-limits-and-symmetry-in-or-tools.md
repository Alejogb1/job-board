Alright, let's tackle this one. I've spent quite a bit of time in the trenches with optimization problems, and the concepts of limits and symmetry, especially within the context of OR-Tools, are fundamental to making real progress. They're not just abstract mathematical ideas; they directly impact the practicality and performance of our solutions. Let's break down what they mean and how they function in practice, drawing from experiences I’ve had over the years.

The core idea behind limits in OR-Tools revolves around controlling the computational resources used by the solver. Without limits, optimization algorithms could potentially run indefinitely or consume excessive memory, essentially turning into resource hogs. We typically work with two primary types of limits: time limits and solution limits.

Time limits, specified in seconds, are perhaps the most common. They tell the solver, “don't spend more than this amount of time trying to find an optimal solution”. Now, it's important to understand that this doesn't guarantee the algorithm will reach optimality; it just ensures it won’t keep running forever. In my experience, I've found that a significant portion of optimization tasks hit diminishing returns after a certain period, where the improvement in solution quality becomes less and less significant per unit of compute time. Setting a time limit becomes a pragmatic way to balance the need for the best solution against the cost of computation. I remember one project where we were optimizing a supply chain network, and we had to implement dynamic time limits based on the complexity of the input data and the urgency of the decision. The early, less critical runs got shorter time limits while the late, high-impact ones had more time to converge.

Solution limits, on the other hand, specify the number of solutions the solver should find before terminating. This is particularly useful when you are less interested in the *absolute* best solution and more in a variety of good or near-optimal solutions. This can be a helpful strategy in cases where the objective function is not the only consideration; perhaps some unmodeled practical aspects come into play that we need to evaluate manually after the solver does its work. For example, in scheduling problems, you might generate several feasible schedules, each slightly different, and present them to the decision-makers for the final selection, taking into account factors that were difficult to formulate mathematically.

Now, for some code examples to solidify the concepts, let's imagine you're using the CP-SAT solver within OR-Tools for a simple job shop scheduling problem:

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

def create_job_shop_model(num_jobs, num_machines, durations):
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    starts = {}
    ends = {}
    intervals = {}

    for job_id in range(num_jobs):
        for task_id in range(num_machines):
            start_var = model.NewIntVar(0, 1000, f'start_j{job_id}_t{task_id}')
            end_var = model.NewIntVar(0, 1000, f'end_j{job_id}_t{task_id}')
            interval_var = model.NewIntervalVar(start_var, durations[job_id][task_id], end_var,
                                                 f'interval_j{job_id}_t{task_id}')

            starts[(job_id, task_id)] = start_var
            ends[(job_id, task_id)] = end_var
            intervals[(job_id, task_id)] = interval_var

    # Add precedence constraints within each job
    for job_id in range(num_jobs):
        for task_id in range(num_machines - 1):
            model.Add(ends[(job_id, task_id)] <= starts[(job_id, task_id + 1)])

    # Add no-overlap constraint for each machine
    for machine_id in range(num_machines):
        machine_intervals = [intervals[(job_id, machine_id)] for job_id in range(num_jobs)]
        model.AddNoOverlap(machine_intervals)
    
    obj_var = model.NewIntVar(0, 1000, 'makespan')
    for job_id in range(num_jobs):
        model.Add(obj_var >= ends[(job_id, num_machines - 1)])

    model.Minimize(obj_var)

    return model, starts, ends

def solve_with_limits():
  num_jobs = 3
  num_machines = 3
  durations = [[5, 3, 7], [2, 8, 4], [6, 4, 9]]
  model, starts, ends = create_job_shop_model(num_jobs, num_machines, durations)
  solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
  
  # Set a time limit of 10 seconds
  solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = 10.0
  
  # Set a solution limit of 5 solutions
  solver.parameters.num_search_workers = 4 # you can use more cores
  solver.parameters.enumerate_all_solutions = True
  solver.parameters.solution_limit = 5 # this line is crucial

  status = solver.Solve(model)
  if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
      print(f"Solution found: ")
      for job_id in range(num_jobs):
        for task_id in range(num_machines):
            print(f"Job {job_id}, Task {task_id}: Start {solver.Value(starts[(job_id, task_id)])}, End {solver.Value(ends[(job_id, task_id)])}")
      print(f"Makespan: {solver.ObjectiveValue()}")
  else:
    print(f"No solution found (Status: {status})")
    
  print(f"Number of solutions: {solver.NumSolutions()}")
```
As you can see from the code, `solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds` controls the time limit and `solver.parameters.solution_limit` sets the solution limit. You can run this and observe how it stops when these limits are reached.

Let's move on to symmetry, which is a slightly more subtle issue. Symmetry in this context refers to identical or near-identical solutions that the solver will explore, only differing in some permuted form. The solver will spend time looking at these symmetric solutions without getting any improvement. We're not concerned with the 'symmetry' of a mathematical object, but rather with redundant or wasteful explorations during search.

A common example occurs when you have identical resources, like machines, in a scheduling problem. If machine A and machine B are interchangeable, then switching the jobs assigned to them doesn’t inherently lead to a better or worse objective value (assuming no other constraints). The solver might waste a lot of computation time exploring these equivalent states. This, in practice, manifests as an optimization algorithm that's slow to converge. It’s akin to repeatedly trying variations of the same thing hoping it will turn into something different.

One way to handle symmetry in OR-Tools, though not applicable in all cases and particularly the one above, is to introduce symmetry-breaking constraints. This effectively prunes the search space by ensuring that, for example, identical variables are handled in a canonical way rather than permuted. Consider the following example where we are simply trying to select a set of items under a constraint and there are identical items:
```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

def solve_item_selection_symmetry():
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    items = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3] # three identical items of value 3
    num_items = len(items)
    x = [model.NewBoolVar(f'x_{i}') for i in range(num_items)] # selection variable
    
    # constraint: ensure at most 3 items selected
    model.Add(sum(x) <= 3)
    
    # Add symmetry-breaking constraints for identical items.
    # Note that in this example, items 0 and 1 are identical and items 3,4, and 5 are also identical.
    model.Add(x[0] >= x[1])
    model.Add(x[3] >= x[4])
    model.Add(x[4] >= x[5])
    
    # define objective function
    model.Maximize(sum(x[i] * items[i] for i in range(num_items)))

    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    status = solver.Solve(model)

    if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
        print("Solution found:")
        for i in range(num_items):
            if solver.Value(x[i]):
              print(f"Item {i}: Value {items[i]}")
        print(f"Objective Value: {solver.ObjectiveValue()}")
    else:
        print(f"No solution found (Status: {status})")
```
As you see, we explicitly add constraints to ensure that the indices of identical items are ordered in a certain way. Without these symmetry-breaking constraints, the solver might explore symmetric solutions that differ only in the permutation of the selected items (for example selecting the first item ‘1’ and then the second item ‘1’ or selecting the second item ‘1’ and the first one which are basically the same thing), increasing the solution time. Notice that this is a simplistic case with few elements, and for very large problems specific methods to handle symmetry should be preferred.

A more practical approach is using specific modeling features of OR-Tools when possible. For instance, using `AllDifferent` constraints can be used to model resource allocations without manual symmetry breaking by adding extra constraints to model symmetry. However, this approach is more involved and depends on the nature of your optimization problem.

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

def solve_resource_allocation_with_alldifferent():
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    num_tasks = 4
    num_resources = 3
    
    resource_assignments = [model.NewIntVar(0, num_resources-1, f'resource_assignment_{i}') for i in range(num_tasks)]
    
    # each task must be assigned a resource
    model.Add(cp_model.AllDifferent(resource_assignments))
    
    # minimize assignment indices (example objective)
    model.Minimize(sum(resource_assignments))

    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    status = solver.Solve(model)
    
    if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
        print("Solution found:")
        for i in range(num_tasks):
            print(f"Task {i} is assigned to resource {solver.Value(resource_assignments[i])}")
        print(f"Objective Value: {solver.ObjectiveValue()}")
    else:
        print(f"No solution found (Status: {status})")

```

In this example, the use of `AllDifferent` constraint avoids the need for manual breaking symmetries that could be added in the absence of such a constraint. The underlying solver is able to understand that using specific constraint (such as `AllDifferent` in this case) allows for exploring the solution space more efficiently.

For a deeper dive into these concepts, I highly recommend *"Handbook of Constraint Programming"* by Rossi, van Beek, and Walsh for constraint programming theory. Also, check out the *"Integer Programming"* book by Wolsey for more general optimization techniques. For OR-Tools specific knowledge, always refer to the official documentation; it’s a rich resource with plenty of well-explained examples.

In conclusion, limits and symmetry are critical factors in optimization within the OR-Tools framework and any other optimization software. Understanding their implications, as well as using the correct constraints, allows us to build robust and efficient solutions to challenging real-world problems. They are something that you learn with time and experience while working with optimization solvers.
