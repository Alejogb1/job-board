Right then, let's unpack this. I remember a project a few years back where we needed to deploy a complex image recognition system onto a low-power embedded device. We had a thoroughly trained Keras sequential model, but its computational demands were just too high for the hardware. That’s where the notion of converting it to a spiking neural network (SNN) using something like Nengo-DL came to the fore. It's a nuanced process, and certainly not a one-to-one mapping, but highly effective when done well.

The primary motivation behind this conversion is energy efficiency. SNNs, inspired by biological neurons, operate on sparse, event-driven principles rather than the continuous activations of traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). This event-driven nature can lead to significant power savings, particularly on specialized neuromorphic hardware. Nengo-DL is a superb framework for bridging the gap between the continuous domain of ANNs (like those built in Keras) and the discrete, temporal domain of SNNs.

Now, the crux of the problem lies in translating the fundamental operations of a Keras model into their spiking equivalents. Keras layers such as dense layers and convolutional layers, when translated, need to be implemented with spiking neurons and appropriate connection weights. These spiking neurons don't have activation functions in the same manner as an ANN. Instead, they accumulate input and, when a threshold is reached, 'fire' a spike. Nengo-DL, therefore, does this translation with a few techniques. One crucial aspect is rate encoding, which converts the continuous outputs from the Keras model into spike rates. Essentially, a higher activation value in the Keras output is represented by a higher frequency of spikes in the Nengo-DL network.

Here's how it typically works, step by step:

1. **Building the Keras model:** We start with the familiar task of constructing and training a Keras sequential model. We are working in the realm of standard deep learning tools.

2.  **Preparing the Keras model for Nengo:** This often involves defining specific layers within the model. We have to ensure compatibility with the translation methods available in Nengo-DL. For example, we usually need to ensure that any activation functions are either ReLU or a variant of ReLU for effective conversion. Activation functions that are not explicitly available in the Nengo-DL library can be a major roadblock.

3.  **Creating the corresponding Nengo-DL model:** This is where Nengo-DL’s conversion tools come into play. We essentially use it to import the trained Keras weights and re-create the architecture within the spiking network.

4.  **Running simulations:** We use Nengo-DL to simulate the SNN and test its performance on our dataset. This step includes exploring various encoding methods, simulation parameters, and spiking neuron types to find the optimal settings. This usually involves a good bit of experimentation.

5.  **Analyzing and refining:** Finally, we examine performance metrics like classification accuracy and energy consumption, further optimizing the architecture if required.

To make this concrete, let me provide three illustrative code snippets, albeit simplified, that show this translation in action. Please note, I'm not providing the full dataset loading or model training part of the script. Instead I am providing code snippets that are central to the conversion.

**Snippet 1: Keras Model Definition**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

def build_keras_model(input_shape):
  model = Sequential([
      Flatten(input_shape=input_shape),
      Dense(128, activation='relu'),
      Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])
  return model

# Assume this function is called like: keras_model = build_keras_model((28,28,1))
# And that this is followed by a training step and weight saving
```

This first snippet shows a very basic Keras sequential model that includes a flattening layer, a dense layer with a relu activation function and an output layer with softmax for classification. Crucially, the activation function is explicitly set, and this model would be trained on some dataset before moving to the next step. Note the input shape for this example assumes some sort of grayscale image or data.

**Snippet 2: Nengo-DL Conversion**

```python
import nengo
import nengo_dl
import tensorflow as tf

def convert_to_nengo_model(keras_model, input_shape, sim_time = 0.1, dt=0.001):
  with nengo.Network(seed=0) as net:
    inp = nengo.Node(size_in=input_shape[0]*input_shape[1]*input_shape[2])  # Assuming flattened input
    nengo_dl.Converter(keras_model, input_nodes={"flatten_input": inp},  swap_activations={tf.keras.activations.relu : nengo.SpikingRectifiedLinear() }, init_synapses=0.005)
    out_p = nengo.Probe(net.outputs, synapse=0.01)
  
  with nengo_dl.Simulator(net, dt=dt) as sim:
      sim.run(sim_time)
  
  return net, sim
# The input shape variable from the build_keras_model is used here too.
# Assume this function is called like: nengo_net, sim = convert_to_nengo_model(keras_model, (28,28,1))
```

This second snippet is where the core conversion using Nengo-DL happens. Note the use of `nengo_dl.Converter`, which takes the trained Keras model, the input node, and the type of activation function mapping. We are using `nengo.SpikingRectifiedLinear()` to map the Keras Relu activation. The `init_synapses` is a hyperparameter to tune the spike network behavior. After creating the simulation, we also run it to generate spike data, which can then be used for assessment or further processing.

**Snippet 3: Extracting Classification Output**

```python
import numpy as np
def extract_classifications(sim, probe_output):

  output_data = sim.data[probe_output]
  averaged_output = np.mean(output_data, axis=0)
  predicted_class = np.argmax(averaged_output, axis=1)

  return predicted_class
# Assume this function is called like: output = extract_classifications(sim, out_p)
```
This final snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the spiking outputs and derive a classification based on rate coding. We are averaging the network outputs and then predicting a class based on the averaged results. This function assumes some knowledge of the output of the simulator.

Important considerations for this conversion involve: the choice of spiking neuron model within Nengo, the simulation time required for adequate spike accumulation, and the synaptic time constants, all these hyperparameters require tuning for each specific use case.

For a more in-depth understanding of SNNs, I'd recommend exploring the foundational papers by W. Gerstner and W. Maass on spiking neuron models and synaptic plasticity, as detailed in "Spiking Neuron Models: Single Neurons, Populations, Plasticity" by Gerstner et al. For a more practical approach, the Nengo documentation, along with papers by the Nengo team on neural engineering and the Nengo-DL framework, provides excellent guidance. “How to Train Deep Spiking Neural Networks” by Han et al. is also a valuable resource focusing on training methods. I’ve found all of these to be extremely helpful.

This process, while seemingly intricate, is highly rewarding. The potential to run complex machine learning tasks on extremely energy efficient hardware offers significant advantages across a range of application. The code snippets above provide a jumping-off point, and further tuning will depend on the specific task and the desired balance between accuracy and computational cost.
