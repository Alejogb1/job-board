, let's address this. I’ve certainly stumbled across shape mismatches when working with ResNet50, especially when fine-tuning it for single-class classification, and it's a fairly common hiccup. These errors usually arise because of inconsistencies between the output dimensions of your model's final layers and the expected shape of your target data, or the input dimensions of subsequent layers you might add. Having battled this in several projects — once on a particularly challenging satellite imagery classification task— I can pinpoint the common culprits and, more importantly, how to tackle them.

Fundamentally, ResNet50, like many convolutional neural networks designed for multi-class image classification, culminates in a fully connected layer (or sometimes a series of them) that produces an output vector matching the number of classes in the original ImageNet dataset – 1000, in this case. When repurposed for a single-class problem (a binary classification if you think about it from a machine learning perspective), the dimensions no longer align. The mismatch manifests when either the loss function you’re using expects an output of shape `(batch_size, 1)` (or just `(batch_size)`) for binary classification, but your network still outputs `(batch_size, 1000)`, or if your model has input requirements that your data does not meet after feature extraction.

Let's breakdown this into practical steps. The primary issue here is the final layer of the pre-trained ResNet50, which by default generates that 1000-dimensional output. There are multiple ways to resolve this, and they depend somewhat on your specific framework. My go-to approach usually follows one of these:

**1. Replace or Modify the Final Fully Connected Layer**

The most frequent solution is to completely replace the final fully connected layer (often denoted as `fc` or `classifier` depending on the framework) with a new layer suitable for binary classification. This new layer should have only one output neuron (or two if you prefer representing output using one-hot encoding for two classes, then one output per class with softmax). If we go with a single neuron, you might want a sigmoid activation applied to the output if you’re using a binary cross-entropy loss.

Here’s an example using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import models

# Load the pretrained ResNet50
resnet50 = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Freeze all layers except the final one (optional, but often beneficial for fine-tuning)
for param in resnet50.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Get the number of input features to the last fully connected layer
num_ftrs = resnet50.fc.in_features

# Replace the final layer
resnet50.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 1)  # Use a linear layer for binary classification (single output neuron)
# Add a sigmoid to have probability output directly from the model
resnet50 = nn.Sequential(resnet50, nn.Sigmoid())

# Example input
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

# Check the shape
output = resnet50(dummy_input)
print(output.shape) # Expected: torch.Size([1, 1])
```
In this snippet, we fetch a pre-trained ResNet50 from `torchvision.models`, freeze its parameters (a common practice when fine-tuning to retain pre-trained weights and not overfit on small single-class data), then we replace the original final fully connected layer with a new linear layer with a single output followed by a sigmoid activation. The output now is of shape `(batch_size, 1)`, ready for binary classification.

**2. Using a Custom Head:**
   Another approach is to create an entirely new "head" that operates on the feature map produced by the ResNet50 after removing the final layers. This method allows for more flexibility, including adding different layers like dropout or batch normalization, before feeding the output into a single neuron.

   Here’s an example in TensorFlow (Keras):

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Load pretrained ResNet50, excluding the final classification layer
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
# Freeze the base model layers
base_model.trainable = False

# Create a custom head
inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(224,224,3))
x = base_model(inputs, training=False) #Important, training is False to avoid using training mode when using the model during prediction
x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.Dropout(0.5)(x) # Add dropout for regularization
outputs = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
# Example input
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 224, 224, 3))

# Check the shape
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output.shape) # Expected: (1, 1)
```
Here, we load ResNet50 without its top (classification) layers using `include_top=False`. We then construct a new sequential model where the base model layers are not trainable, followed by global average pooling and other dense layers which reduce the spatial dimensions and add some layers before reaching the final output, a single neuron with a sigmoid activation. The output is, again, of shape `(batch_size, 1)`.

**3. Modifying Input Layers:**
    Sometimes, you might encounter a shape mismatch not just in the final layers but in the input dimensions required by ResNet50 itself, or if you have done something like using transfer learning on data that is not RGB. The default shape is typically 224x224x3 when it is used with ImageNet. If your input images are of different shapes, you may need to either resize them before passing them to the model (which could lead to distortion) or preprocess them into the correct shape using a data generator.

    An example of that using Keras' ImageDataGenerator in Tensorflow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Create an ImageDataGenerator for data preprocessing
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255,
                             rotation_range=20,
                             width_shift_range=0.2,
                             height_shift_range=0.2,
                             horizontal_flip=True)

# Load ResNet50 without the top layers
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
base_model.trainable = False

#Create the final classifier
x = base_model.output
x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=outputs)

# Generate a dummy dataset
# Let us assume 10 images of dimensions (500, 500, 3)
images = tf.random.normal((10, 500, 500, 3))
labels = tf.random.uniform((10,1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32) # dummy labels
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((images, labels))

# Process the dataset
def resize_images(image, label):
    resized_image = tf.image.resize(image, (224, 224))
    return resized_image, label

processed_dataset = dataset.map(resize_images).batch(5)

# Feed the data to the model
for batch_images, batch_labels in processed_dataset:
  output = model(batch_images)
  print(output.shape) # Expected (5,1), (5,1) depending on batch size

```

In this example, we create a dataset using random images of size (500,500,3). Then, we define a resizing function and a dataset to apply it to. After that, we feed the resized batches into the model. This approach resizes images using the Tensorflow API before using them with the model, ensuring the correct shapes are used.

**Recommended Resources:**

For a deeper dive, I suggest delving into:

* **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** An excellent foundational text for deep learning concepts. It provides comprehensive understanding of CNNs, transfer learning and concepts that are important to understand the issues.
*   **PyTorch documentation and tutorials on transfer learning:** PyTorch's official site offers abundant, hands-on examples that are invaluable.
*   **TensorFlow documentation and Keras API reference:** similar to pytorch documentation, this will give you a thorough overview of the tensorflow/keras methods for loading and adapting pre-trained models.
*   **Papers on transfer learning:** Specifically search for papers focusing on transfer learning with CNNs, which often detail best practices for fine-tuning pre-trained models. For example:  "How transferable are features in deep neural networks?" by Yosinski et al. or "DeCAF: A Deep Convolutional Activation Feature for Generic Visual Recognition" by Donahue et al. can help understand more about the process.

In summary, shape mismatches when fine-tuning ResNet50 for single-class tasks are usually resolved by modifying the final layers to output the correct dimensions or preprocessing the input data to match the model's input dimensions. These modifications ensure consistency and allow the model to be trained correctly for your intended purpose. It’s a common issue, and while it can be frustrating, it's also straightforward to address by modifying or replacing the final layers, and ensuring correct input data dimensions through preprocessing or using tools such as ImageDataGenerator or tensorflow dataset APIs. It’s all in the details.
