,  I've seen this specific issue crop up more often than one might expect with Azure Machine Learning, and it’s almost always tied to permissions or how the storage is configured, not necessarily with the machine learning compute itself. It’s a particularly frustrating error because, on the surface, it looks like a simple file operation gone wrong. I recall back in 2020, during a large-scale model deployment project for a client involved in predictive maintenance, we encountered this exact problem. Our team had initially configured the storage account and datastore in what seemed like a straightforward manner, but attempting to programmatically upload new training data using python scripts within an Azure ml environment kept failing with those pesky read-only errors. It definitely made us reevaluate our approach.

The underlying cause, in almost all cases I've dealt with, boils down to how Azure Machine Learning interacts with the storage accounts. Azure ML doesn't directly interact with the file system like your local machine does. Instead, it uses datastores, which are references to Azure storage accounts. These datastores are crucial, acting as the bridge connecting the AML environment with your files. If you see "read-only" errors while adding files, it usually indicates a permission problem concerning the user, the compute instance, or how the datastore itself was registered. Let's break down the most common culprits.

First, the most frequent offender is improperly configured **service principal or managed identity permissions**. When you’re working with azure ml, it often employs a service principal (an application identity) or a managed identity for resource authentication. This identity needs to have specific read and *write* access to the storage account and the container where you are attempting to add files. A read-only role assigned to this identity, or a lack of explicit 'write' permissions to a specific container or even the root level of the storage account, will yield exactly the errors you're encountering. The solution is not simply granting 'contributor' on the whole storage account, as that's often far too permissive. Instead, focus on least privilege by using roles such as "Storage Blob Data Contributor" on the target container.

Secondly, there is the potential misconfiguration of the **datastore itself**. When registering the datastore in Azure ML, you must be extremely precise in how you set it up. You define the location and how Azure ML will authenticate. If the authentication method doesn’t use the correct service principal or managed identity that has the proper write access, or the datastore itself isn't configured with write permissions, you will face this error. It isn't enough to simply create a storage account and then point the datastore at it. Specifically, ensure the authentication type during datastore registration is correctly configured. For example, specifying account keys isn’t secure for production; service principals or managed identities are best. Additionally, if the datastore configuration restricts it to a read-only operation through its properties within the Azure ML workspace, you'll encounter these issues.

Lastly, consider the **computational environment**. Even if the datastore and identities are configured correctly, the compute instance or cluster used for your azure ml tasks must also have the necessary permissions to write to the storage through the datastore. This might mean ensuring that the managed identity assigned to the compute resources also has appropriate “storage blob data contributor” permissions to your storage account. Furthermore, ensure that the compute instance or cluster itself isn't operating under a policy or configuration that imposes read-only file access to the datastore.

Let me illustrate with some examples. Let's say you're attempting to upload a new training data file using the Azure ML Python SDK.

**Example 1: Basic Datastore Upload (Failing)**

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace, Datastore, Dataset
from azureml.core.authentication import InteractiveLoginAuthentication

# Authentication:
interactive_auth = InteractiveLoginAuthentication()
ws = Workspace.from_config(auth=interactive_auth)


datastore_name = "my_data_store"

# Assuming my_data_store is already registered but configured incorrectly,
# or the compute environment doesn’t have adequate permissions
datastore = Datastore.get(ws, datastore_name)

# This will probably fail due to read only errors:
try:
    datastore.upload_files(files = ['./my_training_data.csv'],
                           target_path = 'my_new_data',
                           overwrite=True)
    print("Files Uploaded")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during upload: {e}")
```

In this first example, even though the code appears simple and straightforward, if the `my_data_store` is configured with insufficient permissions, or the identity used by either the compute instance or the Azure ML user does not have write access, it will throw an error. It's a common scenario because the code itself doesn’t highlight any problems. The underlying issue isn't in the code itself.

**Example 2: Service Principal Permission Update (Solution)**

```python
# This is not python but azure cli syntax for demonstrating how you would rectify the situation.
# Example: Grant service principal Storage Blob Data Contributor role on target container.

# Get the principal id from the service principal used by Azure ML (or managed identity)
# You can usually find this in the AML studio under compute settings for managed identities
# or in the Azure portal application registration

principal_id=$(az ad sp show --id <your_service_principal_app_id> --query objectId -o tsv)
# If using a managed identity, the equivalent might involve a az identity show operation

# Get your Storage Account id
storage_account_id=$(az storage account show -g <resource_group> -n <storage_account_name> --query id -o tsv)


# Get target container for datastore from Azure Portal. Assume container name is 'my-data'
container_name='my-data'
# Build scope for the operation
scope="$storage_account_id/blobServices/default/containers/$container_name"


# Assign contributor role to the service principal
az role assignment create --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" --assignee $principal_id --scope $scope

# Important, if using managed identities, make sure to add permissions for the compute where the code will run.
```

This second example does not involve python but rather demonstrates the necessary steps via Azure CLI to resolve permission issues. By granting the required service principal "Storage Blob Data Contributor" permissions at the container level, subsequent upload operations performed by azure ml using that service principal will most likely succeed. Note that this command assumes familiarity with Azure CLI.

**Example 3: Datastore configuration check (python check)**

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace, Datastore
from azureml.core.authentication import InteractiveLoginAuthentication

# Authenticate
interactive_auth = InteractiveLoginAuthentication()
ws = Workspace.from_config(auth=interactive_auth)

datastore_name = "my_data_store"
datastore = Datastore.get(ws, datastore_name)

print(f"Datastore name: {datastore.name}")
print(f"Datastore type: {datastore.datastore_type}")
print(f"Datastore container: {datastore.container_name}")

# This would be the service principal/managed identity being used for authentication
print(f"Datastore Auth: {datastore.credentials}")

# Additional troubleshooting steps could include checking datastore properties in Azure Portal
# and manually uploading a file to the datastore location using Storage Explorer or similar.

```
This third example is a short code snippet for checking the configuration of your datastore itself using the python SDK. It will print the name, type, container and importantly, credentials, allowing you to verify how azure ml is accessing the datastore. It's a basic troubleshooting step to make sure you're accessing the right storage and with the correct identity.

For further learning on these topics, I'd highly recommend checking out Microsoft's official Azure documentation on service principals and managed identities. Additionally, the "Programming Microsoft Azure" book series by Cloud Solutions Architect authors can provide a deeper technical dive. The “Azure Databricks Cookbook” by Packt is also a useful resource for handling data manipulation tasks involving Azure resources that’s relevant here. These resources cover best practices for resource authentication and authorization, particularly within the Azure ML environment.

In summary, read-only errors when adding files to Azure ML are almost always a consequence of misconfigured authentication or insufficient permissions. Careful analysis of the datastore configuration, the service principal or managed identities involved, and the permissions attached to compute resources will almost always lead you to the underlying problem and solution.
