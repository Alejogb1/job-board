,  I've definitely seen this headache pop up more than a few times, especially back when I was heavily involved in optimizing deep learning models for resource-constrained edge devices. The short answer, as with many technical hurdles, is that "can't be imported" is often a symptom of several underlying issues, rather than a single, easily identifiable problem. It rarely boils down to just the model itself being flawed. Instead, it’s typically a mismatch in the environment where the model was saved and the environment where you're trying to load it, or perhaps specific quirks with the saving and loading process itself.

Let's break this down systematically, focusing on the common culprits. Firstly, and perhaps most frequently, we encounter *version inconsistencies*. MobileNetV2, and indeed most deep learning models, aren't single, monolithic entities. They rely heavily on the underlying frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) and their associated libraries. When you save a model using, say, TensorFlow 2.5, attempting to load it in an environment running TensorFlow 2.1 is a recipe for disaster. The internal structures of the saved model file format, along with the way layers and operations are serialized, can differ drastically between versions. The framework might not know how to correctly interpret the serialized data from an earlier (or later) version. This often results in import errors or a model that just fails to behave predictably. I recall one specific project where we wasted several hours debugging seemingly random inference issues before realizing that the production environment had not been updated to the same TensorFlow version we were using for training.

Another critical aspect that often gets overlooked is the *method used for saving*. There isn't a single "save" button. Depending on your framework and the specific needs, you have several choices. For TensorFlow, for example, you might be using `model.save()`, which, depending on the argument passed, could be a SavedModel, a HDF5 file, or other formats. Each of these have their own nuances when it comes to loading. Similarly, with PyTorch, you’d either use `torch.save()` for saving the model state_dict or saving the entire model object. The crucial point here is that the method you use to save needs to be precisely the method you use to load. I've seen countless cases where developers tried loading a saved state_dict using the `torch.load()` function expecting to get a full model, and vice versa, resulting in load errors and type mismatches. Furthermore, sometimes if the model is saved using a specific hardware accelerator or backend that's not available at the point of import, a failure may occur due to incompatibility in the execution environment.

A third area where importing issues can originate is the *custom layers or operations*. MobileNetV2 itself is a standard architecture, but, you might have added custom layers, loss functions, or other model modifications that are not part of the core framework. If your model relies on these custom components, then you need to ensure that these custom definitions are available when the model is loaded. This typically means ensuring that you register or include your custom classes before loading the model. If you forget to do this, the framework will have no idea how to instantiate those specific layers and will raise an error.

Here are a few illustrative code snippets, demonstrating these issues and their potential solutions:

**Example 1: Version Inconsistency (TensorFlow)**

```python
# Code (Training with an assumed tensorflow version 2.5):

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2

# Create a MobileNetV2 model
model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=True)

# Save the model in SavedModel format
tf.saved_model.save(model, "mobilenet_v2_model")

# Later, on another machine running tensorflow 2.1 (or when loading with incorrect tensorflow version)

import tensorflow as tf

try:
    # Attempt to load the model from the same location.
    loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("mobilenet_v2_model")
    print("Model loaded successfully!")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}") # This is the likely place you'll find errors
    print("Check Tensorflow version compatibility.")

# Solution: The solution in this case is to align the tensorflow versions
#            of the training and loading environment.
```

**Example 2: Incorrect Saving/Loading Methods (PyTorch)**

```python
# Code (Training, state_dict approach):
import torch
import torchvision.models as models

# Create a MobileNetV2 model
model = models.mobilenet_v2(pretrained=True)

# Save the model's state_dict
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "mobilenet_v2_state.pth")

# Code (Loading with an incorrect method)
try:
    loaded_model = torch.load("mobilenet_v2_state.pth")
    print("Model loaded successfully, though not expected!")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading: {e}")
    print("Incorrect loading method was used.")

# Correct Loading method (for state_dict)
try:
   loaded_model = models.mobilenet_v2()
   loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("mobilenet_v2_state.pth"))
   print("Model loaded correctly using state_dict.")

except Exception as e:
   print(f"Error loading (state_dict): {e}")


# Code (Training, Full model approach):
# Save the entire model
torch.save(model, "mobilenet_v2_full.pth")

# Correct Loading (Full Model):
try:
   loaded_full_model = torch.load("mobilenet_v2_full.pth")
   print("Model loaded correctly using full model approach.")

except Exception as e:
   print(f"Error loading (full model): {e}")
```

**Example 3: Custom Layer Issues (TensorFlow)**

```python
# Custom Layer (Training environment)
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class CustomLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                 initializer='random_normal',
                                 trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                 initializer='zeros',
                                 trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    CustomLayer(5),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
])

model.save("custom_model") # Assuming the user saved using the save method.

# Code: Load environment without registering custom class
try:
    loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("custom_model")
    print("Error! Custom class definition was not present.") # Error occurs here.

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading: {e}")

# Correct loading requires re-defining the CustomLayer class or ensuring that
# it is in the same module at loading time.
# The solution is to include the custom class definition and then
#  use `tf.keras.models.load_model`
# Correctly define the custom layer:
class CustomLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                 initializer='random_normal',
                                 trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                 initializer='zeros',
                                 trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

# Now load correctly
try:
    loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("custom_model") # Now loads correctly
    print("Model loaded successfully, using custom layers!")

except Exception as e:
   print(f"Error loading (custom layer): {e}")
```

To dive deeper into these issues, I recommend starting with the official documentation for both TensorFlow and PyTorch, specifically the sections related to model saving and loading. For a more theoretical understanding, "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville is a great resource which goes into detail regarding the architecture and inner workings of deep learning models in a general sense. For specifics of optimization for mobile deployment, consider papers and books covering topics like model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation, which often mention the challenges of model portability. For example, "MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications" by Howard et al. will detail one of the original models being discussed and show some approaches to optimisation which might cause such compatibility issues during export if not handled carefully.

In conclusion, importing a saved MobileNetV2 model (or any deep learning model) involves far more than just pointing your code at a file. You need to meticulously manage version dependencies, use consistent save/load methodologies, and account for custom model components. Debugging these kinds of issues can be time-consuming, but understanding these core principles will greatly streamline your troubleshooting process. My personal experience has shown me that starting by verifying version compatibility is always the first and the most important step to take to solve these kinds of issues.
