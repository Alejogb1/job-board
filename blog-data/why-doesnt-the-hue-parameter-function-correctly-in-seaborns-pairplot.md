Okay, let's unpack this. I remember having a similar head-scratcher a few years back while working on a large dataset for a client in the pharmaceutical industry—lots of intricate relationships between different chemical compounds and their effects, and visualizing these multi-dimensional relationships was critical. I was heavily leaning on seaborn at the time, as it usually just handles the graphics heavy lifting without much fuss. Then bam, the `hue` parameter in `pairplot()` decided to play hard to get. It’s definitely not a simple issue, and it often stems from a misunderstanding of how seaborn's internals deal with categorical data when generating these plots.

The crux of the matter lies not within the `hue` parameter itself being defective, but rather in how `pairplot()` expects and interprets the data passed to it, specifically when a `hue` is specified. `pairplot()` generates a matrix of scatter plots (or histograms, or kernel density plots, depending on `kind`), visualizing all pairwise relationships in your dataset. When you add `hue`, you're telling seaborn to *categorize* the data based on the distinct values in that specified column and then represent those categories with different colors (or sometimes markers).

The first place where things tend to go sideways is when your intended `hue` column isn't explicitly recognized as categorical data. If your column is of numeric type—even if it contains only a few unique numbers like 1, 2, and 3, which you *intend* to represent different categories—seaborn will often treat it like a continuous variable, leading to a meaningless gradient of colors instead of distinct hues. This occurs because seaborn infers types from pandas' data structures and uses those types to determine plotting strategy.

Another common reason for unexpected behavior arises when your `hue` column contains missing values (NaNs). These missing values can cause plots with unusual legends or no color differentiation for these instances, potentially distorting your interpretation of the data. Further still, if there is a disproportionately large number of one specific category relative to other categories within your dataset, the resulting plots can become dominated by a single color, rendering the other categories hard to distinguish, again limiting the utility of `hue`.

Let me give you a practical example based on a dataset I've seen often in my consulting work, and that I even used for that pharmaceutical project. Assume you have a dataframe representing the properties of different compounds, where 'compound_id' is a numeric column representing specific compounds, though they function as categories (1, 2, 3… N). And let’s say your dataframe looks something like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = {
    'property_a': [1.2, 2.5, 3.1, 4.8, 1.8, 2.2, 3.5, 4.1, 1.5, 2.8],
    'property_b': [5.6, 6.2, 7.1, 8.3, 5.9, 6.5, 7.4, 8.1, 5.8, 6.9],
    'compound_id': [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Example 1: Incorrect use of hue
sns.pairplot(df, hue='compound_id')
plt.show()

```

In this first code snippet, seaborn may interpret `compound_id` as a numeric column, displaying incorrect hue. To fix this, we need to tell pandas that 'compound_id' is a category and then pass the changed column to the pairplot call.

```python
# Example 2: Correct use of hue with categorical data
df['compound_id'] = df['compound_id'].astype('category')
sns.pairplot(df, hue='compound_id')
plt.show()
```

Here, by converting ‘compound_id’ to the ‘category’ dtype using `astype('category')`, we’re explicitly telling pandas (and, in turn, seaborn) to interpret it as a categorical variable. This leads to each `compound_id` getting a distinct color in the pairplot, which is exactly what we're after.

Another scenario I've encountered is handling missing data. Let's add some NaNs to the dataset to illustrate:

```python
import numpy as np

data = {
    'property_a': [1.2, 2.5, 3.1, 4.8, 1.8, 2.2, np.nan, 4.1, 1.5, 2.8],
    'property_b': [5.6, 6.2, 7.1, 8.3, 5.9, 6.5, 7.4, np.nan, 5.8, 6.9],
    'compound_id': [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, np.nan, 1]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

df['compound_id'] = df['compound_id'].astype('category')

# Example 3: Handling missing data
sns.pairplot(df.dropna(subset=['compound_id']), hue='compound_id')
plt.show()

```

In the last example, before calling `pairplot()`, i’m using `df.dropna(subset=['compound_id'])` to remove rows where `compound_id` is missing. This approach ensures that the color distinctions in your plot are clear and accurate, preventing the NaN from polluting the visual interpretation. Another approach could be filling nan values with a placeholder like ‘Missing’, but, depending on the problem, this may not be the best.

In summary, while the `hue` parameter isn’t directly broken, its behavior is very sensitive to data types and the presence of missing data. Understanding these nuances is crucial for creating accurate and meaningful visualizations with seaborn's `pairplot()`.

If you want a more in-depth exploration of data visualization principles and how statistical tools handle categorical data, I highly recommend looking into *The Grammar of Graphics* by Leland Wilkinson. This text provides foundational concepts about how different chart types are constructed and how data maps to visual encodings. For a more practical approach using python and pandas, check out *Python for Data Analysis* by Wes McKinney. It covers how pandas handles data types, which is critical in understanding how seaborn interprets your data, and it will reinforce concepts such as the categorical type. Finally, look for research papers on categorical data visualization that go more in-depth to understand what you should avoid when creating a color palette for plots.

I hope these points give a solid foundation for understanding why the `hue` parameter in seaborn’s `pairplot()` might behave in ways you initially don't expect. The key is really just to be very explicit about the type of data you are passing to the function, and pay close attention to missing values.
