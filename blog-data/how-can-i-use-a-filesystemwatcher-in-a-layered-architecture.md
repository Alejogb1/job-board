,  I've seen this pattern—using `FileSystemWatcher` in a layered architecture—go sideways more times than I care to count, often leading to tightly coupled messes and maintenance nightmares. It’s not that a `FileSystemWatcher` is inherently problematic; it's how you integrate it that matters. The key is proper abstraction and adherence to the principles of separation of concerns.

When dealing with a layered architecture, which usually consists of layers like presentation, application, and data access, you need to ask where the responsibility of monitoring the filesystem truly lies. The filesystem isn’t an application-level concern in most scenarios; it's closer to a data source or an infrastructure detail. Therefore, embedding the `FileSystemWatcher` directly into the presentation layer or the core application logic is generally a bad idea, primarily due to tight coupling. Changes in how the filesystem is monitored should not ripple through your entire application.

In my past work at a large financial institution, we had a system responsible for processing transaction files dropped into a shared directory. The initial implementation scattered `FileSystemWatcher` instances all over the place – directly within different microservices that needed access to new files. It was a recipe for disaster. Changing the monitoring logic, like adding a filter, or modifying the watched path, required modifying every service. It led to brittle code that was difficult to debug and extend. What we needed, and what you’ll likely benefit from as well, is a dedicated layer for handling such concerns.

Here's the approach that worked well, along with some code to demonstrate:

**The Data Access/Infrastructure Layer:**

This is where the core `FileSystemWatcher` logic belongs. Create a dedicated component—I typically call it something descriptive like `FileSystemChangeMonitor`—within your data access or infrastructure layer. This component encapsulates the monitoring and provides a cleaner interface to the rest of your application.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class FileSystemChangeMonitor
{
    private FileSystemWatcher _watcher;
    public event EventHandler<FileSystemEventArgs> FileChanged;

    public FileSystemChangeMonitor(string path, string filter = "*.*")
    {
        if (!Directory.Exists(path))
            throw new DirectoryNotFoundException($"Directory not found: {path}");

        _watcher = new FileSystemWatcher(path, filter);
        _watcher.NotifyFilter = NotifyFilters.LastWrite | NotifyFilters.FileName;
        _watcher.Changed += OnFileChanged;
        _watcher.Created += OnFileChanged;
        _watcher.Deleted += OnFileChanged;
        _watcher.Renamed += OnFileChanged;
        _watcher.EnableRaisingEvents = true;
    }

    private void OnFileChanged(object sender, FileSystemEventArgs e)
    {
       FileChanged?.Invoke(this, e);
    }

    public void StopMonitoring()
    {
        _watcher.EnableRaisingEvents = false;
        _watcher.Dispose();
    }
}
```

In this snippet, I have encapsulated the `FileSystemWatcher` and its event handling within the `FileSystemChangeMonitor` class. Notice the use of a `FileChanged` event; this event is the only public facing interaction that the class exposes, creating a layer of abstraction between the details of filesystem monitoring and other components. The constructor validates the path to avoid runtime issues and I am also including `Created` and `Deleted` events.

**The Application Layer (and decoupling with an Interface)**

The next step is to use this `FileSystemChangeMonitor` in the application layer. It’s essential, though, that your application layer doesn’t directly depend on the concrete `FileSystemChangeMonitor` class. Introduce an interface to abstract away the details:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

public interface IFileSystemMonitor
{
    event EventHandler<FileSystemEventArgs> FileChanged;
    void StopMonitoring();
}

// Example Implementation:
public class MyApplicationService
{
    private readonly IFileSystemMonitor _fileSystemMonitor;
    public MyApplicationService(IFileSystemMonitor fileSystemMonitor)
    {
        _fileSystemMonitor = fileSystemMonitor;
        _fileSystemMonitor.FileChanged += OnFileChanged;
    }

    private void OnFileChanged(object sender, FileSystemEventArgs e)
    {
      // Logic to process the event
      Console.WriteLine($"File {e.ChangeType}: {e.FullPath}");
    }
}
```

Here I introduce the `IFileSystemMonitor` interface. Now, `MyApplicationService` doesn't care *how* filesystem changes are monitored; it only relies on the interface. The `FileSystemChangeMonitor` from before would implement the `IFileSystemMonitor` interface allowing for inversion of control. This approach is critical; it allows you to switch out your file monitoring implementation without modifying the application logic. It’s decoupling at its finest and crucial for maintainability and testability.

**Dependency Injection:**

Finally, you would use a dependency injection (DI) container to instantiate the concrete `FileSystemChangeMonitor` and inject it into the `MyApplicationService`. Here's a very basic setup of how this might look without a full container, just for illustration:

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string directoryToWatch = @"C:\TestDirectory"; // Set a directory you can create to test with.
        if (!Directory.Exists(directoryToWatch)){
            Directory.CreateDirectory(directoryToWatch);
        }
        FileSystemChangeMonitor monitor = new FileSystemChangeMonitor(directoryToWatch);
        MyApplicationService service = new MyApplicationService(monitor);

        Console.WriteLine("Monitoring started. Press any key to stop.");
        Console.ReadKey();
        monitor.StopMonitoring();
        Console.WriteLine("Monitoring stopped.");
    }
}
```

In a real application, a DI framework like Microsoft's built-in DI or Autofac, would typically handle the instantiation of these objects. This example illustrates the pattern.

**Why This Works:**

This approach ensures:

*   **Loose Coupling:** The application layer is not directly tied to the `FileSystemWatcher`. You can switch to a different monitoring mechanism, or a simulated one during testing, without breaking other layers.
*   **Testability:** The application service can be easily tested by mocking the `IFileSystemMonitor` interface to simulate different file system events.
*   **Maintainability:** Changes to file monitoring logic are isolated within the data access/infrastructure layer, reducing the risk of unexpected ripple effects.
*   **Reusability:** The monitoring component can be reused in different parts of the system or in other applications.

**Further Reading:**

If you want a deeper dive, I recommend these resources:

*   **_Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software_ by Eric Evans:** Though it does not focus explicitly on `FileSystemWatcher`, it explains clearly how to organize a system based on bounded context, which this layering approach follows.
*   **_Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture_ by Martin Fowler:** A must-read if you are interested in general layering, patterns for applications and separation of concern. This will help you better understand the "why" behind these architectures.
*   **Microsoft's Official Documentation on Dependency Injection:** For specifics on implementing dependency injection in C#. You’ll find great resources under the .net documentation.

In conclusion, while `FileSystemWatcher` can be powerful, it's crucial to integrate it judiciously, particularly within a layered architecture. The approach of encapsulating the `FileSystemWatcher` within a dedicated infrastructure/data access layer and decoupling it with an interface for use by the application layer will provide a far more robust and maintainable solution than integrating it directly into any other part of the application. Remember, the goal is to manage complexity, and layering, done well, is one of our strongest tools.
