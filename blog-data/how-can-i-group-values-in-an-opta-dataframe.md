Alright, let's tackle this. Grouping values in an Opta dataframe – I've been down that road quite a few times, especially back when we were building that complex player tracking system for the semi-pro league. It’s not always as straightforward as the pandas equivalent, primarily because Opta data often arrives in a format that demands a bit more wrangling before you can effectively group it. We’re dealing with a hierarchical structure sometimes nested deep in json or xml, and simply applying a group by isn’t going to cut it.

Fundamentally, you need to first ensure your dataframe is structured in a way that makes grouping logically possible. This usually means extracting the relevant columns or features that you want to use for grouping from nested structures. I recall a particularly challenging case involving Opta's F24 format. We had events nested under game objects, each with its own unique identifiers and associated data points. We couldn't directly group based on event type; we first had to flatten that structure into a tabular format.

Here's the general approach, with concrete examples:

**Step 1: Data Preparation – Flattening and Feature Extraction**

Before we even think about grouping, we need to make sure we have the data arranged properly. This usually involves un-nesting JSON or XML structures using the pandas `json_normalize` or custom parsers if it’s not structured as neatly as JSON. In our case, let's assume we have a DataFrame where each row represents an event in a football match, and this event contains nested data under a column called 'event_data'. This ‘event_data’ contains information such as the team id, player id, and location on the pitch. We need to extract these into their own columns.

```python
import pandas as pd
import json

def extract_event_data(df):
    # Example data simulating Opta event format, assume it is parsed into the dataframe already
    # if you are dealing with json data as string, use json.loads for parsing,
    # Example:
    # df = pd.DataFrame({'event_data_json_string': [ '{"typeId":1, "teamId":12, "playerId": 123, "location":{"x":23, "y":45}}', '{"typeId":2, "teamId":12, "playerId": 456, "location":{"x":78, "y":12}}' ]})
    # df['event_data'] = df['event_data_json_string'].apply(json.loads)


    df[['event_type_id', 'team_id', 'player_id']] = df['event_data'].apply(lambda x: pd.Series([x.get('typeId'), x.get('teamId'), x.get('playerId')]))
    df[['location_x','location_y']] = df['event_data'].apply(lambda x: pd.Series([x.get('location').get('x'), x.get('location').get('y')]))

    return df

# Example Usage:
data = {'event_data': [{'typeId':1, 'teamId':12, 'playerId': 123, 'location':{'x':23, 'y':45}},
                        {'typeId':2, 'teamId':12, 'playerId': 456, 'location':{'x':78, 'y':12}},
                        {'typeId':1, 'teamId':13, 'playerId': 789, 'location':{'x':90, 'y':22}},
                       {'typeId':2, 'teamId':13, 'playerId': 123, 'location':{'x':10, 'y':30}}]
        }

df_example = pd.DataFrame(data)
df_example = extract_event_data(df_example)

print(df_example)

```

This code first extracts the nested information into flat columns. This is crucial – you can't group by a path within a column. The `get` method is used to handle cases where some of these keys may be missing to avoid errors.

**Step 2: The Grouping Operation**

Now that we have flattened our structure, we can leverage the powerful `groupby()` functionality that pandas provides. We can group by any combination of the columns we’ve extracted. For example, if we want to group by `team_id` and then find the average location of events for each team, we can do it as below:

```python
def group_by_team_and_get_avg_location(df):
    grouped_data = df.groupby('team_id').agg(
      avg_location_x = pd.NamedAgg(column="location_x", aggfunc="mean"),
      avg_location_y = pd.NamedAgg(column="location_y", aggfunc="mean")
      )

    return grouped_data
grouped_df = group_by_team_and_get_avg_location(df_example)

print(grouped_df)
```

In this code snippet, we're grouping by `team_id` and calculating the average x and y location of the events for that team using `.agg()`. This is a powerful way to summarize data based on groups, and you can use various aggregations such as `sum`, `min`, `max`, `count` etc., depending on the analysis you need. The `pd.NamedAgg` allows us to label the output columns in a better way.

**Step 3: Handling Multiple Grouping Levels**

Often, you’ll need to group by multiple columns. For instance, you might want to see how player activity varies *within* a team. This requires multiple grouping levels. Using the example data we had earlier, let's group by `team_id` first and then group by `player_id` to find the number of events per player for each team. This would require a nested grouping.

```python
def group_by_team_and_player_event_count(df):
    grouped_data = df.groupby(['team_id', 'player_id']).agg(event_count = pd.NamedAgg(column="event_type_id", aggfunc="count"))

    return grouped_data

grouped_df_multilevel = group_by_team_and_player_event_count(df_example)
print(grouped_df_multilevel)
```

Here we are grouping first by `team_id` and then within each group, we are grouping by `player_id` and calculating the event count per player in each team. Notice the list of grouping columns given to `.groupby()`. This gives us a hierarchical index, which we can later manipulate and utilize for detailed analysis.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Data Types:** Make sure that the columns you are using for grouping and aggregations have the correct data types. If you are dealing with numbers stored as strings, you might need to convert those using `astype()` before performing calculations.
* **Missing Data:** Handle missing data appropriately. Opta data might have missing values, and you should decide whether to drop rows with missing values or fill them using methods like `fillna()` with appropriate strategies.
* **Performance:** If you are dealing with very large datasets, be mindful of performance. You might want to explore optimizing your code using vectorized operations or alternative libraries like Dask, that allows processing datasets too large to fit into memory.

**Recommended Resources:**

For a deeper dive into these concepts, I would highly recommend looking at "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney, the creator of Pandas. It’s an excellent resource for understanding data manipulation techniques in Pandas. Additionally, for more intricate analysis with hierarchical data, I suggest reading the pandas documentation on grouping, especially section dealing with "MultiIndex" and "Advanced Aggregation" it will prove quite helpful. I have also found that the 'Fluent Python' book by Luciano Ramalho offers great insights into Python programming, and while it doesn't focus solely on pandas, it covers fundamental Python concepts that are beneficial in the long run.

In conclusion, grouping data in an Opta DataFrame involves more than simply calling `groupby()`. You must first restructure your data to allow for logical grouping based on relevant features. This usually requires data extraction from complex structures, after that the basic pandas functionality of `.groupby` will work as expected. These simple yet effective methods have served me well over the years, and I hope they help you as well. Remember to pay attention to data types, handle missing data correctly, and think about performance if you have a lot of data. Happy coding.
