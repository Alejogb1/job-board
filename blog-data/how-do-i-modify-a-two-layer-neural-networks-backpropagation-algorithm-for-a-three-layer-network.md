Alright, let's tackle this. I've been down that road of extending network architectures a few times myself, and I recall quite vividly the moment I had to move beyond a simple two-layer model. It's more about understanding the underlying mechanism than anything else; once you've got that, extending it feels almost natural. Backpropagation, at its core, is just the chain rule of calculus applied to the parameters of your network, so adding layers simply means extending that chain.

The shift from two to three layers introduces an extra set of weights and biases, which also means an extra layer of gradients to calculate. The crucial change isn't in the fundamental backpropagation algorithm itself, but rather in how we recursively apply it from the output layer all the way back to the input layer. In a two-layer scenario, you're typically dealing with a single hidden layer and an output layer. When you introduce a third, it effectively becomes a sandwich – input, hidden layer 1, hidden layer 2, output.

Let me explain it in a way that will hopefully stick, along with some code snippets to make it more concrete. We'll assume, for simplicity's sake, that we're using the standard sigmoid activation function. Bear with me while I build a mental model.

**The Core Concept: Extending the Gradient Flow**

In a two-layer network, you calculate the error at the output and then backpropagate that error to adjust the weights and biases of the hidden layer. However, with a three-layer network, we have one more layer to backpropagate through. The error signal coming from the output layer now needs to be distributed across the weights connecting hidden layer 2 and the output, and then the resulting gradient is used to compute a gradient for the weights connecting hidden layer 1 and hidden layer 2.

Let's break down how this works for each layer in the 3-layer case:

1.  **Output Layer:** The gradient calculation here is pretty much the same as in a two-layer network, it uses the cost function derivative and output's activation derivative, all with respect to the output layer's weights and biases. This part is straightforward.

2.  **Hidden Layer 2:** This is where the extension comes in. The error signal is backpropagated from the output layer, multiplied with the derivative of the activation of layer 2, and the weights connecting hidden layer 2 and the output layer. The crucial bit is that this result now becomes the ‘error’ term for adjusting hidden layer 1.

3.  **Hidden Layer 1:** The error from the previous step (hidden layer 2), again multiplied with its activation derivative, and the weights connecting hidden layer 1 and hidden layer 2 are now used to calculate the gradients of layer 1.

**Code Example 1: Forward Propagation**

Let's begin with how forward propagation would look like. This sets up the activation values we use later in the backward pass. For demonstration, we'll stick to a basic feed-forward approach.

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x * (1 - x) # note this assumes x is the activation and not the input of the sigmoid

def forward_propagation(input_data, weights1, biases1, weights2, biases2, weights3, biases3):
    layer1_output = sigmoid(np.dot(input_data, weights1) + biases1)
    layer2_output = sigmoid(np.dot(layer1_output, weights2) + biases2)
    layer3_output = sigmoid(np.dot(layer2_output, weights3) + biases3)
    return layer1_output, layer2_output, layer3_output
```
This snippet shows how to take the dot product of inputs and weights and add biases, then pass it through the activation to get your layer output. It's straightforward and builds the layers up. We return these because these values are critical in the back propagation pass.

**Code Example 2: Back Propagation**

Now for the meat of the matter. Here's the backpropagation implementation. Pay particular attention to how the error signal is passed back from each layer.

```python
def back_propagation(input_data, target, layer1_output, layer2_output, layer3_output, weights1, weights2, weights3):
    #Output layer error
    output_error = (layer3_output - target) * sigmoid_derivative(layer3_output)

    #Hidden Layer 2 error
    hidden2_error = np.dot(output_error, weights3.T) * sigmoid_derivative(layer2_output)

    #Hidden Layer 1 error
    hidden1_error = np.dot(hidden2_error, weights2.T) * sigmoid_derivative(layer1_output)

    # Calculate gradients
    d_weights3 = np.dot(layer2_output.T, output_error)
    d_biases3 = np.sum(output_error, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    d_weights2 = np.dot(layer1_output.T, hidden2_error)
    d_biases2 = np.sum(hidden2_error, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    d_weights1 = np.dot(input_data.T, hidden1_error)
    d_biases1 = np.sum(hidden1_error, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    return d_weights1, d_biases1, d_weights2, d_biases2, d_weights3, d_biases3
```
Notice how the output error is calculated, and then this is used to propagate back to the layer before, and so on. The derivative of the activation is key here, this allows us to scale the back propagated error by the local gradient of the activation. The gradient for weights and biases are calculated using the error values.

**Code Example 3: Putting it Together**
Lastly, let's do an example implementation of training with our newly created functions.

```python
def train(input_data, target, weights1, biases1, weights2, biases2, weights3, biases3, learning_rate, epochs):
  for i in range(epochs):
    layer1_output, layer2_output, layer3_output = forward_propagation(input_data, weights1, biases1, weights2, biases2, weights3, biases3)
    d_weights1, d_biases1, d_weights2, d_biases2, d_weights3, d_biases3 = back_propagation(input_data, target, layer1_output, layer2_output, layer3_output, weights1, weights2, weights3)
    weights1 -= learning_rate * d_weights1
    biases1 -= learning_rate * d_biases1
    weights2 -= learning_rate * d_weights2
    biases2 -= learning_rate * d_biases2
    weights3 -= learning_rate * d_weights3
    biases3 -= learning_rate * d_biases3
    if i % 100 == 0:
        loss = np.mean(np.square(layer3_output - target))
        print(f"Epoch {i}, loss: {loss}")
  return weights1, biases1, weights2, biases2, weights3, biases3
```

Here you can see a simple implementation of training that involves using the forward and backpropagation functions. The loss is calculated as mean square error to show the progress of training.

**Important considerations:**

*   **Initialization:** How you initialize your weights matters. A common approach is using random values from a normal distribution.
*   **Activation Function Derivatives:** ensure you're using the correct derivative of your activation function.
*   **Learning Rate:** Proper tuning of the learning rate is important for convergence.
*   **Vectorization:** These examples use numpy for simplicity; efficient implementations will utilize vectorization for performance.
*   **Numerical Stability:** Pay attention to numerical stability as it can make a substantial difference when training.

For deeper reading and a more comprehensive understanding, I recommend these resources:

*   **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This is a classic textbook that covers all the fundamentals of neural networks, including detailed explanations of backpropagation. The section on multi-layer perceptrons and backpropagation is particularly relevant.
*   **"Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen:** This is a free online book that offers a very clear and accessible explanation of neural networks. The chapter on backpropagation is fantastic.
*   **Papers related to gradient optimization:** Explore literature related to Adam, SGD with momentum, and other optimization algorithms, to improve performance and stability of training.

Essentially, modifying backpropagation for an additional layer is about carefully propagating the error from the output layer back through each hidden layer, one at a time. It is very important to keep the error signal and their derivatives correct. If you get that, then the rest is just a matter of careful implementation. The code examples should give you a solid foundation, but don't hesitate to dig further into the cited resources. Good luck!
