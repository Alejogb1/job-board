Alright,  I’ve been down this road a few times, specifically in projects dealing with controlled text generation where analyzing the model's confidence is paramount. The typical T5 output, be it through `generate()` or a standard forward pass, often yields generated text, or perhaps token ids directly. However, accessing the logits—the raw, pre-softmax outputs of the model—requires a slightly different approach. I'll walk you through how I've handled it, focusing on the practical aspects.

The critical understanding here is that we need to modify the way the model's forward pass is executed or hook into intermediate calculations, bypassing the standard `generate()` method that handles softmax application by default. Usually, when using transformers from Hugging Face, the forward function returns the `logits` along with other outputs like `past_key_values`, which the generator function uses. This means, in a sense, the logits are there, but you have to know how to retrieve them before they’re transformed into a probability distribution.

**Basic Approach Using a Forward Pass**

First, let's consider a basic forward pass to extract logits without using the generate function. In most cases, you’d first tokenize your input text and prepare it for the model. Next, feed those tokens directly into the model's forward pass and retrieve the logits. This isn't a particularly efficient way to generate text; it's really meant for investigation or specific use-cases where you control the decoding procedure yourself.

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-small"  # Or any T5 variant
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Input text
input_text = "translate English to German: Hello, how are you?"

# Tokenize input
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Perform a forward pass
with torch.no_grad():  # disable gradient calculation
  outputs = model(**inputs, return_dict=True) # return_dict = True for easier access to logits

# Access the logits
logits = outputs.logits

print(f"Logits shape: {logits.shape}") # typically [batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]
```

This snippet shows how you can extract the `logits` directly. Note that `torch.no_grad()` is used since we aren’t updating weights, and it also improves computational efficiency. The shape of the logits tensor is crucial here. You’ll notice it's typically `[batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]`. The `sequence_length` corresponds to the length of your target output if you’ve provided decoder input IDs, but it will correlate to encoder input sequence length if you haven't provided specific decoder input ids. Each vector along the `vocab_size` dimension represents the logit score for each token in the vocabulary. You can then apply softmax to obtain the probability distribution over those tokens.

**Modifying `generate()` for Logit Access**

Now, the above method is useful for analyzing the raw model outputs, but usually, we want to generate text and still have access to logits, especially if we're doing something like beam search or other forms of constrained generation. To capture logits during the generate function, we need to dive a little deeper and use the `output_scores` and `return_dict_in_generate` parameters available in the `generate()` method.

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Input text
input_text = "translate English to German: Hello, how are you?"

# Tokenize input
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")


# Generate with output scores enabled
with torch.no_grad():
  outputs = model.generate(
      **inputs,
      output_scores=True,
      return_dict_in_generate=True,
      max_new_tokens=30  # or any suitable length
  )

# Extract logits
transition_scores = outputs.scores
print(f"Transition scores shape (list of tensors): {[t.shape for t in transition_scores]}")

generated_tokens = outputs.sequences
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(generated_tokens[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(f"Generated Text: {generated_text}")
```

Here, by setting `output_scores=True` and `return_dict_in_generate=True`, the `generate()` function not only returns the generated sequence but also a sequence of the model’s scores (logits) at each step. The shape of each element in the `transition_scores` list is `[batch_size, vocab_size]`, corresponding to the logits produced at each decoding step. It's a list, because the decoding happens step-by-step, so each element corresponds to the logits for the next token, after the previous tokens have already been processed.  If the `generate` function outputs multiple sequences, then the first dimension will represent the number of beams, i.e., batch\_size times num\_beams. The `transition_scores` holds the scores of the model before the application of the softmax function. You may have to apply softmax yourself if you want to obtain probabilities.

**Customizing Decoding Loops for Granular Control**

Sometimes, neither the standard forward pass nor the augmented `generate()` function provides the necessary control. In those situations, you'd have to implement a custom generation loop, manually controlling the decoding step-by-step and extracting logits after each step. This is significantly more complex, but offers fine-grained access for things like dynamic beam size or sampling mechanisms. I’ll give you a simplified version as an illustration, keeping it a bit abstracted:

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

model_name = "t5-small"  # Or any T5 variant
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

input_text = "translate English to German: Hello, how are you?"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Initialize the decoder input with the pad token, or BOS token in some cases
decoder_input_ids = torch.tensor([[model.config.pad_token_id]], device=model.device) # Pad token id

all_logits = [] # list to hold logits at each step.

max_length=30
with torch.no_grad():
    for i in range(max_length):

      outputs = model(
          input_ids=inputs.input_ids,
          attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask,
          decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids,
          return_dict = True
      )

      logits = outputs.logits[:, -1, :] # taking only the last token's logits
      all_logits.append(logits)

      next_token_id = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)
      decoder_input_ids = torch.cat([decoder_input_ids, next_token_id.unsqueeze(0)], dim=1) # add new predicted token

    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(decoder_input_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(f"Generated Text: {generated_text}")
print(f"Logits shape: {[l.shape for l in all_logits]}") # Logits shape is per decoding step
```

In this third example, I’ve implemented a basic, greedy decoding loop. The key here is that at each iteration, we're calling the model directly and extracting the `logits`. This allows us to inspect or manipulate them before deciding which token to generate next. This level of control is invaluable for custom decoding strategies.  Note that this is a simple greedy strategy, and there are other, more sophisticated techniques like beam search or nucleus sampling that you can adapt similarly.

**Closing Remarks**

Navigating the different ways of accessing logits in transformer models like T5 requires a solid understanding of the inner workings of both the model architecture and the library you are using. The examples above cover a good starting point, going from basic forward passes, to modifying the generate function, and finally a fully custom decode loop. I strongly advise diving into the Hugging Face Transformers library documentation and checking out research papers about sequence generation and decoding strategies to understand better the various subtleties. Specifically, the paper *Attention is All You Need* (Vaswani et al., 2017) provides a foundational understanding of transformer architectures. Further, I found the “Natural Language Processing with Transformers” book by Tunstall, von Werra and Wolf (O'Reilly, 2022) an incredibly helpful resource for diving into the implementation specifics of transformer models and their use in text generation. Mastering these details can provide significant control and flexibility for your custom applications.
