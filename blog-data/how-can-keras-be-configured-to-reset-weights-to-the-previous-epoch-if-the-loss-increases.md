Let's tackle this. It’s a problem I’ve faced multiple times in my career, particularly when dealing with volatile datasets or finetuning complex architectures where unexpected loss spikes can throw off the training process. The question of how to revert to previous weights in Keras upon a loss increase touches on fundamental training dynamics and how we can exert finer control over them.

The core issue revolves around the standard optimization process: by default, Keras, along with its underlying framework (like TensorFlow or Theano), progresses forward at each epoch, updating weights based on the gradients calculated from the current batch of data. If the loss increases, these updated weights, by definition, are less effective than their predecessors. To achieve the desired behavior, we need to introduce a mechanism that monitors the loss, determines whether an increase has occurred, and if so, restores the weights to their state before the current training epoch began.

This isn't a built-in feature directly provided by Keras' training loop, which means we must implement custom logic, primarily through the use of custom callbacks. Callbacks, in Keras, are powerful tools that allow us to insert code snippets at specific points in the training process, such as the start or end of an epoch.

Here's how I'd typically approach this using a custom callback. Firstly, I’ll outline the necessary steps before presenting code examples:

1. **Store Weights at Epoch Start:** At the beginning of each epoch, we save the model’s weights. We need a mechanism to do this efficiently, without bogging down training by doing deep copies every single time. The callback will need an attribute to hold the weight's snapshot from the previous epoch.
2. **Monitor Loss at Epoch End:** At the end of each epoch, we check if the current epoch’s loss is greater than the previous epoch’s loss (or a defined ‘best loss’ tracker).
3. **Restore Previous Weights:** If the loss has increased, we load the previously stored weights, effectively reverting the model’s state to its more promising position.
4. **Handle First Epoch:** The very first epoch is special, there's no “previous” epoch to revert to so this needs to be handled appropriately. Typically, I’d skip the revert on epoch 0 but ensure weights are saved for epoch 1.

Now let's look at this in code. Here's the first implementation showcasing these ideas:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

class RevertOnLossIncrease(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.best_loss = np.inf # Initialize with a large value
        self.previous_weights = None

    def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None):
        if epoch > 0: # Skip the very first epoch
           self.previous_weights = self.model.get_weights()

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        current_loss = logs.get('loss')

        if current_loss is not None and current_loss > self.best_loss:
            if self.previous_weights is not None:
                self.model.set_weights(self.previous_weights)
                print(f"\nEpoch {epoch+1}: Loss increased. Reverting to previous weights.")
            else:
                print("\nEpoch {epoch+1}: Loss increased, but no previous weights were stored, skipping revert.")
        else:
            if current_loss is not None:
                self.best_loss = current_loss

# Example Usage
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
x_train = np.random.random((100, 10))
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, (100, 1))

revert_callback = RevertOnLossIncrease()
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, callbacks=[revert_callback], verbose=0) # Verbosity 0 to keep the ouput clean
```

In this first example, we focus on the fundamental implementation and ensure it works as expected. Note how verbose output is handled through the 'verbose=0' parameter in fit() to prevent the epoch-by-epoch output mixing in with the callback-specific outputs.

However, this is a basic version. It has a glaring problem: it's using simple float comparison, which can be unreliable because of floating-point arithmetic's inexactness. A tiny fluctuation in the loss might trigger an unnecessary revert. Let’s improve it by adding a tolerance threshold to avoid accidental reverts:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

class RevertOnLossIncreaseWithTolerance(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, tolerance=1e-5):
        super().__init__()
        self.best_loss = np.inf
        self.previous_weights = None
        self.tolerance = tolerance

    def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None):
        if epoch > 0:
            self.previous_weights = self.model.get_weights()

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        current_loss = logs.get('loss')

        if current_loss is not None and (current_loss - self.best_loss) > self.tolerance:
            if self.previous_weights is not None:
                self.model.set_weights(self.previous_weights)
                print(f"\nEpoch {epoch+1}: Loss increased by {current_loss - self.best_loss:0.8f}. Reverting to previous weights.")
            else:
                print("\nEpoch {epoch+1}: Loss increased but no previous weights to revert.")
        elif current_loss is not None:
            self.best_loss = current_loss


# Example Usage
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
x_train = np.random.random((100, 10))
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, (100, 1))

revert_callback = RevertOnLossIncreaseWithTolerance(tolerance=1e-4)
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, callbacks=[revert_callback], verbose=0)
```

Here, I’ve included a `tolerance` parameter that is used to determine if a loss increase is significant. This adds robustness.

Finally, let’s add a bit of polish and make the revert operation less naive. Instead of directly reverting, we could potentially keep a history of ‘best’ weights encountered during training and revert to that globally optimal point. This requires an additional data structure but allows our model to recover from more than a single bad epoch.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

class RevertToBestOnIncrease(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, tolerance=1e-5):
        super().__init__()
        self.best_loss = np.inf
        self.best_weights = None
        self.tolerance = tolerance

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        current_loss = logs.get('loss')

        if current_loss is not None:
            if (current_loss - self.best_loss) > self.tolerance:
               if self.best_weights is not None:
                   self.model.set_weights(self.best_weights)
                   print(f"\nEpoch {epoch+1}: Loss increased by {current_loss - self.best_loss:0.8f}. Reverting to best weights.")
               else:
                   print(f"\nEpoch {epoch+1}: Loss increased and no best weights to revert.")
            elif current_loss < self.best_loss:
                self.best_loss = current_loss
                self.best_weights = self.model.get_weights()


# Example usage
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
x_train = np.random.random((100, 10))
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, (100, 1))

revert_callback = RevertToBestOnIncrease(tolerance=1e-4)
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, callbacks=[revert_callback], verbose=0)
```

In this third implementation we’re now storing the best weights globally, not just the weights from the previous epoch. This allows us to ‘jump back’ to a better point in training should a particularly bad epoch push us far away from the local minima we’re trying to find.

These callbacks provide ways to manage the training procedure more robustly. For a deeper dive into the mathematics of optimization and the intricacies of training deep learning models, I'd recommend consulting the “Deep Learning” book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville or the book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen. Additionally, for specific techniques related to regularization and optimization, research papers on topics such as Adam, SGD and related optimizers might be helpful. It is crucial to keep in mind that this callback’s behavior will depend on the specific properties of your dataset and the architecture you are using. Proper experimentation is key to determine the optimal settings for any given task.
