Alright, let's talk about max pooling kernel sizes. I've spent quite a bit of time tinkering with these in different contexts, and it's not always as straightforward as grabbing the first option off the shelf. The ‘optimal’ size really depends on the specifics of your data and what you're trying to achieve with your model, so a one-size-fits-all answer doesn’t really exist. But, I can share some insights that should help guide your decisions.

First off, let's quickly recap what max pooling actually does. It's a downsampling operation. Within a given kernel (or window), it selects the maximum value and discards the rest. This has several benefits: it reduces the spatial dimensions of your feature maps, which in turn decreases the number of parameters in your model and thereby decreases computational load. It also adds a degree of translational invariance, meaning that small shifts in the input won't drastically alter the features it extracts. Think of it as a kind of spatial feature summarization.

Now, onto the core of the question – how do we select the kernel size? The most common options are 2x2, 3x3, and occasionally 5x5, or even larger. However, sizes beyond 5x5 are rarer and generally only relevant for very large input images where massive downsampling is beneficial.

**The 2x2 Kernel: A Workhorse**

The 2x2 kernel with a stride of 2 is practically the default in most convolutional neural networks. Its main advantage is that it halves the dimensions of your feature maps with each pooling layer. This is a good balance between aggressive downsampling and retaining spatial information. It generally works well for tasks where you need to progressively reduce the input size, but don't want to obliterate the details. I’ve frequently used 2x2 kernels, particularly when dealing with image classification problems with relatively high input resolutions, such as 256x256 or higher. It allows the network to learn features at multiple scales without becoming computationally overwhelming. I once worked on a project involving satellite imagery classification where cascading multiple conv layers followed by 2x2 max pooling proved quite effective in capturing spatial patterns at varying granularities.

Here’s a simplified example in Python using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume input_tensor is of shape (batch_size, height, width, channels)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 28, 28, 3))  # Example input of a 28x28 RGB image

max_pool_2x2 = tf.nn.max_pool(input_tensor,
                            ksize=[1, 2, 2, 1],
                            strides=[1, 2, 2, 1],
                            padding='VALID')

print(f"Input shape: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Output shape after 2x2 pooling: {max_pool_2x2.shape}")
```
Notice how the spatial dimensions are reduced by a factor of 2 due to the kernel size of 2x2 and stride of 2.

**The 3x3 Kernel: When More Context is Needed**

Moving to a 3x3 kernel with a typical stride of 2 or 3 provides a larger receptive field, allowing the pooling operation to consider a broader context. It retains more spatial information compared to 2x2 and consequently downsamples less aggressively. This can be beneficial in situations where preserving fine details is more important, such as object detection tasks or semantic segmentation. Consider for example, a scenario involving identifying small objects within an image. While 2x2 might miss some of these, a 3x3 would offer more spatial context from which features can be summarized, leading to better feature representation. A 3x3 max pooling works well when you need some extra spatial aggregation without discarding too many pixels.

Here is an example demonstrating the impact of a 3x3 kernel:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 28, 28, 3)) # Example input

max_pool_3x3 = tf.nn.max_pool(input_tensor,
                            ksize=[1, 3, 3, 1],
                            strides=[1, 2, 2, 1],
                            padding='VALID')


print(f"Input shape: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Output shape after 3x3 pooling with stride 2: {max_pool_3x3.shape}")
```
Here we used a 3x3 kernel with a stride of 2. This shows how even with an increase in kernel size, we are still able to reduce the dimensions. The reduction is less aggressive than the 2x2 version above due to the larger kernel size, and the dimensions become 13x13 instead of 14x14 (resulting from the 2x2 kernel) given an input of 28x28.

**Larger Kernels: Niche Cases**

Larger kernels like 5x5, or occasionally larger, are less commonly used and typically reserved for very specific cases. For instance, if you’re dealing with exceptionally large images with abundant redundant information, or your input features have very large, uniform areas, using a 5x5 kernel can offer considerable downsampling, allowing you to capture high-level features more efficiently. However, this comes at the cost of more aggressive information loss and requires careful evaluation as it might lead to the model missing crucial details.

Here's an example demonstrating a 5x5 kernel:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 28, 28, 3)) # Example input

max_pool_5x5 = tf.nn.max_pool(input_tensor,
                            ksize=[1, 5, 5, 1],
                            strides=[1, 2, 2, 1],
                            padding='VALID')


print(f"Input shape: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Output shape after 5x5 pooling with stride 2: {max_pool_5x5.shape}")
```

In this example, note the further reduction in spatial dimensions compared to the 2x2 and 3x3 examples. With a stride of 2, it results in a shape of 12x12.

**Choosing the 'Optimal' Size: A Process of Experimentation**

In practical terms, the selection of the "optimal" size is an iterative process informed by the specific problem and dataset at hand. In most of my experience, I generally begin with 2x2 max pooling and then assess performance. If the model is struggling to capture certain features, I explore larger kernel sizes, such as 3x3, while keeping in mind potential information loss. It's crucial to evaluate performance on a validation dataset, not just on the training set, to prevent overfitting due to overly aggressive downsampling.

I found it particularly helpful to look at the "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition" paper (often cited as VGGNet) by Simonyan and Zisserman, which explains the architectural considerations for pooling. Also, the book “Deep Learning” by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville offers excellent explanations on the principles and practical implications of pooling. Additionally, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron provides hands-on insights, while not specifically focused on pooling kernel sizes, it explains model building and evaluating techniques which are invaluable during the model building process. I also frequently look at papers from the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) and the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) for the latest developments.

The decision isn’t just about performance metrics either. It's also about computational cost. Larger kernels reduce the spatial dimensions more aggressively but also lead to less information retention. This could be fine for some tasks but not for others. Balancing that trade-off is crucial.

Ultimately, the optimal max pooling kernel size is best determined by experimentation and careful analysis of the validation set performance. Don't be afraid to test different sizes and combinations of pooling layers, coupled with different convolutional layers. The best answer is the one that gets the best performance within your computational constraints.
