Okay, let's tackle this. I remember one particularly challenging project back in 2018, where we had a core data processing module written in Python, containerized, and then several independent microservices, also containerized, that needed to use that core module. It wasn’t as straightforward as just dropping files into a shared directory, and we had to get quite clever with our solution. Importing a Dockerized Python module from a separate Docker container isn't inherently supported in a direct, module-like import sense because each container is, by design, isolated. However, with some clever maneuvering, we can achieve the functional equivalent. The core lies in understanding how to expose and access the required code.

At its heart, the problem is one of resource access. Containers operate in their own namespaces and filesystems, preventing direct access between them. We have three principal paths, broadly speaking, to navigate this: building the module into both containers at build time, using a shared volume, or exposing the module via an API and having the consumer communicate that way.

Let’s begin by discussing building the module into both containers. This is probably the most straightforward method conceptually, but it is not always practical. If you modify the module, you have to rebuild all dependent containers, which quickly becomes a maintenance nightmare. The general idea here is to copy the Python module into each container during the Docker build process, ensuring it's within the python path. You can achieve this via the `COPY` instruction in your `Dockerfile`.

Here is a simplified example of how this process might look in a consumer container’s `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for consumer container
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the module from a specific location
COPY ./path/to/your/module /app/my_module

# Copy the rest of your application
COPY ./consumer_code /app/consumer_code

WORKDIR /app/consumer_code
# Install requirements if you have them
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

In this scenario, the `COPY ./path/to/your/module /app/my_module` line specifically copies the directory containing your module to a location (`/app/my_module`) within the container. Because the module's directory is then located inside a directory `/app`, it should be discoverable when running python inside the container. This might be suitable for very simple, rarely-changing libraries, but it introduces significant limitations for more dynamic applications.

Next, let’s explore using shared volumes. A volume is a way to persist data that is independent of a specific container. Docker volumes can be mounted in multiple containers, enabling data, and crucially, our module's code, to be shared between containers. This approach involves creating a named volume and then mounting this volume to both the module-containing and module-using containers. This is beneficial since you don't need to rebuild the consumer container if the shared module changes.

Here is an example of how this can be achieved using `docker-compose` (while you can achieve this using docker run command as well, using docker-compose often results in cleaner and more easily repeatable setups):

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  module_container:
    build: ./module_service # Path to the module's Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - my_shared_volume:/app/my_module  # Mount volume here
    # You can optionally run the module here if you wish, or leave it to run on-demand

  consumer_container:
    build: ./consumer_service # Path to the consumer's Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - my_shared_volume:/app/my_module  # Mount volume here
    depends_on:
        - module_container # Consumer depends on the module container, or at least needs that shared volume.

volumes:
  my_shared_volume:
```

In the above `docker-compose.yml`, `my_shared_volume` is declared as a shared volume, then mounted at the same path in each container. In this approach, we’d build a separate image for the module container, then populate `/app/my_module` with the module code. The consumer would have this directory accessible as well. The key is to set this up consistently in both containers.
Inside the Python code running in the consumer container, you would then import the module as if it were local:

```python
# consumer_code/main.py

import my_module.some_function

my_module.some_function()
```

The final approach, and arguably the most robust for many use cases, is exposing the module functionality via an API. Instead of directly importing the Python code, the consumer container interacts with the module through HTTP or other networking protocols. The module would become an API service rather than simply a package. While this requires more upfront work, it decouples the services more effectively, enhancing scalability and allowing for the module to be more easily changed, potentially even swapped out, without affecting the consumers.

Here is a skeletal example of the module’s code using a minimal framework, like Flask, to demonstrate:

```python
# module_service/app.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

def my_module_function():
   return {"status": "success", "message": "Functionality from my module was used"}

@app.route('/api/use-module')
def use_module():
    result = my_module_function()
    return jsonify(result)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

```

The consumer container would then send requests to the specified endpoint, and handle the returned JSON accordingly. Note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you'd need to consider security, error handling, and data serialization. In this example the consumer container can use the Python requests library to obtain the JSON data from this endpoint.

The choice between these methods often depends on the specific project requirements, how often the module changes, the size of the module, and your team's experience.

For deeper insights, you should familiarize yourself with concepts such as Docker volumes (particularly bind mounts and named volumes as discussed) and networking between Docker containers. Look at the Docker documentation itself which is incredibly thorough. Additionally, I’d recommend “Docker in Practice” by Ian Miell and Aidan Hobson Sayers for real-world strategies, or “The Docker Book” by James Turnbull for a more foundational understanding. These resources will prove invaluable as you navigate similar situations. “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” by Martin Kleppmann is not directly related to containerization, but its discussions on service architecture will be useful when considering the API approach.

In summary, while directly importing code between containers isn’t possible without creating a shared file location, using a shared volume or exposing your module as an API are effective approaches that address the core need. Each method presents its trade-offs, so selecting the most appropriate one depends on your specific circumstances.
