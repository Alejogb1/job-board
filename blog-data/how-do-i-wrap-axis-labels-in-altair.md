Alright,  I've certainly bumped into this particular formatting challenge with Altair countless times, especially when visualizing datasets with long, descriptive categories. It's a common frustration, really. The default behavior of truncating or overlapping axis labels simply isn't acceptable for professional-looking charts. So, wrapping the labels becomes a necessity. It's not baked-in as a single, straightforward option within Altair, but the flexibility of the Vega-Lite spec, which Altair sits on top of, does allow for several workarounds. I'll walk you through a few techniques I've found effective over the years, each with its pros and cons.

First off, let’s be clear: we're not directly setting a "wrap" property. Instead, we're leveraging a combination of strategies that use things like adjusting the angle of the labels, using newline characters within the labels themselves, or even employing Vega expressions to dynamically manipulate how those labels are displayed. These approaches, when executed well, give the desired effect.

The initial and simplest method is to adjust the angle of the axis labels. This can alleviate some overlap issues, especially when the labels are just moderately long. While it doesn't technically wrap them, a tilted label can often prevent the ugliness of truncation. Here’s a basic code example:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['Very Long Category Name One', 'Another Extremely Lengthy Category Name',
                   'A Slightly Longer Category', 'Short Category'],
        'value': [10, 15, 12, 8]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('category', axis=alt.Axis(labelAngle=-45)),
    y='value'
)
chart
```

Running this code tilts the x-axis labels at a -45 degree angle. The `labelAngle` parameter within the `alt.Axis` object controls this. Negative angles tilt the labels counterclockwise. While this example doesn't wrap text, it’s the first technique I usually try, simply because it’s quick and often sufficient. If this doesn't completely solve the issue, it gets me closer.

Now, if tilting isn’t enough, we can move onto the next technique: inserting explicit newline characters (`\n`) into the labels. This method requires pre-processing the data before it’s passed to Altair but gives you the most control. This approach forces the text to break onto new lines at the specific locations you define. Let's see that in action:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['Very Long Category Name One', 'Another Extremely Lengthy Category Name',
                   'A Slightly Longer Category', 'Short Category'],
        'value': [10, 15, 12, 8]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def wrap_labels(text, max_length=15):
    words = text.split()
    wrapped_text = ""
    current_line = ""
    for word in words:
        if len(current_line + " " + word) <= max_length:
            current_line += (" " + word) if current_line else word
        else:
            wrapped_text += current_line + "\n"
            current_line = word
    wrapped_text += current_line
    return wrapped_text

df['wrapped_category'] = df['category'].apply(wrap_labels)


chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='wrapped_category:N',
    y='value'
)
chart

```

In this example, I’ve defined a `wrap_labels` function. This simple function splits the input string by spaces and adds newline characters (`\n`) to break the string into lines based on the defined `max_length`. This lets us pre-format the labels exactly how we want. Note that the `x` encoding needs to indicate that `wrapped_category` is nominal (`:N`) since we've modified the labels. The limitation here is that it’s somewhat rigid: you have to decide on a max length beforehand, and might need to refine this value based on your specific use-case. But overall, it works well when you need specific control over the wrapping logic.

Finally, for the most sophisticated method, we can leverage Vega-Lite expressions directly. Altair allows passing Vega-Lite configurations, and this gives us a high degree of flexibility. It also avoids the need to pre-process your data like in the previous method. We'll use the `labelExpr` property of the axis definition. Here’s a simplified example of how you could accomplish that:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['Very Long Category Name One', 'Another Extremely Lengthy Category Name',
                   'A Slightly Longer Category', 'Short Category'],
        'value': [10, 15, 12, 8]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)


chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
  x=alt.X('category:N', axis=alt.Axis(
        labelExpr="substring(datum.value, 0, 15) + (length(datum.value) > 15 ? '...' : '')",
      )
    ),
    y='value'
)
chart
```

This version utilizes a Vega expression within the axis configuration. The `labelExpr` here uses `substring` to grab the first 15 characters of the category label and adds ellipsis if the length is greater than 15 characters, providing a form of truncation. This can also be used to create multiline labels based on string splitting within the expression itself, but that requires a bit more complexity in that expression definition, something I would normally advise against unless truly required. This approach provides great flexibility, as we’re effectively scripting how the labels are displayed dynamically based on the data.

Let’s talk briefly about recommended resources. If you are going to be working with complex chart customizations regularly, I would suggest looking into these:

1.  **The Vega-Lite Documentation:** This is *the* source of truth for how Altair charts work. You can find it easily online, and it details all configurations possible via the Vega-Lite specification. This document lets you deeply understand the configurations that you can pass through Altair.
2.  **"Interactive Data Visualization for the Web" by Scott Murray**: While focusing more on D3.js, it offers an exceptional explanation of core visualization concepts, which is incredibly helpful for better comprehending how Vega-Lite (and therefore Altair) renders its charts, and the underlying principles that you should be thinking about when making visualizations.
3.  **"Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic:** This is less technical but is essential for understanding best practices in creating clear and effective data visualizations. It reinforces the importance of readable labels and helps contextualize why solving these sorts of visual issues are important in practice.

In my experience, the best approach is often a combination of these techniques. Start with a simple angle adjustment, then, if that’s not sufficient, pre-process with newline characters for more control, and finally, consider Vega expressions for the most dynamic and flexible, but complex, solutions. The right choice will depend on the complexity of your data and the level of customization you require. The examples above should serve as a solid foundation to get your labels just the way you need them.
