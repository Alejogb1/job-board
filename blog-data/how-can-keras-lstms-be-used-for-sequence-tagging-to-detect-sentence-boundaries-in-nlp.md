Okay, let’s tackle this interesting challenge. Sequence tagging with LSTMs for sentence boundary detection; I've spent quite a bit of time with this problem in the past, particularly when dealing with noisy transcripts from an older speech-to-text system where punctuation was… let's say *optional*. It's a worthwhile exercise that really showcases the power of recurrent neural networks, specifically lstms, when properly applied to natural language processing.

The core idea here is to frame sentence boundary detection not as a binary classification problem (sentence/not-sentence), but as a sequence tagging task. In sequence tagging, we assign a label to each token (usually words or subwords) in the input sequence. For sentence boundary detection, this label can indicate whether a token is the end of a sentence or not. This approach allows us to leverage the temporal dependencies present in the text, which is where lstms truly shine. They process the sequence step-by-step, maintaining a hidden state that captures information from past tokens, thereby making informed predictions about the likelihood of a sentence ending at a given point.

Let's break down the process and why specific choices are made. First, we need our training data, which requires text with sentence boundaries clearly marked. A common way to represent this is using a simple "b-end" or "i-cont" (beginning-end, intermediate-continue) tagging scheme. For instance, given the sentence "this is a sentence. and here is another." the tagged version could be:

`[("this", "i-cont"), ("is", "i-cont"), ("a", "i-cont"), ("sentence", "b-end"), ("and", "i-cont"), ("here", "i-cont"), ("is", "i-cont"), ("another", "b-end")]`

This illustrates how each word is tagged based on whether it is an intermediate part of a sentence ("i-cont") or the boundary of a sentence ("b-end"). This makes it a sequence tagging exercise, and it's this format that allows us to train our lstm model.

Now, consider the keras model itself. We’ll need a couple key components: An embedding layer to convert words into dense vector representations, an LSTM layer to process the sequence and capture temporal dependencies, and a dense layer with softmax activation to provide our tagging probabilities.

Here's a first code snippet illustrating the construction of a basic lstm model for sequence tagging using Keras:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

def create_lstm_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, lstm_units, num_tags):
    input_layer = Input(shape=(None,))  # Variable-length input sequence
    embedding_layer = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)(input_layer)
    lstm_layer = LSTM(units=lstm_units, return_sequences=True)(embedding_layer)
    output_layer = Dense(units=num_tags, activation='softmax')(lstm_layer) # Softmax for tag probabilities

    model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
```

In this first example, we’re keeping the configuration relatively straightforward. We define our input layer to take a variable-length sequence. The output from the dense layer will be a probability distribution across our tags (in this case, `b-end` and `i-cont`), so we use the softmax activation. Note that this snippet does not cover data preparation and relies on the input already being processed into sequences of token ids.

The training process involves feeding the model token sequences and their corresponding tags. Given the categorical outputs, our loss function is `categorical_crossentropy`.

Let’s move to the next example, which focuses on the crucial part of preparing data. To train the model effectively, our text needs to be converted into a numerical representation that the model can understand. Here’s an example of how this data preprocessing might occur, including padding sequences to a fixed length if needed:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

def preprocess_data(sentences, tags, max_len=None):
    tokenizer = Tokenizer(oov_token="<unk>")  # Handles out-of-vocabulary words
    tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)
    word_index = tokenizer.word_index
    vocab_size = len(word_index) + 1

    tokenized_sentences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences)

    if max_len is None:
        max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in tokenized_sentences)

    padded_sentences = pad_sequences(tokenized_sentences, padding='post', maxlen=max_len)

    tag_to_index = {"i-cont": 0, "b-end": 1}
    num_tags = len(tag_to_index)

    encoded_tags = [[tag_to_index[tag] for tag in seq] for seq in tags]
    padded_tags = pad_sequences(encoded_tags, padding='post', maxlen=max_len)
    categorical_tags = to_categorical(padded_tags, num_classes=num_tags)

    return padded_sentences, categorical_tags, vocab_size, max_len, tag_to_index
```

This function handles tokenizing the text, using a `<unk>` token for out-of-vocabulary words, and creating numerical sequences. It also pads the sequences to the same length, which is critical for batch processing and ensures a uniform input shape. Tags are similarly converted to numerical labels and are one-hot encoded.

Now, finally, a third code snippet showing the complete workflow, putting both aspects together to highlight training:

```python
# Assume you have your sentences and tags as lists of lists. For demonstration purposes, using dummy data
sentences = [["this", "is", "a", "sentence"], ["and", "this", "is", "another", "one"], ["final", "sentence"]]
tags = [["i-cont", "i-cont", "i-cont", "b-end"], ["i-cont", "i-cont", "i-cont", "i-cont", "b-end"], ["i-cont", "b-end"]]
embedding_dim = 100
lstm_units = 128

padded_sentences, categorical_tags, vocab_size, max_len, tag_to_index = preprocess_data(sentences, tags)
num_tags = len(tag_to_index)
model = create_lstm_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, lstm_units, num_tags)

model.fit(padded_sentences, categorical_tags, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=1)

# To make predictions
test_sentences = ["testing", "this", "now", "can", "we", "detect", "the", "end"]
test_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(test_sentences)
padded_test_sequences = pad_sequences(test_sequences, padding='post', maxlen=max_len)
predictions = model.predict(padded_test_sequences) # Now you get the tagging probabilities
predicted_tags = np.argmax(predictions, axis=-1) # Now you get the predicted tag index

for i in range(len(test_sentences)):
    print(f"Token: {test_sentences[i]}, Predicted Tag Index: {predicted_tags[i]}")
```

This complete workflow showcases the entire process from data preprocessing to training and ultimately, the prediction stage.

It is crucial to note that this model can be further improved using techniques like bi-directional lstms, or crf layers on top of lstm to capture dependencies in tags or other optimization techniques such as hyperparameter tuning.

For deeper dives, I highly recommend checking out the following resources: The "Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin (a comprehensive text on nlp), specifically the sections on sequence tagging and recurrent neural networks. Additionally, "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet provides excellent practical guidance on using Keras, with clear explanations and examples. Finally, for those interested in advancements in neural sequence tagging, research papers on bi-directional lstms and conditional random fields in nlp applications, accessible through venues like ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) and EMNLP (Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing), can offer further insights. These are where more in-depth theoretical understanding and cutting-edge implementations are detailed, and will prove quite valuable as you delve deeper into this specific problem.

Remember, sentence boundary detection, while seemingly a simple task, has numerous nuances in different languages and text styles. Through proper data preparation, lstm architecture, and rigorous training, we can achieve very satisfactory results.
