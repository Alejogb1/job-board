Let's tackle this. I've seen this exact issue crop up a fair few times over the years, and it often boils down to how elasticsearch and chewy interpret data types, particularly dates. It's a common enough head-scratcher when you start mixing rails’ active record with the search capabilities of elasticsearch via chewy.

The core problem is that when chewy indexes your data, it often infers the data type of fields based on what it first encounters. Dates, which are stored as `date` or `datetime` objects in rails, can sometimes end up being indexed as strings in elasticsearch. This happens because elasticsearch doesn’t inherently ‘know’ the structure of your rails model when it’s first populating the index. This leads to your search results returning date fields as strings rather than their intended date or datetime objects, which makes further manipulation quite awkward in ruby.

The solution is to be explicit in your chewy configuration, ensuring elasticsearch understands the specific data type of these date fields. This involves two primary steps. First, defining how your dates should be indexed within your chewy index definition, and second, potentially handling some type conversion on the rails side when loading results.

To illustrate, let’s consider a typical scenario. Let's say we have a `Post` model with an `published_at` datetime attribute. Without explicit configuration, chewy would likely index `published_at` as a string in elasticsearch, leading to the issue you’re experiencing.

Here’s a typical Chewy index definition before any fixes:

```ruby
class PostsIndex < Chewy::Index
  index_name :posts

  define_type Post do
    field :title, type: 'text'
    field :content, type: 'text'
    field :published_at # Here's our culprit, likely indexed as string
  end
end
```

Now, let’s look at how to explicitly define our `published_at` field as a `date` type in elasticsearch. Here’s the corrected index definition:

```ruby
class PostsIndex < Chewy::Index
  index_name :posts

  define_type Post do
    field :title, type: 'text'
    field :content, type: 'text'
    field :published_at, type: 'date' # Explicitly defined as date
  end
end
```

By specifying `type: 'date'`, you're instructing elasticsearch to index this field as a date. This ensures that dates are stored and indexed correctly. However, even with this change, you still might get back a string representation from chewy initially. Here's how you typically fetch results using chewy:

```ruby
results = PostsIndex.query(match: { content: 'some text' }).load
puts results.first.published_at.class # Likely returns String
```

Even though elasticsearch knows the field is a date, the values loaded back into the ruby object from chewy can often be strings. This is where a second step is needed. You can modify your model's initialization or results loading process to correctly cast strings to date/datetime objects. In chewy, you often don’t directly modify the model, you process the attributes after the load. A common method is to utilize active record’s built in functionality with an after_find callback or a custom method in the model to handle conversions.

Here’s how you might approach this, adding a class method directly in the model for clarity, while noting this is not directly coupled to the chewy indexing itself:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  def self.process_search_result(record_hash)
    return nil unless record_hash

    record_hash["_source"].tap do |source|
      source["published_at"] = DateTime.parse(source["published_at"]) if source["published_at"].present?
    end
    record_hash
  end

  def published_at
   read_attribute(:published_at).is_a?(String) ? DateTime.parse(read_attribute(:published_at)) : read_attribute(:published_at)
  end
end

# Example use:
results = PostsIndex.query(match: { content: 'some text' })
loaded_results = results.to_a.map{|r| Post.process_search_result(r.attributes.to_h)}
loaded_results.compact.each { |result| puts result["published_at"].class} # Will output DateTime if published_at is a valid string or DateTime
```

This example is focused on the return value from an elasticsearch lookup but the issue is similar to the retrieval of the attributes via a `load` call as well. This method takes a hash representing a chewy search result and checks if the `published_at` key is present and contains a string. If so, it parses the string into a `datetime` object. It then utilizes the tap method to allow for the conversion to happen in place on the original loaded object as a hash before returning it. I also demonstrated how to overload the `published_at` method to handle the string cast on any usage of the attribute on the Post object directly. It does not solve the issue of data being stringified coming from the elastic search results, only when loading into Active Record models directly.

In essence, the key takeaways are:

1.  **Explicit Type Definitions:** Always define your date fields with `type: 'date'` in your chewy index definitions. This is non-negotiable for correct indexing.
2. **Attribute Processing After the fact:** Be prepared to process the attributes returned from chewy to parse strings into their correct data type. This could be in your model directly, or when loading the results after a query.

**Important Note:** After modifying your index definitions, you must reindex your data. Otherwise, elasticsearch will still hold the old data with the incorrect type. You typically do this by running `rake chewy:reset`.

For further reading, I recommend exploring:

*   **Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide** by Clinton Gormley and Zachary Tong. This provides an in-depth understanding of how elasticsearch handles data types.
*   The official Chewy gem documentation found directly on github or rubygems. It provides excellent examples and use cases for more advanced use of the gem. Pay special attention to the sections on field definitions and attribute handling.
*   The official elasticsearch documentation on their website specifically regarding date data types, especially concerning the various date format options, although the defaults used by chewy are more than sufficient.

Dealing with data type conversions between your application and a search index is always going to be a consideration, and by being deliberate in your index definitions and careful when processing data, you can ensure that your dates are correctly represented as you fetch them from the index. In past projects, I found that taking these small, deliberate steps saved many hours of debugging later. This is something that becomes intuitive over time with further experience with both rails and elasticsearch.
