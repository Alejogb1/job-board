Alright, let's tackle this one. I’ve spent a good chunk of my career dealing with the complexities of deep learning models, and hyperparameter tuning, particularly with tools like GridSearchCV, is something I've got a rather intimate understanding of. The short answer is that GridSearchCV is a powerful technique, but its effectiveness for deep neural networks is nuanced, and quite frankly, frequently not optimal without careful consideration.

The fundamental idea behind GridSearchCV is exhaustive search: you define a grid of possible hyperparameter values, and the algorithm tries *every* combination, evaluating each one using cross-validation. This is incredibly straightforward, and for many machine learning algorithms where the hyperparameter space is relatively small, it's often perfectly sufficient. However, when we delve into the world of deep learning, we run into problems.

Firstly, deep neural networks often have a large number of hyperparameters to tune. We're not just talking about learning rate, but also parameters like the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, activation functions, dropout rates, batch size, optimizer choice, and more – the list goes on. The combination space explodes exponentially, and the time required to evaluate each configuration using GridSearchCV quickly becomes prohibitive. I remember back in 2018 working on a convolutional neural network for image segmentation, and even with a small subset of the possible hyperparameter combinations, it took days to complete just one run. We ended up needing to switch to more efficient methods.

The second challenge is that the evaluation of deep learning models is computationally intensive. Running a single training process with cross-validation already demands significant resources, both in terms of time and processing power. GridSearchCV essentially multiplies this cost by the number of combinations, rendering it infeasible for many real-world scenarios where time and resources are constrained.

Moreover, GridSearchCV treats all hyperparameter settings as discrete, which isn't always the best approach. Some hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, are inherently continuous. Discretizing them and treating them as individual points might not capture the optimal values that exist between the points within the defined grid.

Now, with that said, it’s not all doom and gloom for GridSearchCV. It can still be effective in certain circumstances, especially as a starting point for smaller models, or for focusing on a few select, crucial hyperparameters. The trick is to be strategic. If, for example, you have a relatively small network with only a few key parameters you want to optimize, and your resources aren't too stretched, then GridSearchCV can get the job done, though it likely won't lead to the absolute best results.

Let me illustrate this with a few examples:

**Example 1: A Basic, Limited Scenario**

Let's say we’re working with a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for a simple classification problem, and we're only focused on tuning the number of neurons in a single hidden layer and the learning rate.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Generate dummy data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=10, random_state=42)
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)

# Define the hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {
    'hidden_layer_sizes': [(50,), (100,), (150,)],
    'learning_rate_init': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
}

# Define the model
mlp = MLPClassifier(max_iter=200, random_state=42)

# Configure cross-validation
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Initialize GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(mlp, param_grid, cv=cv, verbose=0, scoring='accuracy')

# Run the GridSearch
grid_search.fit(X, y)

# Output the best results
print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best score:", grid_search.best_score_)
```

In this example, we have a small grid, and the computation is manageable. This approach is viable here, though you can imagine how quickly this becomes unfeasible as we add more layers or parameters.

**Example 2: Utilizing GridSearchCV as a Pre-step**

Let’s say I want to narrow down my hyperparameters before diving into more sophisticated methods. Here I use GridSearchCV with a reduced range of values. Suppose we're focusing on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for an image classification task (using a placeholder dataset for illustration):

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
import numpy as np

# Placeholder dataset for demo
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=500, n_features=10, n_informative=5, random_state=42)

class CNNClassifier(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    def __init__(self, filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=0):
        self.filters = filters
        self.kernel_size = kernel_size
        self.activation = activation
        self.epochs = epochs
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.verbose=verbose
        self.model = self._build_model()


    def _build_model(self):
        model = models.Sequential([
          layers.Dense(self.filters, activation=self.activation, input_shape=(X.shape[1],)),
          layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
        ])
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
        return model

    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.model.fit(X, y, epochs=self.epochs, batch_size=self.batch_size, verbose=self.verbose)
        return self

    def predict(self, X):
        y_pred = self.model.predict(X)
        return (y_pred > 0.5).astype(int)

    def predict_proba(self, X):
        return self.model.predict(X)

# Define the hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {
    'cnn__filters': [32, 64],
    'cnn__kernel_size': [3, 5],
}

# Create a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                    ('cnn', CNNClassifier())])


# Run grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=2, verbose=0, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X, y)

print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best score:", grid_search.best_score_)
```

Here, we've integrated a custom CNN class for use within `GridSearchCV`. While limited to a few parameters, it shows how you can use it to refine settings prior to exploring other optimization methods.

**Example 3: A Cautionary Note**

To really underscore the challenge of using GridSearchCV in complex scenarios, consider this. We’ll expand the parameters used in example 2 considerably, keeping the basic architecture.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
import numpy as np

# Placeholder dataset for demo
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=500, n_features=10, n_informative=5, random_state=42)

class CNNClassifier(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    def __init__(self, filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=0):
        self.filters = filters
        self.kernel_size = kernel_size
        self.activation = activation
        self.epochs = epochs
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.verbose=verbose
        self.model = self._build_model()


    def _build_model(self):
        model = models.Sequential([
          layers.Dense(self.filters, activation=self.activation, input_shape=(X.shape[1],)),
          layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
        ])
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
        return model

    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.model.fit(X, y, epochs=self.epochs, batch_size=self.batch_size, verbose=self.verbose)
        return self

    def predict(self, X):
        y_pred = self.model.predict(X)
        return (y_pred > 0.5).astype(int)

    def predict_proba(self, X):
        return self.model.predict(X)

# Define the hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {
    'cnn__filters': [16, 32, 64, 128],
    'cnn__kernel_size': [3, 5, 7],
    'cnn__activation': ['relu', 'tanh', 'sigmoid']
}

# Create a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                    ('cnn', CNNClassifier())])


# Run grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=2, verbose=0, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X, y)

print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best score:", grid_search.best_score_)
```
Even with a minimal increase in the parameter ranges, the computational time drastically increases. This illustrates the combinatorial explosion, and showcases how quickly GridSearchCV can become prohibitive.

For anyone looking for a more in-depth understanding of hyperparameter optimization, I’d highly recommend “Bayesian Optimization in Machine Learning” by Martin Krasser and “Hyperparameter Optimization” by Frank Hutter. Also, for deep learning theory, the seminal “Deep Learning” by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville is an indispensable resource.

In conclusion, GridSearchCV can be a useful tool, especially in the early phases of model development or for specific scenarios where the number of hyperparameters is small. However, it's generally not the most efficient choice for the complexities of hyperparameter tuning within deep learning architectures, and more sophisticated approaches should be strongly considered as soon as models grow beyond simplicity. There are many more efficient alternatives like random search, Bayesian optimization, and methods leveraging gradient descent on the validation error that are more suitable in these cases, and we should always strive to use the most appropriate method.
