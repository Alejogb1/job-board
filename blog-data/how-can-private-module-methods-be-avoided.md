Alright, let’s tackle this. Thinking back to a project I was on a few years ago – a rather complex distributed system involving numerous microservices, actually – we ran into this exact problem quite acutely. The drive for encapsulation was strong, but the allure of “private” methods within modules (especially when using languages that don't explicitly support private class members at the module level) became a point of contention and ultimately a source of fragility. We quickly realized that the patterns we initially gravitated towards could be improved upon significantly. So, avoiding 'private' module methods isn’t just about syntax or convention; it's about crafting a more robust, maintainable architecture.

The core issue stems from the fact that, within a module, you technically *can* define methods that are only intended for internal use. However, many languages lack the enforcement mechanisms to make those truly private at the module level (like, for example, the equivalent of `private` members in many object-oriented classes). You might think, ", I'll just name them something with an underscore prefix, signaling their intended private nature." This, of course, isn’t bulletproof, it’s more a convention than a rule. Code will still call them if they get referenced or imported unintentionally. This is the problem, a matter of semantics and reliance on developer vigilance, not actual language enforced privacy. In a large codebase or a multi-developer team, you’re inevitably going to run into situations where someone either unknowingly or carelessly calls these methods and causes problems.

Instead of depending on naming conventions and hoping for the best, we need alternatives that provide actual isolation and prevent unexpected coupling. One of the primary methods I've come to rely on, and I'd strongly recommend you investigate this more, is functional decomposition. Rather than embedding smaller helper methods directly into a module, aim to break down complex functionalities into smaller, independent functions that are either: (1) located within their own module and made explicitly accessible or (2) passed into a module that needs them as parameters, promoting loose coupling. This approach shifts the focus away from module-level 'privacy' and towards functional composition and clear dependency management. Let's look at a python example.

```python
# Inefficient and problematic approach, typical with 'private' methods
# module my_module.py

def _helper_function(data):
  # some private processing
  return data * 2

def main_function(input_data):
    intermediate_data = _helper_function(input_data)
    # more logic using intermediate_data
    return intermediate_data + 10
```

Here we have `_helper_function`, a so-called private method, hidden behind convention but easily callable from anywhere. Now, consider a functional approach:

```python
# Inefficient and problematic approach, typical with 'private' methods
# module processing_functions.py
def process_data(data):
  return data * 2

# In the consumer module
# module my_module.py

from processing_functions import process_data

def main_function(input_data):
    intermediate_data = process_data(input_data)
    # more logic using intermediate_data
    return intermediate_data + 10
```
Now, the processing logic is in a separate module, explicitly made available. This promotes more modularity and also enables independent testing of `process_data`. The coupling to the original module is broken.

Another technique I've found invaluable is to leverage classes strategically, even in languages that aren't strictly OOP-centric. By encapsulating logic within a class, you can leverage the language’s mechanisms for private or protected members (if they exist) or enforce privacy through scoping and closures. The key idea is to create an instance of the class within the module, effectively keeping the internal methods scoped only to that specific object. This doesn't create the same "module-private" feel as a language feature might, but provides stronger encapsulation than just naming conventions. In javascript, a language I've had extensive experience with, the pattern could be illustrated like this:

```javascript
// problematic approach, typical with 'private' methods, even in js
const module_js = (function(){
  function _helperMethod(data) {
    return data * 2;
  }

  return {
    mainFunction(input) {
       let intermediate = _helperMethod(input);
        return intermediate + 10;
    }
  };
})();

// you can easily do module_js._helperMethod(5) here, even if its intended private

```

Now compare it to the object instantiation technique.

```javascript
//Better approach with classes
const myModule = function() {

  class Processor {
     #helperMethod(data) { // # makes it truly private
      return data * 2;
    }
    process(input){
      let intermediate = this.#helperMethod(input);
      return intermediate + 10;
     }
   };

  const processor = new Processor();

  return {
    mainFunction(input) {
      return processor.process(input);
    }
  };

}();
// you cannot do myModule.processor._helperMethod(5) here, the method is not exposed
```
Using javascript class members `#helperMethod` we have more isolation, and the private-like functions are only accessible through a class instance’s methods. The external module interface becomes very focused on exposed functions. Note, not all language versions may support such features fully, and it's important to verify version and compatibility before relying on this specific approach.

Finally, consider a scenario where you need to inject behaviour directly into a module based on certain conditions. Instead of having a hidden internal function that alters the behaviour of a module, use dependency injection. Pass the specific behaviour as a function/object. The receiving module doesn't need to know about the internal processing logic of the passed function, it just calls it based on its own requirements. Here is another Python snippet showing the idea, with the added benefit of avoiding singleton instances:

```python
# Inefficient and problematic approach, typical with 'private' methods
# module my_module.py
def _specific_logic_impl_a(data):
  return data + 5

def _specific_logic_impl_b(data):
    return data * 5

class MyModule():

    def __init__(self, use_logic_a = False):
        self.use_logic_a = use_logic_a;

    def process(self, data):
        if self.use_logic_a:
            return _specific_logic_impl_a(data)
        else:
            return _specific_logic_impl_b(data)
```

This code leads to coupling, and requires a special configuration at class level. Now, compare it to the dependency injection approach:

```python
# Better approach, use dependency injection to avoid hidden module methods
# helper_functions.py
def specific_logic_impl_a(data):
    return data + 5

def specific_logic_impl_b(data):
    return data * 5

# In my_module.py
class MyModule():
    def __init__(self, logic_processor):
         self.processor = logic_processor

    def process(self, data):
        return self.processor(data)
# usage example
from my_module import MyModule
from helper_functions import specific_logic_impl_a, specific_logic_impl_b
module_instance_a = MyModule(specific_logic_impl_a)
module_instance_b = MyModule(specific_logic_impl_b)

result_a = module_instance_a.process(5)
result_b = module_instance_b.process(5)
```
Here, we pass behaviour into the module. We decoupled it from hardcoded conditional branching, and we are now able to test behaviours separately.

For further reading, I'd recommend exploring "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin, for solid principles around modularity and design. "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler is also an excellent resource for techniques to improve code structure. For more in-depth theoretical grounding, consider resources on functional programming principles, like the documentation for languages such as Haskell or Clojure, which often emphasize pure functions and modularity. Additionally, delving into the concept of “separation of concerns” and its implementations in different programming paradigms can also be quite insightful.

To summarize, avoiding private module methods is not about strictly enforcing syntactical privacy that might not exist or is hard to implement in many cases. It is rather about using patterns that encourage better modularization, testability, and dependency management using functional decomposition, strategic class usage and dependency injection techniques. By proactively thinking about your code structure and the level of coupling you want to maintain, you can produce much cleaner, maintainable, and robust systems.
