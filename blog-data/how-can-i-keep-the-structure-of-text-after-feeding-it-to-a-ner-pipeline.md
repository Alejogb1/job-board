Alright, let's tackle this. Preserving the original text structure while applying Named Entity Recognition (NER) can be a bit of a balancing act, but it's absolutely crucial for many downstream tasks. I recall a project a few years back, involving automated analysis of legal contracts. We needed to extract entities like names, dates, and locations but, crucially, the position and context of these entities within the document were just as important as the entities themselves. So, we faced this exact challenge of keeping the structure intact post-NER.

The fundamental issue is that most NER pipelines, at their core, operate on sequences of tokens. They don't inherently maintain a direct link to the original text's structure, such as line breaks, paragraphs, or even specific formatting. The tokenization process often strips away these nuances, treating the input as a flat stream of words or sub-word units.

Now, how to overcome this? The trick lies in careful pre-processing and post-processing, essentially weaving the original structural information back into the results. The approach I've found most reliable involves using token indices as a crucial link. Before you even feed the text to the NER model, you need to record where each token originated from within the original text. This allows you to reconstruct the original structure later.

Here's how you can approach this with a few practical methods. First, the simplest case, we will explore preserving token indices in a list and remapping the model results back to the original text. This does have limitations, but is good for demonstrating basic principles.

```python
import spacy

def simple_ner_with_indices(text):
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    doc = nlp(text)
    tokens = [token.text for token in doc]
    token_spans = [(token.idx, token.idx + len(token.text)) for token in doc]
    entities = []
    for ent in doc.ents:
        entity_tokens = []
        for span in token_spans:
             if span[0] >= ent.start_char and span[1] <= ent.end_char:
                  entity_tokens.append(span)
        entities.append({"text": ent.text, "type": ent.label_, "tokens": entity_tokens})
    return {"original_text": text, "tokens": tokens, "entities": entities}


text = "Apple Inc. is located in Cupertino, California. Their profits rose by 15% this year."
result = simple_ner_with_indices(text)

print(result)

```

In the code above, we're using `spaCy` as our NER engine. We keep track of each token’s span (its start and end index in the original string). When we extract entities, we map their character spans back to their associated token spans. This results in a data structure that includes both the original tokens and their corresponding entity labels, allowing you to later recreate the original text's structure.

However, this is pretty bare-bones. For more complex text with multiple lines, paragraphs or specific structure, this would not be particularly useful. Here, we need to record the structure, which can be achieved by adding additional structural markers (line breaks, section headers, etc.) into the tokenized text. Here is a more advanced example.

```python
import spacy
import re

def ner_with_structural_markers(text):
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    structured_tokens = []
    structural_elements = []
    
    #Split by line breaks to identify paragraph structure and add markers
    lines = text.splitlines()
    current_char = 0
    for line_num, line in enumerate(lines):
        doc = nlp(line)
        for token in doc:
            token_data = {
                "text": token.text,
                "start": token.idx + current_char,
                "end": token.idx + current_char + len(token.text),
                "line": line_num
             }
            structured_tokens.append(token_data)
        current_char += len(line) +1
        if line_num < len(lines)-1:
           structural_elements.append({'element':'line_break', 'location': current_char -1})


    entities = []
    for ent in nlp(text).ents:
        entity_tokens = []
        for token in structured_tokens:
            if token["start"] >= ent.start_char and token["end"] <= ent.end_char:
                entity_tokens.append(token)
        entities.append({"text": ent.text, "type": ent.label_, "tokens": entity_tokens})

    return {"original_text": text, "tokens": structured_tokens, "entities": entities, "structural_elements": structural_elements }


text = """This is the first line of the document.
This is the second line with Microsoft Corporation mentioned.

And here's another paragraph about Amazon Inc."""
result = ner_with_structural_markers(text)
print(result)
```

In this example, we are pre-processing by splitting based on line breaks, adding markers to indicate when a new line occurs, and storing the token start and end character positions along with the line number. While this adds more information, reconstructing the original text still isn't particularly straightforward.

The most robust solution I've used in the field, particularly for complex document types, involves using an intermediate representation, essentially creating a dictionary or json-like structure that maps every token in the original text to its properties, such as the text itself, its character spans and associated entities. Once the structural analysis is complete, this intermediate representation is used to rebuild the final document. This allows for much more advanced operations on the document structure as well.

```python
import spacy

def structured_ner_intermediate_rep(text):
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    doc = nlp(text)
    intermediate_rep = []
    
    for token in doc:
        token_info = {
            "text": token.text,
            "start": token.idx,
            "end": token.idx + len(token.text),
            "entity": None  # Initially no entity
        }
        intermediate_rep.append(token_info)

    for ent in doc.ents:
        for token_info in intermediate_rep:
            if token_info["start"] >= ent.start_char and token_info["end"] <= ent.end_char:
                 token_info["entity"] = {"text": ent.text, "type": ent.label_}
    
    return { "original_text": text, "intermediate_representation": intermediate_rep}



text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Google is also mentioned here."
result = structured_ner_intermediate_rep(text)

print(result)

```

Here, our intermediate representation `intermediate_rep` is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing a token from the original text with the token's start and end positions and entity information.

The output of each of these examples represents a structured version of the original text, containing all relevant information for further processing, which can be customized based on the specifics of the needed structure. The output can be post-processed to reconstruct the original text while retaining all identified entities and their locations.

For further reading and more detailed exploration of these techniques, I strongly recommend looking into these resources:

*   **"Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin:** This is a comprehensive textbook that provides a deep dive into various aspects of natural language processing, including tokenization, NER, and general document processing. The chapters on text analysis and information extraction are particularly relevant.
*   **spaCy's Official Documentation:** The spaCy documentation is a well-structured and practical resource for anyone working with spaCy. The documentation includes many useful examples and provides insight into the inner workings of the library. Focus on the API reference and examples related to tokenization and entity extraction.
*   **Papers on Information Extraction:** Specifically, search for papers related to ‘token classification’ and 'sequential tagging’ . Some research papers delve into strategies for maintaining context during entity recognition and techniques for handling complex structural information.
*   **The transformers library documentation**: The Transformers library from Huggingface includes an impressive array of tools and techniques for tokenization, especially sub-word tokenization, as well as many well-regarded NER model implementations.

In summary, maintaining the structure of your text during NER is not impossible. By carefully tracking token indices and leveraging intermediate representations, you can bridge the gap between structured text and sequence-based processing of NER pipelines. The approaches above provide a solid foundation for most scenarios, and you can iterate further from here. Remember that the "best" approach will likely vary depending on the precise structure of your input data and the level of structural preservation you require.
