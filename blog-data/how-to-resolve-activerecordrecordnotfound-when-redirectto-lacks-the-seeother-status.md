Alright, let's talk about that *ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound* error rearing its head when `redirect_to` doesn’t play nice with the `:see_other` status code. I’ve had my fair share of run-ins with this beast, particularly in the early days of building e-commerce platforms back in the 2010s. Trust me, dealing with broken user flows due to seemingly straightforward redirects can be a genuine headache. What appears as a simple redirect issue can often unravel into a deeper exploration of http status codes and the underlying nuances of database interactions with your web application.

The root of the problem, as you likely suspect, lies in the interplay between the http status codes and how browsers treat them during redirects, specifically when using `redirect_to` in rails without explicitly specifying `:see_other` (303). Rails, by default, uses a 302 (Found) status code for redirects. When a client (like a browser) receives a 302 response, it *can* reissue the subsequent request using the same method that was previously used (e.g., `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`). However, in some cases, like after successful updates or deletions, using the same method for a redirect can be problematic, as it might incorrectly recreate the resource or execute the same operation again leading to issues such as not having the expected data or ending up on a page that expects a different http method.

Now, where does `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` come in? This typically arises because the redirect location, which is often dependent on the successful completion of an action that changes a database record, is no longer valid. Think of a situation where you delete a record and then redirect to that same record’s show page. The show page is looking for a record that is now gone, hence the error.

Specifying the `:see_other` status (303) is the standard solution to this problem. A 303 status code informs the client that it *must* make a `GET` request to the new location, regardless of the original request method. This is crucial after actions like `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` because the subsequent redirect should nearly always be to a page that expects a `GET` request. This prevents the browser from blindly reposting or re-executing methods that can lead to unexpected consequences and is particularly important for idempotent operations.

Let’s delve into some practical examples. Imagine an e-commerce scenario where users can delete items from their cart. Here's how a typical scenario might unfold, and how the `:see_other` status code can prevent errors:

**Scenario 1: Incorrect Redirect (Without `:see_other`)**

```ruby
# app/controllers/cart_items_controller.rb

class CartItemsController < ApplicationController
  def destroy
    @cart_item = CartItem.find(params[:id])
    @cart_item.destroy
    redirect_to cart_path, notice: 'Item removed.'
  end
end

```

In this snippet, after deleting the `cart_item`, rails defaults to a 302 response. The browser, *might*, depending on implementation, issue another `DELETE` request to the `/cart` path. If the cart show action was expecting a `GET` request and looking to fetch cart items from the database and render them, it would error out because of the unexpected method.

**Scenario 2: Correct Redirect (With `:see_other`)**

```ruby
# app/controllers/cart_items_controller.rb

class CartItemsController < ApplicationController
  def destroy
    @cart_item = CartItem.find(params[:id])
    @cart_item.destroy
    redirect_to cart_path, notice: 'Item removed.', status: :see_other
  end
end
```

Here, we've explicitly told the browser that the redirect *must* be a `GET` request by specifying the `:see_other` status code. This resolves the potential issue of the browser attempting another `DELETE` request and allows the browser to properly navigate to the cart page.

**Scenario 3: Redirecting After Update**

Let’s consider another example, updating a user profile:

```ruby
# app/controllers/profiles_controller.rb

class ProfilesController < ApplicationController
  def update
    @profile = Profile.find(params[:id])
    if @profile.update(profile_params)
      redirect_to profile_path(@profile), notice: 'Profile updated.', status: :see_other
    else
      render :edit
    end
  end

  private
    def profile_params
      params.require(:profile).permit(:name, :email)
    end
end
```

As with the delete scenario, sending a 302 in this instance might cause problems depending on the browser. The browser could attempt to re-issue the `PUT` request, especially if something went wrong with the form submission. The `:see_other` enforces that the request is now a `GET` to show the updated profile, ensuring that the user lands on the correct page, without causing unexpected side-effects.

The key takeaway is that specifying the `:see_other` status code explicitly for redirects after actions that modify resources is crucial, particularly when those actions employ `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`. This avoids browser confusion, makes your application more robust and predictable, and prevents those pesky `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` errors when the redirect targets a location that was rendered obsolete by the action. Remember, it isn’t enough to *think* that a redirect will work, but you need to ensure that the expected behaviors around method types remain consistent.

In terms of further reading, I'd strongly recommend *Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content* (RFC 7231). This document provides the definitive specification for http status codes and how they should be interpreted by clients. It can be a bit dry, but it’s the source of truth and understanding it will vastly improve your general web development skills. Also, *Building Microservices* by Sam Newman delves into the architectural reasons behind using correct status codes, although it's not entirely specific to redirect issues. It provides great context around designing web APIs effectively. Furthermore, I highly recommend going over the official rails documentation on redirects, and specifically paying attention to the caveats of `redirect_to`.

Beyond that, focusing on understanding the HTTP protocol and carefully reviewing how status codes impact browser behavior will significantly reduce the occurrence of issues like these. When in doubt, lean towards explicitness, and always test your redirects thoroughly, especially after modifying data.
