,  It’s a question that takes me back a few years, actually, to a project where we were building a private blockchain for supply chain tracking. We ran into this very scenario, a `Blockchain.addBlock()` function mysteriously failing, all because of a missing argument. The problem is not always immediately obvious, and it stems from the core understanding of how blocks are constructed and linked in a blockchain structure.

The fundamental problem when you encounter an `addBlock()` function failure, especially when the error is related to missing arguments, usually boils down to the fact that every new block must reference the preceding block in the chain. This referencing is crucial for the integrity and immutability of the blockchain. If we’re talking about a simplified blockchain model, typically, a block structure includes at least the following: the block's data, a timestamp, the block’s hash, and a hash of the previous block. The 'missing argument' almost always is the previous block's hash.

Let’s imagine a scenario where your `Blockchain` class looks something like this (in a highly abstracted, conceptual way):

```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, timestamp, data, previous_hash):
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.data = data
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
        # Assume a hash calculation function here
        # In reality, this could involve SHA256 or other cryptographic hashing
        import hashlib
        sha = hashlib.sha256()
        sha.update(str(self.timestamp).encode('utf-8') + str(self.data).encode('utf-8') + str(self.previous_hash).encode('utf-8'))
        return sha.hexdigest()

class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = [self.create_genesis_block()]

    def create_genesis_block(self):
        return Block("0", "Genesis Block", "0")

    def add_block(self, data):
        # This is where the problem often arises.
        previous_block = self.chain[-1]
        previous_hash = previous_block.hash
        new_block = Block(str(datetime.datetime.now()), data, previous_hash)
        self.chain.append(new_block)

    def display_chain(self):
        for block in self.chain:
            print(f"Timestamp: {block.timestamp}")
            print(f"Data: {block.data}")
            print(f"Previous Hash: {block.previous_hash}")
            print(f"Hash: {block.hash}")
            print("-" * 20)

import datetime
#Example Usage
my_blockchain = Blockchain()
my_blockchain.add_block("First transaction")
my_blockchain.add_block("Second transaction")
my_blockchain.display_chain()
```

In the above example, the `Blockchain.add_block` function is implemented correctly, and we supply the previous block's hash. However, a common error is to initialize a new block without accessing the previous block to retrieve its hash. Perhaps the code might look like this at some point:

```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, timestamp, data, previous_hash):
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.data = data
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
         # Assume a hash calculation function here
        # In reality, this could involve SHA256 or other cryptographic hashing
        import hashlib
        sha = hashlib.sha256()
        sha.update(str(self.timestamp).encode('utf-8') + str(self.data).encode('utf-8') + str(self.previous_hash).encode('utf-8'))
        return sha.hexdigest()


class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = [self.create_genesis_block()]

    def create_genesis_block(self):
        return Block("0", "Genesis Block", "0")

    def add_block(self, data):
        # Error: Previous hash is missing!
        new_block = Block(str(datetime.datetime.now()), data, None)
        self.chain.append(new_block)

    def display_chain(self):
        for block in self.chain:
            print(f"Timestamp: {block.timestamp}")
            print(f"Data: {block.data}")
            print(f"Previous Hash: {block.previous_hash}")
            print(f"Hash: {block.hash}")
            print("-" * 20)


import datetime
#Example Usage
my_blockchain = Blockchain()
my_blockchain.add_block("First transaction")
my_blockchain.add_block("Second transaction")
my_blockchain.display_chain()
```

Here, during the initialization of `new_block` in the `add_block` function, `None` is passed as the `previous_hash`. The next block will not reference the preceding block causing a break in the chain. Although this might not throw an error during execution (depending on how validation is set up in the class) it results in an invalid blockchain. Note that in the first example the calculation of the hash is dependent on the previous block's hash. Consequently, if the previous hash is missing or incorrect, the newly calculated hash won't accurately represent the block's position in the chain, rendering it invalid within the broader blockchain context.

In more complex systems, this error might manifest subtly. For example, during a distributed consensus protocol, not passing the correct 'previous block hash', could mean that the new block is rejected by network nodes, even if the code runs without crashing on the initiating node.

Let's consider one last example where the `previous_hash` is actually computed, but there is a misunderstanding of what `previous_block` should represent:

```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, timestamp, data, previous_hash):
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.data = data
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
         # Assume a hash calculation function here
        # In reality, this could involve SHA256 or other cryptographic hashing
        import hashlib
        sha = hashlib.sha256()
        sha.update(str(self.timestamp).encode('utf-8') + str(self.data).encode('utf-8') + str(self.previous_hash).encode('utf-8'))
        return sha.hexdigest()



class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = [self.create_genesis_block()]

    def create_genesis_block(self):
        return Block("0", "Genesis Block", "0")

    def add_block(self, data):
        if len(self.chain) > 0:
           previous_block = self.chain[0] #incorrect access!
           previous_hash = previous_block.hash
           new_block = Block(str(datetime.datetime.now()), data, previous_hash)
           self.chain.append(new_block)
        else:
          new_block = Block(str(datetime.datetime.now()), data, "0")
          self.chain.append(new_block)


    def display_chain(self):
        for block in self.chain:
            print(f"Timestamp: {block.timestamp}")
            print(f"Data: {block.data}")
            print(f"Previous Hash: {block.previous_hash}")
            print(f"Hash: {block.hash}")
            print("-" * 20)


import datetime
#Example Usage
my_blockchain = Blockchain()
my_blockchain.add_block("First transaction")
my_blockchain.add_block("Second transaction")
my_blockchain.display_chain()
```
In this final example, the code attempts to get the hash of the genesis block instead of the previous block. The code avoids assigning `None` to the `previous_hash` parameter, but it does not correctly add to the chain structure by pulling the wrong block to reference. In a real system, this would cause the cryptographic integrity of the blockchain to fail when nodes attempt to validate it.

When debugging this, it’s crucial to inspect the `addBlock` function and verify that it's:

1.  Accessing the last block in the chain (`self.chain[-1]`).
2.  Extracting the hash from that block (`previous_block.hash`).
3.  Passing this hash as the `previous_hash` argument to the new `Block` constructor.

For those who wish to go deeper on the theoretical foundations, I would recommend two excellent resources: "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopoulos, for a broad yet thorough understanding of the underlying technology, and “Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies” by Arvind Narayanan, Joseph Bonneau, Edward Felten, Andrew Miller, and Steven Goldfeder, for a more academic and detailed look at the cryptographic and distributed aspects of blockchain. Both of these resources do an excellent job at explaining why referencing the previous block's hash correctly is absolutely necessary for the chain's immutability and security.
In short, the 'missing argument' is typically the *previous block's hash*, without which the blockchain's linking mechanism breaks down. Remember this the next time you are implementing or debugging such a function, and you'll have a much clearer understanding of the issue.
