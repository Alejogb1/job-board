Let's tackle this. It's a scenario I've certainly encountered more than once over my years working with Ruby on Rails. The situation, where you're expecting, say, a nicely formatted HTML view, but instead get the dreaded `"#<MyModel:0x00007f7f7f8a69e0>"` printed straight to the page – or similar – usually stems from how Rails handles implicit rendering and type coercion within its view layer. It isn't some strange quirk; it's often a deliberate, albeit sometimes confusing, mechanism.

In essence, Rails views interpret data sent to them. When you pass a complex object (like an instance of an ActiveRecord model) without instructing Rails *how* to convert it into a string, the default behavior kicks in. Ruby, as a language, provides a `to_s` method on every object, and by default, that method returns a string representation that includes the class name and its memory address. That's what you're seeing. It’s important to understand that Rails’ view rendering isn't just about HTML. It can handle plain text, json, xml, or indeed the string representation of whatever data you provide it.

This often occurs when the expectation is that Rails will magically understand your intent and format the object into something useful for display. For instance, perhaps you expect to output the name of a user model instance, so you pass the user object directly to the view via an instance variable: `@user`. You *assume* that Rails is smart enough to fetch `@user.name` and display that. It's not. If you simply have `<%= @user %>` in your erb template, without specifying *which* attribute you want, Rails will use the default to_s method of your object.

I saw this play out repeatedly in a project several years ago where we transitioned a rather large application from an older version of Rails to Rails 5, which then got bumped up to version 7. The old rendering was implicitly handling certain model display via overridden `to_s` methods within various models (a less than ideal practice). The change in the rendering engine and how default coercions are now handled meant many of these older display mechanisms failed. Instead of the expected information, we got a parade of `"#<ModelClass:0x00...>"` in production. It was, shall we say, a good debugging week.

The key takeaway is that Rails needs an explicit instruction of how to convert your object to something renderable. This explicit conversion usually occurs in one of three ways: first, by accessing a specific attribute you're looking to display; second, by defining a proper `to_s` method on the specific model; and third, via view helpers (either built-in or those you create yourself) that explicitly format the output.

Let’s illustrate with some straightforward examples.

**Example 1: Direct Attribute Access**

Here’s a simple user model, and the scenario we described earlier. Imagine the code in `app/models/user.rb`:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # attributes: name (string), email (string)
end
```

And in your controller (`app/controllers/users_controller.rb`):

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

And now, your view (`app/views/users/show.html.erb`):

```erb
<p>User: <%= @user %></p>
```

This would render `User: #<User:0x00007f7f7f8a69e0>` or something similar.

**Solution:** To render, say, the name, modify the view as follows:

```erb
<p>User: <%= @user.name %></p>
```

Now, you'll see the user's name displayed correctly. This demonstrates that we've moved from relying on implicit coercion to explicitly selecting the specific piece of data to render.

**Example 2: Overriding `to_s` (with caution!)**

While possible, I strongly advise against using this approach for complex output. It creates issues with object representation in other areas of the application. Let me quickly present it for completeness before we move on to the view helpers which are preferred.

Within our `User` model, you can define a custom `to_s` method:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def to_s
    "User: #{name} (#{email})"
  end
end
```

Now, with your original view code (`<p>User: <%= @user %></p>`), you’ll get something like `User: John Doe (john.doe@example.com)`. This seems convenient, but it has several drawbacks. Firstly, the output is fixed; if you want just the name elsewhere, you need to define a separate method. Secondly, this method’s output is global – if the purpose of `to_s` changes, it can break things that rely on the current output elsewhere in your application, such as output to console. Lastly, it can be problematic with internationalization and localized formats. It's rarely the best solution for display logic; however, it does effectively solve the original problem.

**Example 3: Using View Helpers**

The most flexible and recommended approach is using view helpers. This keeps your display logic separate and allows for more complex formatting. We might add a helper to `app/helpers/users_helper.rb`:

```ruby
module UsersHelper
  def display_user(user)
    content_tag(:div, class: 'user-info') do
      concat content_tag(:span, "Name: #{user.name}")
      concat content_tag(:br)
      concat content_tag(:span, "Email: #{user.email}")
    end
  end
end
```

Now, your view could call this helper:

```erb
<p>User: <%= display_user(@user) %></p>
```

This will generate formatted HTML (with a `<div class="user-info">` and appropriately rendered spans and line breaks), giving you control over the final output, separating display logic from the model logic.

**Conclusion**

The primary reason you’re seeing object rendering as text in Rails 7 is because you're presenting a complex Ruby object to the view layer without explicitly instructing it how to convert it to a renderable format. Rails will always default to the basic `to_s` method for that object, and that produces that text output. Direct access to attributes, defining custom `to_s` methods (with caveats), and, most appropriately, utilizing view helpers, all offer ways to control what’s displayed. I always steer teams towards using view helpers as they offer the greatest degree of flexibility and maintainability.

For further understanding, I recommend the following resources. Firstly, *Agile Web Development with Rails 7* by Sam Ruby, David Bryant Copeland, and Dave Thomas. It provides a thorough explanation of Rails internals, particularly in regards to the view layer. Additionally, to really deep dive into how Ruby handles implicit type conversion and what to_s methods achieve, *The Ruby Programming Language* by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto, is invaluable. This book will give a really thorough understanding of why and how these issues are surfacing. Finally, while it is not a book, the official Ruby documentation for the `Object` class (especially the `to_s` method) is critical when understanding this issue. The depth and context those three will offer is well beyond a simple fix. They establish a framework for problem-solving as a whole.

Understanding object behavior and how Rails handles rendering is not just about getting the right output. It is crucial for robust and maintainable applications in the long run. In short, it's rarely Rails that's messing up, it's simply following the rules of the language and doing what it's asked.
