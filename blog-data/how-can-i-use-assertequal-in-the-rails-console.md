Let's tackle this from a pragmatic angle, shall we? Having spent what feels like an eternity debugging Rails applications, the `assert_equal` family of methods has been a frequent companion, though perhaps not always directly in the console as initially intended for tests. While it’s not directly a built-in method that you’d typically use to, say, verify data in your interactive console session, we can get it to work – with some nuance.

The core issue is that `assert_equal` and its siblings (`assert_not_equal`, `assert_nil`, `assert_not_nil`, etc.) are primarily tools from the `ActiveSupport::TestCase` module. They are designed for creating unit and integration tests, rather than for ad-hoc checks in the Rails console. By default, they aren't readily available in your console environment. So, the key is to make them available, and we do this by mimicking a testing context. It’s not quite as streamlined as directly invoking them, but it is very effective once you've set it up.

What I've usually found beneficial is to define a small helper module that includes `ActiveSupport::TestCase`. This way, we're bringing the testing functionality into our console session without directly modifying our Rails environment in a more permanent manner.

Here's how I often set up a session for this:

First, I define a quick helper module:

```ruby
module ConsoleTestHelpers
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  include ActiveSupport::Testing::Assertions
end
```

This module extends `ActiveSupport::Concern` to allow us to include testing behaviors and it also includes the `ActiveSupport::Testing::Assertions`, which contains the `assert_equal`, `assert_nil` and related methods that we’re aiming for.

Now, inside the Rails console, I can include this module:

```ruby
include ConsoleTestHelpers
```

Once we do this, we can start using `assert_equal`, `assert_nil` and the others, which effectively lets us make assertions on data in the console, however it’s not quite the same as a test run. A failing assertion will not stop execution of the console commands, it will simply raise a `Minitest::Assertion` exception. To handle that, we can use `rescue` blocks.

For instance, consider a situation where we're inspecting a database record:

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'test@example.com')

begin
  assert_equal('Test User', user.name)
  puts "User name is correctly set to Test User."
rescue Minitest::Assertion => e
  puts "Assertion failed: #{e.message}"
end
```

This block attempts to assert that the user's name attribute is equal to 'Test User'. If the assertion fails, it catches the `Minitest::Assertion` exception and logs a failure message instead of crashing the console. If the assertion passes, a message about the passing case will display. In practice, this will quickly become cumbersome if you have several checks in a row, which is why I usually create helper methods to make this easier to read and to write.

Here's a refined example, encapsulating the assertion check into a method:

```ruby
module ConsoleTestHelpers
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  include ActiveSupport::Testing::Assertions

  def assert_check(description, expected, actual)
      begin
          assert_equal(expected, actual)
          puts "#{description} : ✅ passed"
      rescue Minitest::Assertion => e
        puts "#{description} : ❌ failed: #{e.message}"
      end
  end
end
```

In this expanded module, we've added `assert_check` which takes a description, the expected and the actual values. With it, we can write the check shown above as:

```ruby
include ConsoleTestHelpers
user = User.find_by(email: 'test@example.com')
assert_check("User name check", 'Test User', user.name)

```
This makes the checks much clearer.

The critical thing to understand is that these assertions do not halt the Rails console like they would in a traditional test. The console still executes each line, just logging results.

Finally, consider checking for a nil value. Here's how:

```ruby
include ConsoleTestHelpers
user = User.find_by(email: 'nonexistent@example.com')
assert_check("User is nil check", nil, user)
```

In this case, we're attempting to find a user by a nonexistent email address, then assert that the result is nil. This often comes in handy when debugging models after some queries.

I want to point out that this should not be a wholesale replacement for creating real test cases using mini-test or similar testing libraries. The main use-case for applying `assert_equal` and the likes in the console is for quickly inspecting and debugging live data during development. When it’s time to write actual tests for your software, they should be placed within test files instead of in a console session. The advantages here are repeatability and the ability to create a larger suite of checks.

For a deeper understanding of `ActiveSupport::TestCase` and its assertion methods, I would recommend delving into the Rails codebase itself. The documentation for `ActiveSupport` is extremely informative. Additionally, the book "Rails Testing for Dummies" by Barry Burd provides practical examples and walks through how test cases work and how they're structured, which would further clarify why these methods are designed the way they are. For general Ruby testing best practices, the documentation of mini-test is an excellent start.

In short, getting `assert_equal` working in the Rails console is about importing a small portion of Rails’ test suite. It’s a useful trick for quickly debugging and verifying data, but be sure to remember that the true value of these assertions is revealed when they're part of a comprehensive test suite.
