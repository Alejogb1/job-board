 Dynamic task parallelism in airflow, particularly concerning a varying number of dates, is a problem I've encountered several times, and honestly, it's a common hurdle. I recall a project where we were processing daily financial market data, and the sheer volume of data shifted considerably depending on holidays and weekend effects. Hardcoding task counts was a non-starter; we needed something fluid, something that adapted. Here’s how I’ve generally approached it, moving past just simple loops to more robust solutions.

Essentially, the challenge lies in generating tasks dynamically at runtime based on a data-driven input, in your case, the date ranges. Airflow's architecture leans heavily on defining DAGs statically, so we can’t just arbitrarily add tasks in the middle of a run. Instead, we need to leverage features designed to accommodate this kind of variability. We can use a combination of templating, dynamic task mapping using a concept introduced with newer airflow versions (specifically with the `task_group` and map functions) and, sometimes, custom operators when necessary.

The core of the solution involves a "discovery" step within the dag where we obtain the set of dates. This is usually done through a sensor (e.g., `TimeDeltaSensor`, `SqlSensor`, `ExternalTaskSensor` depending on your source), an operator that queries a database, or, in simple cases, a python function. This initial task then passes this dynamic data downstream to generate subsequent parallel tasks.

Let’s begin with the simplest case, using python to derive the list of dates that we want to process. I would recommend doing this in a dedicated task in your airflow dag, and not inside the `dag` definition itself, to avoid slow dag parsing and potential dag locking. Here’s an example of how that would look:

```python
from airflow.decorators import dag, task
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
import pendulum
from datetime import timedelta


@dag(start_date=days_ago(1), schedule=None, catchup=False, tags=['example'])
def dynamic_dates_example():
    @task
    def get_dates_to_process(start_date, end_date):
        dates_to_process = []
        current_date = start_date
        while current_date <= end_date:
            dates_to_process.append(current_date.to_date_string())
            current_date = current_date.add(days=1)
        return dates_to_process

    @task
    def process_date(date):
         print(f"Processing date: {date}")

    start_date = pendulum.today().add(days=-7)
    end_date = pendulum.today()

    dates = get_dates_to_process(start_date, end_date)
    process_date.expand(date=dates)


dynamic_dates_example()
```

This dag will first use a python task that computes the date range between last week and today, and returns the date as a list of string values. Then, using `expand`, it calls the `process_date` task for each date, effectively parallelizing the processing. Note the use of pendulum, which is recommended by apache airflow for date operations, as it is timezone aware. In this very basic example, the `process_date` task simply prints the date, but this would be substituted by your actual processing logic. The `get_dates_to_process` task is the core of our dynamic creation of tasks for processing.

Now, let’s consider a scenario where the list of dates is actually a list of filenames that we need to process, and these filenames need to be fetched from an external database. This is a typical scenario that I have worked with, and we would need a sensor in our airflow dag to find those files. Let's imagine you are using a postgres database and the filenames are stored there. This is slightly more complex, but shows a real-world usage scenario:

```python
from airflow.decorators import dag, task
from airflow.providers.postgres.operators.postgres import PostgresOperator
from airflow.providers.postgres.hooks.postgres import PostgresHook
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
import pendulum


@dag(start_date=days_ago(1), schedule=None, catchup=False, tags=['example'])
def dynamic_files_example():
    
    @task
    def get_files_to_process():
        postgres_hook = PostgresHook(postgres_conn_id="your_postgres_conn_id") #replace with your connection id
        sql_query = """
            SELECT file_name FROM your_file_table
            WHERE created_at BETWEEN %s AND %s;
        """
        start_date = pendulum.today().add(days=-7)
        end_date = pendulum.today()
        records = postgres_hook.get_records(sql_query, parameters=(start_date, end_date))
        return [record[0] for record in records]


    @task
    def process_file(file_name):
         print(f"Processing file: {file_name}")

    files = get_files_to_process()
    process_file.expand(file_name=files)

dynamic_files_example()
```

In this version, we use the `PostgresHook` to execute a SQL query to retrieve the file names from your database. The `get_files_to_process` task returns a list of filenames, which is then used by the `process_file` task through task mapping via `expand`.

Finally, let's consider a more recent Airflow feature - task groups - as this provides a great way to structure dynamic task generation when you are using the new task mapping (introduced in airflow 2.3) features, specially if you require more complex orchestration. Assume now that we have a list of files that have a prefix and a corresponding date. We wish to process each set of file prefixes for each date:

```python
from airflow.decorators import dag, task_group, task
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
from datetime import timedelta
import pendulum


@dag(start_date=days_ago(1), schedule=None, catchup=False, tags=['example'])
def dynamic_files_group_example():

    @task
    def get_date_prefixes_to_process(start_date, end_date, prefixes):
        date_prefixes = []
        current_date = start_date
        while current_date <= end_date:
             for prefix in prefixes:
                date_prefixes.append(f"{prefix}_{current_date.to_date_string()}")
             current_date = current_date.add(days=1)
        return date_prefixes


    @task_group
    def process_date_prefix(prefix):
        @task
        def process_prefix(prefix):
             print(f"Processing prefix: {prefix}")

        process_prefix(prefix)

    start_date = pendulum.today().add(days=-7)
    end_date = pendulum.today()
    prefixes = ["file_prefix_a", "file_prefix_b"]

    date_prefixes = get_date_prefixes_to_process(start_date, end_date, prefixes)
    process_date_prefix.expand(prefix = date_prefixes)

dynamic_files_group_example()
```
Here, we use the task group to logically group the tasks that need to be performed on each file prefix with a specific date. While not strictly necessary in this example (we could use the direct map function), for more complex logic inside this task group, this could be very helpful. The main point is, however, that the `expand` function is still used to process each result of the `get_date_prefixes_to_process` task, allowing the overall dag to scale dynamically.

For further reading and a more comprehensive grasp of dynamic task mapping, you'll find the official Apache Airflow documentation indispensable. Specifically, look into sections relating to "dynamic task mapping" and "task groups". Also, consider delving into *Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow*, by Bas Harenslak and Julian Rutger, as they cover these advanced topics with excellent practical examples. It's a great way to build a more solid understanding of these features, avoiding any of the typical pitfalls you may experience during implementation. Another useful resource is "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann for developing a good basis of distributed computing and its inherent challenges. These can help frame your Airflow usage within a larger context of reliable data processing.

Remember, the correct approach will largely depend on the specifics of your data source, the complexity of the processing, and the overall scale you're aiming for. Start simple, test incrementally, and gradually build towards a robust and scalable solution. It’s all about understanding Airflow’s underlying mechanics and leveraging them appropriately.
