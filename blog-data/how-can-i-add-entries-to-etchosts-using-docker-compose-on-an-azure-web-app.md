Alright, let’s tackle this. I've personally bumped into this exact challenge a few times back when we were transitioning our monolithic services to containerized microservices on Azure, and it’s a pretty common hurdle. The core issue stems from how Docker networking operates, especially within the constrained environment of an Azure Web App. Directly manipulating the `/etc/hosts` file inside a container running on an Azure Web App isn’t straightforward. You don't have the direct access you would on a standalone Docker host. The good news is, there are several techniques we can leverage to achieve the desired outcome.

First, it's critical to understand that a Docker container, in its default configuration, doesn't inherit host-level DNS settings or hosts entries from the underlying Azure Web App infrastructure. Inside the container, DNS resolution is typically managed by Docker's internal DNS server, which is usually based on a bridge network configuration. Attempting to modify `/etc/hosts` within the container after it’s already running (like via `docker exec`) is not persistent, it vanishes when the container is restarted. This is because containers are intended to be ephemeral. This means we need a method to apply these changes *during* the container's creation, and ideally, through the docker-compose configuration.

One robust approach is to use the `extra_hosts` directive within your `docker-compose.yml` file. This allows us to map hostnames to specific ip addresses at the container creation time, effectively adding them to the container's internal `/etc/hosts` file. It’s a declarative approach, meaning the desired configuration is defined in the compose file itself, and docker handles the implementation. This avoids the need for complex scripts or manual configurations. Let me illustrate with a concrete example:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  my_service:
    image: my_custom_image:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    extra_hosts:
      - "internal.api.example.com:10.0.0.5"
      - "legacy.database.example.com:192.168.1.10"
    # other service configurations
```

In this snippet, `internal.api.example.com` will resolve to `10.0.0.5` and `legacy.database.example.com` will resolve to `192.168.1.10` *inside* the `my_service` container. The container’s `/etc/hosts` file will reflect these mappings when the container is created via `docker-compose up`. This approach is clean, repeatable, and avoids manual modifications. It's crucial to ensure those IPs are accessible from within the container's network. This method generally works well for static mappings and scenarios where the IP addresses are known upfront.

Now, let's address a more dynamic case where perhaps you're pulling environment variables or need more programmatic control. The `extra_hosts` directive is limited when you require more sophisticated operations. In those circumstances, you might need to modify the container image itself or leverage a startup script within the container. Here’s a way to bake in dynamic host entries into a docker image build process:

First you would need to create a custom Dockerfile using a base image, then in your `dockerfile` you could write something like:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y iputils-ping

COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
```

Then the `entrypoint.sh` script would look something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Add /etc/hosts entries based on environment variables
if [[ -n "${CUSTOM_HOST1_NAME}" && -n "${CUSTOM_HOST1_IP}" ]]; then
  echo "${CUSTOM_HOST1_IP}  ${CUSTOM_HOST1_NAME}" >> /etc/hosts
fi

if [[ -n "${CUSTOM_HOST2_NAME}" && -n "${CUSTOM_HOST2_IP}" ]]; then
  echo "${CUSTOM_HOST2_IP}  ${CUSTOM_HOST2_NAME}" >> /etc/hosts
fi

# Start main process (you may need to modify this)
exec "$@"
```

And then in your docker-compose, this would be wired up with environment variables, like so:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  my_dynamic_service:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: my_dynamic_image:latest
    environment:
      - CUSTOM_HOST1_NAME=dynamic.api.example.com
      - CUSTOM_HOST1_IP=10.10.10.15
      - CUSTOM_HOST2_NAME=dynamic.cache.example.com
      - CUSTOM_HOST2_IP=172.16.0.20
    # other service configurations
```

Here we are building the image with our custom `dockerfile` that copies an entrypoint script to run every time the container starts. This script then dynamically adds hosts entries by reading the environment variables. Note that this approach requires rebuilding the image whenever the IP addresses or hostnames change, and it's not as clean as `extra_hosts` if the mappings are always static. However, it grants you much more flexibility if environment variables dictate the addresses, or you need to perform conditional logic. The `exec "$@"` line is critical, as it passes along the command specified in your container's `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` definition in the Dockerfile if those exist. Ensure you tailor the script to your specific process needs.

Let me address one further consideration. Sometimes the services you need to access are also deployed on Azure and are only reachable via their internal DNS. In that scenario, simply adding static IPs in `/etc/hosts` might not be the best strategy due to potential IP changes. Here, you might investigate Azure’s private DNS integration with your virtual network. Though, this doesn't impact the container's /etc/hosts file directly, it would allow your containers to resolve internal service names using DNS resolution, which is the most typical approach to handle service discovery in cloud environments. Your application code should then be able to connect using these DNS names. This scenario would require a broader architectural change and is typically not as simple as adjusting a `/etc/hosts` file but provides a more scalable and robust solution.

For further investigation, I highly recommend a deep dive into "Docker in Practice" by Ian Miell and Aidan Hobson Sayers – it provides thorough coverage of networking and container configuration. For a more fundamental understanding of networking in general, "TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1" by W. Richard Stevens remains a core text that will solidify your networking knowledge. For Azure specifics, I would look at the official documentation on Azure networking, which is consistently updated and provides the most current advice on best practices in a cloud environment.

In summary, using `extra_hosts` in `docker-compose.yml` provides a clean and straightforward method for static entries. For dynamic requirements, manipulating `/etc/hosts` via a custom startup script can work. However, always consider whether a more integrated solution, such as Azure's private DNS, might be more appropriate for your long term goals. The goal is always to build reproducible and maintainable systems. Good luck and happy coding.
