Okay, let's tackle this. I've seen this scenario more times than I can count, particularly when dealing with batch processing or intensive computation. The core challenge is how to perform calculations concurrently without overwhelming the system by spawning too many threads. I’ll walk you through the nuances of creating an asynchronous method to calculate a sum while actively managing the thread pool. It's a classic problem, and there are several ways to approach it, but the key is finding the balance between concurrency and resource consumption.

My experience with a past project involving large-scale data aggregation comes to mind. We had to compute aggregates from millions of data points coming in from various sources, and doing this serially would have taken days. The initial naive approach was to launch a thread for every data point, which unsurprisingly led to performance bottlenecks and resource exhaustion. We quickly learned the importance of thread pooling and asynchronous execution.

The primary way to control the threads involved in this type of task is by using a thread pool executor. This mechanism lets you submit tasks for execution to a limited pool of threads, preventing the system from being overburdened. When a thread in the pool finishes a task, it picks up another from the queue, allowing the concurrency you want with predictable resource consumption. Let's break down how to do this with Python, given it's a commonly used language.

Here's the first snippet using Python's `concurrent.futures` module, which is one of the most straightforward approaches:

```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

def calculate_partial_sum(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

def calculate_sum_asynchronously(all_numbers, num_threads=4):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_threads) as executor:
      results = []
      # we chunk the numbers into smaller lists to be computed by different threads
      chunk_size = len(all_numbers) // num_threads
      chunks = [all_numbers[i*chunk_size: (i+1)*chunk_size] for i in range(num_threads - 1)]
      chunks.append(all_numbers[(num_threads - 1) * chunk_size:])

      futures = [executor.submit(calculate_partial_sum, chunk) for chunk in chunks]
      for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
          results.append(future.result())
    return sum(results)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    numbers = list(range(1000000))  # large set of numbers
    start_time = time.time()
    total_sum = calculate_sum_asynchronously(numbers, num_threads=8)
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total sum: {total_sum}")
    print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

In this example, `ThreadPoolExecutor` manages the threads. We divide the initial number set into chunks, each handled by a separate worker thread in the pool. The `executor.submit()` method schedules the `calculate_partial_sum` tasks, and `concurrent.futures.as_completed` iterates through the completed futures allowing for the results to be aggregated. Notice the chunking of data; this is fundamental. Without it, each thread might receive a minimal work unit, leading to excessive overhead from thread management.

Now, while `concurrent.futures` is convenient, it is not the only way. Sometimes, you might need finer control over thread creation or might be working in an environment where `concurrent.futures` isn’t available. In such scenarios, the `threading` module could be a good alternative. Let's look at the next example using the `threading` module directly:

```python
import threading
import time
import queue

def calculate_partial_sum(numbers, q):
  q.put(sum(numbers))

def calculate_sum_asynchronously_threaded(all_numbers, num_threads=4):
  q = queue.Queue()
  threads = []

  chunk_size = len(all_numbers) // num_threads
  chunks = [all_numbers[i*chunk_size: (i+1)*chunk_size] for i in range(num_threads - 1)]
  chunks.append(all_numbers[(num_threads - 1) * chunk_size:])

  for chunk in chunks:
      thread = threading.Thread(target=calculate_partial_sum, args=(chunk, q))
      threads.append(thread)
      thread.start()

  for thread in threads:
      thread.join() # wait for each thread to finish

  total_sum = 0
  while not q.empty():
    total_sum += q.get()
  return total_sum


if __name__ == '__main__':
    numbers = list(range(1000000))
    start_time = time.time()
    total_sum = calculate_sum_asynchronously_threaded(numbers, num_threads=8)
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total sum: {total_sum}")
    print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```
Here, we're explicitly creating `threading.Thread` objects, starting them, and then using `join` to wait for their completion. The partial sums are communicated back via a queue. This approach gives you more control over individual threads but requires manual management of threading creation and synchronization mechanisms (like this queue), making it less streamlined than the previous `concurrent.futures` example but more flexible if needed.

Another important thing I’ve seen often overlooked is the overhead related to creating threads. While threading is efficient, creation and destruction of threads can still have its impact. This is why thread pooling is paramount in production environments. The `ThreadPoolExecutor` internally reuses threads, reducing the overhead.

Finally, remember that asynchronous execution isn’t a magic bullet, and doesn't always give speed-up compared to synchronous code. It’s most advantageous in scenarios where there’s a mixture of compute and waiting (like i/o, network, external process). If your computation is fully CPU-bound and not memory bound, you might see a more modest gain or no speed-up at all, or in some cases even a slowdown because of extra threading and sync overheads. This is where understanding the nature of your computational task becomes crucial. If you are constantly swapping data from main memory, then threads can help avoid being idle during the swap process, but CPU-intensive tasks are often best handled by fewer (but more efficient) threads to avoid bottlenecks.

For further reading, I would strongly recommend: "Python Cookbook" by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones, especially the sections on concurrency and parallelism; and “Concurrent Programming in Java: Design Principles and Patterns” by Doug Lea if you are curious about how concurrent primitives are designed and implemented in an industrial setting, which has implications even for Python code. The material from these books will provide a thorough grounding in concurrent programming techniques. I would also suggest reading materials about computer architecture, especially cache coherency to understand the potential drawbacks of certain threaded computations. These concepts will greatly inform how you design and implement your solutions.

Let's move on to another example, this time using `asyncio`, particularly helpful when dealing with i/o bound tasks in python:

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def calculate_partial_sum(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

async def calculate_sum_asynchronously_asyncio(all_numbers, num_threads=4):
    chunk_size = len(all_numbers) // num_threads
    chunks = [all_numbers[i*chunk_size: (i+1)*chunk_size] for i in range(num_threads - 1)]
    chunks.append(all_numbers[(num_threads - 1) * chunk_size:])

    tasks = [calculate_partial_sum(chunk) for chunk in chunks]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return sum(results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    async def main():
        numbers = list(range(1000000))
        start_time = time.time()
        total_sum = await calculate_sum_asynchronously_asyncio(numbers, num_threads=8)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Total sum: {total_sum}")
        print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This `asyncio` example is different in that it leverages coroutines and event loops to handle concurrency. The `async` and `await` keywords are used to define coroutines and manage the suspension and resumption of operations. Unlike traditional threads, `asyncio` is single-threaded and cooperative, which means it handles concurrency by multiplexing tasks on the same thread using an event loop. It's particularly suitable for i/o bound tasks since when one task is waiting, another can be running. For CPU-bound tasks, such as simple math, it is often not a great idea as there are no threads that can run on other cores.

In closing, whether you choose `concurrent.futures`, raw `threading` or `asyncio`, understanding the underlying concepts of thread pools and task management is crucial for building efficient and robust applications. It's not just about making code faster; it’s about making it work reliably under various loads and conditions. Choosing the correct strategy depends heavily on the type of tasks your application handles, and you need to know your application well to know what the right approach is.
