Alright,  I've spent my fair share of time orchestrating .net core applications in azure, so I've seen a few things when it comes to integrating with mysql and managing large data ingestion processes. We're diving into a fairly common scenario, but there are definitely nuances to consider, especially when optimizing for performance and reliability.

Initially, when dealing with a similar setup a few years back, we had a particularly thorny issue with upload timeouts and database connection exhaustion, which I'll touch upon later. But, first, let's lay the groundwork for a successful deployment.

The basic flow you’re after involves several key steps: containerizing your .net core application with docker, creating an azure app service, configuring it to work with a mysql database (ideally an azure database for mysql flexible server for ease of management), and then tackling that bulk data upload aspect. It’s a multi-stage dance, but once the steps are clear, it's entirely manageable.

**Step 1: Dockerizing your .NET Core Application**

This starts with a well-defined `dockerfile`. Here's a basic example:

```dockerfile
#stage 1: build phase
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build-env
WORKDIR /app

#copy csproj and restore
COPY *.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore

#copy everything else and build
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

#stage 2: final runtime image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-env /app/out .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "YourApplication.dll"]
```

This dockerfile performs a multi-stage build. The first stage uses the .net sdk to build your application. Then, it copies the built artifacts into a runtime image that's smaller and only includes what's needed to run your app. Make sure to replace `YourApplication.dll` with the actual name of your application’s main dll.

**Step 2: Creating an Azure App Service and Configuring MySQL Connection**

You can achieve this through the Azure portal, Azure cli, or infrastructure-as-code tools like bicep or terraform. Personally, I find the cli pretty efficient for initial setup. Here's a conceptual Azure cli sequence:

```bash
az group create --name yourresourcegroup --location eastus
az mysql flexible-server create --resource-group yourresourcegroup --name your-mysql-server --sku-name Standard_B1ms --admin-user youradmin --admin-password yourpassword --public-access 0.0.0.0
az appservice plan create --resource-group yourresourcegroup --name your-app-plan --sku S1 --is-linux
az webapp create --resource-group yourresourcegroup --plan your-app-plan --name your-webapp --deployment-container-image-name yourdockerimage:latest --https-only true
```

Replace placeholders like `yourresourcegroup`, `your-mysql-server`, `your-app-plan`, `your-webapp`, `yourdockerimage:latest`, `youradmin`, and `yourpassword` with your actual values. Critically, you'll want to configure environment variables in the app service to point your .net core application to your mysql server. This usually looks something like:

`connectionstrings__defaultconnection` set to `server=your-mysql-server.mysql.database.azure.com;database=yourdatabase;uid=youradmin;pwd=yourpassword;`

Again, replace the placeholders with the correct connection details. The `public-access 0.0.0.0` in the mysql command makes your server publicly accessible for testing, but you'll want to lock it down using firewall rules to specific ip addresses in a real production scenario.

**Step 3: Handling Bulk Data Uploads**

This is where things get interesting. A naive approach might involve sending massive amounts of data through a standard http endpoint, which frequently results in request timeouts, excessive memory consumption on the server, and potential database performance issues. Instead, consider the following strategies:

*   **Chunked uploads:** Break down large data files into smaller chunks. Your .net core application should receive these chunks and either store them temporarily or process them in batches.
*   **Background processing:** Use a message queue like Azure Service Bus or Rabbitmq to offload the actual database insertion process to a background job. This allows your api to respond quickly and ensures robustness.
*   **Database batch inserts:** Use libraries like entity framework core's `addrange` or a raw sql command with a large insert statement with multiple value sets, to insert multiple rows in a single operation instead of inserting one at a time.

Here's a .net core code snippet illustrating a simplified version of chunked uploads, assuming you're receiving a csv file, using a basic stream processing approach:

```csharp
[HttpPost("upload")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Upload(IFormFile file)
{
    if (file == null || file.Length == 0) return BadRequest("no file was uploaded.");

    try
    {
        using var reader = new StreamReader(file.OpenReadStream());
        string? line;
        var data = new List<MyDataType>(); //my custom data type
        while ((line = await reader.ReadLineAsync()) != null)
        {
            //here is where we would parse the csv line into an object of type MyDataType
            //in this example, we just simulate it for simplicity
            var myData = new MyDataType{ Data = line };
            data.Add(myData);

            if (data.Count >= 1000) //process in batches of 1000, for example
            {
              //simulate storing data in database
                await _myService.BulkInsertData(data);
              data.Clear(); //clear the list for next batch
            }
        }
          //ensure to process any left over data
          if (data.Any()) {
              await _myService.BulkInsertData(data);
          }

        return Ok("upload finished");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        //log error details here, for example with Ilogger
        return StatusCode(500, "an error occurred.");
    }
}
```

And then a basic bulk insert example from the above code snippet within a service class might look like this:

```csharp
public async Task BulkInsertData(List<MyDataType> data)
    {
      //assuming you have an entity framework context and the myDataType class is mapped to a database table
     _context.AddRange(data);
     await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
```

This code shows a simplified processing of a file, reading it line by line. In a real-world application, you'd likely use a proper csv parsing library and would want to add more error handling. Additionally, you'd want to leverage a background process for database writes so that the upload endpoint returns very quickly. Here is an example where you leverage azure service bus for this:

```csharp
//in the upload endpoint
public async Task<IActionResult> Upload(IFormFile file)
{
    //... check for file, read file to list<string> of lines (same as in prior example).
      var lines = new List<string>();
      //add lines here

       //serialize the data to json
    var json = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize(lines);

    //send to azure service bus
    await _serviceBusClient.SendMessageAsync(new ServiceBusMessage(json));

    return Ok("upload initiated");
}


//in a background service (this can be hosted as a separate worker process)
public async Task ProcessUploadedData()
{
    while(!_stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested){
        await Task.Delay(1000);

         ServiceBusReceivedMessage message = await _serviceBusReceiver.ReceiveMessageAsync();
         if(message != null)
         {
             var json = message.Body.ToString();
            var lines = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<string>>(json);

            var data = new List<MyDataType>(); //parse the lines to type mydatatype
             foreach(var line in lines)
            {
                //parse
                 var myData = new MyDataType{ Data = line };
                data.Add(myData);
            }

            await _myService.BulkInsertData(data);

            await _serviceBusReceiver.CompleteMessageAsync(message); //complete when done
        }
    }
}
```

This approach offloads the actual processing of data to a separate process. The upload endpoint returns quickly to the client and the data is processed in the background in the worker service, ensuring scalability and preventing timeouts. In this example, we’re using `ServiceBusReceivedMessage` as it's a very standard approach for this. The message is marked as complete once processed, preventing the same message from being processed again.

**Key Takeaways**

Avoid large single inserts. Implement chunked uploads and background processing with message queues to keep your api responsive and ensure scalability and resilience. Employ batch inserts to optimize data insertion. Remember to use appropriate logging and error handling throughout your code. The initial setup with Azure is streamlined, but the heavy lifting comes in optimizing how you handle large quantities of data.

For deeper understanding on the topics discussed, I'd suggest exploring these resources:

*   **"Programming Microsoft Azure, Second Edition" by David S. Platt:** A solid overview of azure services.
*   **"Entity Framework Core in Action" by Jon P. Smith:** Deep dive into ef core best practices.
*   **"Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann:** An invaluable resource for understanding the fundamentals of data processing and distributed systems which will help you think about the problem from first principles.
*  **The official documentation for Azure App Services, Azure database for mysql, and Azure service bus.** They are essential for staying up to date.

This should provide a fairly comprehensive starting point for deploying your application to azure while addressing those performance considerations that usually cause headaches. Remember that each scenario is unique, so adjustments might be needed based on your specific requirements and data structures. Good luck.
