I've seen this one pop up a million times it's the classic docker image not found locally error and it usually hits when you're trying to spin up a container and docker just can't find the image you told it to use I mean seriously its like the simplest thing sometimes gets you

 lets break it down and get this thing working

First things first you gotta understand how docker looks for images it has a local cache where it stores all the images it has downloaded when you run docker run or a docker compose up command it tries to find the image there locally before even thinking about going to a registry like docker hub or your private registry if you have one thats the key thing

So when you get that "image does not exist locally with tag" error it usually means one of these three things

1 You actually never pulled the image docker is searching your local image cache and its just not there You gotta explicitly pull it using docker pull the image name and tag then try run again

2 You messed up the image name or tag when you were typing it in your docker run or docker compose file Docker images are like versioned software the name and the tag are specific identifiers check that everything is matched character by character its case sensitive especially with linux distros and tags

3 You're on a network where docker cant actually reach the registry docker needs network access to pull images from registries maybe its a proxy issue or you are behind a firewall

I've had my fair share of this problem I remember like its yesterday one time I was working on a microservices setup I was trying to bring up a backend service that had a new redis image version and I swear i checked my compose file a million times but I kept getting the image does not exist error turns out I was using a slightly different tag in my compose compared to what was in the registry and it took me ages and more than a few cups of coffee to figure it out it was ridiculous

So here's the typical troubleshooting workflow what you should be doing

First verify that you've actually pulled the image you should be doing this before running containers you should always pull the image if you've not done so before it's like making sure you have the ingredients for your cake before you try to bake it

```bash
docker pull your_image_name:your_tag
```

replace your\_image\_name with the name of the image and your\_tag with the tag you're trying to use if no tag is specified it will assume latest which you should probably avoid for production

If that doesnt work double-check that you typed everything right when you tried to run the image double check you image names tags and spelling

```bash
docker run your_image_name:your_tag
```

Make sure that name and tag exactly match what you specified or intended that you have pulled correctly

If it's still a no-go check that docker can reach the registry it's like having a perfectly good map but no internet connection to use it

First try to run this and see what the output is

```bash
docker pull alpine:latest
```

if you can't pull from docker hub its probably a network issue but its good to check your docker installation in some rare occasions

For the networking issues you could check for docker proxy settings usually in your docker desktop settings or your docker engine config if its a standalone install you can also check your system proxy settings to see if they are conflicting

If you are behind a company firewall you might need to configure docker to use a proxy server to get internet access you might need to speak to your network admin for proper configuration instructions

This was another problem I faced it was not as simple as it may seem I was trying to deploy a private docker image in a restricted network at my previous workplace and it took a few days to get the settings working perfectly it turned out that I needed to use an authentication token stored locally and add it to the pull request with the specific registry address along with the proper network proxy this stuff can get surprisingly complex sometimes

Now some best practices from years of dealing with these docker issues

1 Always use specific tags instead of latest I cannot emphasize this enough especially in production you'll never know when a latest tag might change unexpectedly and breaks something

2 Pre-pull your images during your build process it is a good way to avoid the docker image not found locally error during the container startup if you know which images you'll need in production you could do it beforehand and cache it

3 Use an image caching solution like a private registry this will save time and bandwidth and its good for reproducibility of builds especially in CI/CD environments

4 Make sure your docker config is setup for your registry itâ€™s surprising how often authentication and other config settings can cause issues

5 Learn how to use the docker system prune command it is very useful to clean up your system from all of these unnecessary local images and volumes when you are working on a complex docker environment

And of course debugging tools are your friends check your docker logs and your system logs these will provide clues that will take you to the problem

I mean I'm not saying docker errors are always fun but with the proper debugging they can be less painful I can tell you a joke about docker containers but it might be a little too layered for some of you

For learning more about docker I would recommend reading the Docker documentation this is very basic but it works https://docs.docker.com/
There are also some good books on the subject like "Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton which goes over some of these technical details

And remember its always better to be systematic in your troubleshooting you will get there I've been there many times so you're not alone on this
