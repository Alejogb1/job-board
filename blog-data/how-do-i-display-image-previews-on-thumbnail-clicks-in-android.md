,  I recall a project back in '18, a social media app, where we had precisely this requirement: displaying larger previews when users tapped on image thumbnails. It sounds simple on paper, but the devil, as they say, is in the details – especially when you want it smooth and performant, even with hundreds of images. This isn't a trivial "copy-paste" situation, and it warrants a considered, multi-faceted approach.

The core challenge revolves around efficiency and memory management. Loading full-resolution images directly into an activity or fragment is a surefire recipe for out-of-memory errors, especially on lower-end devices or when dealing with a large number of images. Therefore, we need to be smart about how we handle this. The basic pattern generally involves:

1.  **Thumbnail Generation:** Displaying scaled-down versions initially to provide a visual representation without consuming excessive resources.
2.  **Lazy Loading:** Loading full-sized images only when the user clicks a specific thumbnail.
3.  **Efficient Image Handling:** Employing techniques like caching, and proper bitmap management, to prevent memory leaks and ensure smooth transitions.

Let's unpack these points with code examples.

Firstly, concerning thumbnail creation: it's seldom a good practice to resize an image manually each time the thumbnail is required. Instead, it’s preferable to either: (a) generate thumbnails during the image upload phase on the server side and serve them alongside the larger images, or (b) generate these once client-side and store them in a local cache. If we consider the situation where thumbnails are not pre-generated and we must do it on the client, we can do this with something like the following:

```java
import android.content.Context;
import android.graphics.Bitmap;
import android.graphics.BitmapFactory;
import android.os.AsyncTask;
import android.widget.ImageView;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.lang.ref.WeakReference;

public class ThumbnailLoader extends AsyncTask<File, Void, Bitmap> {

    private final int thumbnailWidth;
    private final int thumbnailHeight;
    private final WeakReference<ImageView> imageViewReference;

    public ThumbnailLoader(ImageView imageView, int width, int height) {
        this.imageViewReference = new WeakReference<>(imageView);
        this.thumbnailWidth = width;
        this.thumbnailHeight = height;
    }

    @Override
    protected Bitmap doInBackground(File... files) {
        File imageFile = files[0];
        if (imageFile == null || !imageFile.exists()) {
            return null;
        }
        return createScaledBitmap(imageFile, thumbnailWidth, thumbnailHeight);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPostExecute(Bitmap bitmap) {
      ImageView imageView = imageViewReference.get();
      if (imageView != null && bitmap != null) {
        imageView.setImageBitmap(bitmap);
      }
    }


    private Bitmap createScaledBitmap(File imageFile, int reqWidth, int reqHeight) {
       try {
           FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(imageFile);
            BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
            options.inJustDecodeBounds = true;
           BitmapFactory.decodeStream(fis, null, options);
           fis.close();
            int inSampleSize = calculateInSampleSize(options, reqWidth, reqHeight);

            fis = new FileInputStream(imageFile);
            options.inJustDecodeBounds = false;
            options.inSampleSize = inSampleSize;

            return BitmapFactory.decodeStream(fis, null, options);
       } catch(Exception e) {
           return null;
       }
    }


   private int calculateInSampleSize(BitmapFactory.Options options, int reqWidth, int reqHeight) {
        final int height = options.outHeight;
        final int width = options.outWidth;
        int inSampleSize = 1;

        if (height > reqHeight || width > reqWidth) {
            final int halfHeight = height / 2;
            final int halfWidth = width / 2;

            while ((halfHeight / inSampleSize) >= reqHeight
                    && (halfWidth / inSampleSize) >= reqWidth) {
                inSampleSize *= 2;
            }
        }

        return inSampleSize;
    }
}
```

Here, we are using an `AsyncTask` to avoid blocking the UI thread, and `BitmapFactory.Options` to avoid unnecessary memory allocation during thumbnail scaling. The `calculateInSampleSize` method effectively reduces the dimensions of the original image, limiting the memory usage. To use the loader, instantiate it and call `execute` with the file object: `new ThumbnailLoader(imageView, 100, 100).execute(new File("/path/to/image.jpg"));`

Secondly, handling clicks and loading the large images: when a thumbnail is clicked, we need to load the corresponding full-sized image. Again, doing this directly on the UI thread is not advised. Here’s a simplified way to approach that, assuming that you have a URL or path to the high-resolution image.

```java
import android.content.Context;
import android.graphics.Bitmap;
import android.graphics.BitmapFactory;
import android.os.AsyncTask;
import android.widget.ImageView;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.lang.ref.WeakReference;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;

public class LargeImageLoader extends AsyncTask<String, Void, Bitmap> {

    private final WeakReference<ImageView> imageViewReference;
    private final Context context;

    public LargeImageLoader(Context context, ImageView imageView) {
        this.imageViewReference = new WeakReference<>(imageView);
        this.context = context;
    }

    @Override
    protected Bitmap doInBackground(String... urls) {
        String imageUrl = urls[0];
        HttpURLConnection connection = null;
        InputStream inputStream = null;
        try {
             URL url = new URL(imageUrl);
            connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            connection.connect();
            inputStream = connection.getInputStream();

            return BitmapFactory.decodeStream(inputStream);

        } catch (IOException e) {
           return null;
        } finally {
             if (inputStream != null) {
               try {
                 inputStream.close();
                } catch(IOException ignored) {}
             }
            if (connection != null) {
              connection.disconnect();
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPostExecute(Bitmap bitmap) {
        ImageView imageView = imageViewReference.get();
        if (imageView != null && bitmap != null) {
            imageView.setImageBitmap(bitmap);
        }
    }
}
```

This loader uses the `AsyncTask` again to avoid blocking the UI thread. Crucially, it uses `HttpURLConnection` to retrieve the image data from the network and `BitmapFactory.decodeStream` to create a bitmap from the input stream. This approach is more suitable for loading remote images. To use: `new LargeImageLoader(context, fullSizeImageView).execute("https://example.com/fullsizeimage.jpg");`

Now, consider the third point - efficient bitmap caching. Storing loaded bitmaps in a cache is extremely important to ensure a fluid user experience and avoid unnecessarily reloading images. Android provides classes such as `LruCache` that can be implemented like this:

```java
import android.graphics.Bitmap;
import android.util.LruCache;

public class BitmapCache {

    private LruCache<String, Bitmap> memoryCache;

    public BitmapCache(int cacheSizeInKb) {
        int maxSize = cacheSizeInKb * 1024; // convert to Bytes
        memoryCache = new LruCache<String, Bitmap>(maxSize) {
            @Override
            protected int sizeOf(String key, Bitmap bitmap) {
                return bitmap.getByteCount();
            }
        };
    }

    public void addBitmapToMemoryCache(String key, Bitmap bitmap) {
        if (getBitmapFromMemCache(key) == null) {
            memoryCache.put(key, bitmap);
        }
    }

    public Bitmap getBitmapFromMemCache(String key) {
        return memoryCache.get(key);
    }
}

```

This `BitmapCache` class allows us to store bitmaps efficiently. Before loading any image from the network or disk, the application should check the cache; if the bitmap is available, it should be used directly. Upon loading an image, the bitmap should be added to the cache for later reuse.

For deeper understanding, I’d suggest researching the following resources:

*   **"Efficient Android Threading"** by Doug Sillars (although a bit dated now, the principles remain relevant). It delves deeply into `AsyncTask` and other threading strategies for Android.
*   **Android Developer Documentation:** Specifically, the sections on "Managing Bitmaps", “Displaying Bitmaps Efficiently” and the `LruCache` class. These are critical for grasping the best practices for memory management with images.
*   **"High Performance Android Apps"** by Doug Sillars (Again, it’s an older book, but concepts discussed about image handling are still crucial.) This book will provide more context to performance optimization for mobile applications, including a discussion on managing memory consumption with images and using caching properly.

Implementing this layered approach (thumbnail generation, lazy loading, and efficient caching) ensures that your application handles image previews smoothly, even with large numbers of images and varying device capabilities. Remember that these examples are starting points; production code will likely require additional error handling and more robust caching mechanisms, but these should get you well on the way to a working solution.
