Okay, let's tackle this. I've seen this particular point trip up many a developer, and it's understandable. The core issue revolves around the fundamental lifecycle of a Docker container build versus its runtime. The short answer is: yes, technically you *can* start a process using `RUN` in a Dockerfile, but it's crucial to understand that the process will **not** persist when the container is run from the resulting image. This often leads to confusion, and in my experience, it's where many debugging hours are spent.

Let’s unpack why and how that is, drawing from past projects where I’ve had to navigate this exact situation. Imagine building an image for a web application. You might be tempted to use `RUN` to start the server during the image build process, thinking that the server will then automatically be running when a container is created from that image. You might see something along these lines:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx

RUN service nginx start # <-- This is where the misunderstanding begins.

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Here, `RUN service nginx start` attempts to start the nginx service during image building. The important takeaway is that this command executes within a *temporary* container that's created during the build. Once the command finishes, this container is discarded, and the resulting filesystem changes become a new layer in your image. Therefore, the nginx process, while started within that temporary container, does not persist in the final image. This is a crucial distinction.

The `RUN` command, at its core, executes commands *during* the image build process. Its main purpose is to install software, copy files, set up configurations, and perform other image preparations. It isn't meant to create persistent running processes within the final container. Anything you start with `RUN` exists only within the ephemeral build container.

What you *do* want to use to start your main application process in the container is either the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` instruction, or sometimes a combination of both. These instructions define the command that will run when the container is launched from the image. The `CMD` instruction provides a default command that can be overridden when running the container, whereas `ENTRYPOINT` sets the main command that will always be executed, possibly with arguments provided from `CMD` or the command line during runtime.

To illustrate the correct approach, consider the following example:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
COPY app.py .

CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

In this case, I install Python, its package manager, and copy the application code using the `RUN` instructions. Then, I define the command to run when a container is started using the `CMD` instruction. This tells Docker to run `python3 app.py` when the container is initialized.

Now, let’s add a scenario involving `ENTRYPOINT`:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y  bash

COPY entrypoint.sh /

RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

CMD ["-some", "parameters"]
```

And our simple entrypoint.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "starting process with args $*"
ls -al
# start our application here, perhaps
# exec some_app
```

Here, the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction specifies that the `entrypoint.sh` script should be executed. If no command-line arguments are supplied when running the container, the parameters specified by `CMD` are passed as arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT` script. This is a common pattern for adding pre-launch logic, such as environment setup or parameter parsing. The `ls -al` and subsequent placeholder comment represent your actual application startup logic that will execute once a container based on this image is started.

The key difference between these is that, in the second example, we always execute the script in the `ENTRYPOINT`, passing any command line arguments to it; whereas, in the first, the `CMD` is simply the command that gets executed when we start the container.

Another common mistake is when trying to create services via daemonizing them inside a container. It's generally bad practice. Containerized applications should typically run as a foreground process, which ensures that the container lives as long as the application process is running. If the application exits, the container will exit as well. This behavior makes managing container lifecycles considerably easier. When we daemonize a process, it detaches from the foreground, and we're not managing that process anymore, which leads to headaches with container health checks. For example, starting an application via something like `command &` inside the `CMD` instruction will detach from the foreground and the container might terminate since the `CMD` process will likely exit shortly after the start of that daemonized application. The preferred method is to start the application directly in the foreground as shown in the examples above and using a process manager if necessary.

If you really require complex process management, you should investigate an init system inside your container. However, this can add complexity and is not generally recommended for simple applications. In the vast majority of cases, simply starting your main process using `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` is the most appropriate method.

To solidify this further, I'd encourage you to consult the Docker documentation, specifically the sections on Dockerfile instructions, `CMD`, and `ENTRYPOINT`. Additionally, “Docker in Practice” by Ian Miell and Aidan Hobson Sayers provides an excellent in-depth look at these concepts, offering a more comprehensive perspective with real-world examples. "Effective DevOps" by Jennifer Davis and Ryn Daniels also dedicates chapters to containerization and best practices around Docker, which will be highly beneficial. Finally, I can't stress enough the value of experimenting. Play around with these concepts by building your own sample images. That is really where the learning solidifies.

In summary, avoid the temptation to use `RUN` to launch processes meant to persist beyond the image build. Leverage `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` appropriately to start your application processes when the container is instantiated. This strategy simplifies your Dockerfiles, makes debugging easier, and ensures predictable container behavior.
