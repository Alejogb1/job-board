Okay, let’s tackle this. The question of whether machine learning can discern the presence of a division operator in images isn’t as straightforward as it might initially seem. It's less about optical character recognition (OCR) of a symbol and more about a deep dive into pattern recognition at a granular level. I've encountered scenarios similar to this in the past, specifically during a project aimed at automatically identifying handwritten mathematical equations. The goal was not just to recognize characters, but to understand the structure and semantics of the expressions. The division operator, being a critical part of that structure, presented its own unique challenges.

At its core, a standard image classification model, such as a convolutional neural network (cnn), would struggle if simply provided with images containing or not containing the division symbol. The pixel-level differences between these images might not be statistically distinct enough to train a reliably accurate classifier without a great deal of very specific training data, which is inefficient. However, the problem becomes more tractable if approached with appropriate pre-processing and careful network design.

The key lies in understanding the visual characteristics of the division operator. Unlike letters which have more complex features, it often presents as a relatively simple visual pattern (typically a horizontal line and a dot above and below). We can exploit this simplicity. A very raw input dataset would require vast quantities of data and time to train. The network would spend a lot of its "learning budget" working out how the images even look instead of getting to the actual data representation. So, we must make it easier. We must provide features that are more easily understood.

First, let's consider feature extraction. Instead of feeding raw pixel data, we can preprocess images to highlight edges and lines, then perform segmentation to isolate individual symbols. This makes the network's job easier by focusing on relevant features rather than trying to parse the entire scene's pixel data. Preprocessing is absolutely crucial for such a task. Techniques like canny edge detection or hough transform, while relatively "old-school," are still extremely useful in this context to isolate the actual characters in the images.

For the actual classification, a convolutional neural network is still a good choice. The key is in the network architecture. We wouldn't necessarily require a very deep network like ResNet or VGG in this scenario. Something smaller and designed to focus on local patterns would be better suited. Also, using transfer learning from a pre-trained model isn't particularly useful, as this task is very domain specific. It requires more granular features than, for example, recognizing cats and dogs. We need a custom trained network from scratch.

Now, let's look at some practical code examples. These will be simplified for clarity, but they demonstrate the core concepts. This is based on what I did many years ago when building a similar system in Tensorflow and Keras.

```python
# Example 1: basic image pre-processing using OpenCV in python

import cv2
import numpy as np

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    if img is None:
        return None  # Handle the case when image cannot be opened
    
    # Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise
    blurred_img = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5, 5), 0)
    
    # Edge detection using Canny
    edges = cv2.Canny(blurred_img, 50, 150)
    
    # Optional: Invert the binary image if needed (depends on how you train your model)
    # edges = cv2.bitwise_not(edges)

    # Convert edges to a numpy array for easier manipulation
    edges_np = np.array(edges)

    return edges_np

# Example Usage
preprocessed_image = preprocess_image("path/to/your/image.png")
if preprocessed_image is not None:
    print("Image preprocessed successfully")
    # You would now feed this into the neural network
else:
     print("Failed to preprocess the image")

```

This first code snippet demonstrates basic pre-processing that gets us an edge-detected version of the image using OpenCV. This effectively extracts a much lower dimensional representation of the image and highlights the boundaries of the objects we want to detect. This will give us the edges which are much easier for the machine learning algorithm to parse than the raw pixel data.

Next, let’s look at building a simplistic convolutional neural network. This is purely for example and the parameters must be tuned to achieve a good level of accuracy for your specific dataset:

```python
# Example 2: Building a simple CNN with Keras for Binary classification

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def create_division_classifier(input_shape):
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary classification (has division or not)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model


# Example usage:
input_shape = (50, 50, 1) #Adjust as needed for the image dimensions from your preprocessing
model = create_division_classifier(input_shape)

model.summary() # Provides details of the network architecture and its parameters

# You would then train the model with data and test its performance

```
This second example code snippet creates a very simple convolutional neural network, it takes an input shape as parameter, the rest of the network is hardcoded but it uses the most common layers used for image recognition. In addition to this, it has a binary cross entropy output as this is a yes/no question: Does the image contain a division operator?

Finally, we also need to consider how to handle variations in size and rotation. Augmentation is very useful here. We would introduce these as transformations to the input images during training. This enhances the generalization of the model and avoids it overfitting to the training data. For a proper training regime the image generator from Keras would be a good starting point. Here we will do it manually:

```python
# Example 3: Simple Data Augmentation techniques

import cv2
import numpy as np
import random

def augment_image(image, angle_range=(-15, 15), scale_range=(0.8, 1.2)):

    height, width = image.shape[:2]

    # Rotation
    angle = random.uniform(*angle_range)
    M_rot = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D((width/2, height/2), angle, 1)
    rotated_image = cv2.warpAffine(image, M_rot, (width, height))

    # Scale
    scale = random.uniform(*scale_range)
    resized_width = int(width * scale)
    resized_height = int(height * scale)
    resized_image = cv2.resize(rotated_image, (resized_width, resized_height), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)

    # Padding if resized image is smaller than original
    if resized_width < width or resized_height < height:
        pad_width = max(0, (width - resized_width) // 2)
        pad_height = max(0,(height - resized_height) // 2)
        padded_image = np.pad(resized_image, ((pad_height, pad_height + (height - resized_height)%2), (pad_width, pad_width + (width - resized_width)%2)), mode='constant')

    # Cropping if resized image is larger than original
    else:
        crop_width = (resized_width - width) // 2
        crop_height = (resized_height - height) // 2
        padded_image = resized_image[crop_height: crop_height + height, crop_width:crop_width+width]
    return padded_image

# Example usage:
input_image = cv2.imread("path/to/your/image.png",cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
augmented_img = augment_image(input_image)

cv2.imwrite("path/to/your/augmented_image.png",augmented_img) #Write augmented image out to disk

```

This final code snippet demonstrates manual image rotation and scaling augmentation. The code pads the image when the scaling results in a smaller image than the original or crops when the scaled image is larger. For a good model, it's essential to train on a large dataset of diverse images.

In summary, classifying images based on the presence of a division operator is definitely feasible with machine learning. It involves a careful combination of pre-processing to make sure that the features we wish to detect are highlighted, an appropriate neural network model architecture, and effective data augmentation to handle the variation. Although a common image classification task, this specific problem requires attention to the details and an awareness that out-of-the-box approaches may fail. The key is always to start by understanding the visual elements involved and designing a solution around those characteristics.

If you want to explore this further, I recommend reading *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville; it covers the theoretical foundations in great detail. Also, for practical implementations with OpenCV and Keras, *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron is an excellent resource. Finally, for a deeper dive into more advanced data augmentation techniques, search for papers from the *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence* journal, where there is lots of in-depth research on this kind of topic.
