Alright, let's unpack this. I've seen this exact scenario play out more times than I'd care to count, and while the specifics might shift from project to project, the underlying causes often boil down to a few key areas. The "custom `AlertDialog` layout isn't displaying correctly" complaint usually masks issues in either the layout definition itself, the way the dialog is being constructed, or the interplay between them. Let's break it down, shall we?

Firstly, and this is something I've absolutely stumbled on myself in the past, is the layout hierarchy. When crafting a custom layout for an `AlertDialog`, you need to be exceptionally mindful of how it's structured, especially if you’re using complex layouts like `ConstraintLayout` or nested `LinearLayouts`. The `AlertDialog`’s container isn’t a complete blank slate; it has its own internal structure. What this means in practice is, if you're not careful with attributes like `layout_width`, `layout_height`, and crucially, `layout_gravity`, the view can either collapse to an invisible size, overflow its parent, or simply not position itself as you'd intended. In one instance, I recall spending a good hour debugging a seemingly empty dialog only to find out that the root view’s `layout_height` was set to `0dp` due to a misplaced weight.

Now, let's talk implementation details, which also are often sources of grief. You'd be amazed how frequently I find that developers are inflating the custom layout correctly but then fail to actually set it on the `AlertDialog.Builder`. There's a subtle but critical distinction between inflating a view and telling the `AlertDialog` to use it. Another common pitfall is not setting up data correctly after inflating the layout. If your custom view contains interactive elements like `EditText` or `Spinners`, you must ensure you're populating them with initial values correctly and retrieving updated values properly when the dialog is dismissed or action buttons are pressed. Failing to handle state appropriately is another recipe for a malfunctioning dialog.

Then, there’s the matter of styling and themes. The default theme of an `AlertDialog` might interfere with your custom layout's appearance. For instance, if your custom layout relies on specific margins or padding, the default dialog might have some predefined rules that conflict with it. This can lead to visual oddities like incorrect text spacing or misaligned elements. You might think your layout is behaving wrongly, while it is the style settings on the dialog which are the source of the discrepancies. To avoid this, you should consider applying a custom theme, potentially inherited from your application’s theme, which provides more control over the visual appearance of the dialog.

To illustrate these points, I'll provide three examples, covering a simple text display case, a more interactive setup, and finally, the theme consideration.

**Example 1: Simple Text Display**

Imagine you have a simple layout that displays a message:

```xml
<!-- res/layout/custom_alert_dialog_text.xml -->
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:padding="16dp">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/dialog_message_text"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:textSize="18sp"
        android:text="Default Message" />

</LinearLayout>
```

And here's how you would display it in your activity:

```java
// in your Activity
import android.app.AlertDialog;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.TextView;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        showCustomAlertDialog("This is a custom message");
    }

    private void showCustomAlertDialog(String message) {
         AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
         android.view.View dialogView = getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.custom_alert_dialog_text, null);
         TextView messageTextView = dialogView.findViewById(R.id.dialog_message_text);
         messageTextView.setText(message);
         builder.setView(dialogView);
         builder.setPositiveButton("OK", (dialog, which) -> dialog.dismiss());
         AlertDialog dialog = builder.create();
         dialog.show();
    }
}
```

This code demonstrates a simple but effective use case, avoiding the common pitfall of not setting the custom view.

**Example 2: Interactive Dialog**

Now, let’s add a simple interactive element. Suppose you want the user to input some text:

```xml
<!-- res/layout/custom_alert_dialog_input.xml -->
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:padding="16dp">

    <EditText
        android:id="@+id/dialog_input_text"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:hint="Enter some text" />

</LinearLayout>
```

And the corresponding activity code would be:

```java
// in your Activity
import android.app.AlertDialog;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.EditText;
import android.widget.Toast;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        showCustomInputDialog();
    }

    private void showCustomInputDialog() {
        AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
        android.view.View dialogView = getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.custom_alert_dialog_input, null);
        EditText inputEditText = dialogView.findViewById(R.id.dialog_input_text);
        builder.setView(dialogView);
        builder.setPositiveButton("OK", (dialog, which) -> {
            String input = inputEditText.getText().toString();
            Toast.makeText(this, "Input: " + input, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            dialog.dismiss();
        });
        builder.setNegativeButton("Cancel", (dialog, which) -> dialog.dismiss());

        AlertDialog dialog = builder.create();
        dialog.show();
    }
}
```

Here, the key part is that we are obtaining the input from `EditText` after the positive button is clicked, which is necessary when dealing with interactive elements.

**Example 3: Theme Customization**

Finally, let's show a custom theme to avoid visual discrepancies. Let's say we want to apply a basic custom style with a specific background color:

```xml
<!-- res/values/themes.xml -->
<resources>
    <style name="CustomAlertDialogTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.Dialog.Alert">
        <item name="android:windowBackground">@color/light_blue</item>
        <!-- Customize other styles if needed -->
    </style>
</resources>
```

And we apply this theme in our `AlertDialog` instantiation. Note that this assumes you have added a color to your `colors.xml` as `<color name="light_blue">#e0f7fa</color>`. Here is the code to use it in your activity:

```java
// in your Activity
import android.app.AlertDialog;
import android.os.Bundle;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.content.Context;
import android.view.ContextThemeWrapper;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        showCustomThemedAlertDialog();
    }

    private void showCustomThemedAlertDialog() {
        Context themedContext = new ContextThemeWrapper(this, R.style.CustomAlertDialogTheme);
        AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(themedContext);
        android.view.View dialogView = getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.custom_alert_dialog_text, null);
        builder.setView(dialogView);
        builder.setPositiveButton("OK", (dialog, which) -> dialog.dismiss());
        AlertDialog dialog = builder.create();
        dialog.show();
    }
}
```

In this case, we create a `ContextThemeWrapper` and use that context in the `AlertDialog.Builder` constructor.

For a comprehensive understanding of layout constraints and best practices, I'd recommend diving into "Android Layouts" by Ian Lake and Reto Meier. The official Android documentation also has excellent sections on custom dialogs and themes which you should definitely explore.

In conclusion, troubleshooting custom `AlertDialog` layout issues often comes down to a meticulous review of your layout hierarchy, correct inflation and setting procedures, and potentially adjusting the theme. Debugging experience comes with time, and having seen these issues first hand, I hope these points are helpful in your journey.
