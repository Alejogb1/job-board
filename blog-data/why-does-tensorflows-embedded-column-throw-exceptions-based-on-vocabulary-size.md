Okay, let's dive into this. I've certainly encountered this particular headache with TensorFlow's embedding columns more times than I care to remember, particularly back in the days when we were scaling up our recommendation engine. The problem essentially boils down to how TensorFlow manages memory when dealing with potentially enormous vocabularies. The "exception based on vocabulary size" isn't really about the size *per se*, but rather the practical implications of large vocabularies on the embedding matrix, especially within the constraints of available memory and computational resources.

The core of the issue arises from the mechanics of embedding layers. An embedding layer transforms integer indices (representing words, user ids, item ids, etc.) into dense, vector representations. Think of it like a lookup table: each integer index maps to a unique vector. This "lookup table" – the embedding matrix – is held in memory and, crucially, needs to be large enough to accommodate the largest index in your vocabulary. If your vocabulary is small, say, a few hundred words, the corresponding embedding matrix is also reasonably sized. However, when you start dealing with vocabularies containing tens of thousands or even millions of unique items, the memory required to hold the embedding matrix explodes.

TensorFlow doesn't actually throw exceptions *solely* because of vocabulary size. The real catalyst for these exceptions is usually the inability to allocate enough memory for the embedding matrix. This typically translates to out-of-memory (oom) errors, resource exhaustion messages, or other similar issues during the graph execution phase when TensorFlow attempts to initialize or access this matrix. The exception messages themselves may not always explicitly point to vocabulary size, and interpreting the underlying cause frequently requires a deeper dive into resource usage and graph execution.

Now, why is this a concern specifically for *embedded* columns? Because when you use `tf.feature_column.embedding_column`, you're implicitly creating and managing this embedding matrix. Unlike other types of feature columns (e.g., numeric columns), embedded columns involve the storage and maintenance of a dense matrix that directly scales with vocabulary size.

Let me give you a couple of scenarios I've experienced that highlight this:

**Scenario 1: The "Too Many Items" Case**

Initially, we had a recommendation system built for a relatively limited set of products. Our vocabulary, let's say, was around 5000 items. Things were running smoothly. But as we expanded our catalog, the vocabulary grew to over 200,000 items. Without paying attention to the increased memory requirements for the embedding layer, our TensorFlow jobs started crashing with oom errors during the graph initialization. We were effectively trying to load a matrix far too large for the available gpus.

Here’s a simplified code snippet, illustrating a similar situation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

vocab_size = 200000  # Large vocabulary
embedding_dimension = 16

item_id = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_identity(key='item_id', num_buckets=vocab_size)
item_embedding = tf.feature_column.embedding_column(item_id, dimension=embedding_dimension)

feature_columns = [item_embedding]

# Imagine a larger estimator being built using feature_columns
# The out of memory error occurs when the embedding layer is initialized during
# graph construction or during the training/evaluation phase.
# In this simplified example we won't create the actual estimator
# to reduce complexity, but the problem occurs on the step of
# creating an embedding column.
```

The exception wouldn't occur at the point where `embedding_column` is created; instead it manifests during TensorFlow's graph execution, when the embedding matrix needs to be allocated and/or accessed.

**Scenario 2: The "Implicit Vocabulary" Trap**

Another issue I've seen is the "implicit" vocabulary trap. If you are not careful, TensorFlow can accidentally infer a very large vocabulary size if your data contains extremely high integer IDs. The `categorical_column_with_identity` assumes your ids start at 0 and go up to a given number. If you load the data that isn't formatted to that assumption, say user ids are assigned from one million, without rescaling the ids to start at zero, your resulting matrix size would be enormous, even if your actual number of users is much smaller, such as 1000. This again, leads to excessive memory allocation and crashes.

Here is a snippet that showcases the issue:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Data that contains very high ids
data = {'user_id': [1000000, 1000001, 1000002, 1000003, 1000000]}
# Let's assume in real life this can come from some preprocessing step.
# Without understanding that assumption this code will crash.

vocab_size = 1000003 # incorrectly infered vocabulary size
embedding_dimension = 16

user_id = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_identity(key='user_id', num_buckets=vocab_size)
user_embedding = tf.feature_column.embedding_column(user_id, dimension=embedding_dimension)

feature_columns = [user_embedding]
# similar to the previous example, the problem manifests later during execution.
```

These situations illustrate how vocabulary size translates directly into resource demands.

**Mitigation Strategies**

So, how do we deal with this? There are a number of strategies, and the right one depends on the specifics of your application.

1. **Vocabulary Management:** This is the most direct approach. Before training, carefully prune your vocabulary to include only the most frequent or relevant terms. You can also consider bucketing or hashing infrequent terms to reduce the effective vocabulary size. Tools like the `tf.lookup.StaticVocabularyTable` can be very useful here.

2. **Embedding Dimension Reduction:** Reducing the embedding dimension can have a significant impact on memory consumption. While decreasing the embedding dimension may affect model performance, carefully tuning this parameter can significantly improve scalability without excessive loss in accuracy. You should consider using techniques from information retrieval and machine learning such as singular value decomposition, which help in reducing data dimensionality while preserving as much information as possible.

3. **Resource Allocation:** Ensure you allocate sufficient memory for your TensorFlow jobs. Use appropriate configurations for your execution environment and be sure to check your hardware's memory. Monitoring resource usage during training is also helpful in diagnosing issues related to insufficient memory. Tools such as `nvidia-smi` are very beneficial to monitor gpu memory.

4. **Alternative Embedding Techniques:** In cases where vocabulary size remains extremely problematic, explore techniques like shared embedding layers where multiple vocabularies use the same embedding layer or methods to reduce the dimensionality of the embedding layer using techniques from principal component analysis, such as SVD. You could also experiment with techniques like hashing or count min sketch.

5. **TensorFlow's `experimental_feature_column.sparse_column_with_integerized_feature`:** This allows you to reduce the dimensionality of the embedding layer. For very large vocabulary sizes, it might be more effective to generate sparse feature vectors which are then passed through one or more dense layers.

Here’s an example that implements the vocabulary management, by limiting the vocabulary size:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# sample data, assume you loaded this from a source of training data
data = [1, 3, 5, 2, 7, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 10]

vocab = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9] # manually create a vocabulary
num_oov_buckets = 1
embedding_dimension = 16

# transform the vocabulary to tensors
vocabulary = tf.constant(vocab, dtype=tf.int64)

# map integers from your data to the vocabulary, using -1 for the out of vocabulary token
ids_to_vocab_table = tf.lookup.StaticVocabularyTable(
    tf.lookup.KeyValueTensorInitializer(keys=vocabulary, values=tf.range(len(vocabulary), dtype=tf.int64)),
    num_oov_buckets
)

# this function maps all incoming integers to vocabulary ids, or the oov token
def create_item_feature(item_id):
  return ids_to_vocab_table.lookup(item_id)

item_feature = create_item_feature(tf.constant(data, dtype=tf.int64)) # transforming the sample data

# you should pass the resulting ids_table, as well as the number of ids available in the table
# and out-of-vocabulary buckets
item_id = tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_identity(
      key=item_feature,
      num_buckets=len(vocab) + num_oov_buckets
)

item_embedding = tf.feature_column.embedding_column(item_id, dimension=embedding_dimension)

feature_columns = [item_embedding]
# The resulting tensor has the dimension of the vocabulary provided.
```

For further reading, I'd recommend delving into the TensorFlow documentation on feature columns and embedding layers. Additionally, the book "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet is a very useful resource that explains the details of embedding layers. For a more theoretical understanding of dimensionality reduction techniques, "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman is an excellent starting point. Finally, various research papers on recommendation systems and natural language processing often delve into efficient techniques for handling large vocabularies.

In summary, TensorFlow's embedded columns do not explicitly throw exceptions because of the vocabulary size itself; rather, it's the resulting memory pressure from the required embedding matrix that often causes resource allocation failures during the graph execution. Carefully managing vocabularies, optimizing embedding dimensions, and using appropriate computational resources are crucial when dealing with large-scale datasets and embedding layers. This situation, I've found, is a common pitfall that can be addressed with careful planning and a good understanding of the underlying principles of embedding layers.
