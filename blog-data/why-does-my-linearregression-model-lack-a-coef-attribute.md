Okay, let’s tackle this. I've seen this issue pop up more than a few times, usually when someone's diving into `scikit-learn`'s linear regression implementation for the first time, or occasionally after a frustrating debugging session where something went off the rails earlier in their code. The absence of the `coef_` attribute in a `LinearRegression` model, which is intended to hold the learned coefficients after the model has been fitted, generally points to one primary reason: the model hasn't been fitted to any data. Let’s walk through the details.

From my own experience—I recall once working on a project predicting website traffic where I had inadvertently skipped the `.fit()` step because I was hyper-focused on feature engineering, then spent an hour scratching my head wondering where my coefficients had vanished—the fundamental principle to grasp here is that the `coef_` attribute is dynamically created *after* the fitting process. It's not a pre-existing property; it's a result of the model learning from the input data. The `LinearRegression` class in `scikit-learn` is, at its core, an estimator – a blueprint for the model. It’s only when you provide training data via the `.fit(X, y)` method that the actual optimization to find the line of best fit happens, and that’s when the `coef_` attribute, which stores the weights of the independent variables, is populated. If you try to access `coef_` before calling `.fit()`, or if the fitting process encounters a problem that prevents model convergence, it will simply not be there, raising an `AttributeError`.

Let's consider that your code looks something like this:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Generate some sample data for demo purposes
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

model = LinearRegression()

# Attempt to access coef_ before fitting - this will throw an error!
try:
    print(model.coef_)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```

In this example, running it *as is* will result in that infamous `AttributeError`. You’re trying to access a property that doesn’t exist yet. The model hasn't been given any data to learn from. It's akin to asking a student to provide the solution to an equation before they've actually studied the material or been shown the problem.

Now, let's see how you correct this situation by actually fitting the model:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Generate some sample data for demo purposes
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model before accessing coef_
model.fit(X, y)

print(model.coef_)
```

By including the `model.fit(X, y)` line, we are providing the model with the features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`). The `fit` method computes the best fitting line (in this case, a 1-dimensional regression) using ordinary least squares, thus populating the `coef_` attribute. Now you'll observe the coefficients; a list of weights assigned to your features.

While the most common reason is skipping the `.fit()` step, there is a less common, and often more frustrating, scenario where the `fit()` method fails to converge, which can also lead to `coef_` not being properly populated. This can happen when your data has issues. For example, features are highly correlated or you have severe multicollinearity. The model may fail to properly optimize the weights, and in some cases this can cause a silent failure of fitting without the obvious `AttributeError`, though it's less likely to be the culprit behind missing `coef_`—this can sometimes mask underlying problems with feature preprocessing or data structure. In more complex cases with high-dimensional data, or with data that isn't properly scaled, numerical issues may occur. Often the model fitting process will converge, but sometimes the data can be so poorly constructed that the calculations fail.

Let's illustrate with an example that highlights an often-encountered scenario: adding an unnecessary bias term that may or may not lead to convergence issues in some model fitting libraries and could, in some situations, lead to an unusual absence of the `coef_` attribute, which is not a failure of convergence but a problem with how the data is interpreted, though it’s very unusual:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Incorrectly adding an explicit bias to the input features.
# This can potentially lead to issues in model convergence or unexpected behavior
X = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1], [5, 1]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept = False) #explicitly tell the model not to fit an intercept

# Fit the model
try:
    model.fit(X, y)
    print("Coefficients:", model.coef_)
except Exception as e:
   print(f"An error occurred during fitting: {e}")
   
```

In this somewhat contrived example, we’ve explicitly added a column of 1s to the X matrix which *could*, depending on the specifics of the implementation details of a particular model fitting library, cause the `.fit` function to potentially not populate `coef_` as you might expect, although in the context of `scikit-learn`, it is still likely to work as intended as we've specified `fit_intercept = False`. It is not a failure of convergence of ordinary least squares but an unusual case where explicit intercept handling could lead to unexpected behavior, depending on the model implementation, if not handled with care. This is less about direct convergence issues and more about how data is interpreted in relation to the presence or absence of the bias intercept term, which is included by default in `scikit-learn` and does not need to be included explicitly as a feature.

If, despite fitting your model, you *still* find the `coef_` is missing or gives errors, then I would highly recommend that you double-check the formatting of your `X` and `y` inputs to the `.fit()` function. If you have multiple feature columns, ensure that `X` is a 2D numpy array or a pandas DataFrame. If `y` represents a vector, ensure it's a 1D numpy array or pandas Series. Any deviation from these common expected data formats can cause underlying issues which can prevent `coef_` from being calculated.

To deepen your understanding, I'd recommend consulting the official `scikit-learn` documentation, particularly the sections on Linear Regression and model fitting, and also delving into the theory of linear models, which is well explained in "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. Also, "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop is another valuable reference that provides a more theoretical, but very practical, underpinning of linear regression. These resources will give you a far more rigorous background to linear regression, the underlying math, the various ways the coefficients are calculated, and how data and model parameters influence the fitting process. Understanding these details is important for avoiding the kind of situations where you are left scratching your head trying to find where the `coef_` attribute has gone missing.
