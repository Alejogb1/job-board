Okay, let's unpack this. There’s more to injecting file content into Docker environment variables than meets the eye, and it’s something I've tackled a few times, particularly in more complex CI/CD pipelines. While a straightforward `ENV` command in a Dockerfile seems tempting, it falls short when dealing with sensitive information or large content. We need to employ methods that handle data securely and effectively. I’m going to break down how we can achieve this, exploring several practical approaches, and why choosing one over another often depends on context.

The fundamental challenge here is that docker build contexts don't easily allow for referencing file content during image creation *directly* within the `Dockerfile` using basic `ENV` instructions. The `ENV` instruction operates on static, string values. You *could* technically encode the file's contents as a single, giant string, but that's incredibly unwieldy, insecure when dealing with things like keys or credentials, and prone to breaking your build process. Instead, we must leverage mechanisms that inject data *at runtime* or through more secure build-time methods.

The first and often simplest solution utilizes environment variables directly provided when running a container. The syntax for passing these is rather straightforward: `--env FILE_CONTENT=$(cat path/to/your/file.txt)`. The `$(cat path/to/your/file.txt)` part executes a command that reads the file and inserts the output as the value. This, however, has significant drawbacks. It is vulnerable if the command you're using to read the file isn't carefully sanitized. Also, the entire file's content, when substituted, could create a very large, or even limit-breaking environment variable, depending on the system's maximum environment size. This method is best suited for small files and non-sensitive data during development or internal testing. If this is what your are after, here is an example:

```bash
# file: my_secret.txt
# this is my super secret message. Don't share

docker run --env SECRET_MESSAGE="$(cat my_secret.txt)" ubuntu:latest bash -c 'echo $SECRET_MESSAGE'
```

The snippet above shows us reading the `my_secret.txt` content into the `SECRET_MESSAGE` variable using the `cat` command substitution. The echo statement within the container will print the contents of this variable. The limitation of this approach is apparent: the shell that executes `docker run` has access to the file. That makes this an inherently unsecure way to pass secret information.

A far more robust approach, particularly for secrets, is mounting the file as a volume and then loading its content at runtime within the application. This involves the `-v` or `--mount` flag. This method keeps sensitive data outside of the image itself and away from the execution environment of the Docker run command. The data only becomes available once the container starts, and the application inside is responsible for reading the mounted file. Here’s a working example:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for mounting file as volume

FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY app.py .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

```python
# file: app.py
import os

def read_file_content(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "File not found"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = "/app/secrets/my_secret.txt" # path to mount
    file_content = read_file_content(file_path)
    print(f"File Content: {file_content}")

    # Alternatively use it to configure an environment variable
    os.environ['MY_CONFIG'] = file_content
    print(f"MY_CONFIG: {os.environ['MY_CONFIG']}")
```

```bash
# terminal commands to build and run

# make sure the secret exists as a file
echo "my secret configuration" > my_secret.txt

# build the image
docker build -t my-python-app .

# run the image and mount the file
docker run -v $(pwd)/my_secret.txt:/app/secrets/my_secret.txt my-python-app

# cleanup file
rm my_secret.txt
```

In this example, the Python script `app.py` expects the secret file to be available under the `/app/secrets/my_secret.txt` path *inside the container*. When we execute `docker run`, the `-v $(pwd)/my_secret.txt:/app/secrets/my_secret.txt` flag tells Docker to mount the file located at `$(pwd)/my_secret.txt` (which is the `my_secret.txt` file in our current directory) into the container at the `/app/secrets/my_secret.txt` path. The Python code then reads and process this file contents. Note that now the secret's content isn't passed through the shell, nor is it part of the docker image, which greatly increases security. This method is better suited for larger files and sensitive data.

Thirdly, for sensitive data like API keys and database credentials, consider using Docker secrets. This method integrates with Docker Swarm and allows you to define secrets, manage them, and securely provide them to containers without them being stored directly in your images or passed as command-line arguments. This offers the best control and security when working in a swarm environment. However, the process is more involved. Here's how it works:

First, create a secret, either directly or from a file:

```bash
echo "my_api_key_123" | docker secret create my_api_key -
```

Now you create a docker service that will be using the secret:

```yaml
# file: docker-compose.yml

version: "3.9"
services:
  my_app:
    image: my-python-app  #Assuming the same image built in the previous example
    secrets:
      - my_api_key # reference the secret name we defined above
    command: ["python", "app.py"] # app entrypoint, in this example we load the secret at runtime

secrets:
  my_api_key:
    external: true # signal that the secret is already managed outside
```

Then, we can adjust the python program from before like this:

```python
# file: app.py
import os

def read_file_content(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read().strip()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "File not found"

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # secret is mounted under /run/secrets
    file_path = "/run/secrets/my_api_key"

    api_key = read_file_content(file_path)
    print(f"API key: {api_key}")

    os.environ["API_KEY"] = api_key
    print(f"API_KEY is loaded from /run/secrets")

```

And run the service as such:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This approach mounts the file containing the secret at `/run/secrets/my_api_key` within the container.  This path is pre-configured by Docker when using secrets. We can then read and utilize it within our application. The actual secret value is never exposed in the Dockerfile, environment variables, or command-line arguments used to execute the application.

For further study on these topics, I highly recommend "Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton, a great practical guide for docker. Also, “The Twelve-Factor App” methodology, while not specific to Docker, provides crucial insights into best practices for configuring applications. Finally, if you are considering secrets, you should familiarize yourself with Docker’s documentation on Swarm secrets. These are foundational texts that will help in understanding and navigating these concepts better.

In summary, using files as Docker environment variables directly through `ENV` is generally unsuitable. The choice between mounting volumes and utilizing Docker secrets depends on the level of security and complexity your environment demands. For local development, a simple volume mount is often sufficient; but for production, Docker secrets, or even dedicated secret management solutions, are greatly preferrable. Consider your security needs, file size, and deployment environment when deciding which approach is best suited for your application.
