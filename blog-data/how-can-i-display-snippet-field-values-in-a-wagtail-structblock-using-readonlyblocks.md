Okay, let's tackle this. I remember a particularly tricky project involving a content-heavy news site that needed very specific editorial control, and the core of the issue was precisely this: displaying complex snippet data within wagtail’s `StructBlock` using `ReadOnlyBlock` functionalities. It’s not entirely straightforward, but with a bit of clarity, we can nail it down. The challenge, as you’ve probably discovered, is that `ReadOnlyBlock`s aren't designed to directly process model data, particularly snippets which need a bit more massaging to render usefully.

The basic problem stems from `ReadOnlyBlock`'s primary function: presenting static text or values pre-defined within a block definition. It doesn't dynamically fetch data from database models like our snippets. This is great for things like section headers or divider lines, but inadequate for the richness and relations involved with snippets. Thus, we have to intervene to pre-process the data from our snippet field before feeding it to the `ReadOnlyBlock`.

The typical approach that’s initially appealing is to simply set the `value` attribute within `ReadOnlyBlock` to reference the snippet field. Unfortunately, that gives us either a model instance object string representation, which isn't very useful in a front-end template, or nothing at all. So we have to pre-process that data. The process involves a few key steps: retrieving the snippet instance, accessing the relevant field values from that instance, and then constructing some output that can be displayed within the `ReadOnlyBlock`. This often means serializing parts of the snippet's data into a format that the `ReadOnlyBlock` can readily display.

Let’s walk through some implementations I've seen work well. Let's imagine we have a snippet model named `Author`, with fields like `name` and `biography`, and that we’re using a `StructBlock` to add authors within a page.

Here's the first approach, using a simple string representation for the `ReadOnlyBlock`. We’ll need to override the `to_python` method within the `StructBlock` itself. The key insight is to leverage this opportunity to resolve the snippet before the data reaches the `ReadOnlyBlock`. This approach works best when the display requirement is simple - displaying the name of the author in this case:

```python
from wagtail.core import blocks
from wagtail.snippets.blocks import SnippetChooserBlock
from .models import Author # Assume models.py contains our Author snippet


class AuthorBlock(blocks.StructBlock):
    author_snippet = SnippetChooserBlock(target_model=Author, label="Select Author")
    author_name = blocks.ReadOnlyBlock(label="Author Name")

    def to_python(self, value):
         value = super().to_python(value)
         if value and value.get('author_snippet'):
            author = value['author_snippet']
            value['author_name'] = author.name if author else "No author selected"
         return value

    class Meta:
        icon = "user"
        label = "Author"
```

In this example, `to_python` intercepts the block's data. It checks if an `author_snippet` is present, then fetches the `Author` instance if it exists. The `name` from the snippet is extracted and assigned to `author_name` in the `value` dictionary before passing it to the template. In this example, the template would only need to render `{{ block.author_name }}` which will now have the correct value.

Now, let's consider a situation where we want a more structured output, perhaps showing both the name and the beginning of the biography. We’ll need to format that within the `to_python` method and output the whole thing as a string (since read only blocks cannot handle objects or lists):

```python
from wagtail.core import blocks
from wagtail.snippets.blocks import SnippetChooserBlock
from .models import Author

class AuthorBlock(blocks.StructBlock):
    author_snippet = SnippetChooserBlock(target_model=Author, label="Select Author")
    author_details = blocks.ReadOnlyBlock(label="Author Details")


    def to_python(self, value):
         value = super().to_python(value)
         if value and value.get('author_snippet'):
            author = value['author_snippet']
            if author:
              truncated_bio = author.biography[:100] + "..." if len(author.biography) > 100 else author.biography
              formatted_output = f"<strong>{author.name}</strong> <br> {truncated_bio}"
              value['author_details'] = formatted_output
            else:
              value['author_details'] = "No author selected"
         return value

    class Meta:
        icon = "user"
        label = "Author with Details"
```

Here, the `to_python` method constructs an html string with the author’s name in bold, then includes the start of the biography. We truncate it to avoid overly long displays. We set that string directly into the `author_details` key in the block’s dictionary. In your template, just render `{{ block.author_details|safe }}`, and the html will render nicely. Note the `|safe` filter - that’s essential when dealing with raw html strings.

For more complex scenarios, particularly if we want to present data in a list or table format, we would likely have to use a different approach. Let’s say, we have a multi-select field inside of our author snippet. To display these values in read-only block we can use similar pre-processing within to_python method, this time mapping them to a string:

```python
from wagtail.core import blocks
from wagtail.snippets.blocks import SnippetChooserBlock
from .models import Author

class AuthorBlock(blocks.StructBlock):
    author_snippet = SnippetChooserBlock(target_model=Author, label="Select Author")
    author_topics = blocks.ReadOnlyBlock(label="Author Topics")

    def to_python(self, value):
         value = super().to_python(value)
         if value and value.get('author_snippet'):
            author = value['author_snippet']
            if author and hasattr(author, 'topics'): # Ensure 'topics' exists in Author model
              topics_list = ", ".join([topic for topic in author.topics.names()]) # Assumes 'topics' is a tag field
              value['author_topics'] = topics_list if topics_list else "No topics associated with this author"
            else:
              value['author_topics'] = "No author selected"
         return value


    class Meta:
        icon = "user"
        label = "Author with Topics"

```

In this third snippet we use the same methodology to create a comma-separated string from an assumed `topics` field that is part of our snippet. It assumes that the `topics` field is a tag field and therefore `.names()` function is available. The important lesson from this snippet is that we can tailor the content displayed via `ReadOnlyBlock` by pre-processing the snippet data in the `to_python` method.

A crucial point: while this works well for simpler presentations, it's worth considering if the complexity warrants moving the rendering logic into a custom template tag or a custom block with more advanced rendering capabilities. This reduces the burden within the `to_python` method and keeps the logic cleaner.

As for resources to deepen your understanding, I highly recommend reviewing the official Wagtail documentation – particularly the sections on `StructBlock`, `ReadOnlyBlock`, and custom block rendering. Specifically, the documentation on overriding the `to_python` method within a `StructBlock` is invaluable. Also, the book "Two Scoops of Django" includes insights on similar data processing strategies that can be helpful for Wagtail as well, as most Wagtail functionality builds on top of Django. The specific patterns related to template tags and custom blocks will also assist here. There’s also a wealth of information within the Wagtail community forums and GitHub, which can often surface specific edge cases or better patterns for implementation.

The key takeaway here is that `ReadOnlyBlock` is about static presentation, so you need to bridge the gap between the snippet model and what can be rendered by preprocessing the data within your block's `to_python` method. This makes it feasible to use `ReadOnlyBlock` to present complex snippet information effectively and clearly.
