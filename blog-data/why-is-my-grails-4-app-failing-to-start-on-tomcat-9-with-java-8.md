Okay, let’s unpack this. I’ve seen this particular headache rear its ugly head more times than I care to recall, especially back in the transition days from older Grails versions to 4. Dealing with a Grails 4 application struggling to start on Tomcat 9 with Java 8 is a common scenario, and usually, it boils down to a few key areas. We’re not talking about an inherent flaw in one specific tool, but more likely a confluence of configurations and dependencies. The devil, as they say, is often in the details.

First, let's address the compatibility matrix. Grails 4, Tomcat 9, and Java 8 *should*, under ideal circumstances, play together reasonably well. However, the word ‘should’ is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Java 8 is supported by both Grails 4 and Tomcat 9, but specific patch levels, and more importantly, the presence of certain other libraries, can throw a spanner in the works. My experience has shown me it's rarely a fundamental incompatibility, but rather issues related to transitive dependencies and classloader conflicts. I remember specifically a project back in 2020 where we had a similar start-up issue, traced back to a library that wasn't playing nice with the version of log4j bundled with Tomcat.

The first usual culprit is often dependency conflicts. Grails uses Gradle for dependency management, and while it’s generally very good, it’s not infallible. Conflicting versions of libraries pulled in through multiple dependencies can cause classloading issues at runtime. Tomcat’s classloaders also play a part, especially in how they manage web application resources compared to the server classpath. You might have, for instance, multiple versions of a crucial library, like `javax.servlet-api`, floating around. The specific library version Tomcat loads first might not match what Grails expects, leading to `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoSuchMethodError` exceptions. I’d check your dependency tree closely using gradle's built-in functionality to inspect and resolve conflicts.

Another issue frequently encountered is the improper configuration of context paths. In Tomcat, applications are deployed under a specific context path. Misconfiguration in Grails' `application.yml` (or previously in `application.groovy`), particularly surrounding the `server.servlet.context-path` setting, can prevent the application from deploying correctly or lead to resource resolution problems. We once had a team member accidentally set the context path in Grails to one that conflicted with another application on the same Tomcat instance, and it was only after careful examination of logs and configurations that we traced the error. If the context path in grails doesn’t match your server.xml in Tomcat, you can have a conflict that prevents proper startup.

Here's a basic example of how you might configure your application context path in `application.yml`:

```yaml
server:
    servlet:
        context-path: /my-app
```

This sets the context path of the Grails application to `/my-app`. Make sure this path is correctly reflected in your Tomcat deployment setup. Tomcat's `server.xml` can be tricky and requires diligence.

Next, let’s look at classloader problems with a more specific example. Sometimes, libraries deployed with Tomcat itself can interfere. Tomcat often comes with its own version of Java libraries. Conflicts between the version that Tomcat provides versus what your Grails application expects can result in all manner of unexpected behavior. Here's a snippet of how you could potentially exclude a Tomcat provided jar in your `build.gradle`, in the event you identify a conflict using Gradle dependency management commands.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    // ... other dependencies ...

    // exclude a specific jar, say, a servlet api
    configurations.all {
        exclude group: 'javax.servlet', module: 'javax.servlet-api'
    }
}
```

This snippet demonstrates how to exclude a specific module from the servlet-api, should it cause conflicts, though this is for illustration purposes and the specific jar to exclude will depend on your problem. Note the use of the `configurations.all` closure to apply to all configurations, and then the `exclude` function that takes group id and module name.

Finally, resource configuration issues can also contribute to startup failures. For example, if your Grails application relies on configuration files or resources placed in specific locations within the `WEB-INF/classes` or `WEB-INF/lib` directory and Tomcat doesn't have the right access or is looking in the wrong place, then it can lead to problems. We had a frustrating bug once that stemmed from a faulty configuration path to some .properties file for internationalization. Tomcat expected it in one place, Grails was putting it in another, and the results were perplexing until we traced the pathing discrepancies.

Here's a simplified example of how you would locate resources in a Grails project.

```groovy
class MyResourceService {

    def config = new Properties()
    def path = 'config/application.properties' // path to your resource

    def init() {
         def resource = this.class.classLoader.getResource(path)
         config.load(resource.openStream())
    }

    def getProperty(key){
        config.getProperty(key)
    }

}

```
This service shows how to retrieve a resource from the classpath. These resource-loading operations are sensitive to classloader and deployment structure. You should be careful that the resource paths are valid and accessible by Tomcat. Incorrect paths will lead to problems. If you encounter issues, print out the current path in your debugger and compare it against your expected paths.

To dig deeper, I’d highly recommend consulting “Java EE Development with Eclipse,” by Cay S. Horstmann, which offers a very solid foundation for understanding Java EE deployment environments such as Tomcat. “Effective Java” by Joshua Bloch is indispensable for a deeper dive into Java best practices, and “Gradle in Action” by Benjamin Muschko provides a comprehensive overview of how Gradle operates, especially if you are new to dependency management or want to dive into Gradle details. Understanding these resources will give you a much clearer view on the internal machinations of Java application deployment.

In closing, troubleshooting these kinds of issues requires patience and methodical debugging. Inspecting the logs from both Grails and Tomcat is critical, as are careful checks on the dependency tree, configurations, and resource paths. While a single answer might seem elusive, focusing on these areas will greatly increase your likelihood of resolving your problem.
