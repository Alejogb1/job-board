Alright, let's talk about `data-src` and how it ties into image loading strategies. I’ve seen this pattern crop up in countless projects, and it's often misunderstood, so let’s get into the nitty-gritty. Back in my early days, I once inherited a large e-commerce platform riddled with performance issues. Images were a significant bottleneck; pages were painfully slow to render, and the culprit was mostly related to loading all those product images upfront, whether they were actually in view or not. That’s when I had to dive deep into the world of lazy loading and understand the mechanics of how attributes like `data-src` play a crucial role.

The core concept is this: the `data-src` attribute isn't a standard html attribute that browsers inherently understand when it comes to image loading. It's a custom attribute, part of the larger family of `data-*` attributes, designed to hold custom data for the element it's attached to. In this case, we're using it to store the *actual* source url of the image, whereas the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag, which browsers *do* interpret and use for direct loading, is initially left empty or contains a placeholder image.

The value comes into play when javascript intervenes. Javascript code, typically triggered by events like scrolling or intersection observation, checks to see if an image is about to come into the user's viewport. When that happens, the javascript picks up the image's actual source from the `data-src` attribute and *then* sets it to the `src` attribute. The browser then kicks in, recognizes the `src` change, and starts loading the actual image. This approach, known as lazy loading, ensures images are only loaded when absolutely necessary, reducing initial page load times, conserving network bandwidth, and improving the overall user experience, especially on mobile devices or with slower internet connections.

Let's walk through some code to solidify this.

**Example 1: Basic Lazy Loading using Scroll Events**

This snippet illustrates the simplest, albeit less efficient, approach. We're listening for scroll events and manually checking image positions.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Lazy Loading Example 1</title>
<style>
    .lazy-load { height: 300px; width: 100%; background-color: #eee; margin-bottom: 20px; display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; }
    .lazy-load img { max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="lazy-load">
   <img data-src="image1.jpg" src="placeholder.png" alt="Image 1" />
  </div>
  <div class="lazy-load">
   <img data-src="image2.jpg" src="placeholder.png" alt="Image 2" />
  </div>
  <div class="lazy-load">
   <img data-src="image3.jpg" src="placeholder.png" alt="Image 3" />
  </div>
  <div style="height: 500px; background-color: #f0f0f0;"></div>

<script>
    document.addEventListener("scroll", function() {
        const lazyImages = document.querySelectorAll('.lazy-load img');
        lazyImages.forEach(img => {
            const rect = img.getBoundingClientRect();
            if (rect.top <= window.innerHeight && rect.bottom >= 0 && img.getAttribute('data-src')) {
                img.src = img.getAttribute('data-src');
                img.removeAttribute('data-src'); // prevent repeated loading
            }
        });
    });
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Here, the script waits for a scroll event, finds all `<img>` tags that have a `data-src`, checks if each image is in view, and if so, moves the `data-src` value to the `src` attribute and removes the `data-src`. Note that I’m setting a `placeholder.png` in the src initially which could be a small, lightweight greyed square or a simple icon. It is vital that the `data-src` attribute is present for this logic to work.

**Example 2: Leveraging the Intersection Observer API**

This example utilizes the more efficient Intersection Observer API for detecting when images come into view, which is way better than using scroll events. This is what I'd recommend most of the time.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Lazy Loading Example 2</title>
<style>
    .lazy-load { height: 300px; width: 100%; background-color: #eee; margin-bottom: 20px; display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; }
    .lazy-load img { max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="lazy-load">
   <img data-src="image4.jpg" src="placeholder.png" alt="Image 4" />
  </div>
  <div class="lazy-load">
   <img data-src="image5.jpg" src="placeholder.png" alt="Image 5" />
  </div>
  <div class="lazy-load">
   <img data-src="image6.jpg" src="placeholder.png" alt="Image 6" />
  </div>
  <div style="height: 500px; background-color: #f0f0f0;"></div>


<script>
    const lazyImages = document.querySelectorAll('.lazy-load img');
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => {
        entries.forEach(entry => {
            if (entry.isIntersecting) {
                const img = entry.target;
                img.src = img.getAttribute('data-src');
                img.removeAttribute('data-src');
                observer.unobserve(img); // Stop observing after loading
            }
        });
    });

    lazyImages.forEach(img => observer.observe(img));

</script>
</body>
</html>
```
Here, we're using `IntersectionObserver` to monitor when elements enter or exit the viewport. When an image intersects with the viewport, the observer's callback function loads the image and stops observing it. This way, you are not polling the position of each image every time the user scrolls.

**Example 3: Combining with Loading Attribute for modern browsers**

Modern browsers now support the `loading="lazy"` attribute on images. However, using this together with `data-src` can be useful if you need greater control or compatibility with older browsers that don't yet fully implement or correctly support lazy loading natively.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Lazy Loading Example 3</title>
<style>
    .lazy-load { height: 300px; width: 100%; background-color: #eee; margin-bottom: 20px; display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; }
    .lazy-load img { max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="lazy-load">
   <img data-src="image7.jpg" src="placeholder.png" alt="Image 7" loading="lazy"/>
  </div>
    <div class="lazy-load">
   <img data-src="image8.jpg" src="placeholder.png" alt="Image 8" loading="lazy" />
  </div>
  <div class="lazy-load">
   <img data-src="image9.jpg" src="placeholder.png" alt="Image 9" loading="lazy" />
  </div>
  <div style="height: 500px; background-color: #f0f0f0;"></div>

</body>
</html>
```

In this case, the browser will *first* attempt to use the native lazy loading implementation and will also be loading from the actual `src` attribute rather than `data-src`, which is already set. Older browsers not supporting `loading="lazy"` will still not load these images before they appear in the viewport, since `src` is a placeholder. To support them, you'd combine this with the javascript approach in Example 2, with some additional checks to only apply the `data-src` technique if native lazy loading isn't supported, enhancing both compatibility and performance.

When considering using this technique, be sure you check out *High Performance Browser Networking* by Ilya Grigorik. It dives deep into how browsers work and can help you appreciate the performance considerations. Also, *Web Performance: The Definitive Guide* by Jennifer Robbins offers practical strategies to fine-tune your website's speed and includes sections on image optimization and lazy loading techniques. Finally, the official documentation on the `IntersectionObserver` API from the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is essential if you choose to use it for the image loading implementation.
In short, the `data-src` attribute doesn't magically make images load; it facilitates a mechanism for controlled and delayed loading through javascript manipulation, leading to noticeable improvements in perceived page load times, bandwidth efficiency, and therefore, user experience. It's a powerful tool when used correctly.
