Alright, let's tackle this one. It's a deceptively nuanced area that I’ve seen trip up even seasoned developers, myself included, back in the day when I was managing a distributed processing system for financial data. The short answer is: usually, yes, some form of waiting is prudent after sending a kill signal, especially when dealing with multiple processes, but the ‘why’ and ‘how long’ are what truly matter.

The core issue revolves around the fact that sending a kill signal isn’t instantaneous. It’s an instruction to the operating system, which then has to relay that instruction to the targeted process. Furthermore, the process itself needs to respond to that signal, and how quickly and cleanly it does that varies wildly depending on the signal type and the internal state of the process.

Specifically, when you dispatch a `SIGTERM` signal, the standard 'polite' kill signal, you are essentially requesting that the process terminate gracefully. This means the process receives this signal, and it should, ideally, execute cleanup routines such as releasing resources (file handles, network connections, database locks, etc.) before exiting. This takes time and isn’t guaranteed to occur cleanly or swiftly, particularly if the application is doing complex operations. Sending numerous `SIGTERM` signals concurrently to multiple processes makes the situation even more delicate. You’re now relying on the kernel to handle this multiple signal delivery and on each process to handle the termination with its own specific logic. The process could be locked up, waiting on i/o, or simply slow in responding.

If you immediately proceed with the assumption that all processes have terminated the instant after sending a kill signal, especially a `SIGTERM` signal, you are playing with fire. You could inadvertently trigger cascade errors, create race conditions, or leave lingering resources that should have been cleared. I had a situation where a seemingly innocuous script, designed to stop a set of data ingestion processes, neglected this waiting period, leading to a cascade of zombie processes that then held locks and file handles, ultimately requiring manual intervention and downtime. It's a learning experience I won't soon forget.

The situation differs for a `SIGKILL` signal, which is the 'forceful' kill. This signal doesn’t offer the process a chance to respond; the kernel simply terminates the process. However, even with `SIGKILL`, there is a small time window between sending the signal and the kernel completing the actual termination. That window, though small, still makes it wise to exercise caution and wait. Also, if there is an underlying issue, like process in a defunct state, even `SIGKILL` might not make it immediately disappear.

So, how do you handle this effectively? It’s about incorporating proper waiting mechanisms to ensure processes are actually down before you move on. It's a combination of signal handling best practices and process state checking that provides robustness. Here's a look at several approaches I've used.

First, consider using process monitoring in combination with a loop. You can check if a process is still running (by checking against its PID) after sending the kill signal. This allows for a dynamic and adaptive waiting strategy:

```python
import os
import signal
import time

def send_kill_wait(pid, sig=signal.SIGTERM, timeout=5):
  try:
    os.kill(pid, sig)
    start_time = time.time()
    while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
      try:
        os.kill(pid, 0) # Sends signal 0 to check if process exists
        time.sleep(0.1)
      except OSError:
        print(f"process {pid} terminated.")
        return True
    print(f"process {pid} did not terminate after {timeout} seconds.")
    return False
  except OSError as e:
      print(f"process {pid} does not exist. {e}")
      return True

pids = [1234, 5678, 9012] # Example list of PIDs

for pid in pids:
    if not send_kill_wait(pid):
        send_kill_wait(pid, signal.SIGKILL, 2)  # Try SIGKILL if SIGTERM failed.

```

This Python snippet demonstrates a simple, yet effective, process termination routine. It sends a `SIGTERM` and then loops, periodically checking if the process is still alive. If the process doesn't terminate within the designated timeout, it tries a `SIGKILL`. This gives a process the opportunity to perform cleanup before we take the forceful approach.

Secondly, consider leveraging process group signals. If you are dealing with a set of processes that are all part of a process group, it may be more efficient and easier to kill the whole group at once. You can achieve this by sending signals to the negative pid, which is equivalent to sending the signal to the entire process group:

```python
import os
import signal
import time

def send_group_kill_wait(pgrp, sig=signal.SIGTERM, timeout=5):
    try:
      os.kill(-pgrp, sig) # send to whole process group
      start_time = time.time()
      while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
          all_gone = True
          for pid in os.listdir('/proc'):
              try:
                if os.getpgrp() == pgrp:
                  os.kill(int(pid), 0) # check if process exists by sending signal 0
                  all_gone = False #if any process in the group is found
                  time.sleep(0.1)
                  break
              except (ValueError, ProcessLookupError):
                continue

          if all_gone:
            print(f"Process group {pgrp} terminated.")
            return True
      print(f"Process group {pgrp} did not terminate after {timeout} seconds.")
      return False
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"couldn't send signal to group {pgrp}. {e}")
        return True


#get the process group id, for example
pgrp = os.getpgrp()
if not send_group_kill_wait(pgrp):
    send_group_kill_wait(pgrp, signal.SIGKILL, 2)

```

This Python code example demonstrates how to send signals to an entire process group using the `os.kill(-pgrp, sig)` command. Then it iterates through `/proc` to check if the process group still has any active members. The advantages of process group signals are that it can be simpler and more efficient way to deal with many related processes.

Third, you can use shell scripts to perform process cleanup, and these can make use of `wait` commands. For instance, when executing background processes using the `&` operator in bash, you can use the `wait` command to block until all the backgrounded processes are finished. You can then check the exit status for success or failure.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Start some background processes
my_process1 &
my_process2 &
my_process3 &

# Get the PIDs of backgrounded processes
PIDS=$(jobs -p)

# Send a kill signal to each background process
for pid in $PIDS; do
  kill -TERM $pid
done

# Wait for all background processes to terminate.
wait $PIDS

# Check exit status
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "All background processes terminated gracefully."
else
  echo "Some background processes did not terminate properly."
fi
```

This bash script initiates some background processes and retrieves their IDs. It then sends a `SIGTERM` to each and uses the `wait` command to block until these processes terminate, making it a very straightforward mechanism for coordinating multiple process shutdowns from the command line.

To delve deeper into signal handling and process management on Unix-like systems, I recommend reviewing "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment" by W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago. This book is considered a classic and offers comprehensive insights into system-level programming, including in-depth explanations of signals and process behavior. Another excellent resource is "Understanding the Linux Kernel" by Daniel P. Bovet and Marco Cesati, which covers the inner workings of the Linux kernel, including its process management subsystems. Additionally, consulting the signal man pages (e.g., `man 7 signal` or `man kill`) is essential for understanding the specifics of different signals.

In summary, after sending a kill signal to multiple processes, waiting is essential to avoid potential issues related to resource contention, race conditions, and incomplete shutdowns. While the specific approach will vary depending on your particular requirements and environment, understanding the nature of signal delivery and implementing robust waiting mechanisms based on process state monitoring are crucial for creating stable and reliable applications.
