Okay, let's tackle this. Handling multi-tiff conversions to NumPy arrays is something I've encountered a fair few times, particularly when dealing with large microscopy datasets or satellite imagery. It's often not just about getting it done, but doing it efficiently. Naive approaches can really bog things down, especially if you're working with gigabytes worth of images. So, let's delve into how we can convert multiple tiff files to NumPy arrays concurrently.

The core issue boils down to i/o operations and processor utilization. Reading from disk and converting the data format are both relatively slow processes, and doing this sequentially for numerous files isn't ideal. We need to leverage parallelism to speed things up significantly. Python's multiprocessing library, along with a suitable image handling library, provides the tools we need. I've found that `tifffile` combined with `multiprocessing.Pool` to be particularly robust.

The first critical step involves choosing the correct image handling library. While there are several available, `tifffile` excels in speed and robustness with tiff files, especially when dealing with large image stacks. It handles a wide array of tiff features including multiple pages, compression, and diverse data types. Now, if you are in the scientific community and would like to learn more about the tiff file structure I would recommend the *Tiff Specification* published by Adobe, which is the standard reference document. In practice, I have found this to be a reliable authority on the tiff structure and how to properly handle it.

Moving on to concurrency, using Python’s `multiprocessing` module avoids the global interpreter lock (gil) that prevents true multithreading in standard cpython, particularly in CPU-bound tasks such as our image processing problem. By utilizing multiple processes, we bypass this constraint, effectively using multiple cores to perform conversions simultaneously. A critical element here is using a process pool through `multiprocessing.Pool`. This allows us to define a number of worker processes that can handle conversion tasks, which drastically boosts performance.

Here’s a breakdown using three code examples to illustrate the approach:

**Example 1: Sequential Conversion (Illustrative Purpose)**

This snippet demonstrates a naive, sequential approach. While it serves as a baseline, it's important to understand how much slower it is for a large number of files, since it is a standard iteration, and not concurrent at all.

```python
import tifffile
import numpy as np
import os
import time

def sequential_convert(tiff_files):
  arrays = []
  for file_path in tiff_files:
    try:
        img_array = tifffile.imread(file_path)
        arrays.append(img_array)
    except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error reading {file_path}: {e}")
  return arrays

if __name__ == '__main__':
  # Generate dummy tiff files, just for testing
  dummy_dir = "dummy_tiffs"
  os.makedirs(dummy_dir, exist_ok=True)
  num_files = 5
  tiff_files_dummy = []
  for i in range(num_files):
    dummy_array = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(100, 100), dtype=np.uint8)
    tiff_path = os.path.join(dummy_dir, f"test_{i}.tif")
    tifffile.imwrite(tiff_path, dummy_array)
    tiff_files_dummy.append(tiff_path)

  start_time = time.time()
  converted_arrays_sequential = sequential_convert(tiff_files_dummy)
  end_time = time.time()
  print(f"Sequential conversion time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")

  # clean up the dummy directory
  for f in tiff_files_dummy:
    os.remove(f)
  os.rmdir(dummy_dir)
```

This example reads tiff files one after the other and shows how slow it would be with lots of images, especially if they are large. It’s not a scalable approach.

**Example 2: Basic Multiprocessing with a Function**

This example starts to integrate a process pool and defines a separate conversion function.

```python
import tifffile
import numpy as np
import os
import time
from multiprocessing import Pool

def convert_single_tiff(file_path):
    try:
        img_array = tifffile.imread(file_path)
        return img_array
    except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error reading {file_path}: {e}")
      return None

def concurrent_convert(tiff_files, num_processes=4):
    with Pool(processes=num_processes) as pool:
      converted_arrays = pool.map(convert_single_tiff, tiff_files)
    return [arr for arr in converted_arrays if arr is not None]

if __name__ == '__main__':
  # Generate dummy tiff files, just for testing
  dummy_dir = "dummy_tiffs"
  os.makedirs(dummy_dir, exist_ok=True)
  num_files = 5
  tiff_files_dummy = []
  for i in range(num_files):
    dummy_array = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(100, 100), dtype=np.uint8)
    tiff_path = os.path.join(dummy_dir, f"test_{i}.tif")
    tifffile.imwrite(tiff_path, dummy_array)
    tiff_files_dummy.append(tiff_path)

  start_time = time.time()
  converted_arrays_concurrent = concurrent_convert(tiff_files_dummy)
  end_time = time.time()
  print(f"Concurrent conversion time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")

  # clean up the dummy directory
  for f in tiff_files_dummy:
      os.remove(f)
  os.rmdir(dummy_dir)

```

Here, we use a pool of worker processes (`multiprocessing.Pool`) to convert files in parallel. The function `convert_single_tiff` does the actual conversion, and `pool.map` executes this function concurrently on different files. This represents a major step up in terms of performance.

**Example 3: Advanced Multiprocessing with Metadata Retention**

Sometimes, you need to keep the image metadata when loading. The following example shows how this is done:

```python
import tifffile
import numpy as np
import os
import time
from multiprocessing import Pool
from collections import namedtuple

def convert_single_tiff_with_metadata(file_path):
  try:
    with tifffile.TiffFile(file_path) as tif:
        img_array = tif.asarray()
        metadata = tif.imagej_metadata
    return namedtuple("ImageData", ["array", "metadata"])(img_array, metadata)
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error reading {file_path}: {e}")
      return None

def concurrent_convert_with_metadata(tiff_files, num_processes=4):
    with Pool(processes=num_processes) as pool:
        converted_data = pool.map(convert_single_tiff_with_metadata, tiff_files)
    return [data for data in converted_data if data is not None]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Generate dummy tiff files, just for testing, with dummy metadata
    dummy_dir = "dummy_tiffs"
    os.makedirs(dummy_dir, exist_ok=True)
    num_files = 5
    tiff_files_dummy = []
    for i in range(num_files):
      dummy_array = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(100, 100), dtype=np.uint8)
      metadata = {"unit": "um", "resolution": 1}
      tiff_path = os.path.join(dummy_dir, f"test_{i}.tif")
      tifffile.imwrite(tiff_path, dummy_array, imagejmetadata=metadata)
      tiff_files_dummy.append(tiff_path)


    start_time = time.time()
    converted_data_concurrent = concurrent_convert_with_metadata(tiff_files_dummy)
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Concurrent conversion time with metadata: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")

    # print some of the metadata:
    for data in converted_data_concurrent:
       print(f"metadata = {data.metadata}")
       # note: you can access the numpy array through the following way
       # data.array

    # clean up the dummy directory
    for f in tiff_files_dummy:
      os.remove(f)
    os.rmdir(dummy_dir)
```

This advanced approach loads metadata from each tiff file together with the image data into a named tuple to return a structured result, which is quite common when dealing with imaging data. Instead of simply using `imread`, it uses `tifffile.TiffFile` to have more granular control over the reading process and extraction of the image metadata.

When you’re working on something more complicated than the dummy tiff files generated by the code examples, you may need to adjust the number of processes to avoid overwhelming your system; you can adjust `num_processes` parameter in the functions. Also, how each file is read may require more detailed handling such as dealing with specific color spaces, compression types or other specific tiff features. For that, I would recommend exploring the documentation of `tifffile`, since it gives you full control over how tiffs are read. Also, if you deal with large image stacks, you may want to explore memory-mapping and delayed reads, which are also explained by `tifffile`'s documentation.

This pattern of using `multiprocessing.Pool` combined with a suitable image library like `tifffile` is usually robust enough for most tiff conversion jobs. I've found that a well-structured solution like this can significantly reduce processing time for large datasets, and it's something that's often overlooked but is crucial when working with big image data. Remember, performance gains are not just about clever coding, they're also about choosing the correct tools and techniques for the job.
