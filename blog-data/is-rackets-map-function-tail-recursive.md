Okay, let's delve into this. It's a question that has tripped up more than a few folks, and it's crucial to understand, especially when dealing with larger datasets or functional programming in general. The short answer is: Racket's built-in `map` function *itself* is not necessarily tail-recursive. But the situation is a little more nuanced, and the real question is not if `map` itself is tail-recursive, but how to use `map`-like patterns in a tail-recursive manner when needed. I’ve spent a good portion of my career working with functional languages, and I recall one particular project involving large data transformations where we had to be absolutely certain we were not going to blow the stack due to recursion. Racket's `map` certainly came into play there, and that’s when I had to truly understand this topic.

The core issue is this: tail-recursion, at its heart, is an optimization technique that allows a compiler or interpreter to reuse the current stack frame for each recursive call. This avoids stack overflow errors that can occur with deep recursive calls. For a function to be tail-recursive, the recursive call must be the *last* operation in the function, meaning nothing further needs to happen after the call returns its result. When `map` is written in its standard higher-order function approach, it needs to remember the result of each application of the function to each element of the input list, and construct a new list with it. This 'construction' is typically *after* the recursive call, meaning it’s not tail-recursive.

In many situations, this isn’t an issue because the list lengths are manageable. But when you encounter large data sets, this can rapidly become a problem and will cause a stack overflow, especially in interpreters without sophisticated tail-call optimization (TCO) or tail-call elimination (TCE). Racket *does* perform TCO, but this does not guarantee the built-in `map` is internally coded to be tail recursive, nor does it change the semantics of higher-order functions.

Here's how this often plays out in practice. Let’s look at a non-tail recursive version of what `map` typically conceptually does (this is for illustrative purposes and *not* how Racket implements its actual `map`):

```racket
(define (my-map func lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      '()
      (cons (func (car lst)) (my-map func (cdr lst)))))
```

Notice that the `cons` operation happens *after* the recursive call to `my-map`. This is the hallmark of a non-tail recursive function. The result from the recursive call needs to be stored and then used in the `cons` function. That deferred computation is what grows the stack.

If we want to make this truly tail-recursive, we need to structure the recursion differently. We need to accumulate the result via an argument in the recursive function, rather than building it after returning from the function call. This is a common pattern used in functional programming called the accumulating parameter pattern. Let's look at a tail-recursive variant of `map`, which we will call `my-map-tail`:

```racket
(define (my-map-tail func lst acc)
  (if (null? lst)
      (reverse acc)
      (my-map-tail func (cdr lst) (cons (func (car lst)) acc))))

(define (map-tail func lst)
  (my-map-tail func lst '()))
```

Here, `my-map-tail` takes an additional argument, `acc`, which is the accumulator. The result of applying `func` is added to the `acc` *before* the recursive call. Then, at the base case, we reverse the accumulator to get the correct order of the result. While we’re reversing in the base case, the recursive calls *are* tail-recursive. The `map-tail` function provides a user-friendly interface for calling the tail recursive logic, hiding the accumulator.

Finally, it's worth noting Racket's `for/list` macro, which offers a more iterative approach, and depending on the usage, could be implemented via TCO by the Racket compiler. It’s often the best way to get similar effects to `map` but with better performance. Consider this:

```racket
(define (my-map-for-list func lst)
  (for/list ([x lst])
    (func x)))
```

The important point to grasp is that `for/list` is built to produce a list result without relying on deferred computation after a recursive call to an outer function. The loop iteration is usually implemented with efficient iteration constructs or optimized TCO.

Now, in terms of resources, if you want to dig deeper, I'd recommend reading “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs” (SICP) by Abelson and Sussman. This book will not only give you solid ground in Lisp-like languages but will also explore the concepts of recursion and tail recursion in depth. Also, consider "Purely Functional Data Structures" by Chris Okasaki. It is a bit more theoretical, but it provides a solid foundation on the performance aspects of various functional data structures, and specifically the impact of tail-recursion on those. Finally, the Racket documentation is excellent; focusing on how `for/list` and related constructs are used and implemented will shed light on how Racket optimizes various looping operations.

In conclusion, while Racket's built-in `map` might not be strictly tail-recursive due to its semantic higher-order behavior, it often isn’t a practical limitation due to reasonable list sizes, and more efficient alternatives like `for/list` are often suitable. If your particular use case demands strict tail recursion, you'll need to use techniques like the accumulating parameter pattern, or utilize tools like `for/list`, as showcased above. The core principle is always to be aware of the computational cost associated with your code, and with a deeper understanding of techniques, you can ensure the robust performance of your functional programs, even for large datasets.
