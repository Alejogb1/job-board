Okay, let's tackle this. It's a fairly common requirement, accessing FTP resources through a proxy, and it’s not always as straightforward as one might initially assume within a Rails environment. I remember back when I was working on a large media management platform; we had a client insisting on accessing their FTP server, which sat behind a strict corporate proxy. It was a fun puzzle, let me tell you. The key challenge is that standard FTP libraries often don’t inherently understand proxy configurations. Rails, being a framework, doesn’t directly provide proxy support for FTP either. We need to introduce a layer that understands both FTP and the HTTP proxy.

The underlying problem stems from the fact that FTP operates over multiple connections, a primary control connection (usually on port 21) and then one or more data connections (which are dynamically established). A basic HTTP proxy, as you likely know, typically handles only single, persistent TCP connections, which is a clash with the requirements of FTP’s multi-connection nature. Thus, we can't simply set a standard http_proxy environment variable and expect everything to work. We’ll need to use either a socks proxy (which does handle multiple connections) or utilize a proxy server specialized for FTP (which is significantly less common). Since assuming the user already has an ftp proxy server setup is a bad practice, we focus on socks proxies.

Let's walk through how to approach this programmatically, using the `net-ftp` gem, which comes standard with Ruby. Although it lacks direct proxy support itself, we can leverage libraries like `socksify` to tunnel FTP traffic through a SOCKS proxy server.

Here's how you’d structure it:

**Code Snippet 1: Basic FTP Connection via SOCKS Proxy**

```ruby
require 'net/ftp'
require 'socksify/http'

def ftp_with_socks_proxy(ftp_host, ftp_user, ftp_password, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user = nil, proxy_password = nil)

  Socksify::HTTP.new(proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_password)

  ftp = Net::FTP.new

    begin
      ftp.connect(ftp_host,21)

      ftp.login(ftp_user, ftp_password)

      # Example: listing files (replace with your desired actions)
      files = ftp.nlst
      puts "Files on the server: #{files}"

      ftp.close
      return true

    rescue Net::FTPPermError => e
      puts "FTP permission error: #{e}"
      return false
    rescue SocketError => e
      puts "Socket error: #{e}"
      return false
    rescue Errno::ECONNREFUSED => e
      puts "Connection Refused: #{e}"
      return false
     rescue StandardError => e
      puts "An error occurred: #{e}"
      return false
    end
end

# Usage Example:
ftp_host = 'your_ftp_host'
ftp_user = 'your_ftp_user'
ftp_password = 'your_ftp_password'
proxy_host = 'your_socks_proxy_host'
proxy_port = 1080 # typically 1080 for socks proxies
proxy_user = 'your_socks_proxy_user' #optional
proxy_password = 'your_socks_proxy_password' #optional

if ftp_with_socks_proxy(ftp_host, ftp_user, ftp_password, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_password)
    puts "FTP operation successful."
else
    puts "FTP operation failed."
end
```

In this first snippet, we're using `socksify` to intercept the connection and send it via the proxy. `socksify` monkey patches parts of ruby's core libraries, like `socket`, to route traffic through the socks server. This approach requires the `socksify` gem to be included in your Gemfile and installed (via `bundle install`). It is critically important to ensure the socks server has access to the destination ftp host, otherwise it wont work. The `ftp_with_socks_proxy` method encapsulate the connection and proxy setup. The begin/rescue blocks are critical for handling various potential connection errors and avoiding the crash of the entire application.

While this method works, it implicitly assumes the usage of passive mode. Let's address that now. By default, FTP operates in active mode, meaning the server connects back to a port specified by the client. Since the client is operating behind a proxy, this creates a problem. Passive mode mitigates this, and luckily it's relatively easy to enable.

**Code Snippet 2: FTP with Passive Mode and SOCKS Proxy**

```ruby
require 'net/ftp'
require 'socksify/http'

def ftp_with_socks_proxy_passive(ftp_host, ftp_user, ftp_password, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user = nil, proxy_password = nil)
   Socksify::HTTP.new(proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_password)

    ftp = Net::FTP.new
    begin
      ftp.connect(ftp_host, 21)
      ftp.login(ftp_user, ftp_password)
      ftp.passive = true # Enable passive mode

      # Example: downloading a file
      ftp.getbinaryfile('example.txt', 'downloaded_file.txt')
      puts "File downloaded successfully."

      ftp.close
      return true

    rescue Net::FTPPermError => e
      puts "FTP permission error: #{e}"
      return false
    rescue SocketError => e
      puts "Socket error: #{e}"
      return false
    rescue Errno::ECONNREFUSED => e
      puts "Connection Refused: #{e}"
      return false
    rescue StandardError => e
      puts "An error occurred: #{e}"
      return false
    end
end

# Usage example remains the same as in the first snippet
ftp_host = 'your_ftp_host'
ftp_user = 'your_ftp_user'
ftp_password = 'your_ftp_password'
proxy_host = 'your_socks_proxy_host'
proxy_port = 1080 # typically 1080 for socks proxies
proxy_user = 'your_socks_proxy_user' #optional
proxy_password = 'your_socks_proxy_password' #optional
if ftp_with_socks_proxy_passive(ftp_host, ftp_user, ftp_password, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_password)
    puts "FTP operation successful."
else
    puts "FTP operation failed."
end
```
The critical difference here is `ftp.passive = true`, enabling passive mode for the FTP connection. This is generally recommended, especially when operating behind a firewall or proxy. Passive mode allows the client to establish data connections, avoiding common proxy and network problems. Now, lets look at a practical example of file uploading.

**Code Snippet 3: Uploading a File Using FTP with SOCKS Proxy**

```ruby
require 'net/ftp'
require 'socksify/http'

def ftp_upload_with_socks_proxy(ftp_host, ftp_user, ftp_password, local_file_path, remote_file_path, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user = nil, proxy_password = nil)
  Socksify::HTTP.new(proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_password)
  ftp = Net::FTP.new

  begin
    ftp.connect(ftp_host,21)
    ftp.login(ftp_user, ftp_password)
    ftp.passive = true

    # Upload the file
    ftp.putbinaryfile(local_file_path, remote_file_path)
    puts "File uploaded successfully."

    ftp.close
    return true

  rescue Net::FTPPermError => e
      puts "FTP permission error: #{e}"
      return false
    rescue SocketError => e
      puts "Socket error: #{e}"
      return false
    rescue Errno::ECONNREFUSED => e
      puts "Connection Refused: #{e}"
      return false
    rescue StandardError => e
      puts "An error occurred: #{e}"
      return false
  end
end
# Usage example:
ftp_host = 'your_ftp_host'
ftp_user = 'your_ftp_user'
ftp_password = 'your_ftp_password'
local_file_path = 'local_file.txt'
remote_file_path = 'remote_file.txt'
proxy_host = 'your_socks_proxy_host'
proxy_port = 1080 # typically 1080 for socks proxies
proxy_user = 'your_socks_proxy_user' #optional
proxy_password = 'your_socks_proxy_password' #optional

# Create a dummy file for demonstration purposes.
File.write(local_file_path, "This is a test file for FTP upload through a proxy.")

if ftp_upload_with_socks_proxy(ftp_host, ftp_user, ftp_password, local_file_path, remote_file_path, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_password)
    puts "FTP operation successful."
else
    puts "FTP operation failed."
end
```
Here we see a practical implementation of a file upload through a socks proxy, including a dummy file creation step for easier testing. Note that we can use the same `ftp.passive = true` here.

For further study, I'd recommend delving into RFC 959 for the definitive standard on FTP, which includes the descriptions of active and passive connection modes. The `socksify` gem documentation, also, is crucial if you are to build upon it and handle more complex cases. Also, I’d suggest the classic, "TCP/IP Illustrated" series by W. Richard Stevens for a deeper understanding of networking. Finally, for more advanced proxy topics, look into the Proxy Command pattern in Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides, which often is a source of useful solutions when dealing with proxy servers.

This should equip you to deal with most scenarios involving FTP through a SOCKS proxy in Rails. Remember to handle error conditions appropriately within your production applications. Always test proxy configurations thoroughly in development environments before deploying, and pay attention to error messages. It’s often the little quirks that get you, so be meticulous, and good luck with your projects!
