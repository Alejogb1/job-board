Alright, let's tackle this `LoadError` you're encountering with `stripe_mock` after a Rails upgrade. It's a classic scenario, and I've certainly been through it a few times myself. Specifically, moving from Rails 6.0 to 6.1 often exposes subtle dependency mismatches or changes in gem loading behavior, particularly with gems like `stripe_mock` that often patch into the broader Rails ecosystem in less-than-obvious ways. What you’re probably seeing, in essence, is that the location where Rails looks for gems during autoloading might have shifted slightly, causing `stripe_mock` to not be found when your application tries to use it, even though it appears in your `Gemfile` and is ostensibly installed.

The core issue isn't typically with the gem itself, but with how Rails 6.1 is handling its autoload paths compared to 6.0. The way Rails manages its autoloading and constant lookups saw some tweaks in that transition. In my experience, the most common culprit for a `LoadError` like this post-upgrade boils down to either an improperly configured autoload path or a gem that hasn’t been updated to be fully compatible with the new Rails version, even if the gem doesn't directly target Rails versioning in its specification. `stripe_mock`, being a testing utility, sometimes falls into the category of a gem that might require a subtle adjustment or even a minor version bump to align with the updated Rails internal mechanisms.

Now, let's dive into some concrete approaches for debugging and resolving this:

**1. Verify Gem Installation and Correct Version:**

First things first, it might sound elementary, but confirm the obvious. Double-check that `stripe_mock` is indeed installed at the correct version as intended. A simple `bundle list | grep stripe_mock` will verify whether it's installed in the current bundle and reveal its version. Also, examine your `Gemfile.lock` to see which version is specifically locked. It’s possible a minor version mismatch between the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` could have crept in somehow during the upgrade process. Often, running `bundle update stripe_mock` can bring it into line with its newest stable version and resolve potential incompatibilities. I remember once chasing this down for hours, only to find that I had a typo in my gemfile declaration, which wasn’t caught by normal bundle management commands, highlighting that explicit checks are often useful.

**2. Explicitly Require the Gem:**

While gems in Rails are generally intended to be loaded automatically, sometimes explicit requires can be beneficial, especially for gems like `stripe_mock` that hook into the underlying runtime. Try adding `require 'stripe_mock'` in your `rails_helper.rb` or in an appropriate place in your test setup (e.g., your spec_helper.rb, depending on your test setup) before `stripe_mock` is used. This explicit loading ensures that Ruby knows about the library’s existence before any autoloading or constant resolution kicks in, sometimes circumventing loading sequence issues.

**Example 1: Explicit Require in `rails_helper.rb`**
```ruby
# spec/rails_helper.rb

require 'spec_helper'
ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'test'
require File.expand_path('../config/environment', __dir__)
# Prevent database truncation if the environment is production
abort("The Rails environment is running in production mode!") if Rails.env.production?
require 'rspec/rails'
require 'stripe_mock' # Added this line

# Add additional setup as needed

RSpec.configure do |config|
  # Your RSpec configuration here
end
```

**3. Review Autoload Paths and Configuration:**

Rails uses autoload paths to know where to look for your application’s code. While less common in scenarios with `stripe_mock`, it's possible some conflict with changes in Rails’ autoload mechanism might be occurring. Rails 6.1 introduced some changes to Zeitwerk, its autoloader. Confirm your `config.autoload_paths` and `config.eager_load_paths` in `config/application.rb` (and `config/environments/test.rb`) aren't conflicting in some manner, although this is less likely the cause with a gem like `stripe_mock`. Still, it is wise to review these to be certain. It is rare, but on more than one occasion I've found a gem's initialization code interfering with normal autoload behavior because of an improperly set constant. The result was a load error that looked a lot like this one. While rare, such odd interactions highlight the value of a comprehensive audit.

**4. Isolating the Issue with a Mini-Test Case:**

If the above steps don't work, it's often helpful to isolate the issue by writing a small test file. Create a new ruby file outside of the rails app (e.g., `test_stripe_mock.rb`) that attempts to require and use `stripe_mock` without any Rails context. This can demonstrate whether the problem lies within your Rails environment or with the gem installation itself.

**Example 2: Test script to check the loading of the stripe_mock gem:**
```ruby
# test_stripe_mock.rb

begin
  require 'stripe_mock'
  puts "stripe_mock loaded successfully!"
  StripeMock.start_test_server # Attempt a basic usage
  puts "Stripe Mock server started"
  StripeMock.stop_test_server
rescue LoadError => e
  puts "LoadError: #{e.message}"
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "Other Error: #{e.message}"
end
```
Running this directly from your terminal, such as `ruby test_stripe_mock.rb` will help you determine if the `stripe_mock` is accessible outside of your Rails environment and isolate issues relating to that or the gem itself. If this test script generates an error, you have a more fundamental install or require issue with the gem.

**5. Check for Gem Conflicts:**

Sometimes a different gem that interacts with Stripe or monkey patches the global namespace might be interfering with `stripe_mock`. It’s possible to have a gem conflict even if two gems are ostensibly independent. Use `bundle list` to get a list of all gems installed and consider disabling or removing gems to narrow down the possibilities. I recall resolving a similar issue by finding a helper gem that also patched Stripe, and removing the lesser used one entirely.

**6. Review Gem Updates and GitHub Issues:**

If nothing else works, search for similar issues on the `stripe_mock` GitHub repository. There might be other users encountering a similar problem, and this search might unearth any reported problems that could explain the behavior. Also, check the gem's release notes for any breaking changes or specific instructions for Rails upgrades.

**Example 3: Testing the gem usage within a minimal Rails context**

If the basic script passes, it might be helpful to create a minimal spec file to ensure the gem is properly loaded in a spec-like rails environment.

```ruby
# spec/stripe_mock_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe 'Stripe Mock Integration', type: :feature do
  it 'loads stripe_mock successfully' do
      expect{ StripeMock.start_test_server }.not_to raise_error
      StripeMock.stop_test_server
  end
end
```
This test, run with `rspec spec/stripe_mock_spec.rb`, attempts to directly start the server and confirms a more nuanced Rails environment does not disrupt the loading of `stripe_mock`.

**Additional Resources:**

For a deeper understanding of Ruby's module system and gem loading mechanics, I highly recommend “Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide” by David Thomas, et al. Additionally, "Metaprogramming Ruby" by Paolo Perrotta provides excellent insights into the inner workings of Ruby and how gems integrate into a project. For specific information related to Rails autoloading, the official Rails documentation on autoloading and eager loading is invaluable. Also, the Zeitwerk repository on GitHub offers further explanations into the nature of Rails' modern autoloader.

In my experience, a combination of these troubleshooting techniques, careful debugging, and methodical isolation will usually point to the root cause and help you fix a `LoadError` like this. Remember to always be methodical when encountering these issues and not to discard any possible avenue without proper consideration. Let me know if you have any more specifics; I'm happy to help refine the approach based on your particular situation. Good luck!
