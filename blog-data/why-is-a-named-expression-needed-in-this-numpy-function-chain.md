Alright, let's unpack this question about named expressions in NumPy function chains. I've run into this particular issue more times than I'd care to count, especially during my time optimizing large-scale data processing pipelines, and it's definitely a point that can trip people up, so it's good to address it head-on.

The core problem revolves around readability and debugging within complex NumPy operations. When you start chaining several operations together, things can get messy—fast. Imagine a scenario where you're applying various transformations to a large numerical dataset. Without names, that single line of code becomes a cryptic, interwoven string of function calls. Tracing errors or understanding intermediate data shapes becomes a significant challenge, almost like trying to decipher hieroglyphics.

Consider this: you have a series of operations, each modifying a NumPy array, and you need to understand the state of the array at each stage. Without naming those intermediate results, you're essentially working with a black box, forcing you to constantly re-evaluate the entire expression whenever a change or issue occurs. It's inefficient, prone to mistakes, and ultimately a bottleneck in development and maintenance.

The named expression, usually achieved through the assignment operator (`=`), allows you to give these intermediate results a human-understandable handle. This seemingly simple step dramatically improves the development experience by allowing you to inspect intermediate states more effectively. Moreover, it can improve efficiency by breaking the long processing chain into smaller, more manageable chunks, which can sometimes help with optimization by avoiding the creation of excessively large temporary objects.

Let's get specific and see some working examples. Suppose I had this raw operation that calculates a sort of normalized sum of squares:

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

result = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(data), axis=1) / np.max(data, axis=1))

print(result)
```

This works but imagine the dataset, and therefore the operations, are much more complicated. It becomes a single, dense operation to decipher and reason about. If something goes wrong, or if you have a follow-up question about an intermediate value, debugging this line is going to take more effort than it should. Here, you are operating on the 'data' object, which is not an output of a previous stage; rather, it's the source for the entire series of operations.

Now, let’s refactor this and introduce named expressions:

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

squared_data = np.square(data)
sum_of_squares = np.sum(squared_data, axis=1)
max_values = np.max(data, axis=1)
normalized_sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares / max_values
result = np.sqrt(normalized_sum_of_squares)


print(result)
```

Notice the difference? We've now broken this into logical steps, and each step is assigned to a descriptive variable. If there’s an error, I can immediately check, say, the shape and values within `sum_of_squares`, which I can't do with the first example. I can also inspect the intermediate `squared_data` and `max_values`. Moreover, if my code is evolving and I need to use `sum_of_squares` elsewhere, I have access to it.

The benefits go beyond debugging though. This is also a great way to enforce logical code structure and improve the long-term maintainability. This is also essential for collaboration since it makes the code much more approachable for other developers. Let’s consider another example where we're dealing with more complex matrix operations:

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.random.rand(100, 100)
transform_matrix = np.random.rand(100,100)
projection = np.dot(transform_matrix, np.linalg.pinv(np.dot(matrix, matrix.T)))
transformed = np.dot(projection, matrix)

print(np.mean(transformed))
```

Here's a refactored version with named expressions:

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.random.rand(100, 100)
transform_matrix = np.random.rand(100,100)

matrix_product = np.dot(matrix, matrix.T)
pseudo_inverse = np.linalg.pinv(matrix_product)
projection_matrix = np.dot(transform_matrix, pseudo_inverse)
transformed_matrix = np.dot(projection_matrix, matrix)

print(np.mean(transformed_matrix))
```

This example highlights a complex series of matrix manipulations. Without the named expressions, understanding each step or troubleshooting a numerical instability can be quite challenging. Now, each intermediate step has a clear and logical label.

Furthermore, named expressions can indirectly offer potential performance enhancements. While not always, in some circumstances breaking an expression into named components allows NumPy and/or the underlying hardware to more efficiently handle intermediate results; think memory access patterns and vectorization. This is usually a side effect, and it's not the main driver for why you'd use named expressions, but it can be a beneficial side effect.

The key takeaway is that while those one-liner chains might seem concise at first, they often become liabilities down the line. Named expressions, while adding a few lines of code, contribute significantly to code clarity, maintainability, and debuggability, which outweighs their verbosity. The long-term benefits are immeasurable, especially for larger projects with complex data processing workflows.

For a deeper dive into optimization and good practices in scientific computing, I would recommend the "Effective Computation in Physics" by Anthony Scopatz and Kathryn D. Huff. It goes into detail about the pragmatic aspects of coding in scientific and technical environments, beyond just the syntactical correctness. Also, the "Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake VanderPlas provides excellent coverage of NumPy usage and effective scientific programming practices, especially its sections on vectorization and array manipulations.

Lastly, for a theoretical viewpoint, consider a good linear algebra textbook like "Linear Algebra and Its Applications" by Gilbert Strang. A solid grounding in linear algebra principles helps in structuring such NumPy code with intention.

In short, named expressions aren’t just a coding preference; they are a necessity for developing and maintaining robust, understandable, and efficient code. They represent an essential tool for any developer working extensively with data processing, or anything involving sequences of operations on complex objects.
