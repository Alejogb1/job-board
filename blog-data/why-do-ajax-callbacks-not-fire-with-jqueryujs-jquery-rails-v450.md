alright, so you're banging your head against the wall because your ajax callbacks aren't triggering when using jquery_ujs, especially with jquery-rails v4.5.0, huh? i’ve been there, trust me. it’s like staring at a perfectly good piece of code that just refuses to cooperate. let me tell you about my escapades with this beast.

back in the day, when rails was still young and jquery was king, i spent a solid week debugging what looked like a simple form submission. i was trying to get a modal to update dynamically after a user submitted some data. i had all the callbacks set up, the `ajax:success`, `ajax:error`, even `ajax:complete`, i thought i was in the clear. the server was receiving the data, processing it, and sending back the correct response. but the modal? yeah, it remained stubbornly unchanged. no errors, no console output, just… silence.

after hours of pulling my hair out, i finally realized what was going on. the key issue with jquery_ujs and callbacks not firing, especially in older versions like the one you mentioned, often boils down to how jquery_ujs intercepts and handles ajax requests, and where it expects your callbacks to be attached. it's less about your code being fundamentally flawed and more about jquery_ujs’s quirks in dealing with event delegation.

basically, jquery_ujs relies heavily on event delegation on the document level. this means instead of attaching handlers directly to the elements initiating the ajax request, it binds them to the document and then uses event bubbling to figure out which action actually triggered the event. this is great for dynamic content, but it can lead to confusing callback attachment situations.

the first common mistake is attaching callbacks directly to the form or button element instead of on the document, which is where jquery_ujs is listening. consider this wrong approach:

```javascript
// this is how *not* to do it

$('#my-form').on('ajax:success', function(event, data, status, xhr) {
    console.log('successful ajax call... but not really!');
    $('#my-modal-content').html(data.content);
});

```
in this case, jquery_ujs intercepts the form submission, creates an xhr request, sends it, and processes the response. the problem is, the callback is not attached where the event is triggered, i.e. the document. so the callback simply does not fire.

here's how we fix that. the proper way to handle this is by using event delegation in jquery. you bind the callback to the document and then filter for the element that initiated the event. this is particularly important when you are dealing with dynamically created content.

```javascript
// correct way to handle it

$(document).on('ajax:success', '#my-form', function(event, data, status, xhr) {
    console.log('ajax success firing!');
    $('#my-modal-content').html(data.content);
});
```

this method ensures that the event bubbles up to the document, which is where jquery_ujs has its event listeners, and then filters for the specific `#my-form` element, triggering the callback. we use the jquery `on` method, and the second argument of the `on` method is our selector, and the third is our callback function.

also, a thing that i've seen happen frequently is that people may have forgotten to load jquery-ujs in their application. this is a very easy mistake to make and very hard to debug, because no errors are shown. you just have empty callbacks. ensure that your `application.js` has included it:

```javascript
// application.js
//= require jquery
//= require rails-ujs
//= require_tree .

```
if you have included jquery-ujs, but your callbacks are still failing, there could be another potential issue. for example, maybe your response is not a json response, so, your `ajax:success` method cannot process it.

another problem i’ve encountered is related to how the server responds. jquery_ujs, by default expects a json response. if your rails backend returns plain html for instance, the ajax handlers will be skipped. you'll get the data, but the callbacks never trigger because the content type isn't right. let me show you the difference between a json response and a html one.

in ruby on rails if you send json you would do something like this in your controller:

```ruby
# controller.rb

def update
    # your logic here
    respond_to do |format|
        format.json { render json: { status: 'success', content: 'updated content' } }
    end
end
```

notice the `format.json` block. this tells rails to send a json object back to the client when the content type is json.

and if you want to return html instead, which jquery-ujs might not like (unless you configure it otherwise), then you would do something like this:

```ruby
# controller.rb

def update
   # your logic here
   respond_to do |format|
       format.html { render partial: 'my_partial', locals: { content: 'updated content'} }
   end
end
```

so, if your callbacks aren't firing, check what your server is returning. you might need to adjust your response type to json or update jquery-ujs configurations accordingly, which is not always a trivial task. or consider other solutions like the `turbo-rails` gem which has a better handling of modern ajax interactions.

also, a final "gotcha" is that sometimes there are javascript errors on your page that might stop the event listeners from working. inspect the javascript console, you might find some surprising details. if your javascript has any errors jquery_ujs might not fire the ajax events and then they’ll fail silently.

so, to recap, the main things to check are:

1.  are you binding your callbacks on the document using `$(document).on('ajax:success', 'your-selector', function(){});` ?
2.  is your `jquery_ujs` file being included? check the `application.js` file, is it there?
3.  is the server responding with a json content type?
4.  is there any other javascript errors in your page?

if none of these solve the issue, then maybe your browser is playing tricks on you, the internet sometimes is like that ( a bit).

as for resources, i’d recommend having a look at the jquery api documentation, particularly the section on event delegation. specifically, look into the `.on()` method and how it handles delegated events. also, there's some good papers in the official rails documentation covering `jquery_ujs`, but they're a bit old (and i believe they don't cover the latest iterations). for older version of rails, the book "agile web development with rails" goes into some of the caveats of jquery-ujs too. another good resource is the jquery documentation itself.

hope that helps. and remember, debugging is 90% frustration and 10% feeling like a genius when you finally figure it out. so, keep at it!
