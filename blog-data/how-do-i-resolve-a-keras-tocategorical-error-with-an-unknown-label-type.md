Okay, let's tackle this. I've definitely been down this road before – that particularly frustrating `to_categorical` error when your labels are behaving unexpectedly. It's usually not the function itself at fault, but rather something about how the input data is being interpreted. Let's break it down, focusing on the underlying issues and how to fix them, drawing from my past experiences.

The `keras.utils.to_categorical` function is designed to convert a vector of class integers into a binary class matrix, often referred to as one-hot encoding. This encoding is crucial for many classification tasks in machine learning. The typical scenario is that you provide an array-like object of integer labels, and it returns a matrix where each row corresponds to a sample, and the column corresponds to the class, with a 1 in the column representing the sample's class.

Now, the trouble starts when `to_categorical` encounters something that it doesn’t expect, primarily things that can’t easily translate into those class indices. For example, non-integer data types like strings or floats, labels that start at a value other than 0, or even inconsistent encoding schemes can throw it off. From what I've seen, the most frequent culprit is using labels that are not internally represented as consecutive integers starting at 0. This can be quite perplexing when you're dealing with real-world datasets where categories might be represented as IDs, or textual descriptors which you convert in your own way.

Here’s where I often begin troubleshooting: examining the nature of the input labels. If `to_categorical` raises an error, it's a good indication that either the provided input labels are not integers, the range of those integers is not what's expected, or they’re simply not in the format keras can directly handle. I typically run a few checks on the input data before even attempting `to_categorical`.

Let’s imagine a situation – and I’ve seen this happen – where you're working with image data and your labels are stored as strings, perhaps something like "dog," "cat," or "bird." These aren’t numeric, and `to_categorical` will certainly object to that. In this case, you must preprocess your labels into numeric representations before attempting to use them. You need to convert these strings into integers, ensuring they are consecutive and start from zero. I'd use a tool like `scikit-learn`'s `LabelEncoder` for this. Here's an example of such a scenario with the corresponding fix in python:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Assume your labels are strings
string_labels = np.array(['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'dog', 'cat'])

# 1. Convert strings to integers using LabelEncoder
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
integer_labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(string_labels)

# Verify that they are consecutive integers starting at zero
print("Encoded Labels:", integer_labels)

# 2. Then, apply to_categorical
categorical_labels = to_categorical(integer_labels)
print("Categorical Labels:\n", categorical_labels)

# To reverse the transformation, you can use label_encoder.inverse_transform(integer_labels)
```

The above code shows how `LabelEncoder` converts string labels to integers before `to_categorical` is applied. This is a crucial step when your labels aren't already integers, avoiding the `to_categorical` error.

Another common scenario, especially when working with databases or external data sources, is where the labels are already numerical, but they might not start from 0, or they might not be consecutive. For instance, your labels might be `[2, 3, 5, 2, 3]`. Again, `to_categorical` might have problems since the assumption is that the data starts from zero and goes up in units of one. To handle that, we need to re-map these to consecutive integers. Here's how I’ve approached this using a dictionary:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Assume non-consecutive numerical labels
non_consecutive_labels = np.array([2, 3, 5, 2, 3])

# 1. Map non-consecutive integers to consecutive starting from 0
unique_labels = sorted(list(set(non_consecutive_labels)))
label_mapping = {label: index for index, label in enumerate(unique_labels)}
consecutive_labels = np.array([label_mapping[label] for label in non_consecutive_labels])

print("Mapped Labels:", consecutive_labels)

# 2. Apply to_categorical
categorical_labels = to_categorical(consecutive_labels)

print("Categorical Labels:\n", categorical_labels)
```

This script first establishes a mapping between your original labels and consecutive integers and then uses this mapping to create new labels suitable for `to_categorical`. The point is to ensure that the labels are consecutive integers from 0 up to `n-1` where `n` is the number of classes.

Lastly, let's consider a case where there might be a mix of data types or unexpected numerical representations in your labels – a situation I've encountered where, during some data cleaning, certain values ended up being represented as strings. This situation may not throw an error immediately, but when passed into to_categorical, will result in problems due to type mismatch, since some elements can't be interpreted as integers. Here’s the fix I use in that situation:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Assume a mix of data types in labels
mixed_labels = np.array(['1', 2, '3', 1, '2'], dtype=object)

# 1. Convert all values to integers
integer_labels = np.array([int(str(label)) for label in mixed_labels])

print("Integer Labels:", integer_labels)

# 2. Ensure they are consecutive, starting at zero as a best practice
unique_labels = sorted(list(set(integer_labels)))
label_mapping = {label: index for index, label in enumerate(unique_labels)}
consecutive_labels = np.array([label_mapping[label] for label in integer_labels])

print("Consecutive Labels:", consecutive_labels)

# 3. Then apply to_categorical
categorical_labels = to_categorical(consecutive_labels)

print("Categorical Labels:\n", categorical_labels)

```

In the above example, I first ensure all labels are converted to integers. Then the same consecutive integer mapping applied previously. These steps make the input suitable for `to_categorical`.

The key takeaway here is that before you use `to_categorical`, you should always ensure your input labels are *consecutive integers starting from zero*. This process may involve a combination of type conversions, remapping, and cleaning of your original labels. This approach generally resolves most issues I've seen in the field.

For further information regarding data preprocessing for neural networks, I'd recommend consulting the scikit-learn documentation, specifically covering `LabelEncoder` and data preprocessing tools in general. The book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron is also an excellent source, with a thorough section on categorical data preprocessing. Further details about Keras can be found on the official TensorFlow website which has a very thorough Keras section. These resources provide solid foundations for handling real-world machine-learning data effectively.

In my experience, these strategies cover the majority of common `to_categorical` issues. Always inspect your labels, understand their format, and apply appropriate preprocessing steps, and you'll find these kinds of errors are relatively straightforward to address.
