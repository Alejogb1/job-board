Okay, let’s tackle this. The initial synchronization of CloudKit data can often feel more nuanced than the subsequent updates, primarily because you're dealing with the establishment of a consistent state between the client and the cloud. Over my years working with iOS applications and backend systems, I’ve certainly navigated this process, and I recall a rather intense project a few years back involving a large medical database where getting the initial sync *perfectly* right was paramount to the entire application's functionality. Let me walk you through the process, focusing on the practical considerations and common pitfalls you might encounter, and I'll also show you some code examples.

The crux of the first synchronization involves fetching existing records, handling new record creation, and, quite critically, managing any potential conflicts. It’s rarely a simple one-time pull; instead, it's an orchestrated dance of queries, record manipulation, and persistent storage management.

First, it’s imperative you understand the CloudKit data model your application uses. Are you primarily using private or public databases? How are your record types structured? What are the key fields and indices you'll be querying against? For simplicity, let’s assume we’re working with a user's private database, and our records are structured around a ‘Task’ record type with fields like ‘title,’ ‘dueDate,’ and ‘isCompleted.’

The first step usually involves a targeted query, specifically designed to retrieve all records of a given type that haven't yet been synchronized. However, in the case of the very first synchronization, this essentially means retrieving *all* existing records. You accomplish this using `NSPredicate(value: true)` and a suitable `CKQuery` object. Remember that while this predicate fetches all records, CloudKit may limit the initial batch size for performance reasons. This is why cursor management is vital.

Here's a snippet of Swift code illustrating the initial query:

```swift
func fetchAllTasks(completion: @escaping ([CKRecord]?, Error?) -> Void) {
    let query = CKQuery(recordType: "Task", predicate: NSPredicate(value: true))
    let queryOperation = CKQueryOperation(query: query)
    var fetchedRecords = [CKRecord]()

    queryOperation.recordFetchedBlock = { record in
        fetchedRecords.append(record)
    }

    queryOperation.queryCompletionBlock = { (cursor, error) in
         if let error = error {
            completion(nil, error)
            return
         }

        if let cursor = cursor {
           self.fetchRemainingTasks(cursor: cursor, records: fetchedRecords, completion: completion)
        } else {
            completion(fetchedRecords, nil)
        }

    }

    privateDatabase.add(queryOperation)
}

private func fetchRemainingTasks(cursor: CKQueryOperation.Cursor, records: [CKRecord], completion: @escaping ([CKRecord]?, Error?) -> Void) {
    let queryOperation = CKQueryOperation(cursor: cursor)
    var fetchedRecords = records

    queryOperation.recordFetchedBlock = { record in
        fetchedRecords.append(record)
    }

    queryOperation.queryCompletionBlock = { (cursor, error) in
         if let error = error {
            completion(nil, error)
            return
         }

        if let cursor = cursor {
           self.fetchRemainingTasks(cursor: cursor, records: fetchedRecords, completion: completion)
        } else {
             completion(fetchedRecords, nil)
        }
    }

    privateDatabase.add(queryOperation)

}
```

This code demonstrates fetching all 'Task' records and iteratively handling the cursor to potentially paginate through results if your dataset is extensive. The `recordFetchedBlock` accumulates records, and the `queryCompletionBlock` manages the cursor and any errors, ensuring complete data retrieval.

Once you’ve fetched the records, they need to be stored locally. This is essential for offline access and ensuring fast retrieval in subsequent sessions. The specific implementation depends on your persistence layer, but let's assume you're using Core Data for demonstration purposes. Your process would involve creating or updating managed objects based on the received `CKRecord` data.

Here’s another code snippet showing how you might translate a `CKRecord` into a Core Data entity:

```swift
func createOrUpdateTask(from ckRecord: CKRecord, in context: NSManagedObjectContext) {
    let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest<Task>(entityName: "Task")
    fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "recordIDString == %@", ckRecord.recordID.recordName)

    do {
        let results = try context.fetch(fetchRequest)
        var task: Task
        if let existingTask = results.first {
            task = existingTask
            // Update properties from ckRecord
            task.title = ckRecord.value(forKey: "title") as? String
            task.dueDate = ckRecord.value(forKey: "dueDate") as? Date
            task.isCompleted = ckRecord.value(forKey: "isCompleted") as? Bool ?? false
           //Update more fields as needed.
            
        } else {
            task = Task(context: context)
            task.recordIDString = ckRecord.recordID.recordName
             task.title = ckRecord.value(forKey: "title") as? String
            task.dueDate = ckRecord.value(forKey: "dueDate") as? Date
            task.isCompleted = ckRecord.value(forKey: "isCompleted") as? Bool ?? false

            //Set more fields.
        }
        try context.save()
    } catch {
        print("Failed to save or fetch task: \(error)")
    }
}

```
This function either updates an existing `Task` entity, identified by its `recordID`, or creates a new one, populating it from the `CKRecord`. The important aspect is to handle both scenarios: create new records from CloudKit and update any existing records.

Now, a crucial aspect I've alluded to, but we haven't explicitly shown, is handling conflicts. It's entirely possible that while your application was offline, modifications were made both locally and in the cloud. When you fetch a record, CloudKit's metadata (specifically, the modification date) lets you understand if there’s been a change on the server that supersedes any local changes you might have made. In the early sync phase, you're likely establishing local copies, so you might not have any conflicts, but it's wise to have a strategy. I always recommend deferring to the server’s record if you find a conflict during a subsequent sync.

Finally, what about creating records? It's highly likely during the initial sync you’ll have local records that didn't exist in CloudKit. You'll need to push these to the server. That is usually managed separately and should be done after you have successfully established a base state by fetching everything from the cloud. Here's a snippet demonstrating the upload of newly created local records:

```swift
func uploadLocalTask(task: Task, completion: @escaping (Error?) -> Void) {

    guard let recordIdString = task.recordIDString else {
        print("Missing recordId for local task")
        return
    }
    let recordID = CKRecord.ID(recordName: recordIdString)
    let ckRecord = CKRecord(recordType: "Task", recordID: recordID)
    
    //Set properties from task
    ckRecord.setValue(task.title, forKey: "title")
    ckRecord.setValue(task.dueDate, forKey: "dueDate")
    ckRecord.setValue(task.isCompleted, forKey: "isCompleted")


    privateDatabase.save(ckRecord) { (record, error) in
        if let error = error {
           completion(error)
        } else {
           completion(nil)
        }
    }

}

```

This snippet showcases the reverse process: taking a local `Task` entity, creating a `CKRecord` object from it and uploading it to CloudKit. Once these initial records are synced, they become available for future incremental synchronization.

To deep dive further into these areas, I recommend exploring the official Apple documentation on CloudKit, as it is extremely thorough. Additionally, for more advanced understanding of Core Data and persistence strategies, look into the "Core Data by Tutorials" series from Ray Wenderlich. Furthermore, for comprehensive information on handling concurrency and synchronization challenges, consider the classic “Concurrent Programming on iOS” by Apple's own, though it might be an older resource.

In conclusion, your first synchronization involves a carefully crafted sequence of queries, local data management, and often, a thoughtful approach to conflict resolution and record creation. By establishing this strong foundation, you ensure your app's data is robust, consistent, and ultimately reliable, which is key to delivering a positive user experience. Remember to thoroughly test every aspect of this process to ensure a smooth launch.
