Alright, let’s tackle this. Gridding through hyperparameter space for LightGBM, particularly with time series data, isn't exactly a plug-and-play situation, and I've definitely had my share of learning experiences on that front. It's a common challenge and definitely worth understanding in depth. Simply treating it like a standard cross-validation problem can lead to some pretty significant issues, primarily because time series data has an inherent temporal ordering, and shuffling this data can introduce data leakage. We absolutely want to avoid that.

The core problem is this: typical k-fold cross-validation randomly splits data into folds. When your data represents a sequence of events over time, this shuffles the past with the future, which will result in highly misleading performance metrics during model validation, since the model is trained with information it wouldn't have during actual prediction scenarios. So, we need to adopt a time-aware approach. This primarily involves using what’s commonly referred to as *time-based split* or *rolling window* cross-validation.

In my experience, the way to achieve this effectively is to perform a ‘forward chaining’ or ‘expanding window’ validation procedure for evaluation. We sequentially use expanding chunks of data for training, and then validate on a period immediately following that training window. Crucially, validation data should always be from a later time than the training data. This avoids the scenario where data from the future "leaks" into our training sets. This process gives a more accurate representation of how the model will perform on unseen future data.

Let’s break down a practical approach. I'll provide examples using python, and then we can discuss it further. Firstly, we need to create a custom time-based cross-validation object. I'll assume you have your time series data in a pandas dataframe with a datetime index.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit
import lightgbm as lgb
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np


def time_based_cv(data, features, target, n_splits, train_size_ratio=0.8):
    """
    Performs time series cross-validation, given your data.
    Args:
    data (pd.DataFrame): Input dataframe with a datetime index
    features (list): List of feature column names
    target (str): The target variable column name
    n_splits (int): Number of splits for validation
    train_size_ratio (float): The proportion of data to use for training
    Returns:
    splits (list): A list of training and validation data split tuples (train_index, val_index)
    """

    n_samples = len(data)
    train_size = int(n_samples * train_size_ratio)
    tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=n_splits, test_size=n_samples-train_size )

    splits = []
    for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(data):

        splits.append((train_index, test_index))
    return splits

def evaluate_model(data, features, target, params, n_splits):
    """
    Evaluates an lgbm model using the time based CV strategy
    Args:
     data (pd.DataFrame): Input dataframe with a datetime index
    features (list): List of feature column names
    target (str): The target variable column name
    params (dict):  lgbm parameter dict
    n_splits (int): Number of splits for validation

    Returns:
        mean_rmse (float): average root mean squared error across splits.
    """

    splits = time_based_cv(data, features, target, n_splits)
    rmses = []

    for train_index, val_index in splits:

        X_train, X_val = data[features].iloc[train_index], data[features].iloc[val_index]
        y_train, y_val = data[target].iloc[train_index], data[target].iloc[val_index]

        lgbm = lgb.LGBMRegressor(**params)
        lgbm.fit(X_train, y_train)
        y_pred = lgbm.predict(X_val)
        rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred))
        rmses.append(rmse)
    return np.mean(rmses)
```

In the `time_based_cv` function, the `TimeSeriesSplit` class does the heavy lifting by returning the appropriate train and test indices for each fold. The subsequent `evaluate_model` function will then take our splits and train a new lgbm model for each, returning the average root mean squared error which will then provide the signal we require to optimize our hyper parameters.

Now, let's see how we can integrate this into a simple grid search. For this illustrative example, I will not include full hyperparameter optimization ranges to keep the computation time down.

```python
import itertools

def gridsearch_lgbm(data, features, target, param_grid, n_splits=3):
    """
    Performs gridsearch for an lgbm model
    Args:
        data (pd.DataFrame): Input dataframe with a datetime index
        features (list): List of feature column names
        target (str): The target variable column name
        param_grid (dict): The param grid for the hyperparameter search
        n_splits (int): Number of splits for validation

    Returns:
         best_params (dict): the hyper parameters yielding the lowest average rmse.
    """
    keys, values = zip(*param_grid.items())
    best_rmse = float('inf')
    best_params = None

    for param_values in itertools.product(*values):
        params = dict(zip(keys, param_values))
        avg_rmse = evaluate_model(data, features, target, params, n_splits)
        if avg_rmse < best_rmse:
            best_rmse = avg_rmse
            best_params = params

    return best_params

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Generate dummy time series data for the demo
    dates = pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2024-01-01', freq='D')
    data = pd.DataFrame({'date': dates, 'feature1': np.random.rand(len(dates)), 'feature2': np.random.rand(len(dates)), 'target': np.random.rand(len(dates)) * 10}).set_index('date')


    features = ['feature1', 'feature2']
    target = 'target'
    param_grid = {
       'n_estimators': [100,200],
       'learning_rate': [0.01,0.1],
       'max_depth': [5,7]
    }

    best_params = gridsearch_lgbm(data, features, target, param_grid)
    print("Best hyperparameters found: ", best_params)
```

The `gridsearch_lgbm` function takes a parameter grid and then iteratively fits lgbm models across all combinations of those parameters, using the time-based cross-validation strategy. In real world use cases, the `param_grid` would contain far more refined parameter searches.

Remember that this process can be computationally intensive, so I suggest optimizing it using a technique known as early stopping and potentially utilising an efficient parallelisation framework, depending on your system specifications and dataset size.

One thing I'd encourage you to explore is the concept of rolling forecasts. With rolling forecasts, you incrementally move your test window across the time series data, creating models using all previous data. This can be especially helpful when dealing with very long time series. You can find detailed explanations in “Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control” by Box, Jenkins, Reinsel, and Ljung which is an excellent foundational text. Another great reference is "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, available online, which provides very accessible information on these techniques.

In summary, never underestimate the importance of correctly handling temporal relationships when working with time series data. Neglecting this aspect can lead to significantly biased results and poor model performance in real-world applications. Always ensure that your validation procedures adequately reflect how your model will actually be used. In my work, I've seen first hand what a difference this can make. Remember, there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution and selecting the most appropriate technique requires a deep understanding of your specific time series problem.
