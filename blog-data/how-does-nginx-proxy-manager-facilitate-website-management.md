Let’s tackle this. I remember one particularly hairy project back in '16 – a distributed microservices setup that was initially a nightmare to manage. It’s where I truly appreciated the power of solutions like Nginx Proxy Manager. It's not just another web server; it’s a control panel for routing and securing your web traffic, dramatically simplifying website management.

At its core, Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) is a user-friendly interface built atop the robust Nginx web server. Rather than manually configuring Nginx files, which can become incredibly complex with multiple domains, subdomains, and SSL certificates, NPM provides a web-based GUI for all of this. This means that setting up a reverse proxy, securing your sites with let's encrypt, or managing access control, can all be accomplished with a few clicks instead of tedious command-line configurations. The impact on productivity and reduction in potential errors is quite significant, especially as projects scale.

The primary way NPM simplifies management is through its reverse proxy capability. When a user requests a website, the request hits your server running NPM first. NPM then intelligently routes that request to the appropriate backend server based on defined rules – it’s essentially a traffic cop for your web apps. This allows you to run multiple services behind a single public IP address and port, even if those services are on different machines. For instance, let’s say you have two applications, a blog on port 3000 and a photo gallery on port 4000, both on your internal network. Without a proxy, accessing these via a single public URL would be difficult, if not impossible. With NPM, you can set up rules to route ‘yourdomain.com/blog’ to port 3000 and ‘yourdomain.com/gallery’ to port 4000, all handled by the proxy. This significantly reduces the number of exposed ports and public IP addresses you’d otherwise need, making your infrastructure safer and cleaner.

Another significant advantage of NPM lies in its built-in support for SSL certificate management via Let's Encrypt. Security is paramount, and manually obtaining and renewing SSL certificates for all your domains and subdomains can be extremely time-consuming and prone to errors. NPM fully automates this process. When you set up a new host in NPM, it can automatically request and install a free SSL certificate from Let’s Encrypt. This reduces manual configuration and prevents the headaches associated with certificate expiry – NPM takes care of renewals automatically.

Furthermore, NPM's user interface allows you to manage access lists and authentication easily. For instances where only certain users or IP addresses should have access to particular backend servers, NPM provides tools for creating access control lists and requiring HTTP basic authentication. Without NPM, doing this with raw Nginx would involve meticulously editing configuration files and reloading the service. I can assure you, it’s not the most enjoyable use of one's time.

Let's look at a few simplified examples to demonstrate how this might work in practice.

**Example 1: Basic Reverse Proxy**

Imagine we have a simple Node.js app running on port 3000 on our internal network. The following Nginx configuration snippet shows how you would achieve this reverse proxy if you were to write it manually:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}

```

This configuration tells Nginx to listen on port 80, and if the request is for 'example.com', then forward the request to port 3000 on the same machine. The `proxy_set_header` directives are crucial for proper proxying, especially with web sockets.

With NPM, you’d be setting this up via the web interface by providing a domain name (`example.com`), specifying the backend IP address and port (`127.0.0.1:3000`), and NPM translates these inputs into the equivalent Nginx config. The interface handles the specifics and prevents syntax errors that are often encountered with direct Nginx configuration.

**Example 2: Subdomain Routing with SSL**

Suppose we want two subdomains – `blog.example.com` and `app.example.com` – pointing to two different backend services. Manually, the Nginx configuration could look like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name blog.example.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3001;
        # ... other proxy directives
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3002;
        # ... other proxy directives
    }
}
```

And then you would need the equivalent for port 443, the secure HTTPS configuration, and then the separate configuration to obtain and renew the SSL certificates. However, with NPM, you’d simply create two separate hosts within the interface (`blog.example.com` pointed to port 3001, and `app.example.com` pointed to port 3002), and NPM manages the SSL certificate issuance and renewal automatically. This removes the tedious process of setting this all up in the nginx configuration files and the additional certificate handling, effectively making managing subdomain routing easier and less error prone.

**Example 3: Basic Access Control**

Say, you want to limit access to `internal.example.com` to only specific IP addresses. With Nginx, it would require something like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name internal.example.com;

    allow 192.168.1.10;
    allow 192.168.1.20;
    deny all;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3003;
        # ... other proxy directives
    }
}
```
This allows requests only from the IP addresses 192.168.1.10 and 192.168.1.20, and blocks all other requests. You could also add a `auth_basic` directive and require a username and password.

In NPM, this is achieved via the “access lists” feature and enabling HTTP authentication, all through a point-and-click interface. The system essentially generates the correct Nginx directives from your settings.

In essence, Nginx Proxy Manager doesn't just manage Nginx, it hides away the complexities of Nginx, while simultaneously unlocking many of the benefits of running an Nginx-powered proxy. It allows engineers and even non-technical users to effectively set up and manage robust web services without becoming Nginx experts.

If you’re looking to delve deeper into the technicalities behind Nginx and reverse proxying, I'd strongly recommend the official Nginx documentation, of course. The “HTTP/2” section of the “High Performance Browser Networking” book by Ilya Grigorik is a great deep dive into the specifics and practicalities of managing web traffic. Understanding the fundamentals of TCP/IP and HTTP is also essential, so "TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols" by W. Richard Stevens is a staple for networking professionals. To truly grasp the concepts and architecture of modern web servers, taking a look at papers on the C10k problem, such as “The C10K problem” from Daniel J. Bernstein can be beneficial. These resources can provide you with a solid foundation, while NPM gives you a user-friendly tool to manage these concepts effectively. It's a good example of how user-facing tools can bridge the gap between complex technologies and real-world management. It’s been an invaluable tool for me over the years, and I trust you'll find it useful as well.
