so, you've bumped into the classic rails 5.2.8 named scope argument mystery, huh? yeah, i've been there, wrestled with it myself a few times. it's one of those things that can have you scratching your head, especially when your tests were all green before the upgrade. let me walk you through what's probably happening and how i've tackled this in the past.

basically, before rails 5.2.8, named scopes had a bit of a relaxed approach to argument handling, particularly within the context of rspec tests. it's as if they were quite happy to just take whatever was passed to them, more or less. think of it like this, imagine passing a slightly incorrect formatted email to your mail client, older versions of the email client would try their best to send the email anyway. post 5.2.8 though rails tightened up the screws. now, it expects arguments to be passed exactly how they were defined in your model. if not, it throws a fit or worse silently fails and your tests suddenly go red for no apparent reason.

the core issue usually revolves around how you’re setting up your rspec mocks or stubs. pre 5.2.8, maybe something like `allow(my_model).to receive(:my_scope).and_return(my_relation)` might’ve worked. but, post-upgrade, this approach can easily break. rails now does a more strict argument matching inside the scope logic, especially if you're passing arguments to the named scope in your model.

let's say you have a named scope like this in your `user.rb` model:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  scope :active_users, ->(from_date) { where('created_at >= ?', from_date) }
end
```

and, before the upgrade, this might be working perfectly in your tests:

```ruby
# spec/models/user_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
  describe '.active_users' do
    let(:from_date) { 1.week.ago }
    let(:user_relation) { User.where(id: 1) }

    it 'returns users created after a specific date' do
      allow(User).to receive(:active_users).and_return(user_relation)
      expect(User.active_users(from_date)).to eq(user_relation)
    end
  end
end
```

after the upgrade to rails 5.2.8, though, your tests probably start failing miserably. what's happening? well, rails is trying to use the provided argument, `from_date`, inside your `active_users` scope. but, in your test case, you're stubbing/mocking the entire scope. you're essentially saying "whenever someone calls `active_users`, give back `user_relation`", you're short circuiting the scope logic, and rails can't apply its magic.

the fix? you should actually mimic the arguments passed to the scope on the mock definition, or allow the original named scope to execute during the test case and assert it has been called with the correct arguments. one way to fix the above example might be:

```ruby
# spec/models/user_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
  describe '.active_users' do
    let(:from_date) { 1.week.ago }
    let(:user_relation) { User.where('created_at >= ?', from_date) } # <- mimicking the scope

    it 'returns users created after a specific date' do
      allow(User).to receive(:active_users).with(from_date).and_return(user_relation)
      expect(User.active_users(from_date)).to eq(user_relation)
    end
  end
end
```

notice the change? i'm now using `with(from_date)` when mocking, which is telling rspec exactly what argument the scope is going to receive during the execution of your test case. this is critical post-rails 5.2.8, because rails now cares, a lot.

another thing that has bitten me is when i had a scope that takes multiple arguments, like this:

```ruby
# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  scope :published_between, ->(start_date, end_date) {
    where('published_at >= ? AND published_at <= ?', start_date, end_date)
  }
end
```

in this case, you might run into issues if you mock the scope incorrectly:

```ruby
# spec/models/post_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe Post, type: :model do
  describe '.published_between' do
    let(:start_date) { 2.weeks.ago }
    let(:end_date) { 1.week.ago }
    let(:post_relation) { Post.where(id: 1) }

    it 'returns posts published within a date range' do
      allow(Post).to receive(:published_between).and_return(post_relation)
      expect(Post.published_between(start_date, end_date)).to eq(post_relation) #<- this will fail
    end
  end
end
```

here, the problem is the same as the previous case but on a multiple argument scope, the solution is also quite similar:

```ruby
# spec/models/post_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe Post, type: :model do
  describe '.published_between' do
    let(:start_date) { 2.weeks.ago }
    let(:end_date) { 1.week.ago }
    let(:post_relation) { Post.where('published_at >= ? AND published_at <= ?', start_date, end_date) } #<- mimics the actual scope

    it 'returns posts published within a date range' do
       allow(Post).to receive(:published_between).with(start_date, end_date).and_return(post_relation)
       expect(Post.published_between(start_date, end_date)).to eq(post_relation)
    end
  end
end
```

i've also seen cases where people were using `any_args` in their mocks, hoping that would cover any argument situation. and it works pre 5.2.8 but that will not work anymore because rails strict argument checking after version 5.2.8.

```ruby
# spec/models/post_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe Post, type: :model do
  describe '.published_between' do
    let(:start_date) { 2.weeks.ago }
    let(:end_date) { 1.week.ago }
    let(:post_relation) { Post.where('published_at >= ? AND published_at <= ?', start_date, end_date) }

    it 'returns posts published within a date range' do
       allow(Post).to receive(:published_between).with(any_args).and_return(post_relation) # <- any_args will not work
       expect(Post.published_between(start_date, end_date)).to eq(post_relation)
    end
  end
end
```
while `any_args` may sound tempting, it's not the right tool for this problem, you need to be specific in your mocks.

another important thing to keep in mind, is if the arguments you are passing to the scope are dynamic (calculated in the test case, not statically defined) i've seen this scenario:

```ruby
# spec/models/post_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe Post, type: :model do
  describe '.published_between' do
    it 'returns posts published within a date range' do
        start_date = 2.weeks.ago
        end_date = 1.week.ago
       post_relation = Post.where('published_at >= ? AND published_at <= ?', start_date, end_date)
       allow(Post).to receive(:published_between).with(start_date,end_date).and_return(post_relation)
       expect(Post.published_between(start_date, end_date)).to eq(post_relation)
    end
  end
end
```

in this specific scenario, you need to understand if you want to test the scope logic or just test that the scope is being called with the correct arguments, if you want to test the scope logic, is better to let the scope execute during the test and just assert its behaviour in the test case, instead of mocking the scope as shown in the previous examples. if you want to test only that the scope is being called with the proper arguments you must use `with(start_date, end_date)` which enforces the scope to be called with those specific argument values, you can create a variable `argument` in your test case and then use `with(argument)` to enforce your test case to call the scope with that specific argument.

the key is to remember that after rails 5.2.8, arguments passed to named scopes in test cases need to be more precise and explicit in your mocks and stubs, and you should try to mimic the actual logic inside your scope in the mocked/stubbed response or let the scope execute and assert its behaviour and the arguments received.

if you are looking to understand more about testing and how rails works i can recommend the following books: "test-driven development by example" by kent beck is a classic book on how to implement tests and "agile web development with rails 6" is a more modern and rails-focused book about how to build solid rails apps, and the official rails guides are also quite helpful. also the rspec documentation could help you understand how to properly stub and mock during testing. i've read them a few times, they helped me a lot.

remember that the goal of a test case is not to mock all the parts of your software, but test the interaction of different parts. mocking is just a tool to help your tests, and mocking too much is a pattern that will only create pain. i hope this helps you, it did help me in the past, now i avoid mocking scopes and just test the model behaviour and let the logic flow, it's easier that way. and if you're still struggling, remember there’s always stackoverflow…and a large coffee pot…or two, i'm not judging. (i joke, just try to follow the advice). good luck and let me know if you need anything else!
