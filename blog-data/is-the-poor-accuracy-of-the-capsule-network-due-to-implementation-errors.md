Alright, let's tackle this. I've certainly spent a fair bit of time debugging neural networks, including capsule nets, and the question of whether poor accuracy stems solely from implementation errors is, well, it's a layered problem. It's not always a simple 'yes' or 'no'. I recall working on a complex object recognition project some years back where we initially gravitated towards capsule networks, lured by their promise of handling viewpoint invariance so elegantly. What we found was... complicated.

Let’s be clear: flawed implementations *can* definitely tank accuracy. That's a given in any deep learning endeavor. But to pin the blame *solely* on implementation errors, especially with something as intricate as a capsule network, is probably a simplification. Capsule networks, by design, are more complex than standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They involve dynamic routing, vector outputs, and a different way of representing feature hierarchies – all of which introduce additional possibilities for both conceptual *and* practical missteps.

One of the primary sources of trouble I've seen lies in the incorrect handling of the routing algorithm. It's not enough to simply translate the equations; subtle errors in the iterative update process of routing coefficients can lead to unstable training or a collapse of the hierarchical feature representation. Consider, for instance, how the coupling coefficients are initialized and updated; that subtle detail can make or break convergence. Let’s examine a simplified version of the capsule routing algorithm, where we are updating the ‘b’ values:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class CapsuleLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_capsules, in_dim, out_capsules, out_dim, routing_iterations):
        super(CapsuleLayer, self).__init__()
        self.in_capsules = in_capsules
        self.in_dim = in_dim
        self.out_capsules = out_capsules
        self.out_dim = out_dim
        self.routing_iterations = routing_iterations

        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(in_capsules, out_capsules, in_dim, out_dim))

    def forward(self, x):
        batch_size = x.size(0)
        x_hat = torch.matmul(x.unsqueeze(2), self.weight)  # Shape: [batch, in_capsules, out_capsules, out_dim]
        b = torch.zeros(batch_size, self.in_capsules, self.out_capsules, 1).to(x.device) # Shape: [batch, in_capsules, out_capsules, 1]
        for _ in range(self.routing_iterations):
             c = F.softmax(b, dim=2)  # Shape: [batch, in_capsules, out_capsules, 1]
             s = (c * x_hat).sum(dim=1, keepdim=True)  # Shape: [batch, 1, out_capsules, out_dim]
             v = self.squash(s)      # Shape: [batch, 1, out_capsules, out_dim]
             b = b + (v * x_hat).sum(dim=-1, keepdim=True) # Shape: [batch, in_capsules, out_capsules, 1]
        return v.squeeze(1)

    def squash(self, s):
        s_squared_norm = (s ** 2).sum(-1, keepdim=True)
        s_norm = torch.sqrt(s_squared_norm)
        scale = s_squared_norm / (1 + s_squared_norm) / s_norm
        return scale * s
```
In this snippet, the ‘b’ values are updated during each iteration of the routing process, which determines how much the capsules in the lower layer contribute to capsules in the higher layer. Incorrect initialization or update can cause issues.

Another area where implementation errors can manifest involves the activation function, the “squashing” used in the capsule layer, which normalizes the vector outputs. If this operation is not performed accurately, it can result in gradients that vanish or explode, or non-meaningful capsule representations. The squashing function is critical for maintaining a bounded output and preserving useful signal while limiting the magnitude of the output vectors:

```python
def squash(s):
        s_squared_norm = (s ** 2).sum(-1, keepdim=True)
        s_norm = torch.sqrt(s_squared_norm)
        scale = s_squared_norm / (1 + s_squared_norm) / s_norm
        return scale * s
```

The calculation of 'scale' is crucial here. Missing the norm calculation, or the division by ‘s_norm’ could result in the squashing layer not performing as intended.

However, even with a perfect implementation, capsule networks have their limits. The very premise of using vectors and the dynamic routing process also makes them less straightforward to optimize. They often require careful hyperparameter tuning and more computational resources compared to their CNN counterparts. It's also worth noting that many image datasets, especially those used for benchmarks, aren't necessarily designed to benefit from the specific strengths of capsule networks. If a standard CNN can effectively model the spatial hierarchy needed to solve the problem, then a capsule net might not show a significant performance improvement.

Furthermore, the initial capsule network architectures, while theoretically intriguing, are frequently quite small and might not have enough capacity to model complex data distributions effectively. They might not capture subtle nuances required for high accuracy on some tasks. The number of routing iterations, the capsule dimensions, all affect performance and the best settings are application-dependent. Insufficient or excessive routing iterations, for example, may lead to poor results. Let’s look at an example of a simplified complete capsule network, showing an example of architecture definition:

```python
class SimpleCapsNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(SimpleCapsNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 256, kernel_size=9, stride=1)
        self.primary_caps = CapsuleLayer(in_capsules=1, in_dim=256*8*8, out_capsules=32, out_dim=8, routing_iterations=1)
        self.digit_caps = CapsuleLayer(in_capsules=32, in_dim=8, out_capsules=num_classes, out_dim=16, routing_iterations=3)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1, 1) #flatten and add capsule dim
        primary_caps = self.primary_caps(x)
        digit_caps = self.digit_caps(primary_caps)
        return digit_caps

#example usage:
model = SimpleCapsNet(num_classes=10)
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)  # Example input
output = model(x)
print(output.shape)  # Output Shape is torch.Size([1, 10, 16])
```

Here you can observe how the overall capsule network is structured, illustrating the primary and higher-level capsules. An improperly designed architecture, e.g. too few capsules, wrong kernel sizes or strides, or insufficient routing iterations can all hinder the network’s performance.

So, in short, while implementation errors certainly play a role, simply correcting coding flaws isn't a silver bullet for improving capsule network accuracy. The limitations also stem from the inherent complexity of training them, their architectural design and the specifics of the problem they're trying to solve. It’s more of a multi-faceted challenge involving meticulous implementation, careful hyperparameter selection, and an understanding of the limitations of the approach for the given task.

For further understanding, I’d recommend exploring the original capsule network paper by Hinton, Sabour, and Frosst, published in *NIPS 2017* titled “Dynamic Routing Between Capsules.” Also the theoretical underpinnings of vector-based neural networks are well discussed in *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. These resources should give you a firmer theoretical foundation and help you dissect the intricacies of these networks more effectively.
