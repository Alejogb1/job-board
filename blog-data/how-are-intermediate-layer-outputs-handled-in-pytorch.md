Alright, let's tackle this one. I recall back in my early days working on a complex neural network for image segmentation – a project that almost sent me back to Fortran, I swear – I spent a solid week debugging why my gradients were vanishing like morning mist. The problem, as it turned out, stemmed from a misunderstanding of how PyTorch manages intermediate layer outputs during backpropagation. It’s a vital aspect to comprehend for anyone venturing beyond basic tutorials.

Essentially, in PyTorch, when you define a model using `torch.nn.Module` and its subclasses, the framework cleverly constructs a dynamic computation graph as your data flows forward through the layers. This graph isn't just a passive representation of the operations; it's actively tracking all computations. The intermediate outputs of each layer are implicitly stored, or, more precisely, they are retained as nodes within this graph. These nodes store the output tensor *and* the operations that generated them. This is pivotal because during backpropagation, when the gradients are calculated, the framework needs access to these stored values to correctly chain the derivatives using the chain rule.

Now, here's where the fine print starts. PyTorch doesn’t keep *all* intermediate tensors by default to save memory. If a particular intermediate output isn't explicitly required for further computations in the forward pass, or isn't marked for gradient tracking, it's generally discarded after it has been used. This optimization is incredibly important, especially when dealing with large models or input datasets. However, this default behavior can sometimes lead to those frustrating moments when you suddenly realize some information you needed to calculate a custom loss function or implement a particular layer modification is missing.

Let’s dive into how this works, practically. Consider a simple, three-layer neural network:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleNet()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
output = model(input_tensor) # Forward pass

loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
target = torch.randn(1, 5)
loss = loss_fn(output, target)
loss.backward() # Backpropagation

# Accessing intermediate outputs with a forward hook
def hook_fn(module, input, output):
  print(f"Output tensor shape of {module.__class__.__name__}: {output.shape}")

model.relu.register_forward_hook(hook_fn)
output = model(input_tensor)

```
In this snippet, `model.relu.register_forward_hook(hook_fn)` sets up a hook that intercepts the forward pass of the `relu` layer and executes `hook_fn` after the layer's computation. This is a useful technique to probe and log the shapes and values of intermediate tensors and gain insight into the dataflow. However, the important takeaway here is that PyTorch is automatically managing intermediate tensors needed for gradient calculation by the `loss.backward()` without explicitly needing intervention at the intermediate layer.

Now, let’s look at a scenario where we need to explicitly access an intermediate layer's output to, say, calculate a loss term specific to that layer. For this, we can employ a method involving capturing outputs and making them available at the end of the forward pass.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class FeatureExtractingNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(FeatureExtractingNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 5)
        self.intermediate_output = None  # variable to store intermediate output


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        self.intermediate_output = x  # capturing the output
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x, self.intermediate_output #returning also the intermediate output

model = FeatureExtractingNet()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
output, intermediate_output = model(input_tensor) # Both final and intermediate output

loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
target = torch.randn(1, 5)
loss = loss_fn(output, target)

# Example additional loss using the intermediate_output
intermediate_target = torch.randn(1, 20) # Example target for the intermediate output
intermediate_loss = loss_fn(intermediate_output, intermediate_target)

total_loss = loss + intermediate_loss
total_loss.backward()

print(f"Shape of final output: {output.shape}, shape of intermediate output: {intermediate_output.shape}")
```

Here, within the `forward` function, we're specifically assigning the output of the `relu` layer to `self.intermediate_output`. We’re also modifying the `forward()` method to return it alongside the final output. This makes it accessible for calculations like the `intermediate_loss`. This pattern allows for incorporating auxiliary losses that can regularize training or guide the model to learn specific representations within a specific layer.

Let's look at another useful tool: `torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint`. This allows trading off computation for memory. Suppose you’re working on a deep model where you're limited by gpu memory. Backpropagation requires storing all the intermediate tensors to calculate the gradient. With `checkpoint`, it allows you to recalculate the forward pass in the backward pass, instead of storing it. This can allow you to fit larger models into your limited GPU memory.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.checkpoint import checkpoint

class CheckpointNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CheckpointNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 500)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(500, 1000)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(1000, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.fc1(x)
      x = checkpoint(self.relu1, x) # checkpoint activation
      x = self.fc2(x)
      x = checkpoint(self.relu2,x) # checkpoint activation
      x = self.fc3(x)
      return x

model = CheckpointNet()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10, requires_grad=True)
output = model(input_tensor)

loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
target = torch.randn(1, 5)
loss = loss_fn(output, target)
loss.backward()

```
In this code snippet the `torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint` function treats the layers as a blackbox, and doesn't store the intermediate outputs from the forward pass, instead it recalculates it during back propagation. This allows us to drastically decrease the memory needed, though increasing the computation.

In summary, PyTorch handles intermediate layer outputs dynamically, storing them in the computation graph for backpropagation when required. This process is optimized for efficiency, and often eliminates the need to manually store these tensors. However, when the need arises to access or manipulate these outputs explicitly (for custom losses, visualizations, or specific model modifications), you can employ techniques like forward hooks or explicit capture and return. Tools like `checkpoint` allow memory to be traded off for compute during the training process. For a deeper dive, I’d suggest reviewing the PyTorch documentation on `torch.nn.Module`, particularly the sections discussing the autograd engine and hooks and `torch.utils.checkpoint`, as well as delving into the seminal work “Automatic Differentiation in Machine Learning: A Survey,” which provides a thorough treatment of the underlying mechanics. Also, the book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann offers an excellent practical guide with extensive examples. These resources will provide a comprehensive understanding of how tensors flow and are managed within the PyTorch environment.
