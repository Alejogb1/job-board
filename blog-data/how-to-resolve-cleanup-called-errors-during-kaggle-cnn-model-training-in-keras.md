Alright, let's tackle this one. “Cleanup called…” messages during a Kaggle CNN training run, particularly in Keras, can be frustrating. I've definitely banged my head against that wall a few times, especially when pushing the boundaries of available resources on a Kaggle kernel. It’s rarely a single smoking gun but rather a confluence of factors that we need to systematically address. The essence of these "Cleanup called..." errors usually boils down to the Kaggle environment detecting that something's going sideways – typically, a resource exhaustion event or a process termination. Instead of a proper crash, it politely hints at a resource issue through this message, and the kernel terminates. It’s not particularly descriptive, granted, so let’s break down the most common causes and effective mitigation strategies, all informed by a few past struggles of my own.

First, the elephant in the room: memory. I recall one project involving image segmentation, where I was handling unusually high-resolution satellite imagery within a resnet-based architecture. The model was large, the images were large, and the batch size, initially, was far too optimistic. This led to persistent "Cleanup called..." terminations, without much useful information initially. What’s happening is that when the GPU (or even CPU) memory is fully consumed, the system throws a 'memory error' of sorts, and the Kaggle kernel interprets this as a condition requiring cleanup.

Here's an initial approach to debug this type of memory issues. We can use the Keras callbacks to monitor memory usage more granularly. It's a good first step because it can help us identify if the memory consumption is rising rapidly during each epoch which would be a sign of batch size being set too high. The following snippet demonstrates this using a custom callback:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback
import psutil
import os

class MemoryMonitor(Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MemoryMonitor, self).__init__()

    def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None):
        process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
        mem_info = process.memory_info()
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Memory usage (RSS): {mem_info.rss / (1024 * 1024):.2f} MB")
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
        mem_info = process.memory_info()
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Memory usage after epoch (RSS): {mem_info.rss / (1024 * 1024):.2f} MB")


# Example usage:
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')

# Dummy data
import numpy as np
train_images = np.random.rand(600,28,28,1)
train_labels = np.random.randint(0,9,600)
validation_images = np.random.rand(100,28,28,1)
validation_labels = np.random.randint(0,9,100)


model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=3,
          validation_data=(validation_images, validation_labels),
          callbacks=[MemoryMonitor()])
```

This callback, `MemoryMonitor`, outputs the resident set size (RSS) memory usage at the beginning and end of each epoch. This way, you can observe trends and pinpoint memory spikes. It's often the case that a too-large batch size is the culprit, particularly with complex models and high resolution inputs. Reducing the batch size often helps significantly. However, other strategies such as data type conversions might help as well. Using, for example, `tf.float16` instead of `tf.float32`, whenever applicable, can reduce the memory footprint, but it does come with its own set of considerations, such as potentially reduced precision in calculations, so should be approached with caution.

Beyond memory exhaustion, another frequent source of problems is inefficient data loading. I once encountered a situation where I was generating augmentations and loading images dynamically within a custom data generator, without properly optimizing for it. While this allows for on-the-fly data manipulation, the overhead was slowing down data throughput and consuming significant resources. It often led to ‘Cleanup called…’ errors not because of memory directly, but because the data pipelines could not keep up with the training loop, leading to an inefficient use of the Kaggle environment, and eventually leading to the kernel being terminated.

Using `tf.data.Dataset` with proper prefetching and parallel loading can dramatically improve performance and reduce issues with kernel terminations. I’ve found that this method is often more efficient than custom data generators that are not well implemented, and can often resolve a multitude of issues related to loading data. Here is an example how to do this with our example data:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os

# Assume 'train_images', 'train_labels', 'validation_images', and 'validation_labels' exist from the previous example
# Create a tf.data.Dataset
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_images, train_labels))
validation_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((validation_images, validation_labels))


BATCH_SIZE = 32

train_dataset = train_dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=len(train_images)).batch(BATCH_SIZE).prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

validation_dataset = validation_dataset.batch(BATCH_SIZE).prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)



model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')


model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=3, validation_data=validation_dataset)
```

Using `tf.data.Dataset` offers many benefits: it allows for efficient batching, prefetching (which overlaps data loading with model computation), and parallel loading. This ensures that the data pipeline is not a bottleneck. Using `tf.data.AUTOTUNE` lets TensorFlow dynamically adjust prefetching and parallelism based on your system. This is incredibly important when dealing with large datasets and heavy augmentations. The prefetching with `AUTOTUNE` option is a game changer in preventing issues stemming from the data pipeline not keeping up with the training.

Finally, resource constraints are not always directly related to the model's computational or memory footprint. I’ve faced scenarios where the issue was related to the limited Kaggle kernel resources, particularly when using a very aggressive training schedule with a large amount of training data over an extensive period. In such cases, the Kaggle environment may automatically shut down the kernel due to excessive usage.

To mitigate that, consider incorporating checkpointing mechanisms. Let’s assume that we also want to keep track of the best performing model based on validation loss. We can do that as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

# Assume 'train_dataset' and 'validation_dataset' exist from the previous example

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')

checkpoint_filepath = os.path.join("./", 'best_model')
model_checkpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=checkpoint_filepath,
    save_best_only=True,
    monitor='val_loss',
    mode='min'
    )


model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=3, validation_data=validation_dataset, callbacks=[model_checkpoint_callback])

```

The callback `ModelCheckpoint` will store the best performing model on disk in case a shutdown occurs. This avoids having to rerun the entire training process, from scratch, and it also means that even if a cleanup happens, progress isn't entirely lost. Moreover, regularly saving model checkpoints, alongside a judicious use of early stopping callbacks (not shown here, but quite relevant) can allow you to resume training from the last saved point if it terminates early, saving valuable time and computational resources. Remember to adjust the frequency and saving behavior based on your specific needs and training time of each epoch.

To delve deeper into these topics, I’d recommend looking into the official Tensorflow documentation for `tf.data.Dataset` and Keras callbacks. The "Deep Learning with Python" book by François Chollet gives a good introduction into practical aspects of building deep learning models using Keras. Additionally, exploring research papers on large-scale model training optimization techniques would provide more advanced insights.

In summary, "Cleanup called..." errors during Keras training on Kaggle are usually signals of resource issues, often related to memory, inefficient data loading, or exceeding overall resource limits. By combining systematic memory monitoring, optimizing the data pipeline using `tf.data.Dataset`, and leveraging model checkpoints, you can drastically reduce occurrences of these issues and ensure smoother training workflows. It's not about finding the one perfect fix, but rather understanding the components of the training process and how they interact with Kaggle's resource constraints.
