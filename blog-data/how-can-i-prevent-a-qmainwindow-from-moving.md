Alright, let's tackle this. Preventing a `QMainWindow` from moving is a surprisingly common requirement, especially when you're crafting highly specialized user interfaces. I've personally bumped into this several times over the years, usually when working on embedded systems or kiosk applications where a fixed position and size are absolutely crucial. It’s not always immediately obvious how to achieve this with Qt, and the documentation, while comprehensive, sometimes lacks the kind of direct practical examples that are most helpful.

So, you want that `QMainWindow` glued to its initial spot, eh? There are a few ways to accomplish this, and the best approach depends somewhat on the nuances of your particular needs. We're essentially dealing with window management behaviors at the operating system level, and Qt provides us with a layer of abstraction to interact with these. The core principle revolves around controlling the window flags.

First, the most straightforward approach is to use `Qt::WindowFlags`. Specifically, the combination of `Qt::Window` flag, which will tell the system that it is just a window, and then removing `Qt::WindowMovable` functionality, which, as the name implies, does the job of enabling moving. This effectively takes away the user's ability to manually drag the window. While this is a fairly aggressive step and may not fit all scenarios, it's useful to grasp. Let's look at a simple example demonstrating this technique:

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt
import sys

class FixedWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowTitle("Fixed Window Example")
        self.setGeometry(100, 100, 400, 300) # Arbitrary position and size

        # Disabling movement by altering the window flags
        self.setWindowFlags(self.windowFlags() & ~Qt.WindowMovable | Qt.Window)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = FixedWindow()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

```

In this snippet, I’ve created a `QMainWindow` subclass and within the constructor, I'm accessing existing window flags via `self.windowFlags()` and doing a bitwise AND with the inverse of the `Qt.WindowMovable` to remove the movability flag, ensuring that the window is not movable but stays as window by enabling the `Qt.Window` flag. The bitwise operation removes the given flag from the existing set. It’s a compact, effective method. Execute this code, and you'll find you can't drag the window around with your mouse. Note that on some older Window Managers this might not work so well.

Now, there may be instances where you want a slightly more nuanced approach. For instance, you might still want the user to be able to interact with system-level functions for moving a window, such as those provided by a specific Desktop Environment’s window management system, or even access window manipulation keyboard shortcuts. In this case, disabling the drag behavior becomes a better solution. While this appears that the user cannot move the window when dragging the title bar, it still technically is movable with external forces. The best way to do that is to reimplement the `mousePressEvent` and `mouseMoveEvent` and effectively ignore the events that would normally trigger the window to move. This is useful because we are not touching the operating system flags themselves. Here's how we would approach that:

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt
from PyQt5.QtGui import QMouseEvent
import sys


class PartiallyFixedWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowTitle("Partially Fixed Window")
        self.setGeometry(200, 200, 400, 300)
        self._is_dragging = False # To track whether a drag is in progress.

    def mousePressEvent(self, event: QMouseEvent):
        if event.button() == Qt.LeftButton: # Only track left mouse clicks
            self._is_dragging = True # The mouse has been pressed
            self._mouse_pos = event.globalPos()  # Capture the initial mouse pos
        super().mousePressEvent(event) # Call the original functionality

    def mouseMoveEvent(self, event: QMouseEvent):
        if self._is_dragging:
            delta = event.globalPos() - self._mouse_pos # calculate the difference in position
            # we move the window to its original position, by setting the delta to zero (no move)
            # set up so that every mouse movement moves the window back to where it was.
            self.move(self.pos().x(), self.pos().y())
            # we also update the mouse position.
            self._mouse_pos = event.globalPos() # track the change
        super().mouseMoveEvent(event) # Call the original functionality

    def mouseReleaseEvent(self, event: QMouseEvent):
        if self._is_dragging: # if the mouse was dragging, make it not drag.
           self._is_dragging = False
        super().mouseReleaseEvent(event) # Call the original functionality

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = PartiallyFixedWindow()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

In the above code, we implement `mousePressEvent`, `mouseMoveEvent`, and `mouseReleaseEvent`. This enables us to track when the user has clicked the title bar, and we save the position of the mouse. Then, in `mouseMoveEvent` we calculate the difference in mouse position from the last time the mouse was moved. We then move the window to the location that it was previously, thereby making it appear that we cannot move it. Note that, as before, this does not prevent the user from using other means to move the window. We use a class variable, `_is_dragging`, to track if the user had clicked and held the title bar. Finally, upon releasing the mouse, we set the `_is_dragging` to `False`.

Finally, there's the scenario where you want to be even *more* restrictive, perhaps preventing *all* user initiated movement. This means disabling not only the user interaction with the title bar, but also preventing system shortcuts. This usually involves disabling all movement window events using `eventFilter`. This approach is the most thorough in that it actually intercepts events instead of trying to overwrite window flags. In this case, we will use an `eventFilter` and essentially tell Qt to ignore move events.

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QWidget
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt, QObject, QEvent
import sys

class TrulyFixedWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowTitle("Truly Fixed Window")
        self.setGeometry(300, 300, 400, 300)
        self.installEventFilter(self) # install the filter


    def eventFilter(self, obj: QObject, event: QEvent) -> bool:
        if event.type() == QEvent.Move:
             return True # Filter this event
        return super().eventFilter(obj, event)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = TrulyFixedWindow()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

Here, the `eventFilter` intercepts the `QEvent.Move` event. By returning `True`, we effectively consume the event, and the `QMainWindow` does not move. The return of `True` stops any other event handler from working. Note that this is very aggressive, and should only be done if you really want the window to never move from the screen using the normal Qt functionalities.

For further reading, delve into "Advanced Qt Programming: Creating Great Software with C++ and Qt 5" by Mark Summerfield, particularly the sections concerning window management and event handling. The Qt documentation itself is, of course, invaluable: focus on the `QWidget::setWindowFlags`, `QWidget::move`, `QObject::eventFilter` and associated areas. Additionally, studying the source code of the Qt libraries in relation to window management can give you more in depth understanding of how these libraries and operating systems work together, although this is more in-depth. The first example is the quickest to implement, while the third example is the most secure and most complex solution.

In practice, I’ve found that the second approach using `mouseMoveEvent` provides a good balance between control and maintaining some level of compatibility with system-level window management. However, sometimes, you might have no choice but to use the more aggressive flag modifications or `eventFilter` approach, depending on your specific circumstances and security needs. Each method has its trade-offs, and knowing how to apply them correctly comes from experience. Hope this clarifies the issue.
