, let’s tackle this. I’ve definitely seen this type of "Heroku-not-seeing-my-rails-setup" scenario more times than I care to remember. It's one of those frustrating situations that often boils down to a few key configuration gotchas, and it's rarely a fault of Heroku itself. Let’s break down the typical culprits and how to diagnose them, based on past experiences pulling my hair out on similar deployments.

First off, let's clarify what we mean by “Heroku failing to detect the Rails configuration.” Typically, this surfaces as Heroku either not properly installing your gems, not running migrations, or failing to start your web server, leading to application errors during runtime or deployment failures. The issue usually lies in one of three core areas: missing dependencies, incorrectly structured application files, or configuration discrepancies between your local environment and Heroku’s.

**1. The Gemfile and Gemfile.lock Discrepancy:** This is the most frequent offender. Heroku relies heavily on your `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` to understand your application's required dependencies. It's crucial these files are consistent and up-to-date with your desired environment. I've spent countless hours debugging this on projects where developers added gems, but forgot to commit their `Gemfile.lock`. Heroku’s build system will often choke if the lock file doesn’t match the Gemfile.

* **Problem:** If the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` are not in sync, Heroku might try to install gem versions that are different from your local setup. This can lead to runtime errors, missing dependencies, or incompatible versions. Moreover, if certain necessary gems for deployment (like `pg` for PostgreSQL or specific web servers such as `puma`) are missing, Heroku won't build successfully.
* **Solution:** Ensure that after making *any* changes to the `Gemfile`, you always run `bundle install` locally *and* commit both the `Gemfile` and the newly updated `Gemfile.lock`. It’s a straightforward step but often missed, even by experienced developers.

Here's an example demonstrating proper dependency management (though you'd replace this with your actual gems):

```ruby
# Gemfile

source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '~> 7.0'
gem 'puma', '~> 5.6'
gem 'pg', '~> 1.4'
gem 'redis', '~> 4.8'
```
After modifying `Gemfile`, use the terminal to:
```bash
bundle install
git add Gemfile Gemfile.lock
git commit -m "Updated Gemfile and Gemfile.lock with new gems"
```

**2. Missing `.ruby-version` and Incorrect Ruby Version:** Heroku uses a buildpack system to execute deployments, and that buildpack (for ruby) requires a `.ruby-version` file to correctly install the Ruby version you intend to use. I encountered this when assisting a team migrating from an older version of Ruby. They'd set their Ruby version locally but omitted the `.ruby-version` file from the repository, leading to build failures on Heroku because it defaulted to a newer (and often incompatible) version.

* **Problem:** If you don't explicitly specify the Ruby version, Heroku might default to a different, possibly incompatible one, resulting in compilation errors, missing core libraries, or runtime exceptions.
* **Solution:** Create a `.ruby-version` file in the root of your repository and commit it, specifying the precise Ruby version you’re using. The version number should match exactly what you are using locally.

Here's an example of creating this file:
```bash
echo "3.1.2" > .ruby-version
git add .ruby-version
git commit -m "Added .ruby-version file"
```
This establishes that the Ruby version needed is 3.1.2.

**3. Environment Configuration Discrepancies:** Local environments are often different from cloud environments, and this can create problems. For example, Heroku uses environment variables for configuration, especially regarding database connections. I had to debug a complex issue for a client where they'd hardcoded the database connection information directly into the Rails configuration files. On Heroku, these connection strings come from environment variables, and the hardcoded values didn't work on their deployment.

* **Problem:** Using hardcoded configurations or assuming that local settings are valid in Heroku can lead to connection errors or incorrect behavior. Key database connection settings are usually derived from Heroku's specific environment variables rather than configuration files. Heroku uses `DATABASE_URL` to set the connection information for databases.
* **Solution:** In Rails applications, you should configure database connections via the `ENV['DATABASE_URL']`. Rails will properly parse this URL and configure the database connection accordingly. Similarly, environment variables for other service configurations (redis, for example) should be managed via Heroku's configuration settings, accessible in the Heroku dashboard or the command-line interface.

Here’s a code example of a `database.yml` file that uses an environment variable:
```yaml
# config/database.yml

default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  timeout: 5000

development:
  <<: *default
  database: myapp_development
  username: myuser
  password: mypassword
  host: localhost

test:
  <<: *default
  database: myapp_test
  username: myuser
  password: mypassword
  host: localhost

production:
  <<: *default
  url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
```

The production section obtains its database connection settings from the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`. Heroku will supply this value with the actual connection information when the application runs. The other environments can use values more appropriate for your local setup.

**Further Resources:**

To fully understand and avoid these issues in the future, I highly recommend studying some resources. First, explore the official Heroku documentation related to Ruby on Rails deployments. They have excellent material on buildpacks, environment configurations, and database settings. Specifically, focus on sections about `bundler`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `.ruby-version` files.

Secondly, read through "The Twelve-Factor App" methodology. It explains modern approaches for building robust web applications which, whilst not exclusively related to Ruby on Rails, can help you understand how to structure your application for cloud deployment, which strongly relies on environment variables and loosely coupled configurations.

Additionally, I’d suggest reviewing "Agile Web Development with Rails 7," by David Heinemeier Hansson. It is a more verbose resource on working with Rails, but will often have more in-depth information compared to most online tutorials and articles. Focusing on the deployment and configuration sections within the book can provide some further help.

In summary, when your Heroku deployment fails to recognize your Rails setup, it almost always boils down to configuration discrepancies. Focus on consistent dependency management, correct Ruby version specification, and adherence to the cloud environment configurations, especially in regard to database connections. With careful attention to these points, you'll likely resolve the "Heroku not seeing my Rails" problems and move on to more interesting challenges.
