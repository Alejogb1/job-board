Right then,  Disabling nested locale folder loading in Rails 7 isn't something that's immediately obvious, but it's a situation I've bumped into more than once, particularly in larger projects where we've tried to get a little too clever with folder structures. You see, while Rails' default behavior to recursively load all locale files within the `config/locales` directory is often convenient, it can quickly become problematic if you adopt a more sophisticated approach to your translation file organization. I’ve found that a flat, single-level structure, while seemingly basic, ultimately offers better maintainability and avoids some unexpected loading behavior when you're not paying close attention.

The root of the issue lies in Rails' `I18n.load_path` configuration. By default, this array is populated with paths that recursively include all files within the `config/locales` directory. If you've, for instance, established subdirectories for different functional areas or modules within your application, you might unintentionally load locale files that should be isolated or applied under specific circumstances. This can lead to naming collisions or unexpected overrides, and it's not a scenario you want to be debugging at 3 a.m.

To explicitly disable loading from these subdirectories, you need to selectively modify `I18n.load_path`. The key idea is to first clear the existing entries, then manually add only the desired locale file paths using glob patterns, usually at a single level only. This effectively bypasses the recursive search and gives you precise control over the locales included in your application's internationalization system.

Here’s how I've addressed this in the past, using code snippets to clarify the approach. Remember, this is not a 'one-size-fits-all', and you may need to adjust these based on the particulars of your folder setup:

**Example 1: Loading only files at the root level of config/locales**

```ruby
# config/initializers/i18n.rb

I18n.load_path.clear
I18n.load_path << Dir[Rails.root.join('config', 'locales', '*.{rb,yml}')]
```

In this instance, we start by clearing the `I18n.load_path` array. Subsequently, we explicitly add only files with `.rb` or `.yml` extensions located directly under `config/locales`. This avoids any subdirectory traversal, thus only picking up files at the top level of the locales folder, like `en.yml`, `fr.yml` or similar. If you had `config/locales/admin/en.yml`, that file would be ignored. This approach ensures all nested locales are ignored.

**Example 2: Loading specific files in the root, plus specific files in a subdirectory**

Let's say you do have one subdirectory, perhaps named 'public', that you want to be specifically included while avoiding all others:

```ruby
# config/initializers/i18n.rb

I18n.load_path.clear
I18n.load_path += Dir[Rails.root.join('config', 'locales', '*.{rb,yml}')]
I18n.load_path += Dir[Rails.root.join('config', 'locales', 'public', '*.{rb,yml}')]
```

Here, we initially load all top-level locale files, like in the previous example. However, we also explicitly add locale files from within the `/public` subdirectory. All other subdirectories in `config/locales` would still be ignored and not loaded by the application. This allows for a controlled mix of flat and nested files, but without the full recursive search.

**Example 3: Loading from multiple specified folders**

Suppose you are working in a larger application with locales distributed amongst several top-level directories, perhaps for different modules, and you do not want the full recursive loading behavior:

```ruby
# config/initializers/i18n.rb

I18n.load_path.clear
['admin', 'marketing', 'public'].each do |dir|
  I18n.load_path += Dir[Rails.root.join('config', 'locales', dir, '*.{rb,yml}')]
end
```

In this case, we iterate over an array of subdirectory names (`admin`, `marketing`, `public`). During each iteration, we add locale files from the specific subdirectory only, without loading any additional subdirectories contained within these directories. This again demonstrates control over which parts of the file structure are loaded, and avoids accidental loading of files in subdirectories, which is an essential consideration in any non-trivial application.

These examples illustrate the core principle: explicitly control `I18n.load_path` to dictate which files are loaded. This offers a significant improvement over the default behavior in scenarios where the locale file structure deviates from simple, flat folders.

For deeper understanding on how i18n works in ruby, and more specifically in Rails, I recommend these sources:

1.  **The official Ruby on Rails documentation:** The Rails guides section on Internationalization is a foundational resource. You’ll find detailed explanations of how the `I18n` module functions, the mechanics of locale loading, and configuration options available. This is often the best place to start because it provides the definitive explanation on Rails features.
2.  **"Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide" by Dave Thomas, Chad Fowler, and Andy Hunt:** This book, although focused on Ruby itself, offers a substantial and detailed explanation of how i18n is handled at the core Ruby level, and a useful look at the internal implementation of internationalization. Understanding the underlying principles can give you more freedom when modifying these types of configurations.
3.  **"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler:** While not directly related to i18n, the principles and practices outlined in this book are invaluable when modifying legacy Rails apps or refactoring the folder structures used for locale files. Understanding good software design practices can greatly influence how you structure these directories, and help you to make informed decisions about what to load, and why.

In my experience, carefully curating `I18n.load_path` is a crucial practice when you outgrow basic localization setups. Avoiding the pitfalls of default recursive loading can save considerable time and frustration down the road, while simultaneously allowing you to create more maintainable applications. Remember, control and clarity are key when dealing with something as fundamental as your application's i18n setup. It's not just about getting things to work, it's about making sure they're easy to maintain and understand for the entire team.
