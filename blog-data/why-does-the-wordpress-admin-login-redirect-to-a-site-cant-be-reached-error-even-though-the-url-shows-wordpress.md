Let's dive right in, shall we? I've seen this particular head-scratcher pop up more times than I care to recall. The situation, where your wordpress admin login page directs you to a “site can’t be reached” error, while the browser url bar clearly shows your intended wordpress path (e.g., `/wp-admin`, `/wp-login.php`), usually points towards a disconnect between what the browser expects and what the server actually provides. It's seldom a simple case of a broken link, but more often a subtle misalignment of several moving parts. Think of it like an orchestra where one instrument is slightly out of tune, causing the whole piece to fall apart.

From my experience, this issue commonly stems from several interconnected root causes which we can systematically explore. The first, and quite possibly the most frequent culprit, is an issue with the wordpress site url and home url settings. These values are stored directly in the `wp_options` table within the wordpress database. If these don't accurately reflect the intended domain name or protocol (http vs https), then you're essentially telling wordpress to look for itself in the wrong place. Let's say, for instance, you had initially set up wordpress using an ip address but subsequently switched to a domain name without updating these settings. When wordpress attempts to redirect you after a login attempt, it will use the outdated ip address, rendering the site inaccessible from the domain.

Another frequent suspect is the ubiquitous `.htaccess` file, if you're using an apache server. This file, residing in the root directory of your wordpress install, controls url rewriting and redirects. A misconfigured `.htaccess` file can incorrectly route your login request to a non-existent resource or loop it indefinitely, triggering the browser's “site can't be reached” error. Imagine it as a traffic controller directing cars to a dead-end. This can happen if a rewrite rule, intended for pretty permalinks, inadvertently affects the `/wp-login.php` route or is written in a way that conflicts with wordpress' default routing logic.

Then we have plugin conflicts, or perhaps issues with caching mechanisms, server configurations, or even database errors. Plugins sometimes implement their own routing rules or alter wordpress’ core functionality in such a way that login attempts become muddled, leading to this redirection issue. Cache plugins, especially those used with object caching, can introduce their own layer of complexity if not properly configured or if the cache is corrupted. Server configuration missteps, such as incorrect dns settings, can lead to domain name resolution failures at certain stages of the login process. Database issues, less frequent, but still possible, like the database being temporarily unavailable or corrupted, can also lead to errors when wordpress tries to authenticate a login.

Let’s illustrate this with code examples. First, addressing the `siteurl` and `homeurl` settings. Instead of directly manipulating the database, you can (and should) override these within your `wp-config.php` file. This provides a more reliable and maintainable solution, as these configurations will take precedence over what's stored in the database.

```php
// wp-config.php

define('WP_HOME','https://yourdomain.com');
define('WP_SITEURL','https://yourdomain.com');
```

This code snippet directly sets the `WP_HOME` and `WP_SITEURL` constants, effectively overriding any erroneous values present within the database. Remember to replace `https://yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name. If you are using https and the site is not loading correctly after this change, there may be another underlying issue with your ssl certificate configuration which you'll need to investigate.

Next, let's look at a problematic `.htaccess` file. A common misconfiguration I've observed is a set of rewrite rules that unintentionally interferes with the wordpress login process. Here's an example of something you'd *want* to avoid:

```apache
# .htaccess (Problematic Example)

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]

RewriteRule ^wp-login.php$ / [L,R=301]
</IfModule>

```

The last `RewriteRule` in the above example, `RewriteRule ^wp-login.php$ / [L,R=301]`, specifically redirects any requests to `/wp-login.php` directly to the root of the site, causing a redirect loop, and subsequent “site can't be reached” error in the user’s browser. Removing this line or commenting it out (by prepending it with a `#`) would resolve the conflict. The correct set of rules for basic wordpress functionality should not interfere with the login sequence and would look more like this:

```apache
# .htaccess (Correct Example)

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>

```

Finally, a quick database check can be done via a mysql client or through phpmyadmin to ensure the options table contains the correct `siteurl` and `homeurl` values. If you find they don't match what you've set in `wp-config.php`, that's not necessarily an issue as the `wp-config.php` override takes precedence, but it’s worth investigating to rule out persistent problems.

These three examples highlight different points of potential failure. Troubleshooting this often involves a methodical process of eliminating possibilities, starting with the most common issues. In my experience, I usually check the `wp-config.php` overrides and the `.htaccess` file first. Then I would move on to plugin deactivation and gradually reactivating them while checking the admin login after each one to find a problematic plugin. After that I'll check the server logs for more error information if necessary.

For deeper study into these areas, I’d highly recommend exploring the official WordPress codex, particularly the sections dealing with ‘site url’, ‘home url’, and rewriting rules in `.htaccess`. Beyond that, “High Performance Web Sites” by Steve Souders offers fundamental information on web performance optimization, which also helps in understanding caching and the implications of misconfigured settings. For a comprehensive understanding of Apache web server configuration, consider “Apache: The Definitive Guide” by Ben Laurie and Peter Laurie. These books, coupled with the official wordpress documentation, provide a complete understanding of the systems at work, enabling a more informed and systematic approach to solving this kind of issue. These are foundational resources that have been instrumental throughout my career, and I hope you find them equally helpful.
