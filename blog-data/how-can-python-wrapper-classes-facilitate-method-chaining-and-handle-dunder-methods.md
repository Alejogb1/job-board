Okay, let’s explore that. It’s a good question, and one I’ve personally tackled quite a few times in various projects, especially when dealing with complex data transformations or external library interactions. The crux of your inquiry lies in leveraging Python’s wrapper class paradigm to not only enable fluent method chaining but also elegantly manage those sometimes-tricky dunder methods. Let's break this down, focusing on practical implementation and avoiding too much theoretical jargon.

The essence of a wrapper class, as we're discussing it, is to encapsulate another object—be it a simple data structure, an external API client, or any other complex component. This encapsulation isn’t merely about containment; it's about providing a controlled and often enhanced interface. When we talk about method chaining, we're talking about the ability to string together method calls on an object, one after the other, reading left-to-right, without needing to explicitly store intermediate results. This naturally promotes a more readable and often expressive coding style.

The default approach often involves making each method return the `self` instance after performing its operation, which then allows the next method in the chain to be invoked on the same instance. Consider this as our base case. Now, while this approach works, it gets messy when you’re dealing with class initialization, and other methods in the original class may not have been written to support that model (i.e. if its methods return results different than self). That is where the power of the wrapper really shines.

Here's an example illustrating a basic wrapper concept, focusing on method chaining:

```python
class StringWrapper:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = str(value)

    def append(self, suffix):
        self._value += str(suffix)
        return self

    def prepend(self, prefix):
        self._value = str(prefix) + self._value
        return self

    def uppercase(self):
       self._value = self._value.upper()
       return self

    def get_value(self):
        return self._value


#example use
string_manipulator = StringWrapper("hello").append(" world").prepend("greeting: ").uppercase()
print(string_manipulator.get_value())
```

In this trivial example, `StringWrapper` holds a string internally and methods like `append`, `prepend` and `uppercase` modify this internal value, returning `self`. This, as I previously mentioned, creates the chainable API, allowing us to fluently compose transformations.

Now, about those dunder methods. These special methods—named with double underscores on each side (e.g. `__add__`, `__len__`, `__getitem__`)—provide the plumbing for much of Python’s magic, such as operator overloading or custom indexing behavior. When you wrap a class, you often need to expose some of these dunder methods to allow your wrapper to behave predictably when used in expressions or with core language constructs.

Let’s look at a scenario where you are dealing with a third-party library that returns data structures that you can’t directly modify and it does not support chaining, but you want to use them fluently in a pipeline. For instance, lets say you are using a library that gives a simple dictionary but not class, so it will be hard to extend.
Here’s an example of a `DataWrapper` that shows how to handle dunder methods like `__getitem__` and `__len__`:

```python
class DataWrapper:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self._data = data

    def get(self, key, default=None):
        return self._data.get(key, default)

    def set(self, key, value):
        self._data[key] = value
        return self

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        return self._data[key]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._data)

    def apply_function(self, func):
        self._data = func(self._data)
        return self

# Example Usage
data_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

wrapped_data = DataWrapper(data_dict).set("d",4).apply_function(lambda x: {k: v * 2 for k,v in x.items()})
print(wrapped_data['a'])
print(len(wrapped_data))


```

In this example, `DataWrapper` encapsulates a dictionary. The `__getitem__` implementation allows you to access elements via indexing, as with a standard dictionary `wrapped_data['a']` and the `__len__` method allows you to get the length of the wrapped dictionary, `len(wrapped_data)`. Also, the `set` and `apply_function` methods provide a way to manipulate the underlying data using method chaining.

It is important to note that not all dunder methods need to be implemented. You should expose the ones required for the intended usage of your wrapper, and this will depend heavily on the specifics of the object you are wrapping and how you need to use the wrapped object.

Now, let's look at a more advanced example. Suppose you're integrating with an external API, and this API returns json responses that you want to process through a chain. This can easily be expanded to different data formats and sources. Here’s an example:

```python
import json

class APIResponseWrapper:
    def __init__(self, response_data):
        try:
            self._data = json.loads(response_data)
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            self._data = response_data #if not a json string then use as a default value

    def extract_field(self, field):
        if isinstance(self._data, dict) and field in self._data:
          self._data = self._data[field]
        return self

    def filter(self, func):
        if isinstance(self._data, list):
            self._data = list(filter(func, self._data))
        return self

    def map(self, func):
        if isinstance(self._data, list):
            self._data = list(map(func, self._data))
        return self

    def get_value(self):
        return self._data

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self._data)

# Hypothetical API response
api_response = '{"items": [{"id": 1, "name": "apple", "price": 1.0}, {"id": 2, "name": "banana", "price": 0.5}, {"id": 3, "name": "cherry", "price": 2.0}]}'
response_processor = APIResponseWrapper(api_response)

# Example of method chaining: extract items, filter by price greater than 0.7, extract names
processed_data = response_processor.extract_field("items").filter(lambda x: x["price"] > 0.7).map(lambda x: x["name"]).get_value()
print(processed_data)

#Example with non JSON data to show the use of a default value
api_response_fail = "This is not a json string"
response_fail_process = APIResponseWrapper(api_response_fail)
print(response_fail_process)
```

In this example, `APIResponseWrapper` parses a json string. It then exposes method chain capabilities using `extract_field`, which extracts a specific field based on dictionary key and returns `self`. The `filter` and `map` methods provide transformations on a list, if the underlying data is a list, which is often the case with APIs. Finally, `get_value` returns the final transformed value and `__str__` implements a method to get the string representation of the object itself.

When working with wrappers, you should pay particular attention to the following: immutability versus mutability (which the above examples demonstrates), handling edge cases (like when a key is not present in the wrapped object), and making sure you’re actually adding value. It is essential that the wrapper provides a higher level of abstraction that is more practical than working with the underlying data directly.

For further reading and a deeper dive into related concepts, I strongly recommend reviewing "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho, particularly the sections on operator overloading and object models. Additionally, exploring design patterns, such as the Decorator pattern in "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, et al. , can give you a stronger understanding of the motivations and use cases for such wrapping techniques. Also, for a broader understanding of general software design, "Code Complete" by Steve McConnell should also be on the list.

In summary, Python wrapper classes offer a powerful mechanism for creating clean, chainable APIs while also controlling and exposing the necessary functionality of wrapped objects, including dunder methods. They provide an elegant way to improve code readability and maintainability, which is often worth the effort. The key is to implement them with careful thought and a clear understanding of the underlying requirements.
