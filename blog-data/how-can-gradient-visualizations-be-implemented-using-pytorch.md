Let's see, gradient visualizations in PyTorch, ah yes, I've spent a fair amount of time on those, specifically debugging some finicky image classification models a few years back. They can be incredibly useful, going beyond just seeing training loss numbers and actually getting a feel for what parts of your input the network is focusing on. I think the common starting point many take, and where the real power lies, is understanding backpropagation.

In essence, we’re leveraging the fact that PyTorch automatically computes gradients for us. During training, these gradients are used to update model weights. However, we can also leverage them to see how the network’s output changes with respect to the input. This provides us with a ‘sensitivity’ map, which we can then visualize.

The simplest approach involves directly backpropagating from the output to the input. Consider a standard image classification task. We can feed an image through our network, calculate the loss (though this isn't always necessary for visualization, sometimes just the raw output is sufficient), and then call `.backward()` to compute the gradients. Critically, we're not trying to update the network's weights here; we're interested in the gradients with respect to the input *image*.

Here’s the basic premise in code:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Assuming a pretrained ResNet-18
model = torch.hub.load('pytorch/vision:v0.10.0', 'resnet18', pretrained=True)
model.eval()

def visualize_gradients_direct(image_path, model):
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB')
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize(256),
        transforms.CenterCrop(224),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ])
    input_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)
    input_tensor.requires_grad_(True)

    output = model(input_tensor)
    target_class = torch.argmax(output, dim=1)  # Get the predicted class, could also be a specific class of interest

    output[0, target_class].backward()
    gradients = input_tensor.grad.detach().squeeze(0).cpu().numpy()

    # post-processing gradient visualization
    gradients = np.transpose(gradients, (1, 2, 0))
    gradients = np.abs(gradients) # use abs values to see feature importanace
    gradients_max = np.max(gradients)
    if gradients_max > 0: #avoid division by 0 error
        gradients = gradients/gradients_max

    plt.imshow(gradients)
    plt.title('Direct Gradients')
    plt.show()

visualize_gradients_direct('your_image.jpg', model)
```

In this example, we’re loading a pre-trained ResNet-18 (you could replace this with your own model). We make sure the input tensor has `requires_grad=True` set before passing it through the model. After computing the output, we perform backpropagation from the predicted class score down to the input, and then we detach the gradients, move them to the cpu and process them for visualization. The absolute value helps highlight regions of importance and normalizing between 0 and 1 assists in proper display.

Now, the direct gradient method often yields noisy results. It sometimes picks up on high-frequency noise or even non-salient details. A powerful refinement is the ‘guided backpropagation’ technique, which introduces some cleverness into the backprop process. In guided backpropagation, we only backpropagate positive gradients through relu layers, effectively masking the effect of irrelevant parts of the image in the gradients.

Here’s an implementation of that:

```python
class GuidedBackprop():
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.gradients = None
        self.handles = []

        def backward_hook(module, grad_in, grad_out):
            self.gradients = grad_in[0]
            return tuple(torch.clamp(grad, 0.0) for grad in grad_in) #clamp relu grads

        for module in self.model.modules():
          if isinstance(module, nn.ReLU):
                self.handles.append(module.register_backward_hook(backward_hook))


    def __call__(self, image_tensor, target_class):
        image_tensor.requires_grad_(True)
        output = self.model(image_tensor)
        output[0, target_class].backward()
        gradients = image_tensor.grad.detach().squeeze(0).cpu().numpy()
        for handle in self.handles:
          handle.remove()

        return gradients

def visualize_guided_backprop(image_path, model):
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB')
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize(256),
        transforms.CenterCrop(224),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ])
    input_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)
    guided_bp = GuidedBackprop(model)
    gradients = guided_bp(input_tensor, torch.argmax(model(input_tensor), dim=1))


    #post process gradients
    gradients = np.transpose(gradients, (1, 2, 0))
    gradients = np.abs(gradients)
    gradients_max = np.max(gradients)
    if gradients_max > 0:
        gradients = gradients/gradients_max

    plt.imshow(gradients)
    plt.title('Guided Backpropagation')
    plt.show()


visualize_guided_backprop('your_image.jpg', model)
```

Here, we implement a `GuidedBackprop` class that registers a backward hook with all ReLU layers in the model. This hook modifies the backward pass by clamping negative gradient values to zero. This leads to a more refined visualization, often highlighting object boundaries more effectively. Note, the hook must be cleaned up to avoid issues with gradient calculations on other model uses.

Finally, another technique that can be incredibly insightful, though a bit different from backpropagation is class activation mapping (CAM). This method specifically looks at the activations of convolutional layers and identifies which spatial regions are important for a given classification. It works best with models that have a global average pooling (GAP) layer, as the weights connected to that layer provide the core information for creating the CAM.

Below, I am implementing a simple version, assuming the model has the structure that resnet models generally have:

```python
def visualize_cam(image_path, model):

    image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB')
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize(256),
        transforms.CenterCrop(224),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ])
    input_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)

    features = model.layer4(model.layer3(model.layer2(model.layer1(model.conv1(model.bn1(model.relu(input_tensor)))))))
    output = model.avgpool(features)
    output = output.flatten(1)
    output = model.fc(output)
    target_class = torch.argmax(output, dim=1)

    weights = model.fc.weight.detach().cpu().numpy()
    cam = np.dot(weights[target_class.item()], features.detach().squeeze(0).cpu().numpy().reshape(weights.shape[1], -1))
    cam = cam.reshape(features.shape[2],features.shape[3])

    # post processing of the CAM
    cam = np.maximum(cam, 0)
    cam = (cam - np.min(cam)) / (np.max(cam) - np.min(cam))
    cam = cv2.resize(cam, (224, 224))

    image = np.array(image)
    cam_heatmap = cv2.applyColorMap(np.uint8(255 * cam), cv2.COLORMAP_JET)
    cam_output = cv2.addWeighted(image, 0.5, cam_heatmap, 0.5, 0)

    plt.imshow(cam_output)
    plt.title('Class Activation Map')
    plt.show()

visualize_cam('your_image.jpg', model)
```

Here, we're taking advantage of the feature maps outputted by the last convolutional block and the final classification layer to generate the class activation maps. Note the use of cv2 to resize and display the heatmaps, and that this works based on an assumption of the structure of our model.

For deeper dives into these techniques and their theoretical underpinnings, I would highly recommend checking out the 'Deep Learning' book by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. This provides a solid mathematical foundation for backpropagation. Also, "Explainable AI: Interpreting, Explaining and Visualizing Deep Learning" by Christoph Molnar is an excellent resource specifically focused on these kind of visualization techniques. Furthermore, the original research papers for guided backpropagation and CAM (look for papers by Springenberg et al. on guided backprop and Zhou et al. on CAM) would provide more insight into the methods themselves. Experimentation is key here, so definitely try these on your own models.

In my experience, a combination of these approaches generally gives a good holistic view of what a model is learning and what parts of the input it considers important, assisting significantly in the debugging, and interpretability of deep learning models.
