Alright, let's tackle this one. The question of why TensorFlow graph variables aren't inherently 'frozen,' as one might expect from, say, a static computational graph, comes up more often than one would think, especially when you're moving beyond basic model training into more nuanced deployments or optimizations. In my experience, I recall a project a few years back where we were wrestling (, *analyzing*) the intricacies of model serialization for a mobile application, and this very issue kept popping up. We were attempting to directly load a frozen protobuf model into a lightweight tflite interpreter, only to find that our variable values weren’t baked in as we anticipated, leading to a lot of head-scratching.

The key thing to understand here is that the TensorFlow graph itself is a *description* of the computations you want to perform. It’s essentially a blueprint. Variables, on the other hand, are the containers holding the mutable data that changes as the model learns. When we talk about "freezing," we’re specifically referring to the process of converting these variable values into constant values directly within the graph itself, effectively removing the mutable variable node entirely. This isn't the default behaviour because TensorFlow, by design, prioritizes flexibility and modularity during the training and evaluation phases. Variables being mutable allows for crucial aspects of machine learning like iterative weight updates during backpropagation. If the graph was automatically frozen, you’d effectively be stuck with a pre-trained model, and further adjustments or fine-tuning would be impossible.

To put it another way, envision a building blueprint (the TensorFlow graph) and the actual physical materials (the variable values). The blueprint specifies where the walls and doors are, but until the building is built, the wall materials exist outside the plan. During construction (training), these materials are continually adjusted and refined. Only when you want a static finished building (deployed model), do you fix the materials in place according to the final design. TensorFlow doesn’t assume the materials are permanent until explicitly told to make them so, and hence, variables are mutable by default.

Let's illustrate this with a few code examples. We'll start with a very simple model definition in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# define a simple variable
my_variable = tf.Variable(initial_value=1.0, name="my_variable")

# define a simple operation that uses the variable
result = my_variable * 2

# initialise all variables
init = tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init)
    print("Initial value:", sess.run(my_variable)) # Prints the initial value: 1.0
    print("Result:", sess.run(result)) # Prints result of 1.0 * 2: 2.0

    my_variable.assign(3.0) # explicitly modify the variable
    print("Modified value:", sess.run(my_variable)) # Prints the modified value: 3.0
    print("Result:", sess.run(result)) # Prints result of 3.0 * 2: 6.0

```

This first snippet shows how variable values are explicitly mutable. The graph remains the same, but the value inside `my_variable` can be altered, and all subsequent operations which use that variable are recomputed based on the new value. Notice how the result changes when `my_variable` is altered. If variables were frozen at the beginning, this dynamic recomputation wouldn’t be possible, as we'd be stuck with the initial value of `1.0`.

Now, consider a slightly more involved scenario where we want to use this basic setup in a TensorFlow graph, and we'd like to convert this operation using a custom function (this is a very simplistic example, but represents a general idea):

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
def my_function(input_tensor, multiplier):
    var = tf.Variable(initial_value=multiplier, name="my_multiplier")
    result = input_tensor * var
    return result, var

#create a placeholder
input_placeholder = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32)

#call the function
output, multiplier_var = my_function(input_placeholder, 2.0)

#initialize all variables
init = tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init)
    input_value = np.array(4.0, dtype=np.float32)
    result, multiplier_val = sess.run([output, multiplier_var], feed_dict={input_placeholder: input_value})

    print(f"Result: {result}") # Prints Result: 8.0
    print(f"Multiplier Variable Value: {multiplier_val}") #Prints Multiplier Variable Value: 2.0

    multiplier_var.assign(5.0) #modify the variable
    result, multiplier_val = sess.run([output, multiplier_var], feed_dict={input_placeholder: input_value})
    print(f"Result after variable modification: {result}") # Prints Result after variable modification: 20.0
    print(f"Modified Multiplier Variable Value: {multiplier_val}")#Prints Modified Multiplier Variable Value: 5.0
```

Again, you can see that `multiplier_var` is mutable and is changing and affecting the output accordingly. The variable is still part of the graph but is not constant. This is another demonstration of how mutable variables are handled within the TensorFlow graph.

Finally, let's explicitly demonstrate how to *freeze* a graph, a process that would resolve our initial hypothetical serialization issue. It’s important to note that the process of freezing is not an automatic behaviour; rather, a explicit action by the user to modify the graph. We are going to use the same architecture as before.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.framework import graph_util
import numpy as np

def my_function(input_tensor, multiplier):
    var = tf.Variable(initial_value=multiplier, name="my_multiplier")
    result = input_tensor * var
    return result, var

input_placeholder = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, name="input_placeholder")
output, _ = my_function(input_placeholder, 2.0)


with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    init = tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()
    sess.run(init)
    input_value = np.array(4.0, dtype=np.float32)
    print("Initial output:", sess.run(output, feed_dict={input_placeholder: input_value}))


    output_node_names = [output.name.split(':')[0]]
    graph_def = sess.graph.as_graph_def()
    frozen_graph_def = graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(
        sess,
        graph_def,
        output_node_names,
    )

# print frozen graph details
print(f"Frozen Graph: {frozen_graph_def}")

# loading a frozen graph
with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default() as graph_frozen:
    tf.import_graph_def(frozen_graph_def, name="")
    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph_frozen) as sess_frozen:
        input_tensor = graph_frozen.get_tensor_by_name("input_placeholder:0")
        output_tensor = graph_frozen.get_tensor_by_name(output_node_names[0]+':0')
        frozen_result = sess_frozen.run(output_tensor, feed_dict={input_tensor: input_value})
        print("Frozen graph result:", frozen_result)

```

In this last example, the `convert_variables_to_constants` function explicitly replaces the `my_multiplier` variable with a constant value in the graph’s protobuf representation. This frozen graph can now be saved to disk and loaded later without any need for variable initializations. The value of `my_multiplier` is baked in. If you attempt to modify the constant, an error will be raised. This clearly illustrates how, and why, you would want to freeze the graph, but how this is something we explicitly enable and not default behavior.

For further reading on these concepts, I'd highly recommend checking out the official TensorFlow documentation for graph manipulation, specifically focusing on the sections about variable handling and graph transformations. Also, "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet, while not strictly about graph freezing, offers an excellent overview of the core concepts of TensorFlow that will enhance your understanding. Additionally, looking into research papers focusing on deployment optimizations for machine learning models, particularly those related to mobile devices, will provide a practical understanding of why and when graph freezing is necessary. The process of optimization and compression will invariably lead you to these types of considerations.

In summary, the reason that TensorFlow variables aren’t automatically frozen is to provide the dynamism needed during training and evaluation. Freezing is an *explicit* transformation, converting mutable variables into immutable constants within the graph. The decision when to freeze ultimately depends on your use case; it’s typically done only after training when you intend to deploy a static model for inference. It’s a crucial step in model deployment and optimization, but it is *not* the default operational mode.
