Hey, AI humor and memes are definitely a thing! It's actually a really interesting space, where you can see how AI is learning to understand and even create jokes.  One way AI can do this is by analyzing tons of data, like memes and jokes, to find patterns and relationships.  For example, take a look at this code snippet:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

# Download stopwords if you haven't already
nltk.download('stopwords')

def analyze_meme(meme_text):
  tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(meme_text)
  stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
  filtered_tokens = [w for w in tokens if w not in stop_words]
  # Further analysis of filtered tokens can be done here
  return filtered_tokens
```

This code uses natural language processing (NLP) to break down a meme's text into words and analyze their meaning.  You can even train AI models to generate humorous captions for memes by feeding them a ton of examples.  The possibilities are pretty endless with AI humor and memes - it's like a whole new world of laughs!
