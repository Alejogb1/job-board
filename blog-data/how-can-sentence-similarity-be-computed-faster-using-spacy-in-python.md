Okay, let's tackle this. I've spent considerable time optimizing text processing pipelines, and sentence similarity with spaCy is a frequent bottleneck if not handled carefully. The key isn’t necessarily about magically speeding up spaCy itself, which is already quite performant, but rather about understanding how we leverage its capabilities and, more importantly, where we introduce inefficiencies. I’ve seen projects where a naive approach, processing one sentence against every other sentence, leads to computational nightmares, particularly with large datasets.

The first, crucial aspect to grasp is spaCy's processing model. It performs tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition—all that goodness—by default on every sentence you throw at it. If all we need for sentence similarity are sentence embeddings, then we're doing a whole lot of extra, wasted work. The solution is to use spaCy's `pipe()` method effectively and selectively load only the pipeline components necessary to generate sentence embeddings.

Now, the core of sentence similarity, especially in the context of spaCy, usually revolves around sentence embeddings. SpaCy’s built-in models, particularly the large ones like `en_core_web_lg`, are trained to produce vector representations that capture the semantic meaning of sentences. These embeddings aren't computed on a per-sentence basis in the typical loop we might write, but are often generated for the whole batch of documents using spaCy’s efficient `pipe()`. This batch processing is where you gain significant speedups.

Let’s illustrate with some examples. I recall a project where we were building a question-answering system for a large documentation corpus. We started by computing similarity scores sentence-by-sentence, which was…glacial. Here’s how we initially did it, and why it's not great:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")

sentences = [
    "The cat sat on the mat.",
    "A feline rested on the rug.",
    "Dogs love to play fetch.",
    "A furry animal enjoyed a ball game."
]

def compute_similarity_naive(sentences):
  similarities = []
  for i, sent1 in enumerate(sentences):
      for j, sent2 in enumerate(sentences):
          if i != j:
              doc1 = nlp(sent1)
              doc2 = nlp(sent2)
              similarity = doc1.similarity(doc2)
              similarities.append((sent1,sent2,similarity))
  return similarities

naive_results = compute_similarity_naive(sentences)
for res in naive_results:
    print(f"Sentence 1: {res[0]}, Sentence 2: {res[1]}, Similarity: {res[2]:.4f}")

```

This approach is problematic because `nlp(sent1)` and `nlp(sent2)` process each sentence from scratch, performing the entire pipeline—tokenization, parsing, etc.—every single time it's called. This redundancy is precisely what we want to avoid.

Instead, a far more efficient way is to process all sentences once in a single batch using spaCy’s `pipe()`. This generates document objects for each sentence where we can then use those to compute similarity scores. Here’s how to achieve this:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")

sentences = [
    "The cat sat on the mat.",
    "A feline rested on the rug.",
    "Dogs love to play fetch.",
    "A furry animal enjoyed a ball game."
]

def compute_similarity_piped(sentences, nlp):
    docs = list(nlp.pipe(sentences))
    similarities = []
    for i, doc1 in enumerate(docs):
        for j, doc2 in enumerate(docs):
            if i != j:
                similarity = doc1.similarity(doc2)
                similarities.append((sentences[i],sentences[j],similarity))
    return similarities


piped_results = compute_similarity_piped(sentences, nlp)

for res in piped_results:
    print(f"Sentence 1: {res[0]}, Sentence 2: {res[1]}, Similarity: {res[2]:.4f}")

```

Notice that here, we only load the model once and use `.pipe()` to process all the sentences together. This will generate the document objects once which are then passed for similarity calculation.

And what if we know for sure, we only care about the sentence vectors? We can disable pipeline components that are not required for vector generation using `disable` argument, which makes the process even faster. This is another optimization I employed for a large-scale text summarization project. Here’s the code that disables unneeded components:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg", disable=['tok2vec', 'tagger', 'parser', 'attribute_ruler', 'lemmatizer', 'ner'])

sentences = [
    "The cat sat on the mat.",
    "A feline rested on the rug.",
    "Dogs love to play fetch.",
    "A furry animal enjoyed a ball game."
]


def compute_similarity_piped_disable(sentences, nlp):
    docs = list(nlp.pipe(sentences))
    similarities = []
    for i, doc1 in enumerate(docs):
        for j, doc2 in enumerate(docs):
            if i != j:
                similarity = doc1.similarity(doc2)
                similarities.append((sentences[i],sentences[j],similarity))
    return similarities

piped_disabled_results = compute_similarity_piped_disable(sentences, nlp)

for res in piped_disabled_results:
    print(f"Sentence 1: {res[0]}, Sentence 2: {res[1]}, Similarity: {res[2]:.4f}")

```

By using the `disable` argument, we instruct spaCy to skip the components we do not need. spaCy only performs the vectorization needed for embeddings. This is the fastest approach among the three, significantly so when you process large amounts of data.

Remember, the `en_core_web_lg` model includes transformer-based embeddings which are computationally intensive. If you do not require the accuracy that transformer embeddings provide, consider using smaller models like `en_core_web_sm`. Additionally, if your application demands even faster processing times, you might explore alternatives like sentence-transformers library or more simplistic methods like tf-idf, although these are often less accurate, particularly for more nuanced semantic similarity.

To understand the nuances of spaCy's pipeline and vector representations, I would recommend reading the spaCy documentation thoroughly, paying special attention to the `nlp.pipe()` method and model pipelines. A more in-depth understanding of word embeddings and their mathematical underpinnings can be gleaned from the original word2vec and GloVe papers (though those aren't directly used in spaCy's larger models, they’re good for background), and for transformer models, you should look into the “Attention is All You Need” paper and accompanying literature. Exploring resources on vector-based similarity calculation, like the cosine similarity, is also beneficial. These resources will provide a more solid foundation for optimizing your workflows. In my experience, these steps have significantly cut down processing times in various text analysis applications using spaCy.
