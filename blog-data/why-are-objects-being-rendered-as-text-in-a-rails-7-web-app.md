Alright, let’s get into this. I remember a particularly frustrating project back in '21, a fairly complex e-commerce platform migrating to rails 7. We were dealing with precisely this issue: seemingly random objects, models mostly, were showing up as their string representations instead of the intended HTML elements within the view. It was perplexing because the templates appeared correct at first glance, and there weren't any explicit `to_s` calls going on.

The issue, as is often the case with these types of debugging adventures, wasn't in the obvious places. It boils down to how Rails (or Ruby, more accurately) handles implicit conversions and the way it interprets data when passed into view rendering contexts. When Rails expects a string to be present, but instead receives something that isn't a plain string, it often falls back to the object's `to_s` representation, which by default is typically something like `" <#ModelName:0x000000000000> "` . That's precisely the textual output you were seeing, rather than the user-facing display you expected.

The core problem stems from a misunderstanding or misconfiguration of one or more of these elements: data type coercion, implicit string conversions, and incorrect template logic. Let’s explore these individually.

First, data type coercion. Ruby's type system is relatively dynamic, but it doesn’t mean we can treat everything as a string. When you attempt to render a non-string object directly in an ERB or other template, Rails will, in many situations, attempt to convert it to a string. If no explicit coercion logic exists, the default `to_s` method of the object will be called. This isn't always the output we intend, especially for complex objects.

Secondly, there's the implicit string conversion occurring in template engines. When you pass a variable into an ERB template (or any other templating engine Rails uses), it expects that variable, if it's to appear as plain text in the rendered output, to be a string type. If it's not, as previously mentioned, Ruby and Rails attempt a string conversion. It can be easy to overlook how a variable is being used when templates grow in complexity.

Third, we need to consider incorrect template logic or method usage in our views. This often takes the form of passing data to helpers or partials without properly preparing the data for consumption by those methods or partials. For example, you might assume a helper expects an ID but instead, you're passing the entire model object directly.

Let me give a few concrete code examples that illustrate these points and how we can rectify them.

**Example 1: Data Type Coercion Issue**

Imagine you have a `Product` model with a method `formatted_price` intended to produce a price string and use it in your template. However, you’re passing the model itself instead.

```ruby
# app/models/product.rb
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  def formatted_price
    "$#{price.to_f}"
  end
end

# app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def show
     @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  end
end

# app/views/products/show.html.erb (Incorrect Usage)
<p>Product Price: <%= @product %></p>

```

Here, `@product` is a `Product` object. Because of the way ERB templates work, `<%= @product %>` results in calling `@product.to_s` which, as it’s not overridden, provides a useless textual description. The correct way would be to invoke the formatted price as follows.

```erb
# app/views/products/show.html.erb (Correct Usage)
<p>Product Price: <%= @product.formatted_price %></p>
```
This will correctly print the formatted price using the defined `formatted_price` method.

**Example 2: Implicit String Conversion in Helpers**

Consider a scenario where you have a helper that expects a user ID but you accidentally pass the whole user object.

```ruby
# app/helpers/user_helper.rb
module UserHelper
  def user_profile_link(user_id)
     link_to("View Profile", user_path(user_id))
  end
end

# app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
    def show
        @user = User.find(params[:id])
    end
end
# app/views/users/show.html.erb (Incorrect Usage)
<p>User Link: <%= user_profile_link(@user) %></p>

```

This results in the same issue, as the helper will receive the user object and likely attempt to use `.to_s` resulting in a link to a non-existent `/users/[object to string]` address. Here’s the correction.

```erb
# app/views/users/show.html.erb (Correct Usage)
<p>User Link: <%= user_profile_link(@user.id) %></p>
```
This passes only the user ID as an integer which is what the `user_profile_link` helper is expecting to construct the URL properly.

**Example 3: Incorrect Partial Data Passing**

Imagine a situation where you have a partial view to display product details, but you're passing the incorrect data.

```ruby
# app/views/products/_product_detail.html.erb (Incorrect Usage)
<p>Product Name: <%= product.name %></p>
<p>Product Price: <%= product.formatted_price %></p>

# app/views/products/show.html.erb
<%= render partial: 'products/product_detail', locals: { product: @product } %>
```

While this looks normal at a glance, the crucial mistake here might occur if `product_detail` is accidentally rendered in a different context where `@product` is not explicitly defined or is passed with the wrong identifier. In an example such as this, the `@product` might be redefined, as for example:

```ruby
# app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
    def index
      @products = Product.all
    end
end
# app/views/products/index.html.erb (Incorrect Usage)
<% @products.each do |product| %>
   <%= render partial: 'products/product_detail' %>
<% end %>
```

Here, because we are not providing locals to the partial, the `product` identifier in `_product_detail` will be nil or potentially an unrelated object, resulting in unpredictable output. The fix here is explicit passing of the `product` in locals.

```erb
# app/views/products/index.html.erb (Correct Usage)
<% @products.each do |product| %>
   <%= render partial: 'products/product_detail', locals: { product: product } %>
<% end %>
```

It’s also beneficial to use the `render 'product_detail', product: product` shortcut, which implicitly assigns the local variable.

Debugging these kinds of issues requires a disciplined approach. Always inspect the data types being passed into your templates and helper methods. Use `binding.pry` or `byebug` liberally to inspect the contents of your variables within controllers and views. Be explicitly aware of the expectations of your helpers and partials; don’t make assumptions about their implicit context.

As far as further learning goes, I'd recommend thoroughly reading the *Ruby on Rails Guides*, particularly those sections pertaining to layouts and rendering in views, action controller, and helpers. I also highly advise spending time understanding Ruby’s object model by reading through "Programming Ruby" by Dave Thomas. It provides crucial insights on the behavior of implicit conversions. Also, *Eloquent Ruby* by Russ Olsen is a gem for writing more idiomatic and maintainable code. These resources, coupled with focused debugging, will greatly aid your work.

In my experience, these issues often manifest in larger projects where code is heavily abstracted. Keeping track of what you are passing around and the expected types, with a disciplined and methodical approach to debugging, is crucial. That’s the best path to prevent these ‘text as objects’ problems in your Rails applications.
