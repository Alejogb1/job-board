Alright, let's unpack this. It's a question that pops up more often than you'd think, especially when you're diving deep into api-only architectures with Rails 7. I recall a project back in '21; we were building a decoupled frontend and backend, and we ran headfirst into a similar situation. It felt initially counterintuitive – an *api-only* app needing a session store? It seemed like a vestigial limb from the server-rendered days. So, let's get into the nitty-gritty of why this happens, and what we can do about it.

The crux of the matter lies in how Rails' ActionController::Base and its associated middleware operate. Even in an api-only configuration, Rails still inherits many of the default behaviours designed for traditional web applications. This includes middleware components that are fundamentally intertwined with session management.

Specifically, two key pieces of middleware are typically the culprits here: `ActionDispatch::Request::Session` and `ActionDispatch::Flash`. While an api-only application often won't actively *use* sessions or flash directly for, say, storing user state, or display flash messages, this middleware is still active by default. These components are part of the standard Rails middleware stack, and they operate by reading and writing to a session store, regardless of whether they are actually populated with data by the application code. The need to initialize this is the problem. Rails needs a session store even if the intention is to work stateless because the framework's foundation is not stateless. This means that every request, even in an API-only context, is processed in a way that expects to potentially read or write session data.

Think of it like this: the plumbing is in place even if you aren't running water. The session middleware checks for a session cookie with every request, and if one exists (or is to be created via other means), it reads data from the configured store. Subsequently, at the end of the request cycle, the middleware may try to write the modified (or, in our case, mostly unmodified) session data back to the store. This action relies on the availability of a configured storage mechanism, which by default is the cookie store. Even if the actual session hash is empty, the system needs to know where to attempt to store this potentially empty data.

Now, some might say, "Well, why not just disable it?" And that’s a fair question. Disabling all session middleware can indeed be attempted, but it often introduces unforeseen issues and bypasses standard rails conventions. You might get it to *work* by brute force. But you also start deviating from standard patterns which makes your application less predictable to other developers. Instead of disabling them, there are more elegant ways to ensure this overhead is minimal, which also maintain the conventions. Instead, we can optimize the session setup for an API-only environment.

Let's examine a few code examples:

**Example 1: The Default Setup (And Its Implications)**

This example represents what you often see out of the box when you create a fresh Rails API application. No explicit session store is set up:

```ruby
# config/application.rb

module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.load_defaults 7.0
    config.api_only = true
  end
end
```

Even with `config.api_only = true`, Rails still loads `ActionDispatch::Request::Session` and `ActionDispatch::Flash`. If you haven't specified a session store explicitly via `config.session_store`, Rails will, by default, try to use a cookie-based session store. This is why, without a valid secret key base in your `config/secrets.yml`, or the equivalent in a modern credential setup, you will face exceptions. The system tries to create a secure cookie, which it cannot do without this configuration.

**Example 2: Null Session Store**

A practical approach is to switch to a null session store. It satisfies the middleware's requirement for a store but does nothing with the session data. This is a good option when you need some of the session middleware, and you do not wish to disable them entirely.

```ruby
# config/application.rb

module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.load_defaults 7.0
    config.api_only = true
    config.session_store :null_session_store
  end
end
```

This configuration, by setting `config.session_store` to `:null_session_store`, effectively creates a session store that will not attempt to write or retrieve any data. It satisfies the middleware's need for a valid store, but no session information is actually persisted. This method is extremely lightweight.

**Example 3: Optimized Cookie-Based Store (If Needed)**

Now, If you, for some reason, actually *do* require a session store (maybe you are utilizing the cookies middleware for something specific, outside the typical session purpose), here is how you would configure a cookie based store. This is less common in a true API-only situation but is here for completeness.

```ruby
# config/application.rb

module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.load_defaults 7.0
    config.api_only = true
    config.session_store :cookie_store, key: '_my_app_session', expire_after: 1.day
    config.middleware.use ActionDispatch::Cookies
    config.middleware.use ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore, key: '_my_app_session', expire_after: 1.day
  end
end
```

Here, we explicitly specify a cookie store, setting a key and expiration. We also ensure the necessary cookie and session middleware are included. It’s important to note that unless a specific use case demands this (such as a hybrid application with some server-side rendered elements co-existing), a null session store is typically the better option for API-only apps. The specific `_my_app_session` name should match with your desired naming conventions.

In terms of authoritative resources, I highly recommend spending time with the official Rails documentation, specifically the section on “Rails on API-Only Applications”. Delving into the documentation for `ActionController::Base` and the various pieces of middleware like `ActionDispatch::Request::Session` will give you a foundational understanding of their purpose and behaviour. Additionally, the Rails source code itself is invaluable – don’t be afraid to inspect the implementation of the session middleware and the related classes to gain a deeper understanding. Further, studying the architecture behind stateless authentication methods such as JWT will be useful in thinking about the architectural implications of relying on server-side sessions. Also take a moment to research the concept of the twelve-factor application, especially factor 6, which focuses on statelessness. Lastly, if you find yourself diving into more advanced session management or authentication, I recommend reading "Secure by Default: How to Develop Secure Software" by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (though more general, the principles are excellent) as well as some literature surrounding advanced web-security practices, particularly on session management and authorization patterns.

To summarize: a session store is required in an API-only Rails application due to Rails’ default middleware stack needing a place to persist or attempt to persist session data. Using a `null_session_store` is an excellent solution for API-only applications that do not intend to utilize session management and do not intend to store state server-side. Remember, while it might seem like extra baggage for an api-only app, these components are integral to the Rails architecture and, with a bit of informed configuration, they can be managed effectively, ensuring your API is performant and well-behaved.
