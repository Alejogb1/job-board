Let's dive into this. I remember working on a natural language generation project a few years back, where we were playing around with Markov models for generating text. Using normalized transition matrices is a core technique for this, and it's surprisingly effective when you understand the underlying principles. It’s less about magic, and more about probability and carefully structured data.

The fundamental concept revolves around treating a sequence of words (or n-grams, more generally) as states in a Markov chain. The transition matrix, normalized, gives us the probability of transitioning from one word or n-gram to another. Think of it like a roadmap where each intersection is a word, and the roads leading out of it are marked with probabilities showing where you're likely to go next.

First, we need to build our transition matrix. This involves parsing a corpus of text (some large collection of text), counting word sequences, and then normalizing the counts into probabilities. This is the foundational step. Essentially, we're determining, given the presence of word 'A', what is the likelihood that word 'B' will follow. Crucially, we're working at a conditional probability: p(word_b | word_a).

Here’s a bit of a deeper explanation: We usually don't operate with single words in a real application, we often work with bi-grams or n-grams (a sequence of n words). This way, we capture more contextual information. Let's say we're using bi-grams. We would track pairs of words and how often one follows the other in our text corpus. This "how often" then gets normalized to produce probabilities.

Here is a Python code snippet demonstrating how to build such a normalized transition matrix using bi-grams, leveraging `collections.defaultdict` for a concise implementation and `numpy` for numerical array manipulation:

```python
import collections
import numpy as np

def create_transition_matrix(text):
    """
    Creates a normalized transition matrix from a given text using bi-grams.

    Args:
        text: A string of text.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
        - A dictionary of next-word probabilities (transition matrix).
        - A list of unique words (states).
    """
    words = text.lower().split()
    unique_words = sorted(list(set(words)))
    word_to_index = {word: i for i, word in enumerate(unique_words)}
    num_words = len(unique_words)
    transition_counts = collections.defaultdict(lambda: np.zeros(num_words))

    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        current_word = words[i]
        next_word = words[i+1]
        current_idx = word_to_index[current_word]
        next_idx = word_to_index[next_word]
        transition_counts[current_word][next_idx] += 1


    transition_probabilities = {}
    for word, counts in transition_counts.items():
        total = sum(counts)
        if total > 0: #prevent divide-by-zero issues
             transition_probabilities[word] = counts / total


    return transition_probabilities, unique_words

text_corpus = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the quick fox ran"
transition_matrix, word_states = create_transition_matrix(text_corpus)

print("Transition Matrix:")
for word, probabilities in transition_matrix.items():
  print(f"Word: {word},  Probabilities: {dict(zip(word_states, probabilities))}")
```

This `create_transition_matrix` function takes a string of text, converts it to lowercase and splits it into words. It then creates a dictionary `transition_counts` to store how many times one word follows another, and then transforms these counts to probabilities. You can see in the output how probabilities are calculated for each following word, depending on the current word. The example uses a very short, illustrative text snippet. In practice, you’d use a considerably larger corpus.

Now, with the transition matrix in hand, we can generate sentences. The process is pretty straightforward, at least in theory. We start with a seed word. Then, we sample the next word based on the probabilities for the current word in our matrix. We continue this iterative sampling process, generating a series of words until some stop condition is met, like reaching a predefined sentence length, or encountering a period ('.') token.

Here is the second python code snippet detailing sentence generation, leveraging `random.choice` for a probabilistic weighted sampling of the next word given transition probabilities:

```python
import random

def generate_sentence(transition_matrix, word_states, seed_word='the', max_length=20):
    """
    Generates a sentence based on the transition matrix.

    Args:
        transition_matrix: Dictionary of next-word probabilities.
        word_states: List of unique words.
        seed_word: The starting word for the sentence.
        max_length: Maximum length of generated sentence.

    Returns:
        A generated sentence (string)
    """
    current_word = seed_word
    sentence = [current_word]

    for _ in range(max_length):
        if current_word not in transition_matrix:
           break #stop if the next word is unknown
        next_word_probabilities = transition_matrix[current_word]
        if sum(next_word_probabilities) == 0:
            break # stop if there is no further transitions for this word

        next_word_idx = random.choices(range(len(word_states)), weights=next_word_probabilities)[0]
        next_word = word_states[next_word_idx]
        sentence.append(next_word)
        current_word = next_word


        if next_word == '.':
            break
    return ' '.join(sentence)

generated_sentence = generate_sentence(transition_matrix, word_states)
print(f"\nGenerated Sentence: {generated_sentence}")
```

In the `generate_sentence` function, we start with a seed word and then iteratively select the subsequent words based on the probabilities in our transition matrix. We choose the next word using weighted random sampling (`random.choices`), where the weights are the transition probabilities. The process continues till the stop conditions are met.

However, there are challenges with this approach. The generated sentences may lack coherence and grammatical accuracy, especially if using simple bi-grams. As we move to longer n-grams we also face data scarcity issues.

Consider a situation where our text corpus does not contain a phrase like "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", specifically with "jumped". The transition matrix would not have an entry for 'fox' leading to 'jumped', thereby generating a discontinuity. This is known as the "sparsity" problem. This problem grows exponentially as n in 'n-grams' increases. This is one of the limitations when it comes to relying solely on transition matrices for complex sentence generation.

To overcome such limitations, one could consider smoothing techniques that assign a small probability to unseen transitions, rather than simply treating them as zero probability. Add-one (Laplace) smoothing and Kneser-Ney smoothing are popular methods, although not presented here. In addition, one could consider utilizing higher-order n-grams (tri-grams, four-grams) to get a more complete context. This increase in context also comes with trade-offs in terms of increased computational costs and data sparsity challenges.

Here’s a final snippet demonstrating a very basic example of add-one smoothing:

```python
import collections
import numpy as np

def create_transition_matrix_add_one(text, alpha=1):
    words = text.lower().split()
    unique_words = sorted(list(set(words)))
    word_to_index = {word: i for i, word in enumerate(unique_words)}
    num_words = len(unique_words)
    transition_counts = collections.defaultdict(lambda: np.zeros(num_words))


    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        current_word = words[i]
        next_word = words[i+1]
        current_idx = word_to_index[current_word]
        next_idx = word_to_index[next_word]
        transition_counts[current_word][next_idx] += 1

    transition_probabilities = {}
    for word, counts in transition_counts.items():
        smoothed_counts = counts + alpha
        total = sum(smoothed_counts)
        transition_probabilities[word] = smoothed_counts / total
    return transition_probabilities, unique_words

text_corpus = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the quick fox ran"
smoothed_matrix, word_states = create_transition_matrix_add_one(text_corpus)

print("\nSmoothed Transition Matrix:")
for word, probabilities in smoothed_matrix.items():
  print(f"Word: {word},  Probabilities: {dict(zip(word_states, probabilities))}")
```
In this final snippet, add-one smoothing is added to the previous transition matrix creation. The main difference lies in `smoothed_counts = counts + alpha` and the subsequent probabilities which are based on those smoothed counts.

For deeper exploration, I recommend looking at *Speech and Language Processing* by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin. It’s a standard text for computational linguistics and covers Markov models, n-grams, smoothing, and language modeling in depth. Additionally, I would also check *Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing* by Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Schütze, another comprehensive resource for anyone serious about natural language. These books will give you the theoretical underpinnings along with practical techniques and algorithms you may use in your own projects. Lastly, *Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing* by Yoav Goldberg will be instrumental for progressing toward more sophisticated methods of text generation, leveraging neural network-based approaches.
