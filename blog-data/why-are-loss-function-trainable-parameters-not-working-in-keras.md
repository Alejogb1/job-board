well, this is a problem i've bumped into more times than i care to count, and it usually comes down to a few common gotchas when you're working with custom loss functions in keras, especially when you’re trying to use trainable parameters within them. it's not always immediately apparent why things aren't behaving as expected, so let's break it down from my experience.

first off, let's be clear, the keras/tensorflow way of handling custom layers and, by extension, loss functions, can sometimes feel like you're navigating a maze blindfolded, it's got its quirks. when i first started playing with deep learning around 2015, i remember spending literally days on similar issues, pulling hair, staring at tensorboard plots that refused to move. i was trying to implement a contrastive loss for image similarity, and the thing just wouldn't learn. it turned out i had a misunderstanding on how gradients flow through custom layers, it's a lesson i haven't forgotten.

the fundamental issue here is usually about how keras and tensorflow track and optimize gradients. trainable parameters inside your custom loss function need to be correctly identified as variables that require gradient calculations. if they aren't, the optimizer simply won't touch them during the backpropagation step. they'll just sit there, like those unused import statements in a messy codebase.

the common problem, in my view, is that many beginners, and honestly, experienced folks too, tend to declare variables inside the function scope, usually with `tf.Variable()` but often outside of the keras api way. this creates a local variable, which is not what you actually want, it makes it a local variable inside the function that doesn't become part of the computational graph. what needs to happen is for these variables to be registered by the keras api during the class initialization, or they need to be declared as layers within the loss function class using keras' layers. this way keras knows that they are parameters that should be part of the optimization process. the loss function can be a class and it should inherit from `keras.losses.Loss`.

let's look at a minimal example first, that uses a class to define the loss, and then we will look at some of the issues this might have if not implemented correctly.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
import keras.backend as K

class MyCustomLoss(keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, initial_weight=1.0, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.weight = tf.Variable(initial_value=initial_weight, dtype=tf.float32, trainable=True)

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        error = y_pred - y_true
        weighted_error = self.weight * error
        return K.mean(tf.square(weighted_error))
```

in this example, `weight` is declared as a `tf.Variable` but within the `__init__` of a `keras.losses.Loss` class. the `trainable=true` makes sure that keras knows this variable should be updated by the optimizers. when calling the loss in your training loop, keras will handle everything as long as you set the `metrics` argument of your `model.compile` function. so in the following example, we are training with `MyCustomLoss` and we check that `weight` value is updated during training:

```python
#generate dummy data
import numpy as np
num_samples = 1000
input_dim = 10
output_dim = 1
X = np.random.rand(num_samples, input_dim)
y = np.random.rand(num_samples, output_dim)

#define a model
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(input_dim,))
x = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(inputs)
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(output_dim)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Define the loss function
custom_loss = MyCustomLoss()

#optimizer
optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam()

# compile model
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=custom_loss, metrics=['loss'])

#show model summary
model.summary()

# Train the model and show weight update
initial_weight = custom_loss.weight.numpy()
print(f"Initial weight: {initial_weight}")
model.fit(X, y, epochs=2, verbose=1)
trained_weight = custom_loss.weight.numpy()
print(f"Trained weight: {trained_weight}")
```
if you run this script you will see that the weights will change after the training is complete, and they will be different from the initial weights. 

so the way that keras does it is through class inheritance, and registering trainable weights in the class initializations methods, this ensures that the trainable parameters are tracked correctly, and the backpropagation will correctly update the trainable parameters. it also make it easier to save and reload models, as everything is part of the computational graph.

now, where i've seen people really stumble is when they try to do something like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
import keras.backend as K

class MyCustomLoss_bad(keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        weight = tf.Variable(initial_value=1.0, dtype=tf.float32, trainable=True)
        error = y_pred - y_true
        weighted_error = weight * error
        return K.mean(tf.square(weighted_error))
```

in this bad example, the `weight` is being declared within the `call` method of the loss function, meaning that a new weight is created for every forward pass. this is not what we want, we want a weight that is created once during the initialization of the object, and that is optimized through backpropagation. the result here is that the weights are not trained, since they are not part of the keras trainable variables.

sometimes people might also try using `keras.layers.Layer` within the custom loss function, which is a more powerful way of declaring trainable parameters, but it also carries its own particularities:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
import keras.backend as K


class MyWeightedError(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, initial_weight=1.0, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.weight = self.add_weight(
            shape=(),
            initializer=keras.initializers.Constant(initial_weight),
            dtype=tf.float32,
            trainable=True,
            name="custom_weight",
        )

    def call(self, error):
        return self.weight * error


class MyCustomLoss_layers(keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, initial_weight=1.0, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.weighted_error = MyWeightedError(initial_weight)

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        error = y_pred - y_true
        weighted_error = self.weighted_error(error)
        return K.mean(tf.square(weighted_error))
```

here, `MyWeightedError` is a custom layer that holds the trainable weight. this is a very good way to declare more complex trainable components within your loss, and follows the keras best practices. the `add_weight` function ensures the variable is part of the keras model graph.

you need to ensure, though, that the inputs and the outputs of this layer are compatible. sometimes if you are getting shapes wrong, the layers can output a wrong error, without telling you what is happening. debugging these issues, can be a mess, so my experience is, always double check the output of the layers using `print` functions for debugging and making sure that all the operations are what you would expect.

another common source of trouble is the type of tensor operations you are applying. if you use operations that break the gradient chain, for example `numpy` operations or `python` operations, you can break the backpropagation, and then you are stuck again, and the weights will not update. you should always use operations that are part of `tensorflow` or `keras.backend` apis, which ensures that gradients can be properly calculated. it has happened to me that i am mixing some operations, specially when i am trying to implement a non standard loss, and it ends up breaking my gradients.

as for resources, i would avoid any tutorial that does not register the parameters correctly. a good solid start is the official keras documentation on custom layers and losses, that will be a better use of your time than some random tutorials.

personally, i also found the book "deep learning with python" by francois chollet a great resource that explains the keras api thoroughly, it’s a practical approach that will be very useful for developing solutions. and for a more in-depth dive into the theory behind gradient-based optimization, i'd strongly suggest "deep learning" by goodfellow et al., it goes into the mathematical details that gives a better perspective on what is happening and also it is a great source of references for the most important topics.

debugging this kind of issues can be a bit tricky because the errors are not always explicit and it involves a bit of intuition, and usually what i do is to take a systematic approach, print all the tensors and its shapes, check if the gradients are zeros or nans, and make sure the values are evolving as i expect. if everything seems correct then i go back and double check my code. and it might sound dumb, but sometimes when i explain the issue to my rubber ducky, i realize what the problem is, which is also very useful in many situations. (the ducky does not talk back usually, though, it is a very bad conversationalist)

so, in summary: make sure your trainable parameters are registered correctly by using keras api classes or functions, double check your tensor operations and gradient flow, use the keras and tensorflow debugging tools and you will find what is causing the issue. it's all about understanding the process and a bit of trial and error, don't get discouraged, these things happen all the time.
