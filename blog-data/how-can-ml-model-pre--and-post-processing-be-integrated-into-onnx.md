Alright, let's tackle this. The integration of machine learning model pre- and post-processing into ONNX is a topic I've spent a good chunk of time navigating, especially back when I was working on edge deployments for a computer vision project. We had a complex pipeline involving not just the core inference model, but also a suite of operations on the input and output data. Managing that efficiently across diverse hardware platforms required a deep dive into ONNX and its capabilities.

The core idea behind embedding pre and post-processing directly within the ONNX graph is primarily about improving deployment efficiency and portability. Traditionally, you might handle pre-processing (like normalization, resizing, or encoding) in your application code, and the same goes for post-processing (like non-maximum suppression for object detection or argmax operations). However, this creates a fragile ecosystem where different applications might interpret the same input and output formats slightly differently. Moving these operations into the ONNX graph standardizes the entire inference pipeline, ensuring consistency regardless of the deployment environment.

Now, ONNX itself is not a magical black box. It doesn't support every conceivable pre and post-processing function directly through dedicated nodes. What it does offer is a robust set of fundamental operators, and the flexibility to represent quite complex operations through combinations of these. We frequently leverage `onnx.helper` to craft the custom nodes we need.

Let me give you an idea of how this actually translates to code with some examples. Let’s start with pre-processing; consider a scenario where we need to normalize image input. Let's assume images come in as uint8 tensors, and our model expects float32 tensors with values between 0 and 1. Here's how you could represent the normalization within the ONNX graph:

```python
import onnx
from onnx import helper
from onnx import TensorProto

def create_normalization_graph():
    # Input image tensor definition
    input_tensor = helper.make_tensor_value_info('input_image', TensorProto.UINT8, [1, 3, 224, 224])

    # Output tensor definition after normalization
    output_tensor = helper.make_tensor_value_info('normalized_image', TensorProto.FLOAT, [1, 3, 224, 224])

    # Constants for casting and division
    cast_node = helper.make_node('Cast', ['input_image'], ['casted_image'], to=TensorProto.FLOAT)
    scale_constant = helper.make_node('Constant', [], ['scale_factor'], value=helper.make_tensor('scale_factor', TensorProto.FLOAT, [], [255.0]))
    divide_node = helper.make_node('Div', ['casted_image', 'scale_factor'], ['normalized_image'])

    # Create graph
    graph = helper.make_graph(
        [cast_node, scale_constant, divide_node],
        'normalization_graph',
        [input_tensor],
        [output_tensor]
    )
    model = helper.make_model(graph, producer_name='normalization')
    return model

# Example Usage
normalization_model = create_normalization_graph()
onnx.checker.check_model(normalization_model) # Always check
with open("normalization.onnx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(normalization_model.SerializeToString())
```

In this snippet, we're not employing any special pre-built ONNX normalization node. Rather, we utilize a ‘Cast’ node to change the tensor type to float, followed by a ‘Constant’ node representing our scaling factor (255 in this case), then a ‘Div’ node to perform division. This approach showcases the power of composing foundational ONNX operators into more specialized functionality.

Now, let’s examine post-processing, where a common task is to apply an argmax operation to obtain class predictions from model output. Here's another example using ONNX nodes:

```python
import onnx
from onnx import helper
from onnx import TensorProto
import numpy as np

def create_argmax_graph(num_classes=10):
    # Input of model output
    input_tensor = helper.make_tensor_value_info('model_output', TensorProto.FLOAT, [1, num_classes])

    # Output of the argmax operation
    output_tensor = helper.make_tensor_value_info('predicted_class', TensorProto.INT64, [1])

    # Argmax node
    argmax_node = helper.make_node('ArgMax', ['model_output'], ['predicted_class'], axis=1, keepdims=0)

    # Create graph
    graph = helper.make_graph(
        [argmax_node],
        'argmax_graph',
        [input_tensor],
        [output_tensor]
    )
    model = helper.make_model(graph, producer_name='argmax')

    return model

# Example usage
argmax_model = create_argmax_graph()
onnx.checker.check_model(argmax_model) # check
with open("argmax.onnx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(argmax_model.SerializeToString())
```

This example showcases how readily we can integrate post-processing directly into the ONNX graph. Here, we use the `ArgMax` node which, when set to the correct axis (1 in this instance), returns the index of the maximum value along that axis, thus giving the predicted class label.

For a more complex scenario, consider needing to crop a bounding box from an image. Here we will require an 'Input' for the image itself and another 'Input' representing the coordinates of the bounding box (x,y,width,height) represented as a numpy array. This also requires the use of the `Slice` operator in ONNX, so the complexity does increase.

```python
import onnx
from onnx import helper
from onnx import TensorProto
import numpy as np

def create_crop_graph():
    # Input image tensor
    input_image = helper.make_tensor_value_info('image_input', TensorProto.FLOAT, [1, 3, 512, 512])

    # Input bounding box coordinates tensor
    input_bbox = helper.make_tensor_value_info('bbox_input', TensorProto.INT64, [1, 4])

    # Output cropped image tensor
    output_cropped = helper.make_tensor_value_info('cropped_image', TensorProto.FLOAT, [1, 3, 64, 64])

    # Prepare constants for slice operation
    starts_node = helper.make_node('Constant', [], ['starts'], value=helper.make_tensor('starts', TensorProto.INT64, [4], [0, 0, 0, 0]))
    axes_node = helper.make_node('Constant', [], ['axes'], value=helper.make_tensor('axes', TensorProto.INT64, [4], [0, 1, 2, 3]))
    
    # Dynamic length calculation for slice
    length_0 = helper.make_node('Gather', ['bbox_input', helper.make_node('Constant', [], ['axis_0'], value=helper.make_tensor('axis_0', TensorProto.INT64, [], [0])).output[0]],['start_y_0'])
    length_1 = helper.make_node('Gather', ['bbox_input', helper.make_node('Constant', [], ['axis_1'], value=helper.make_tensor('axis_1', TensorProto.INT64, [], [1])).output[0]], ['start_x_1'])
    length_2 = helper.make_node('Gather', ['bbox_input', helper.make_node('Constant', [], ['axis_2'], value=helper.make_tensor('axis_2', TensorProto.INT64, [], [2])).output[0]], ['height_2'])
    length_3 = helper.make_node('Gather', ['bbox_input', helper.make_node('Constant', [], ['axis_3'], value=helper.make_tensor('axis_3', TensorProto.INT64, [], [3])).output[0]], ['width_3'])
    
    ends_0 = helper.make_node('Add', ['start_y_0', helper.make_node('Constant', [], ['height_offset'], value=helper.make_tensor('height_offset', TensorProto.INT64, [], [64])).output[0]], ['end_y_0'])
    ends_1 = helper.make_node('Add', ['start_x_1', helper.make_node('Constant', [], ['width_offset'], value=helper.make_tensor('width_offset', TensorProto.INT64, [], [64])).output[0]], ['end_x_1'])

    ends_node = helper.make_node('Concat', [starts_node.output[0], ends_0, ends_1, helper.make_node('Constant', [], ['end_ch_dim'], value=helper.make_tensor('end_ch_dim', TensorProto.INT64, [], [1])).output[0]], ['ends'], axis=0)

    slice_node = helper.make_node('Slice', ['image_input', 'starts', 'ends', 'axes'], ['cropped_image'])
    
    # Create graph
    graph = helper.make_graph(
        [starts_node, axes_node, length_0, length_1, length_2, length_3, ends_0, ends_1, ends_node, slice_node],
        'crop_graph',
        [input_image, input_bbox],
        [output_cropped]
    )

    model = helper.make_model(graph, producer_name='crop')

    return model

# Example usage
crop_model = create_crop_graph()
onnx.checker.check_model(crop_model) # always check
with open("crop.onnx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(crop_model.SerializeToString())

```

This final example shows a more complex operation, dynamic bounding box slicing, which required more nodes than the previous examples. Here we utilize `Gather` to grab specific values from a given input tensor (our bounding box input). These values are used to control the slicing operation, by determining both start and end indices. We utilize a `Concat` operator to build the `ends` tensor before passing it to the `Slice` operator along with `starts`, and `axes`.

It is worth noting that while ONNX provides a large number of operators, it doesn’t always offer direct support for every complex operation you might require. In such cases, you can either utilize a combination of existing operations, define custom operations (though this may require custom runtime support), or pre-process certain components outside of the ONNX graph.

For anyone looking to delve further into this area, I strongly recommend studying the ONNX specification documents themselves. Also, the official ONNX tutorials and the documentation of libraries that interact with ONNX, like `onnxruntime`, are exceptionally useful. Furthermore, the book “Deep Learning with Python” by François Chollet provides an excellent foundation in machine learning which then allows for a more detailed understanding of how the operations shown here fit into the bigger picture.

Remember, the best approach for any particular project depends on the specifics of the task and the constraints of the target environment. The ability to move pre and post-processing into the ONNX graph is often a big step toward more efficient and reliable deployments, but like all tools in a developer's toolbox, it needs to be employed with a clear understanding of its implications.
