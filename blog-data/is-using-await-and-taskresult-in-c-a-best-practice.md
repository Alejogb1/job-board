Let's tackle this directly – using `await` and `Task.Result` in C#, particularly the latter, is something I've had my fair share of debugging sessions over. It’s not a simple yes or no, rather a “it depends, but often no.” I’ve seen projects where improper use of `Task.Result` has brought entire services to their knees, and conversely, situations where it provided a quick, if not ideal, solution to a specific constraint. Let's dissect this.

`await` and `Task.Result` are both mechanisms for retrieving results from asynchronous operations, encapsulated in `Task` or `Task<T>` objects. The critical difference lies in *how* they handle that retrieval. `await` is cooperative; it signals to the current asynchronous context that the thread can yield control while the task completes, and it resumes execution when the task yields control back. `Task.Result`, on the other hand, is a synchronous, blocking operation. It forces the current thread to wait (block) until the task completes, potentially causing deadlocks or performance bottlenecks if misused.

In my experience, the allure of `Task.Result` often stems from a desire for simplicity, particularly when a developer is initially grappling with the complexities of asynchronous programming. It might seem easier to just say “give me the result” rather than propagating `async` keywords up the call stack. However, that apparent simplicity usually comes at a high cost when your application hits any scale.

The fundamental problem with `Task.Result` is that it can lead to *blocking the thread*. When a thread is blocked, it becomes unavailable for other work, effectively reducing the concurrency potential of the application. This is especially detrimental in UI applications, server applications handling multiple requests, or any scenario relying on responsiveness. If the task being waited upon is itself blocked, you'll experience a deadlock. This can occur in asynchronous contexts like ASP.NET Core requests, or any environment using a thread pool.

Let’s consider an example. Imagine a service that fetches data from a database.

```csharp
public class DataService
{
    public async Task<string> FetchDataAsync()
    {
        // Simulate database call
        await Task.Delay(100); // Simulate latency
        return "Data from Database";
    }

    public string FetchDataSyncBad() // Using Task.Result - Bad
    {
        // Block the thread
        return FetchDataAsync().Result;
    }

    public async Task<string> FetchDataSyncGood() // Using await - Good
    {
         // Correctly wait asynchronously
         return await FetchDataAsync();
    }
}
```

In this basic `DataService` class, `FetchDataSyncBad` uses `.Result`. If the calling code is not designed to be blocked, this call could lead to performance issues. `FetchDataSyncGood`, on the other hand, employs `await`, which allows the caller to remain responsive while awaiting the result.

Here's another more illustrative example, showing the potential deadlock scenario when used improperly in a UI context, or in any situation with a synchronization context. We can simulate that using a console application for simplicity:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class UiDeadlockExample
{
    public static void RunBad()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting bad example...");
        // This is a potential deadlock in a UI environment.
        var result = SomeLongRunningTaskAsync().Result;
        Console.WriteLine($"Bad Result: {result}");

    }

    public static async Task RunGood()
    {
         Console.WriteLine("Starting good example...");
        var result = await SomeLongRunningTaskAsync();
         Console.WriteLine($"Good Result: {result}");
    }
   static async Task<string> SomeLongRunningTaskAsync()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("SomeLongRunningTaskAsync executing...");
      await Task.Delay(100); // Simulating some work
      return "Data";
    }
}


public class Program
{
   public static void Main(string[] args)
   {
    UiDeadlockExample.RunBad();
    UiDeadlockExample.RunGood().GetAwaiter().GetResult();
    Console.ReadKey();
   }
}
```

In a real UI application, the `SynchronizationContext` is more significant, but the underlying problem is the same: `SomeLongRunningTaskAsync().Result` will block the UI thread. That means, the `await` within `SomeLongRunningTaskAsync` cannot continue its execution on the UI thread because it's blocked, creating a deadlock.

The correct approach, as you see in the `RunGood` method, is to use `await`. By doing so, we allow the asynchronous operation to run freely without blocking the thread where `RunGood` was initially called. This prevents potential deadlocks and keeps your application responsive.

Lastly, it's crucial to consider how you handle asynchronous tasks within a loop. Using `Task.Result` in a loop creates a serial operation when ideally you want to leverage asynchronous processing:

```csharp
    public class LoopExample
    {
        public static async Task ProcessDataAsync(List<int> inputs)
        {
            List<string> results = new List<string>();

            foreach (var input in inputs)
            {
               // Incorrect way
               // var result = ProcessSingleAsync(input).Result;
                // results.Add(result);


                // Correct Way
                results.Add(await ProcessSingleAsync(input));
            }

             foreach(var result in results)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(result);
            }
        }

        private static async Task<string> ProcessSingleAsync(int input)
        {
            await Task.Delay(50); // Simulate some work
            return $"Processed: {input}";
        }
    }
```

Here, the incorrect code would make your processing synchronous for every single iteration, eliminating all the benefits that async programming provides. The corrected version utilizes `await` so that tasks can run concurrently (or in parallel if applicable), allowing the overall operation to complete much faster.

When to avoid `Task.Result` is the most important takeaway. In general, it should only be used in highly specific situations, such as initializers in a startup process or during testing where you know the synchronous block will not cause a deadlock. Even then, it’s best to consider using the `GetAwaiter().GetResult()` pattern if you must call the asynchronous method synchronously, ensuring proper handling of the `SynchronizationContext`.

For further reading on asynchronous programming in C#, I highly recommend: "Concurrency in C# Cookbook" by Stephen Cleary, which provides practical examples and best practices. Also, for a deeper theoretical understanding, you should explore "Microsoft Patterns and Practices: Asynchronous Programming" which covers patterns of asynchronous design. These resources provide the needed context and reasoning for effective asynchronous handling in C# and are much better resources than random blogs or articles that don't get into the real reasons for these techniques.

In conclusion, while `Task.Result` might seem like a shortcut, it almost always leads to problems down the line. Embrace `await` and asynchronous patterns in C#; you will create more robust, performant, and scalable software.
