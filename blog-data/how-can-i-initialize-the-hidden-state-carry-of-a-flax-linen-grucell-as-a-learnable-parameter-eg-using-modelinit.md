Let's delve into this; it’s a very pertinent question when you're fine-tuning or customising recurrent neural networks, particularly with Flax and GRUs. I recall wrestling with a similar issue back when I was developing a sequence-to-sequence model for time series forecasting—it highlighted the importance of proper hidden state initialization. Specifically, you're asking how to make the initial hidden state of a flax `GRUCell` a learnable parameter, which differs from simply zero-initializing it. You want to allow the model to learn what a 'good' initial state is, instead of imposing a static starting point.

The challenge, as you've likely noticed, is that the standard `GRUCell` initialization in Flax usually doesn’t directly expose the hidden state as a trainable variable. Instead, it’s often handled within the cell's internal logic. We need to carefully craft a solution that allows us to manage this.

The key idea revolves around defining a trainable initial state and then ensuring it's properly passed when we first call the GRU cell. Let’s consider how to achieve this step by step:

First, we'll wrap the `GRUCell` within our own layer, which will take care of defining and passing the learnable initial state. We will call this custom layer `TrainableInitialStateGRU`. This custom layer will maintain the trainable initial state and ensure it's provided during the first forward pass. Later calls will use the hidden state from the previous step.

Here's the first example, showing the definition of the `TrainableInitialStateGRU` layer:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import flax.linen as nn

class TrainableInitialStateGRU(nn.Module):
    features: int

    @nn.compact
    def __call__(self, x):
        gru_cell = nn.GRUCell(features=self.features)
        init_carry = self.param('init_carry', jax.random.normal, (self.features,))
        carry = init_carry
        carry, _ = gru_cell(carry, x)
        return carry
```

In this snippet, `self.param('init_carry', jax.random.normal, (self.features,))` is where the magic happens. We are defining a trainable parameter called 'init_carry' and initializing it with a normal distribution. Flax will automatically handle the gradient calculations for this parameter during training.

To use this class, you would initialize it and then apply the layer. We need to manage the hidden state for subsequent calls, so we'll extend the class to handle sequential input properly.

Now, the following snippet shows how this class will be used with sequential input.

```python
class TrainableInitialStateSequenceGRU(nn.Module):
    features: int

    @nn.compact
    def __call__(self, x_seq):
        gru_cell = nn.GRUCell(features=self.features)
        init_carry = self.param('init_carry', jax.random.normal, (self.features,))
        carry = init_carry

        outputs = []
        for x in x_seq:
          carry, _ = gru_cell(carry, x)
          outputs.append(carry)

        return jnp.stack(outputs)
```

Here, `TrainableInitialStateSequenceGRU` layer takes an input sequence `x_seq`. For every timestep in this sequence we take the hidden state from previous step, and pass it to the GRU. This allows the initial hidden state, `init_carry` to be updated through gradient descent. The sequence of outputs from each time step is stacked and returned.

Finally, we will create the model using the `TrainableInitialStateSequenceGRU` layer and show how to initialize it.

```python
class MyModel(nn.Module):
  features: int

  @nn.compact
  def __call__(self, x_seq):
    gru = TrainableInitialStateSequenceGRU(features=self.features)
    out = gru(x_seq)
    return out

# Example Usage
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
model = MyModel(features=10)
x_seq = jax.random.normal(key, (5, 10, 1))  # Sequence of 5 steps, each with input size of 1.

params = model.init(key, x_seq)['params']
output = model.apply({'params':params}, x_seq)
print(output.shape)
```

In this example, we create the `MyModel` which contains a `TrainableInitialStateSequenceGRU` layer. We generate a random input sequence `x_seq` with the appropriate dimensions, and then we initialize the parameters including the learnable initial carry. Finally we perform a forward pass.

Looking back at when I needed this, I had to be careful about handling variable-length sequences as well, which may be relevant for your situation. You might need to use masking or padding strategies coupled with this initial state strategy for efficient computation. This solution assumes fixed length sequences, but the same principle applies to variable length sequences with a little adjustment.

To dive deeper into this and related topics, I would recommend the following:

1. **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This book provides an excellent foundation on recurrent neural networks and the underlying mathematical concepts. It covers GRUs, LSTMs, and the theory behind gradient computation which are essential for understanding the implementation details. Specifically, the chapter on sequence modeling is highly relevant.

2. **The Flax documentation itself:** Flax is rapidly evolving. Therefore, keeping up with the official documentation is important. It contains examples and detailed explanations of all features, including custom layers and parameter handling which is crucial for this problem. Make sure to pay attention to the section on `nn.Module` and parameter handling within custom layers.

3. **Papers related to Recurrent Neural Network Initialization:** You could benefit from exploring research papers discussing initialization strategies of recurrent neural networks (e.g. “On the importance of initialization and momentum in deep learning” by Ilya Sutskever et al.) While most papers focus on weight initialization, some touch upon initializing states. This could give you a broader overview and might inspire further improvements.

In short, we can make the hidden state learnable by defining it as a trainable parameter within a custom layer, such as `TrainableInitialStateGRU`. The key is utilizing flax’s functionality via `self.param`, and maintaining the state for the forward passes. This allows the network to learn a more effective initial state than if we were to statically set it to zero or some random value. Through careful implementation and by studying the resources mentioned, one should be able to confidently navigate such scenarios.
