Alright, let's tackle this. This particular quirk with `allow_any_instance_of` and included modules in rspec is something I recall banging my head against quite a bit back in the day, while working on a moderately large Rails project with a rather extensive use of mixins. It's definitely not immediately obvious why it behaves this way, and it stems from a fundamental difference in how rspec handles stubs in relation to the object's ancestry chain.

The short explanation is this: `allow_any_instance_of` works by directly modifying the target class's method table. When we include a module, the methods aren't *directly* on the class where we’re using `allow_any_instance_of`; rather, they reside within the included module and are incorporated into the class via Ruby’s method lookup. `allow_any_instance_of` modifies the class, *not* the module that is providing those methods. Consequently, when the method is actually called at runtime, it bypasses the stub we created because the method lookup traverses the ancestry chain correctly to the original method in the included module. We are effectively stubbing a ghost method.

Essentially, `allow_any_instance_of` intercepts calls made *directly* to methods defined in the targeted class, but the methods from an included module are resolved via Ruby’s method inheritance mechanism. The call gets sent to the object, and Ruby’s lookup rules direct it to the module, circumventing our stub.

Let me break this down further with a few practical examples.

Let's imagine we have this scenario:

```ruby
# my_module.rb
module MyModule
  def some_method
    "Original method output"
  end
end

# my_class.rb
class MyClass
  include MyModule
end
```

And let’s say we attempt to test `MyClass` using `allow_any_instance_of`:

```ruby
# my_class_spec.rb
require 'rspec'
require_relative 'my_class'
require_relative 'my_module'

RSpec.describe MyClass do
  it "attempts to stub some_method on any instance" do
    allow_any_instance_of(MyClass).to receive(:some_method).and_return("Stubbed output")
    expect(MyClass.new.some_method).to eq("Original method output")
  end
end
```

This test, as we expect based on the described behavior, will fail. The output will be `"Original method output"`, not `"Stubbed output"`. This happens precisely because `some_method` is not actually defined *directly* on `MyClass`, but rather on `MyModule`, and it is incorporated into `MyClass`’s method lookup hierarchy. Thus, `allow_any_instance_of` does not intercept it.

So, how do we get around this? The most straightforward solution is to stub the method directly on the module. This is usually achieved by targeting a specific instance.

```ruby
# my_class_spec.rb
require 'rspec'
require_relative 'my_class'
require_relative 'my_module'

RSpec.describe MyClass do
    it "stubs the module method on an instance" do
        instance = MyClass.new
        allow(instance).to receive(:some_method).and_return("Stubbed output")
        expect(instance.some_method).to eq("Stubbed output")
    end

  it "fails when trying to stub the module directly on the module" do
       allow(MyModule).to receive(:some_method).and_return("Stubbed output")
        expect(MyClass.new.some_method).to eq("Original method output")
    end
end
```

This works as intended, because we're explicitly stubbing the method on a specific instance; however, this also defeats the purpose of using `allow_any_instance_of` if you need to control what *every* instance returns, not just a specific one in your test. If you have many tests, doing this for each method you need to stub across all test files can be verbose.

So, what if we *really* wanted to stub the method across all instances, using the convenience of `allow_any_instance_of`? One way to achieve this is by stubbing the method on the *module* before it gets included into the class. Here's a modified approach:

```ruby
# my_class_spec.rb
require 'rspec'
require_relative 'my_class'
require_relative 'my_module'

RSpec.describe MyClass do
    it "stubs the module method using the module itself before inclusion" do
        allow(MyModule).to receive(:some_method).and_return("Stubbed output")
        # Since Module is already included in the class before reaching here
        # the module method will return the stubbed value
        expect(MyClass.new.some_method).to eq("Stubbed output")
    end
end

```

This third example demonstrates that by acting directly on the module before it is incorporated into the class, we can achieve the intended behavior of stubbing the method across all instances. However, the caveat is that if the module is already included before the spec file runs or before we can apply the stub, we must manually re-include it.

Let's clarify why directly stubbing the module instance fails. Ruby's method lookup will first look at the class and then iterate through the inclusion chain, therefore, it only looks at the module's version of the method if the class itself doesn't define it, or if there is a method delegation in place. Stubbing on the module won’t change the method lookup on an existing instance of the class. That is why the third example works, because we're changing the module before it's integrated into the class.

In my experience, I have found it more reliable, maintainable and straightforward to simply stub the method directly on the instance when it's necessary to mock a module included method, rather than modifying the module directly; the last option, while it works, becomes harder to follow and more brittle over time, especially as a codebase grows. The second approach, shown above, provides just the necessary level of isolation and control without the more complicated logic.

Now, for further reading on this topic, I would highly recommend delving into the following resources:

*   **"Metaprogramming Ruby" by Paolo Perrotta:** This book provides a very comprehensive overview of Ruby’s object model and method lookup mechanisms, which is fundamental to understanding this rspec behaviour. It will clarify exactly how include works and how method calls resolve up the inheritance chain.

*   **"The Ruby Programming Language" by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto:** This is another excellent resource that clarifies the basics of how method lookup works in detail, providing a foundational understanding. Specifically, look at the chapter covering classes and modules.

*   **RSpec’s documentation on mocking and stubbing:** Although it doesn't specifically address this problem directly, the official documentation provides a good foundation for understanding how `allow_any_instance_of` and other mocking methods work under the hood. Familiarize yourself with these to understand the fundamental operations.

This particular interaction between rspec and included modules can be a bit tricky, but by understanding the underlying method lookup mechanisms in Ruby, and how rspec modifies objects, it becomes easier to approach and solve this problem systematically. When faced with similar issues, always consider carefully where the method you're trying to modify lives within the object's hierarchy, and try to keep your stubs focused and explicit.
