Okay so you're wrestling with column layouts inside a Streamlit submit form huh Been there done that got the t-shirt And the stress rash let me tell you its a fun one Not really

Alright so you've got a Streamlit app probably something like this you've got your form you want some inputs and you want those inputs to be nicely arranged in columns not just stacked on top of each other classic user interface requirement But you're running into that classic Streamlit form behavior where things get all wonky and layouting starts acting like its a toddler throwing a tantrum Specifically the `st.columns` function I bet is not doing what you hoped when inside the `st.form` context right Well yeah thats a common pitfall many beginners face it can feel frustrating but its all fixable dont panic

Ive been in this situation many times before my first experience with it was back in like 2019 trying to build a really simple internal tool for my team. We needed to fill in a bunch of data and initially I just slapped everything into a single form. It was a complete mess It looked like a ransom note made by a toddler using a crayon set of questionable origin. I thought oh easy peasy ill just wrap everything in `st.columns` inside the form no problem Well Streamlit had other ideas My beautiful columnar vision was just flat out ignored it all just rendered as a single column like some kind of layout singularity. I mean seriously it was the kind of thing that made me question all my career choices at that point. I spent a whole day ripping my hair out trying to figure out what was going on. Ah good old days

Lets get into the core problem here. Streamlit forms operate in a slightly different scope than the rest of your app They essentially create their own separate execution context. And due to this, direct use of st.columns within st.form can lead to unexpected layout behavior often resulting in the columns being ignored or improperly rendered. This is because st.columns interacts with Streamlits layout system which is affected by this form scope and not in a predictable way. If you add the st.columns directly inside a form it may cause the form to render in a single column because it wont respect the column layout rules within its specific scope. Its annoying but its how it is and we have to deal with it. There are several ways to solve it and most of them revolve around using st.container and its related functions and wrapping your form elements in it.

Heres a typical example of what you dont want to do which doesnt work

```python
import streamlit as st

with st.form("my_form"):
    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
    with col1:
        st.text_input("First Name")
    with col2:
        st.text_input("Last Name")
    submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit")
```

See how that just squishes everything into a single column Yeah not good. So how do we fix it Its very basic and simple use st.container to create a boundary for your form elements

Here's the first approach. Create a container outside the form that will hold columns that will hold individual form elements and thus your column layouts

```python
import streamlit as st

with st.form("my_form"):
    with st.container():
        col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
        with col1:
            st.text_input("First Name")
        with col2:
            st.text_input("Last Name")
    submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit")
```

This one is using a simple `st.container` but also the `with` statement which creates a context and allows everything within it to be contained inside that container it renders the components as intended.

Here's another way you can do it is to make a function that takes some input data and generates the form using `st.container` or `st.columns` directly. This helps with organizing the app and if you need to reuse form layouts

```python
import streamlit as st

def create_form():
  with st.form("my_form"):
      col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
      with col1:
          st.text_input("First Name")
      with col2:
          st.text_input("Last Name")
      submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit")

create_form()

```
This one is pretty basic its just using the `st.columns` again but its inside a function.

Alright so those are your general approaches. Now lets get into some more real world examples of this Ive worked on a couple of web apps in the past that needed complex form layouts One I worked on had multiple sections with fields arranged in different ways so it wasnt just 2 column layouts but like 2 3 4 layouts depending on the section of the form. I'm guessing you are having a similar situation. In such cases I found it helpful to break down the form into smaller functions Each function returned a container containing a specific section of the form and its sub layout. Then I assembled those sections inside the main form container. This gave me a much greater control over the layout. I also use it for styling the forms this is another advantage

One crucial thing to remember is that Streamlit is declarative not imperative which means you describe what you want and Streamlit figures out how to render it under the hood. You have to think in that direction instead of trying to manipulate things directly. Also understand that st.columns or any other layout component needs to be in the scope where streamlit can understand what you are trying to do. So its not a free for all. You cant just throw `st.columns` anywhere and expect things to just work. Trust me I have tried it it ends up failing spectacularly.

Now for some pro tips. If you have super complex layouts I'd also suggest exploring the `st.expander` widget. It lets you collapse sections of the form which can significantly improve usability especially on mobile and desktop with tons of fields. Another thing you can do is that if you have very complex forms with multiple sections you could consider using a session variable to handle conditional forms and make the user interface a little bit simpler.

Also if you are having a lot of trouble and dont understand whats happening try creating a very simple example and start adding complexity to it bit by bit. For example just create two text input fields in a form and work from there.

Oh and one more thing for complex layouts sometimes I find it useful to sketch it out on paper or use a simple wireframing tool. It helps you visualize the whole thing before you start coding and it will save you time when your forms get really complicated trust me on this one. I spent half a day debugging something because i was using the wrong layout rules at some point its a facepalm moment when it comes down to it.

And yeah thats pretty much all the issues that I experienced related to this layouting issue in streamlit forms. Streamlit form layout can be tricky but once you understand how the context works its much easier. Remember that container is your friend and dont forget to structure your forms in functions.

For more in-depth understanding of Streamlit internals I highly suggest diving into the Streamlit documentation and source code. Seriously the source code is surprisingly readable and it can reveal a lot about how layout rules are calculated. Also check out some research papers about declarative programming and you would understand a bit more about how this system works. Try to focus on UI frameworks that work declaratively it gives you a good understanding of how this all works. Also check out the documentation for Streamlit directly it has all the information you need.

Oh and one more thing why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didnt get arrays

Okay bad joke I know back to forms and columns and no more jokes. I hope that helps and yeah good luck with the app let me know if you have any more questions.
