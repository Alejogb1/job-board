Alright, let's talk about Apache Ignite and its partition map exchange—a subject I've had more than a few late nights dealing with. The question zeroes in on optimization, specifically through baseline auto-adjustment and data rebalancing, which are critical for maintaining performance and availability in a distributed system. It's not a trivial matter; get it wrong, and you'll be chasing performance degradation like a hound after a rabbit.

The core of the issue revolves around how Ignite manages data distribution across the cluster. When a node joins or leaves, the partition map changes. A ‘partition map exchange’ is the process by which all nodes agree on the new map, effectively reassigning partitions and thus, data ownership. Inefficient exchanges can lead to periods of instability, increased latency, and even data unavailability. Optimizing this process, therefore, means ensuring exchanges are fast and efficient, minimizing disruption.

Baseline auto-adjustment is the first piece of this puzzle. The baseline is essentially the list of server nodes that are considered 'stable' and active members of the cluster. It dictates which nodes are involved in data rebalancing when a change occurs. If the baseline isn’t correctly configured, you’re likely to encounter slow exchange times, or rebalancing that never finishes, or simply causes unnecessary strain on nodes that weren’t ready for a large influx of data. We used to manually define this, painstakingly maintaining a list of addresses. That wasn’t sustainable in any dynamic environment, hence the need for auto-adjustment.

Baseline auto-adjustment works by detecting node failures and recovery, automatically updating the list of stable nodes. It's a crucial step as manual adjustments are just not practical at scale. We encountered a scenario in one of our deployments where we were manually adding and removing nodes from the baseline, which led to significant downtime. Switching to auto-adjustment, with a properly tuned `discoverySpi` and `failureDetectionTimeout`, practically eliminated that headache. Ignite’s configuration allows you to specify parameters like `autoAdjustTimeout`, which dictates how long the system waits before removing a failed node from the baseline, and `autoAdjustEnabled`, to control whether it is turned on.

Here's how to enable and configure baseline auto-adjustment using java configuration:

```java
import org.apache.ignite.Ignite;
import org.apache.ignite.IgniteConfiguration;
import org.apache.ignite.configuration.DataStorageConfiguration;
import org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration;
import org.apache.ignite.spi.discovery.tcp.TcpDiscoverySpi;
import org.apache.ignite.spi.discovery.tcp.ipfinder.multicast.TcpDiscoveryMulticastIpFinder;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class BaselineAutoAdjustConfig {

    public static IgniteConfiguration getConfiguration() {
        IgniteConfiguration cfg = new IgniteConfiguration();

        // Configure discovery
        TcpDiscoverySpi tcpDiscoverySpi = new TcpDiscoverySpi();
        TcpDiscoveryMulticastIpFinder ipFinder = new TcpDiscoveryMulticastIpFinder();
        ipFinder.setAddresses(Arrays.asList("228.10.10.10:47500..47509"));
        tcpDiscoverySpi.setIpFinder(ipFinder);
        cfg.setDiscoverySpi(tcpDiscoverySpi);

        // Enable auto-adjustment
        DataStorageConfiguration dataStorageConfiguration = new DataStorageConfiguration();
        dataStorageConfiguration.setAutoAdjustEnabled(true);
        dataStorageConfiguration.setAutoAdjustTimeout(60000); // 60 seconds
        cfg.setDataStorageConfiguration(dataStorageConfiguration);


        return cfg;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Ignite ignite = org.apache.ignite.Ignition.start(getConfiguration())) {
            System.out.println("Ignite cluster is started with auto adjustment enabled.");
            // keep running
            Thread.currentThread().join();

        } catch (Exception e){
            System.out.println("There was an exception :"+e);
        }
    }
}

```

In this configuration, `autoAdjustEnabled` is set to `true`, activating the feature, and `autoAdjustTimeout` is set to 60000 milliseconds (60 seconds), meaning if a node becomes unresponsive for 60 seconds, it is automatically removed from the baseline and will trigger rebalancing.

Next is the rebalancing process itself. Data rebalancing is the act of moving data partitions from one node to another to maintain the desired data distribution. This happens after a change in the baseline. Efficient rebalancing is about moving the right amount of data at the right speed without overwhelming the system.

Ignite offers several ways to fine-tune rebalancing. The key configuration options that heavily influence the speed and overhead include: `rebalanceBatchSize`, which dictates the size of data batches moved during rebalancing; `rebalanceThreadPoolSize`, which controls the number of threads used; and `rebalanceThrottle`, which limits the bandwidth used. We once underestimated the impact of large batch sizes during rebalancing across a heterogeneous network. While we initially aimed for faster transfer, we inadvertently created network congestion, slowing down overall performance. So, proper tuning is necessary based on your network bandwidth and hardware capabilities.

Here's a snippet showcasing how to tune rebalancing using XML configuration:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="ignite.cfg" class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration">
        <property name="dataStorageConfiguration">
          <bean class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.DataStorageConfiguration">
            <property name="rebalanceBatchSize" value="1048576"/> <!-- 1MB per batch -->
            <property name="rebalanceThreadPoolSize" value="4"/>
            <property name="rebalanceThrottle" value="10485760"/> <!-- 10MB/s -->
          </bean>
        </property>
         <property name="discoverySpi">
            <bean class="org.apache.ignite.spi.discovery.tcp.TcpDiscoverySpi">
                <property name="ipFinder">
                     <bean class="org.apache.ignite.spi.discovery.tcp.ipfinder.multicast.TcpDiscoveryMulticastIpFinder">
                         <property name="addresses">
                             <list>
                                 <value>228.10.10.10:47500..47509</value>
                             </list>
                         </property>
                     </bean>
                 </property>
             </bean>
         </property>
    </bean>
</beans>

```

In this configuration, the rebalance batch size is set to 1MB, four threads are dedicated to the task, and the bandwidth is limited to 10MB/s. These values should be adjusted based on your specific hardware and network capabilities.

Finally, it's worth remembering that you should not run rebalancing simultaneously with your daily high load traffic. This is a mistake I’ve personally encountered. Running these concurrently can cause data loss or at least severe performance degradation in your critical services. Consider setting up a rebalancing schedule during the off-peak hours or use ignite’s built-in capability to throttle the speed to minimize the impact on overall system performance.

Here is a simple python example of how to start Ignite with rebalancing throttling using an xml configuration file:

```python
import os
import subprocess

def start_ignite_node(config_file):
    """Starts an Apache Ignite node using the provided configuration file."""

    # Construct the Ignite command.
    ignite_path = os.environ.get("IGNITE_HOME", "/path/to/your/ignite/home")
    if not ignite_path:
      print ("Please set your IGNITE_HOME environment variable correctly")
      return
    
    command = [
        os.path.join(ignite_path, "bin", "ignite.sh"),  # or "ignite.bat" on Windows
        config_file
    ]
    try:
        # Execute the command in a subprocess.
        process = subprocess.Popen(command)
        print(f"Ignite node started with config: {config_file}. PID: {process.pid}")
        # Optionally wait for the process to finish
        # process.wait()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: Could not find the ignite executable. Please check your IGNITE_HOME environment variable.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    config_file_path = "path/to/your/rebalancing-config.xml"  # Replace with actual path
    start_ignite_node(config_file_path)


```

This script simply starts an ignite node based on the given xml configuration. This should be run on each node where you wish to start a server instance of ignite.

For deeper understanding of this topic, I’d recommend reviewing the Apache Ignite documentation, specifically the sections on “Data Rebalancing” and “Discovery and Cluster Management.” The book “Apache Ignite in Action” by Ilya Klyuchnikov and Denis Magda provides very good practical insights. Also, "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann gives a broader perspective on distributed systems that’s highly relevant to Ignite’s underlying concepts. These resources will help anyone looking to master these important aspects of Apache Ignite.
