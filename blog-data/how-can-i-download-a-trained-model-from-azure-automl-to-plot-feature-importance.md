Alright, let's tackle this. It's a common scenario, and frankly, one I've personally debugged a few times. Extracting a trained AutoML model from Azure and then plotting feature importance – it's less straightforward than simply hitting a 'download' button, but definitely doable. We need to get into the specifics of how AutoML stores models and then leverage that knowledge to extract and analyze them.

The first hurdle you'll encounter is that Azure AutoML doesn't always give you a nice, neat single model file like you might find with, say, a hand-trained scikit-learn model. It packages its models into a more complex, often pipeline-based, structure. This is because AutoML often combines preprocessing steps (feature engineering, scaling) with the actual model itself. This pipeline approach is great for consistent deployment, but it makes extracting just the model a bit more involved.

So, how do we accomplish this? Primarily, we'll be using the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK. If you haven't got it installed, I recommend reviewing Microsoft's official documentation; make sure to install the `azureml-sdk` and `azureml-automl-core` packages, along with dependencies like `pandas` and `matplotlib`. I personally tend to use virtual environments to manage my python dependencies, you might find that useful as well.

The general workflow is as follows: first, we establish a connection to your Azure workspace. Then, we retrieve the run where AutoML produced your model. From that run, we pull the 'best' model as selected by AutoML. Finally, we load that model and use its specific methods to extract feature importance. Keep in mind that not every model type supports feature importance calculations. Tree-based models like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), Random Forests, and Decision Trees are excellent for this. Linear models are more simplistic and use the feature weights, rather than a complex analysis of splits like a tree-based method. If your AutoML run used a neural network, feature importance is going to be trickier and require techniques outside of the scope of this specific explanation.

Let's get to some code. Here's an example of how to retrieve the model itself, assuming you know the run id and some other required details:

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace, Run
import joblib
import os
import pandas as pd

# 1. Configure workspace connection
subscription_id = "your_subscription_id"
resource_group = "your_resource_group"
workspace_name = "your_workspace_name"
workspace = Workspace(subscription_id, resource_group, workspace_name)

# 2. Specify the run id of your AutoML run
run_id = "your_automl_run_id"

# 3. Retrieve the run
run = Run(workspace.experiments[0], run_id)

# 4. Download the model artifacts. This will create the required folders
run.download_files(output_path='./model_download')

# 5. Find the model filename.
model_path = os.path.join('./model_download', 'outputs', 'model.pkl')

# 6. Load the model using joblib
try:
  model = joblib.load(model_path)
  print("Model loaded successfully.")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
  exit()

print(f"Model class: {model.__class__}")


```

This snippet first configures the workspace details, which are unique to your Azure setup. After that, it retrieves a specific AutoML run using the run id, then proceeds to download the model artifacts associated with that run and then loads the model using `joblib`. Note the path to the pickled model. AutoML often structures these artifacts nested within directories, so pay attention to the folder structure when performing your load.

Now, let's assume your model is a tree-based model, like a LightGBM classifier. We can extract feature importance directly. This requires the correct accessors for the model type that was trained. In my past experience, I found myself digging into the specific `sklearn` or `lightgbm` implementations because Azure AutoML often wraps these models in an internal pipeline class. Here's an example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Check if the loaded model has a 'steps' attribute,
# this would indicate it is part of a pipeline.
if hasattr(model, 'steps'):
    # If a pipeline, check if the last step is a model
    last_step = model.steps[-1][1]
    if hasattr(last_step, 'feature_importances_'):
        importance = last_step.feature_importances_
        feature_names = model.steps[0][1].transformer_list[0][1].columns
    else:
      print("Model doesn't have feature_importances_ attribute.")
      exit()
else:
  # If it's not a pipeline, directly check if the model itself has the attribute
  if hasattr(model, 'feature_importances_'):
      importance = model.feature_importances_
      # Assuming your dataframe has been assigned to 'df_data'
      feature_names = df_data.columns.tolist()
  else:
      print("Model doesn't have feature_importances_ attribute.")
      exit()

# This is just a sanity check.
if len(importance) != len(feature_names):
    print("Error: Length of importance scores and features do not match!")
    exit()

# Create a dataframe
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({'feature': feature_names, 'importance': importance})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('importance', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)

# Plot feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(feature_importance['feature'], feature_importance['importance'])
plt.xlabel("Features")
plt.ylabel("Importance")
plt.title("Feature Importances")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

In this code, I'm first checking for a `steps` attribute, which typically indicates that the model is part of a pipeline (common with AutoML models). If it's a pipeline, I'm grabbing the actual model at the end of the pipeline using the pipeline's steps, and extracting feature importances there. If not a pipeline, the feature importances are pulled directly from the loaded object. After obtaining the scores, we create a `pandas` dataframe, sort them, and then generate the plot via `matplotlib`. Note the check to ensure the feature names and the scores line up, which I found during debugging, is very necessary.

It's worth pointing out that if your AutoML model is an ensemble model (which it very likely could be), the approach changes. Ensemble methods don't have a single feature importance score. Instead, you might need to calculate the average importance across the models in the ensemble. This can be a little more intricate and might not have direct methods available, and will depend on the specific types of models used in the ensemble, like a voting classifier. For further research, I'd recommend exploring papers discussing methods for aggregating feature importance from ensemble methods (refer to the scikit-learn documentation as a starting point) such as the Mean Decrease in Impurity method.

Finally, here's an example illustrating a scenario where your model was part of a custom pipeline, possibly due to some feature engineering performed in the AutoML configuration:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example simulated pipeline
class CustomPipeline:
    def __init__(self, features):
      self.pipeline = Pipeline([
          ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
          ('gbm', GradientBoostingClassifier())
      ])
      self.features = features

    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.pipeline.fit(X, y)

    def predict(self, X):
        return self.pipeline.predict(X)

    def get_feature_importance(self):
        return self.pipeline.steps[-1][1].feature_importances_

    def get_feature_names(self):
        return self.features


# Sample dataframe for demonstration (replace with your data)
df_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(100, 5), columns=['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3', 'feature4', 'feature5'])
df_target = pd.Series(np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100))

custom_pipeline = CustomPipeline(df_data.columns.tolist())
custom_pipeline.fit(df_data, df_target)

importance = custom_pipeline.get_feature_importance()
feature_names = custom_pipeline.get_feature_names()
# Create a dataframe
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({'feature': feature_names, 'importance': importance})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('importance', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)

# Plot feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(feature_importance['feature'], feature_importance['importance'])
plt.xlabel("Features")
plt.ylabel("Importance")
plt.title("Feature Importances")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

Here, we’re simulating a situation where your model is part of a specific custom pipeline. The key is that you will need to modify the data extraction based on the specific model or class and structure. The code defines a `CustomPipeline` class, similar to how AutoML can chain multiple preprocessing steps. The method `get_feature_importance()` then calls down to the estimator inside of the pipeline. This is similar to how you will need to extract the importance information from your downloaded models.

In conclusion, downloading and analyzing feature importance from Azure AutoML models requires understanding how AutoML structures and saves its models. It often wraps models within pipelines, and you'll need to navigate these to get to the core model for feature importance calculations, and may need to write your own wrapper functions. This is the general process I’ve used in the past and I hope this breakdown is helpful. For more in-depth understanding of the feature importance calculations, research the theoretical background behind the specific type of model returned, as well as the `scikit-learn` and associated documentation on model interpretation and feature importances. Good luck.
