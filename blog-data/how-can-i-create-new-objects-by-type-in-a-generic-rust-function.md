Alright, let's tackle this. It's a common scenario, wanting to instantiate new objects generically within Rust. It’s something I've faced repeatedly, especially when building extensible systems or working with traits that need to produce specific types. You’re essentially asking how to circumvent the static nature of Rust's type system when you don't know at compile-time the concrete type you’ll be working with. The challenge stems from the fact that, unlike some other languages, Rust doesn't have a built-in mechanism for creating new objects based solely on a type variable `T`. The language favors explicit control and memory safety. However, there are a few robust patterns that we can use to achieve this functionality.

First, let's acknowledge the inherent problem: in a generic function, `T` is a placeholder for *any* type that satisfies the trait bounds imposed. Rust can't magically know how to create a `T` if `T` isn’t constrained by a trait that includes an appropriate constructor function. This means we need to bring a constructor mechanism into the picture, typically through the use of traits.

A typical and, I’d argue, the most idiomatic solution, is to define a trait that offers a way to construct the target type. Think of it like a factory pattern.

Here's how that would look:

```rust
trait Constructable {
    fn new() -> Self;
}

fn create_new_object<T: Constructable>() -> T {
    T::new()
}

//Example struct
struct MyStruct {
    value: i32,
}

impl Constructable for MyStruct {
   fn new() -> Self {
       MyStruct{ value: 0 }
   }
}

fn main() {
  let instance: MyStruct = create_new_object();
  println!("Instance value: {}", instance.value);
}
```

In this first code example, `Constructable` is a simple trait with a `new()` associated function, forcing any type that implements it to provide a way to create an instance of itself with no input arguments. Then, `create_new_object` is a generic function constrained by that `Constructable` trait. This pattern allows me to create new `MyStruct` objects via the `create_new_object` function and that is an elegant solution.

However, sometimes you need a constructor that takes arguments. We need a slightly different trait for that scenario. Perhaps you also need different kinds of constructors. In such cases, you may have more than one constructor defined within a struct. Here’s an extension that allows you to pass arguments:

```rust
trait ConstructableWithValue<A> {
    fn new(value: A) -> Self;
}

fn create_new_object_with_value<T, A>(value: A) -> T
where
    T: ConstructableWithValue<A>,
{
    T::new(value)
}


//Example struct
struct MyOtherStruct {
    value: String
}

impl ConstructableWithValue<String> for MyOtherStruct {
    fn new(value: String) -> Self {
        MyOtherStruct { value }
    }
}

fn main() {
  let instance: MyOtherStruct = create_new_object_with_value("Hello".to_string());
  println!("Instance value: {}", instance.value);
}

```

In this example, `ConstructableWithValue` is parameterized with a type `A` representing the argument of the constructor. Now, the `create_new_object_with_value` function is also generic over this type `A`, reflecting that the constructor takes an argument of type `A`. This solution is flexible and can accommodate a variety of construction patterns. For instance, you may have multiple constructors for your struct. This solution allows you to call the specific one you want, rather than being forced to choose a single implementation. I have had to use this technique in situations where a struct can be created using different inputs and this is the only safe way of handling this.

Lastly, a more involved approach I've used and which can be incredibly powerful is using function pointers or closures within the trait definition. Let me illustrate this. This offers a high degree of flexibility at the cost of slight complexity:

```rust
trait ConstructableFunc<A, Output> {
    fn constructor_func() -> fn(A) -> Output;
}


fn create_new_object_with_func<T, A>(value: A) -> T
where
    T: ConstructableFunc<A, T>,
{
    let constructor = T::constructor_func();
    constructor(value)
}

//Example struct
struct MyFinalStruct {
    value: i32,
    multiplier: i32
}


impl ConstructableFunc<i32, MyFinalStruct> for MyFinalStruct{
    fn constructor_func() -> fn(i32) -> MyFinalStruct{
          |value| MyFinalStruct { value, multiplier: 2 }
    }
}

fn main() {
  let instance: MyFinalStruct = create_new_object_with_func(10);
  println!("Instance value: {}, Multiplier {}", instance.value, instance.multiplier);
}


```

Here, `ConstructableFunc` provides a function that returns the constructor function itself. This is particularly useful when the logic required for construction is more involved or needs to be generated dynamically at runtime. It also demonstrates how to return an anonymous function, or closure. This offers the most flexibility but requires more careful handling. This approach also enables you to use function factories where more complicated logic might exist than can be expressed easily inline in the struct itself. For instance, when caching or other types of complicated patterns are required.

Now, for some resources that I've found invaluable:

*   **"Programming Rust" by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora F. S. Tindall**: A deep dive into Rust's core concepts, this book covers generics and traits thoroughly. It's a great comprehensive resource to build your understanding on rust programming concepts.

*   **The official Rust documentation**: Specifically, the sections on traits, generics, and associated types will be particularly useful. The official documentation is a good place to start as it provides the latest reference material and is updated frequently.

*   **The "Rust by Example" website**: It has hands-on examples that help to see these concepts in practice. It is very easy to use and gives you practical insight without too much theory.

In my experience, using these approaches, I’ve been able to tackle a wide range of problems, from creating generic data structures to implementing flexible plugin systems. The key takeaway is to remember that Rust forces you to be explicit about how types are created. While this may seem limiting initially, it leads to more robust and predictable code in the long run. Always favor the most direct and type-safe approach that satisfies your requirements, which, in most cases, involves employing a trait with a constructor function or a similar mechanism. You don't always need the complexity of function pointers unless you need the dynamic nature they provide.
