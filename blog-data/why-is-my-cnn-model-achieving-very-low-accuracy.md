Alright, let's dive into the weeds of why your convolutional neural network (CNN) is performing poorly. It’s a common frustration, and honestly, I’ve spent more late nights debugging these than I care to remember. Low accuracy, as you're experiencing, typically stems from a confluence of factors rather than a single isolated issue. We’ll unpack several key culprits, and I'll draw on some past projects to illustrate.

First off, let's consider the data. It's cliche, but it's the cornerstone of everything in machine learning. I recall a project a few years back, classifying images of different types of fasteners. The initial model was… terrible. It turns out, the dataset had a significant imbalance. We had thousands of images of screws, but barely a handful of specialized bolts. The model, predictably, learned to just classify everything as a screw. This brings us to the first potential issue: imbalanced datasets. If your dataset doesn't adequately represent all classes, the model will become biased towards the majority class. Secondly, the data might be noisy. Images that are blurry, poorly lit, or contain irrelevant background information can severely confuse a CNN. Finally, data augmentation is crucial; a lack of it might mean your model overfits to the exact images it's trained on, failing to generalize to slightly varied inputs.

To illustrate the importance of balancing your classes, let’s look at a python snippet using the `sklearn` library, a common and powerful way to balance your dataset using sampling techniques:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.utils import resample

def balance_classes(features, labels):
    unique_labels = np.unique(labels)
    max_class_size = max(np.sum(labels == label) for label in unique_labels)
    balanced_features = []
    balanced_labels = []

    for label in unique_labels:
        class_features = features[labels == label]
        if len(class_features) < max_class_size:
          resampled_features = resample(class_features,
                                        replace=True,
                                        n_samples=max_class_size,
                                        random_state=42)
          balanced_features.extend(resampled_features)
          balanced_labels.extend([label]*max_class_size)
        else:
          balanced_features.extend(class_features)
          balanced_labels.extend([label]*len(class_features))

    return np.array(balanced_features), np.array(balanced_labels)

# Sample usage with dummy data (replace with your actual data)
features = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 3)
labels = np.array([0] * 70 + [1] * 30) # Imbalanced
balanced_features, balanced_labels = balance_classes(features, labels)
print(f"Original label counts: {np.unique(labels, return_counts=True)[1]}")
print(f"Balanced label counts: {np.unique(balanced_labels, return_counts=True)[1]}")
```

This snippet takes your features and labels and resamples the data based on the class size that is maximum in the dataset. This gives your model an equal set of data to work with, improving accuracy in situations with imbalanced data. Note that depending on your specific task, you might need to consider other data balancing techniques, such as using synthetic minority oversampling techniques (SMOTE).

Next, the architecture itself often plays a significant role. Too few layers, and your model might be unable to learn complex representations, resulting in underfitting. Too many layers or parameters, on the other hand, can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but fails on unseen examples. Also, the choice of activation functions, pooling layers, and the number of filters in each convolutional layer is important. I once spent days trying to optimize a facial recognition system only to discover that the initial filter size was simply not capturing the fine features needed. The architecture was essentially crippling its ability to learn the subtle details necessary for accurate classification.

To address this, try visualizing the feature maps produced by your network. This helps you understand what the filters are learning. To further tune the architecture, a common technique is using a simple grid search over the different parameters using keras tuner, as seen below:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras_tuner import Hyperband
import numpy as np


def build_model(hp):
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Conv2D(
            filters=hp.Int('conv_1_filter', min_value=32, max_value=128, step=32),
            kernel_size=hp.Choice('conv_1_kernel', values=[3, 5]),
            activation='relu',
            input_shape=(28, 28, 3)
        ),
        keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        keras.layers.Conv2D(
            filters=hp.Int('conv_2_filter', min_value=64, max_value=256, step=64),
            kernel_size=hp.Choice('conv_2_kernel', values=[3, 5]),
            activation='relu'
        ),
        keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        keras.layers.Flatten(),
        keras.layers.Dense(
            units=hp.Int('dense_units', min_value=128, max_value=512, step=128),
            activation='relu'
        ),
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model


def tune_model(x_train, y_train, max_epochs=10):
    tuner = Hyperband(
        build_model,
        objective='val_accuracy',
        max_epochs=max_epochs,
        factor=3,
        directory='my_dir',
        project_name='cnn_tuning'
    )
    tuner.search(x_train, y_train, validation_split=0.2, verbose=0)
    return tuner.get_best_models(num_models=1)[0]

# Dummy data for demonstration
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 3)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)

best_model = tune_model(x_train, y_train)

print(best_model.summary())
```

This code allows you to tune multiple parameters within the network, and by using the validation accuracy it allows you to pick the parameters most likely to perform well on unseen data.

Finally, let's talk about training. A high learning rate can cause the model to oscillate around the optimal weights, preventing it from converging. A low learning rate, while stable, can lead to extremely slow training or the network might get stuck in a local minimum. Furthermore, not using regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, can result in overfitting. Similarly, the choice of optimizer and its associated parameters is also vital. If your model isn’t converging to an optimal state during training, that should be the first thing you investigate.

Let’s look at a common dropout example with keras:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np


def create_model_with_dropout():
    model = keras.Sequential([
      keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 3)),
      keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
      keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
      keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
      keras.layers.Flatten(),
      keras.layers.Dropout(0.5), # Adding dropout with 50% dropout rate
      keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model


def train_and_evaluate_model(x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test):
    model = create_model_with_dropout()
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)
    loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
    return accuracy

# Generate dummy data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 3)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)
x_test = np.random.rand(20, 28, 28, 3)
y_test = np.random.randint(0, 10, 20)


accuracy = train_and_evaluate_model(x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This adds a dropout layer, which randomly drops connections to nodes during training and helps with preventing overfitting.

For a deeper understanding of these topics, I strongly recommend exploring the original "Deep Learning" textbook by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville for a solid theoretical foundation, and the "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, which is very practically oriented. Additionally, research papers on specific topics such as "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift" (Ioffe & Szegedy) could give you more insight into the optimization process. It is also recommended to check the documentation of whatever framework you are using, such as Tensorflow and Pytorch, to become more familiar with parameters and how the library expects them.

In conclusion, low accuracy in CNN models rarely has a single reason. It usually involves a combination of data quality issues, architectural deficiencies, and suboptimal training practices. Thoroughly examine each area, experiment with different settings, and you'll likely see a significant improvement. Don't get discouraged; it’s a process, and we’ve all been there.
