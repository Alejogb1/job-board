, let’s tackle this. It's a problem I've encountered firsthand, particularly back in the late aughts when web security wasn’t quite the front-and-center concern it is today. We were building a system for aggregating user reviews, and the filtering functionality, specifically involving ranges in the `having` clause, became a significant vulnerability point. It taught me some valuable lessons I’d like to share.

The crux of the issue when using a range in a `having` clause isn't necessarily that the clause itself is inherently weak; the vulnerability arises from how you, the developer, introduce user input into the query. Direct, unsanitized concatenation of user-provided strings into the SQL query is the prime vector for sql injection. Consider a scenario where you have a reviews table and you want to allow users to filter reviews based on the number of ratings they have received.

A naive approach might look something like this in pseudocode:

```pseudocode
min_ratings = get_user_input("min_ratings");
max_ratings = get_user_input("max_ratings");
sql_query = "SELECT product_id, count(*) AS rating_count FROM reviews GROUP BY product_id HAVING rating_count >= " + min_ratings + " AND rating_count <= " + max_ratings;
execute_query(sql_query);
```

See the problem? If `min_ratings` or `max_ratings` become malicious payloads instead of simple integers, the implications are considerable. Think about what happens if a user inserts `"1 OR 1=1; --"` as `min_ratings`--your query now becomes vulnerable, possibly returning unauthorized data or worse, allowing database manipulation.

The primary method to mitigate this is **parameterized queries** or **prepared statements**. This approach separates the SQL code from the data. You define the structure of the query once, and then you feed in user-supplied data as parameters. The database driver handles escaping and sanitization, thereby preventing malicious SQL code from being interpreted as actual instructions.

Let me show you how this works in practice. I’ll provide examples using different languages to give you a broader view of the technique.

**Example 1: Python with psycopg2 (PostgreSQL):**

```python
import psycopg2

def get_filtered_reviews(min_ratings, max_ratings, connection):
    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            sql = "SELECT product_id, count(*) AS rating_count FROM reviews GROUP BY product_id HAVING rating_count >= %s AND rating_count <= %s"
            cursor.execute(sql, (min_ratings, max_ratings))
            results = cursor.fetchall()
            return results
    except psycopg2.Error as e:
        print(f"Database error: {e}")
        return None


# Example usage (assuming you have a connection object named 'conn')
min_ratings_input = 5
max_ratings_input = 20

# The parameters are passed as a tuple.
filtered_reviews = get_filtered_reviews(min_ratings_input, max_ratings_input, conn)


if filtered_reviews:
    for row in filtered_reviews:
        print(f"Product ID: {row[0]}, Rating Count: {row[1]}")
```
Notice the placeholders `%s`? These are where the actual values will go; they are passed as parameters in `cursor.execute()`. This way, the database engine knows that these values are data and not part of the SQL commands, thus preventing injection.

**Example 2: Java with JDBC (MySQL):**

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class ReviewFilter {

    public static void getFilteredReviews(int minRatings, int maxRatings, Connection conn) {
      String sql = "SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) AS rating_count FROM reviews GROUP BY product_id HAVING rating_count >= ? AND rating_count <= ?";
      try(PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        pstmt.setInt(1, minRatings);
        pstmt.setInt(2, maxRatings);
        try(ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery()) {
          while(rs.next()) {
             System.out.println("Product ID: " + rs.getInt("product_id") + ", Rating Count: " + rs.getInt("rating_count"));
          }
        }
      } catch (SQLException e) {
        System.err.println("Database error: " + e.getMessage());
      }
    }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage (assuming you have a database connection named 'connection')
        int minRatingsInput = 5;
        int maxRatingsInput = 20;

        // Replace with your actual database connection
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourdatabase";
        String user = "youruser";
        String password = "yourpassword";

        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)){
            getFilteredReviews(minRatingsInput, maxRatingsInput, connection);
        }
        catch(SQLException e){
          System.err.println("Connection error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Here, question marks `?` are placeholders, and `pstmt.setInt()` is used to assign values to them. The `PreparedStatement` handles escaping. The core principle remains the same: separation of SQL code and data.

**Example 3: PHP with PDO (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc):**

```php
<?php
function getFilteredReviews($minRatings, $maxRatings, $pdo) {
  $sql = "SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) AS rating_count FROM reviews GROUP BY product_id HAVING rating_count >= :min_ratings AND rating_count <= :max_ratings";
  $stmt = $pdo->prepare($sql);
  $stmt->bindParam(':min_ratings', $minRatings, PDO::PARAM_INT);
  $stmt->bindParam(':max_ratings', $maxRatings, PDO::PARAM_INT);

  try {
      $stmt->execute();
      $results = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
      return $results;
  } catch(PDOException $e){
      echo "Database error: " . $e->getMessage();
      return null;
  }

}

//Example usage (assuming you have a PDO connection named '$pdo')
$minRatingsInput = 5;
$maxRatingsInput = 20;
$filteredReviews = getFilteredReviews($minRatingsInput, $maxRatingsInput, $pdo);


if ($filteredReviews) {
    foreach ($filteredReviews as $row) {
        echo "Product ID: " . $row['product_id'] . ", Rating Count: " . $row['rating_count'] . "\n";
    }
}
?>
```
In the PHP example with PDO, named placeholders (`:min_ratings`, `:max_ratings`) are used, and `bindParam()` ensures that these parameters are treated as data. The `PDO::PARAM_INT` parameter in this case is also beneficial, although not required for SQL injection prevention, as it ensures type safety when binding.

These examples clearly illustrate that the vulnerability isn’t inherent to the `having` clause but to how you handle user-supplied data. Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Never concatenate unsanitized user input directly into your SQL strings.

For further understanding, I recommend diving deep into the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) resources, particularly their section on SQL Injection, which provides in-depth coverage of this and other common vulnerabilities. Also, the book "SQL Injection Attacks and Defense" by Justin Clarke is an excellent resource that provides a very practical view on the topic with tons of real world examples. Finally, reading about the specific database’s driver documentation (like psycopg2 for postgres) will give you more insight into how parameter binding works. These resources were crucial during my own learning curve. In short, remember that data and code should *never* be treated the same; the key is strict separation. Your diligence will save you a lot of headaches down the line, trust me on that one.
