, let’s unpack this one. I've seen this exact scenario play out more times than I care to count, usually during the iterative stages of model refinement. The issue of a deep neural network (dnn) producing time series predictions that, while close-ish, don’t quite mirror the trained labels, especially when using a windowed dataset, is a nuanced problem with several potential causes. It's rarely a single culprit, but rather an interplay of factors, and understanding each is key to getting those predictions to align properly.

The core concept at play here is that your model is learning to approximate an underlying function from the training data. However, it does this within the confines of its architecture, the training process, and importantly, the way the data is presented via the windowing process. So when things diverge, it's worth revisiting each of these aspects.

First off, let's consider the nature of windowing. It's inherently a process of slicing a continuous time series into smaller, overlapping (or not) subsequences. Each window becomes an independent training instance, but with an implicit dependence on the sequence order. The crucial point is that the model doesn't 'see' the full time series context at once, but rather these localized segments. If the underlying time series dynamics exhibit long-range dependencies, your model might struggle to fully capture this based only on the localized views provided by the windows. This can lead to a smoothing effect in the predictions or an inability to capture rapid changes in the time series that span multiple windows. This manifests as predictions that lag, are dampened, or simply don't match the sharpness of the actual target.

Next, let’s look at the model itself. The chosen dnn architecture greatly influences the prediction quality. Recurrent networks (rnns), and in particular LSTMs or GRUs, are designed specifically to handle temporal sequences, but even they aren’t magic. The internal hidden states that store sequence information can experience vanishing or exploding gradients, making it harder to retain information across extended sequences or to learn from subtle temporal relationships. Also, the number of layers and units within these layers needs to be appropriate for the complexity of the time series; insufficient capacity will result in underfitting, leading to imprecise predictions, while excessive capacity risks overfitting to the training windows, losing generalization ability on unseen data.

Finally, the training process, specifically the chosen loss function and optimizer configuration, can dramatically impact the outcome. Mean squared error (mse), for instance, is a common loss function for regression, but might not be the best fit for time series prediction, especially if the objective is to capture shape rather than just overall magnitude. You might observe that your predictions tend to follow the general trend, but do not quite replicate the details; this is often an indication of a mismatch between the chosen loss function and what you want your model to optimize for.

To illustrate, let's consider a simplified example using a synthetic time series with a sinusoidal pattern that also includes noise:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Generate synthetic data
def generate_time_series(length=200, noise_std=0.1):
    x = np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, length)
    y = np.sin(x) + np.random.normal(0, noise_std, length)
    return y.reshape(-1, 1)

# Windowing function
def window_data(data, window_size, stride=1):
    windows = []
    for i in range(0, len(data) - window_size, stride):
        windows.append(data[i:i+window_size])
    return np.array(windows)

# Parameters
series_length = 200
window_size = 20
stride = 1
epochs = 50
batch_size = 32

# Generate and scale
raw_series = generate_time_series(series_length)
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_series = scaler.fit_transform(raw_series)

# Create windows
windows = window_data(scaled_series, window_size, stride)
x = windows[:, :-1] # Input
y = windows[:, -1]  # Target

# Reshape for LSTM input
x = x.reshape(x.shape[0], x.shape[1], 1)

# Define the model (simple LSTM)
input_layer = Input(shape=(window_size - 1, 1))
lstm_layer = LSTM(units=50)(input_layer)
output_layer = Dense(units=1)(lstm_layer)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train
model.fit(x, y, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, verbose=0)

# Predict
test_window = scaled_series[:window_size-1].reshape(1,window_size - 1, 1)
prediction = model.predict(test_window)
predicted_value = scaler.inverse_transform(prediction)
print(f'Predicted Value: {predicted_value[0][0]}')

```

In this first example, a simple LSTM network is used to predict the next point in a sine wave. Note that while you'll get a prediction, it may not perfectly match the shape of the original sine wave. The model is attempting to capture the next value, but it only sees a limited window of the past.

Let's consider another example where the issue is more pronounced due to a larger window size, and we modify the model to use a GRU layer instead of an LSTM:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, GRU, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Generate synthetic data (same as above)
def generate_time_series(length=200, noise_std=0.1):
    x = np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, length)
    y = np.sin(x) + np.random.normal(0, noise_std, length)
    return y.reshape(-1, 1)

# Windowing function (same as above)
def window_data(data, window_size, stride=1):
    windows = []
    for i in range(0, len(data) - window_size, stride):
        windows.append(data[i:i+window_size])
    return np.array(windows)

# Parameters (larger window size)
series_length = 200
window_size = 50
stride = 1
epochs = 50
batch_size = 32

# Generate and scale
raw_series = generate_time_series(series_length)
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_series = scaler.fit_transform(raw_series)

# Create windows
windows = window_data(scaled_series, window_size, stride)
x = windows[:, :-1] # Input
y = windows[:, -1]  # Target

# Reshape for GRU input
x = x.reshape(x.shape[0], x.shape[1], 1)

# Define the model (simple GRU)
input_layer = Input(shape=(window_size - 1, 1))
gru_layer = GRU(units=50)(input_layer)
output_layer = Dense(units=1)(gru_layer)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train
model.fit(x, y, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, verbose=0)

# Predict
test_window = scaled_series[:window_size-1].reshape(1,window_size - 1, 1)
prediction = model.predict(test_window)
predicted_value = scaler.inverse_transform(prediction)
print(f'Predicted Value (GRU, Larger Window): {predicted_value[0][0]}')


```

Here, the problem is further highlighted because the increased window size can make it more difficult for a simple recurrent network to capture subtle changes. The GRU layer is similar to the LSTM, but it's not a guaranteed fix, the issue remains.

Finally, we can attempt to improve the performance by increasing the network's complexity and adding more layers and also add a specific metric to focus on the overall shape using mean absolute error (mae):

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Generate synthetic data (same as above)
def generate_time_series(length=200, noise_std=0.1):
    x = np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, length)
    y = np.sin(x) + np.random.normal(0, noise_std, length)
    return y.reshape(-1, 1)

# Windowing function (same as above)
def window_data(data, window_size, stride=1):
    windows = []
    for i in range(0, len(data) - window_size, stride):
        windows.append(data[i:i+window_size])
    return np.array(windows)


# Parameters (larger window size)
series_length = 200
window_size = 50
stride = 1
epochs = 100
batch_size = 32

# Generate and scale
raw_series = generate_time_series(series_length)
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_series = scaler.fit_transform(raw_series)

# Create windows
windows = window_data(scaled_series, window_size, stride)
x = windows[:, :-1] # Input
y = windows[:, -1]  # Target

# Reshape for LSTM input
x = x.reshape(x.shape[0], x.shape[1], 1)

# Define the model (more complex LSTM with dropout)
input_layer = Input(shape=(window_size - 1, 1))
lstm_layer1 = LSTM(units=100, return_sequences=True)(input_layer)
dropout_layer1 = Dropout(0.2)(lstm_layer1)
lstm_layer2 = LSTM(units=50)(dropout_layer1)
output_layer = Dense(units=1)(lstm_layer2)
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mae') #using mae for capturing shape.

# Train
model.fit(x, y, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, verbose=0)


# Predict
test_window = scaled_series[:window_size-1].reshape(1,window_size - 1, 1)
prediction = model.predict(test_window)
predicted_value = scaler.inverse_transform(prediction)
print(f'Predicted Value (Complex LSTM, MAE): {predicted_value[0][0]}')
```

This third example demonstrates that increasing model complexity and using mean absolute error as a loss function tends to improve the model's ability to replicate the overall shape but not perfect.

To further deepen your understanding, I’d strongly recommend diving into specific literature on time series analysis and deep learning. A foundational text such as "Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control" by Box, Jenkins, Reinsel, and Ljung is invaluable for understanding classical time series methods. For the deep learning aspects, "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet, and “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron are excellent resources. Additionally, exploring research papers that focus specifically on time series forecasting with deep learning would provide invaluable insights on advanced architectures and methodologies.

In summary, the discrepancy between your dnn’s predictions and the target time series when using windowed data is a multifaceted issue stemming from how the data is presented, the capabilities of the model, and the chosen training methodology. It's often a process of iterative experimentation and analysis, and a solid understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects is critical for achieving satisfactory results.
