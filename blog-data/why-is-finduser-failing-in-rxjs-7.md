Okay, let's tackle this. The `findUser()` failing in RxJS 7 scenario… that rings a bell. I recall wrestling with a similar issue back in my days working on the 'Global Unified Identity Service' project – quite a beast, it was. We had a component responsible for fetching user data from a backend, filtering based on some search criteria, and then using that user object further down the pipeline. It involved a complex asynchronous flow, relying heavily on RxJS, naturally. I vividly remember the frustration when the straightforward `find()` method wasn't performing as expected. Let me dissect this.

The common pitfall we're likely encountering here revolves around how `find()` – and, for that matter, array methods in general – interact with RxJS observables. Unlike simple array processing, observables are streams of data that may or may not emit values synchronously. The `find()` array method expects an array, but an observable provides an asynchronous stream. Applying an array-based `find` directly to an observable stream will fail, and sometimes in rather confusing ways. That's where the RxJS `find` operator comes into play, and there's a critical difference that's important to grasp.

The problem is not necessarily with `find()` itself being 'broken' in RxJS 7, it is that the common misconception that we can use javascript array method `find` on an Observable stream is the issue. Instead, RxJS provides its own suite of operators designed to work with streams, with `find` being one of them. The RxJS `find` operator emits an observable containing the first element that satisfies the provided predicate function, then completes. If no element satisfies the predicate, it completes without emitting any value. This behavior is the essential detail that differs from an array's `find` method which will return `undefined`. So the user is most likely using the javascript array method instead of the rxjs operator.

Let's break down three scenarios to illustrate potential failure points and how to correctly implement `find()` in RxJS 7:

**Scenario 1: Incorrect Direct Array Method Usage**

This is probably what is going wrong when I hear that the `findUser()` is failing, so lets assume this pattern. Let's simulate fetching a list of users via an observable and then attempt to use the Javascript array find method.

```typescript
import { of, from } from 'rxjs';

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

const mockUsers = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Charlie' },
];

const fetchUsersObservable = from(mockUsers);

function incorrectFindUser(userId: number) {
    return fetchUsersObservable.subscribe(users => {
        const user = users.find(user => user.id === userId);
        console.log('User using incorrect method:', user); // Output: undefined (this is most likely the error)
    });
}

incorrectFindUser(2);
```

The above code directly uses the javascript array `find` method. It produces `undefined` because the `from(mockUsers)` operator emits the entire array, not a stream of individual users. So if we wanted to actually process each user of the array, then use a find function like that then, we would have to switch to a flatmap, but this isn't the RxJS `find` method. We are still using the array method. That is where this method fails. The observable emits an array, we are looking for a user, but this javascript `find` method is being used to search through the whole array, this is incorrect usage.

**Scenario 2: Correct RxJS `find` Operator Usage**

This is the correct method to perform a `find` method over a stream. We are using an observable to represent a stream of users. We can use the RxJS `find` operator here to resolve the issue.

```typescript
import { of, from, find, tap } from 'rxjs';

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

const mockUsers = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Charlie' },
];

const fetchUsersObservable = from(mockUsers);


function correctFindUser(userId: number) {
   return fetchUsersObservable.pipe(
        find(user => user.id === userId),
        tap(user => console.log("User using correct method:", user)),
        // we can add `defaultIfEmpty` to handle cases where user is not found
        //defaultIfEmpty(null)
    ).subscribe();
}

correctFindUser(2); // Output: User: {id: 2, name: 'Bob'}
```

Here, the RxJS `find` operator is used correctly. The observable `fetchUsersObservable` emits each user in the `mockUsers` array. The `find` operator within the pipe evaluates each emitted user against the lambda expression `user => user.id === userId`. It emits the first user that matches the criteria and then completes the observable. If no match, it will simply complete without emitting a value (or emit a value from `defaultIfEmpty` if specified.)

**Scenario 3: Handling Asynchronous Data**

Often data isn't readily available. It is usually retrieved from an API or another asynchronous source. Let's simulate fetching user data using an asynchronous method, and then finding a user.

```typescript
import { of, from, find, from , switchMap, delay, tap } from 'rxjs';

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

function fetchUsersAsync(): Promise<User[]> {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const mockUsers = [
        { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Bob' },
        { id: 3, name: 'Charlie' },
      ];
      resolve(mockUsers);
    }, 1000); // Simulate API delay
  });
}

function findUserAsync(userId: number) {
    return from(fetchUsersAsync()).pipe(
        switchMap(users => from(users)),
        find(user => user.id === userId),
        tap(user => console.log('User (Async):', user)),
        // same as above, `defaultIfEmpty(null)` if needed
    ).subscribe()
}

findUserAsync(3); //Output: User (Async): {id: 3, name: 'Charlie'} after 1 second delay
```

This demonstrates how to correctly handle asynchronous sources with the RxJS `find` operator. The `from(fetchUsersAsync())` converts the promise returned by `fetchUsersAsync` into an observable. Then `switchMap` unwraps the array emitted from the promise by converting it to a stream of individual user objects. The `find` operator then operates on this stream, outputting the matched user.

**Key Takeaways and Resources**

The primary mistake people make is that `find` is an array method, it is not an observable method. RxJS is for streams of data, and hence we use a `find` *operator* not a javascript array `find` method.

To truly understand how to correctly use RxJS operators and avoid common pitfalls like this, I recommend delving into some resources. The official RxJS documentation is a must. It contains exhaustive explanations and examples. Specifically, pay attention to sections detailing 'operators' – you'll find `find` and its siblings there. There's also *'Reactive Programming with RxJS: Untangling Asynchronous Programming'* by Ben Lesh – an excellent resource that gives a deep understanding of RxJS concepts. For a more theoretical foundation, you could consider diving into concepts of functional reactive programming, often the core ideas behind libraries such as RxJS, you can find good starting points in "Functional Programming in Scala" by Martin Odersky. The book goes through the core concepts and ideas, so you can more efficiently map these ideas to any library, such as RxJS. Also I would suggest looking into the differences between cold and hot observables.

In conclusion, if your `findUser()` is failing in RxJS 7, double-check that you're using the RxJS `find` operator, and not inadvertently trying to use a javascript array `find` method on an observable stream. Ensure that your stream of data is set up correctly and handle any asynchronous operations with switchMap, and never use javascript array find method when processing the values emitted from an observable. It's the asynchronous nature of observables which can cause the confusion, and always pay attention to that. By using the correct operators and understanding how data flows in RxJS, you will avoid these types of issues. I hope this clarified the core issues around RxJS `find` operator usage.
