Alright,  It's a frustration I've definitely seen surface multiple times, and it usually comes down to a few core concepts that are easy to overlook when you're moving fast with containerized deployments. Specifically, the issue of a docker stack not reflecting file system changes after a new image is deployed often boils down to misunderstandings about how volumes are handled, image layering, and orchestration updates.

In my time working on a large-scale microservices platform – we had a whole team dedicated to containerization, and I remember pulling my hair out on more than one occasion because of similar issues – I’ve learned these are seldom simple, one-size-fits-all fixes. It's a nuanced interaction of several components, so let’s unpack it.

First, let’s discuss volumes. In the docker ecosystem, volumes are the way we persist data or share data between containers and the host, or even between different containers. When you mount a directory into a docker container from your host, any changes *within the container* won’t, by default, alter your *original source* directory. This is particularly crucial if your application is relying on files within those mounted directories because the behavior will vary depending on whether you are writing from within or outside the container, and on whether the volume is bound or named. A good start here is always to review the docker-compose.yml file, specifically the volumes section. Have you mistakenly hardcoded the wrong path to your source directory, and is it perhaps pointing to a cached version or a location not under active development? These are common oversights.

The second, perhaps less intuitive factor is the image layering system. Docker images are built up in layers, each corresponding to a command in the Dockerfile. When a container starts, it takes the base image layers and creates a thin read-write layer on top. Crucially, if the changes you're referring to happen during *build-time*, they're baked into the image layers. So, if your application needs to download something via a `RUN` command in your Dockerfile and that download changes, you won't see that update in your currently running container *unless you rebuild that docker image*. You will not see the files update simply by deploying with a new image tag; what's changed on your local development machine has not been included in the image, nor copied on container startup, and therefore will not be reflected in your mounted volume. It's not a live sync mechanism. This highlights the importance of carefully separating build-time concerns from run-time concerns in your setup.

Finally, let's consider the orchestration side, which, if you're using docker swarm or kubernetes for example, adds an extra layer of complexity. Orchestration engines manage container deployments. If you deploy a new image, orchestration will usually attempt a rolling update. It will bring down an existing container and start a new one using the new image definition and specified volumes. However, orchestration *won't* just rewrite mounted directories to match new file contents embedded into the new image. The key here is understanding that the orchestration system is focused on starting containers with a specified image, and dealing with their life cycle, not modifying the underlying host file system via mounted volumes.

So, with that in mind, let's demonstrate some specific examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect Volume Mounting**

Let's assume you have a simple application that reads a config file from a mounted volume. The `docker-compose.yml` looks like this:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  app:
    image: my-app:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
```

And the associated directory structure for our application is:

```
config/
    config.json
app.py
docker-compose.yml
Dockerfile
```

Initially, `config.json` has:

```json
{
  "setting": "old"
}
```

If you now go and change `config.json` to:

```json
{
  "setting": "new"
}
```

and then deploy your stack using `docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my_stack`, and if your application is merely reading the file on startup, you'd expect that 'setting' would be 'new' now. But because docker does not update mount points like this automatically (it reads it once on container start), the container will still show 'old'. You would need to restart the container. This is because the container loaded the file at startup and did not have any change in its *local* `app/config` directory after the `config.json` was altered. Therefore, the running container does not see the changed version of your configuration file.

**Example 2: Build-time versus Run-time changes**

Here, let's assume you have an application that uses a `data.txt` file, but this time we download this file with a `RUN` command during image creation:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
RUN wget -qO /app/data.txt https://example.com/data.txt
COPY app.py /app
CMD ["python", "/app/app.py"]
```

In the `app.py`:

```python
with open('/app/data.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()
print(data)
```

And the `docker-compose.yml` looks like this:
```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  app:
    build: .
    image: my-app:latest
```

If `data.txt` changes on `https://example.com/data.txt`, and you merely re-run `docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my_stack`, you will not see the changed data because the `wget` was executed when the image was built. That image layer is now immutable and running inside the container. It does not reach out again to example.com on container startup. The correct action is to rebuild the image with the updated external file. In this case, you would need to either rebuild the image via `docker build --no-cache -t my-app:latest .` and re-deploy or use a method to read this file at run-time (via a volume mount, a configuration server, etc.)

**Example 3: Orchestration and Rolling Updates**

Consider a similar setup where the container reads a `config.json` file from a mounted volume, but this time, we are working with a swarm service.

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  app:
    image: my-app:latest
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 3
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
```
Again, the `config.json` is present at `./config/config.json`. If you change `config.json` and then use `docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my_stack`, the orchestration engine will try to do a rolling update. It will take down one container at a time and bring it back up with your current, local definition, which contains no changes to `config.json` after it was initially mounted. The new containers will therefore reflect the content of config.json on startup, but the changes you made locally after initial deployment were not incorporated. If you want containers to pick up changes in a volume, then a redeploy is required. And to get the changed version in the container, a rebuild and redeploy is required to update the image layer.

In essence, to truly address this problem, you need to ensure your volumes are mounted correctly, understand when changes become part of the image (build time), and that your orchestration logic updates do not rely on docker implicitly refreshing host directories through mounted volumes.

For a deeper understanding of these concepts, I would recommend these resources:

*   **"Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton:** This is a fantastic, detailed book that covers the nuances of Docker’s architecture, layering, and volume management.
*   **Docker documentation itself**: The official docker documentation is a fantastic resource, and it is worth spending time reading through all the major components. It is more useful than most realise.
*   **Kubernetes in Action by Marko Luksa:** Though technically focusing on kubernetes, it provides valuable insight into the orchestration side of container deployment and how state is managed.
*   **Various blog posts and tutorials on Docker best practices:** There are many, but finding authors with extensive experience will be beneficial; focus on well-regarded industry experts.

In conclusion, it’s never a single thing causing the issue of a docker stack not reflecting file system changes. A solid understanding of these core concepts is crucial for reliable deployments. I've spent many long nights debugging such problems and these are the core issues to consider first. It's a learning process, but attention to the details in the configuration and process is what's needed.
