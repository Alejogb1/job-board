Okay so you need to pull random numbers from an existing matrix and build a new one cool I've wrestled with this kind of thing plenty of times back in the day it's like a bread and butter problem for data analysis or simulation stuff

Let's break it down first off youâ€™re talking about random numbers and matrices so NumPy is your friend if you're not using it already seriously go install it it's the base of pretty much anything matrix based in python I mean like 90% of it maybe 95%

Now the basic idea is we're not just going to fill a new matrix with completely random stuff we want randomness but we want it to come from a specific source your big matrix it's like picking balls from a bag but you don't want new color of balls you only want the ones you already have

So there are a couple of ways to do this that i usually use and that i have used a lot on my previous jobs mostly when i was doing large scale simulation when i was working on a climate models those were rough days i tell ya

**Method 1 direct random selection**

The most straightforward way to get this is to randomly pick coordinates in your big matrix and grab the value from there That's how i started learning how to do this things when i was a young padawan using matlab but this is easily done with numpy's indexing

Here's some code showing that using python and numpy:

```python
import numpy as np

def random_matrix_from_source_v1(source_matrix, new_shape):
    source_rows, source_cols = source_matrix.shape
    new_rows, new_cols = new_shape

    new_matrix = np.zeros(new_shape)

    for i in range(new_rows):
        for j in range(new_cols):
            rand_row = np.random.randint(0, source_rows)
            rand_col = np.random.randint(0, source_cols)
            new_matrix[i, j] = source_matrix[rand_row, rand_col]
    return new_matrix

#Example of usage
source = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
new_shape = (2, 2)
result = random_matrix_from_source_v1(source, new_shape)
print (result)
```

This code creates a new matrix with the dimensions defined in the new_shape argument it loops through every element in the new matrix and for each one it picks a random row and column of the source matrix using `np.random.randint` then copies the value from that random position in the source to that position in the new matrix you know i was not born knowing all this.

Okay i hear you saying this is not very performatic and yes you are right this will be very slow for big matrices because for loops in python for this are not a great idea

**Method 2 Using flattened indices**

Now this is where it get's a little bit better to improve speed here's a way that does not use for loops at all this uses flattened index for a way faster approach. This was a technique i picked up while reading some paper i do not remember which one but i can vouch for the performance improvement

```python
import numpy as np

def random_matrix_from_source_v2(source_matrix, new_shape):
    source_rows, source_cols = source_matrix.shape
    new_size = np.prod(new_shape)

    # Flatten the matrix
    flattened_matrix = source_matrix.flatten()

    # Generate random indices
    random_indices = np.random.randint(0, flattened_matrix.size, new_size)

    # Get the random values from the flattened matrix and reshape it
    new_matrix = flattened_matrix[random_indices].reshape(new_shape)
    return new_matrix

#Example of usage
source = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
new_shape = (2, 2)
result = random_matrix_from_source_v2(source, new_shape)
print (result)
```

Okay so instead of looping through each cell of the output matrix we flat the source matrix that turns it into a big vector using `source_matrix.flatten()` then generate a set of random indices using the `randint` function these indices are used to directly access elements in the flattened version of the matrix and we reshape the result to the shape you initially wanted

This is generally faster than the nested loop approach and that's why i use it in most cases. And let's face it nobody likes waiting for a program to finish right especially when you are a data scientist and your boss is breathing down your neck.

Now sometimes you want unique elements meaning you don't want the same value to show up twice in the new matrix. Let me tell you this was a pain in the ass i had to rewrite the same code so many times back when i was working in the hospital with medical data this could have saved me a lot of hours

**Method 3 sampling without replacement**

When you want a sample with no replacements we use the technique of shuffling all the numbers and the picking a sample. I mean you could do it by generating numbers and looping and checking for uniqueness but we are better than that. Here is a better solution:

```python
import numpy as np

def random_matrix_from_source_v3(source_matrix, new_shape):
   source_rows, source_cols = source_matrix.shape
   new_size = np.prod(new_shape)
   flattened_matrix = source_matrix.flatten()

   if new_size > flattened_matrix.size:
      raise ValueError("new shape too big for source matrix need to change shape")

   random_indices = np.random.choice(flattened_matrix.size, new_size, replace=False)
   new_matrix = flattened_matrix[random_indices].reshape(new_shape)
   return new_matrix

#Example of usage
source = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
new_shape = (2, 2)
result = random_matrix_from_source_v3(source, new_shape)
print (result)
```

Here is how this code works this is using the method from `v2` but using `np.random.choice` it has a `replace` argument so you can avoid repeated numbers on the new matrix. If you want to generate a matrix with a size bigger than your source matrix size you will need to change the shape or the program will crash

In terms of resources I'd say look into the NumPy documentation it is really good it's the best thing out there when it comes to numpy and also you can find some papers on computational simulations this is where all the cool tricks are. Seriously look at these papers they are not boring at all. Oh you can also check some books that focus on scientific computing these also help a lot.

So yeah that's how you pull random values from a matrix with numpy and turn that in a new matrix with a new shape. I hope this is what you were looking for if not let me know. I'm here all week to try to help

Oh and just one more thing before i finish: why did the programmer quit his job because he didn't get arrays?
