Okay so you're looking for tools or websites to help with database normalization huh Been there done that man Let me tell you it's a pain in the neck if you don't get it right from the get-go I've spent countless nights debugging data inconsistencies because some junior dev thought denormalization was cool

So here's the deal First off no magic bullet exists no single website or tool will just magically normalize your database for you It's a process a thinking process that you have to understand and apply tools just assist you So don't think you can just throw your schema at a tool and be done with it

I've seen so many projects tank because of bad database design trust me It's often the thing people overlook especially when they're building quick prototypes but it will come back to bite you in the ass later So don't be lazy do it right

What you actually need to understand are the normal forms 1NF 2NF 3NF BCNF and so on I'm not gonna explain them here you can google them for sure or better yet grab a good database design book like "Database Systems Concepts" by Silberschatz Korth and Sudarshan That's a classic and it covers all that fundamental stuff in detail

Now to the tools They're mostly used for visualising your schema and helping you detect normalization issues rather than magically fixing it for you

First we have database design tools they're like diagram editors for your database they allow you to create ER diagrams or relational schemas and see how your tables relate to each other You will find these in almost any development environment I personally prefer using the one built in my database client but you can find lots of alternatives like MySQL Workbench or Dbeaver they let you create diagrams move tables around and define relationships You can use those to see if your tables are dependent on non-key attributes which are telltale signs for normalization issues I’m pretty sure you know that but just in case you don’t I’m saying it

Here’s a super simple example of an SQL creation for a bad table design

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(255),
    customer_address VARCHAR(255),
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    product_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    order_date DATE
);
```

This table is not in 1NF because it has composite values and repeating groups like customer_name and customer_address which are not atomic Then you have product_name and product_price mixed with order information This is an immediate red flag when it comes to normalization

Secondly you might want to use some data modelling tools These tools allow you to not just draw diagrams but also to define the attributes of your tables their types constraints and so on Some of them can also generate SQL code from your design which can speed things up I've played around with a bunch of these in the past when I started but they're not all that different from database design tools to be honest I liked using draw io or Lucidchart for quick and dirty diagrams especially when collaborating

Now for actual online resources not websites per se you should look for stuff on database design best practices you will find lots of articles and tutorials on specific aspects of normalization they are super useful to grasp the concepts I'd recommend checking out academic databases like ACM Digital Library or IEEE Xplore if you are willing to go through some research papers they often have in-depth articles on the topic They will be much more helpful than some blog post of someone learning SQL

So lets improve the table by normalizing a bit here is a new one in 1NF at least

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(255),
    customer_address VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    product_price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);
```

Here we separated customers and products into different tables and orders now uses ids to reference them we have a clear one to many relationship here and we have rid of some of the atomicity and dependency problems

Lastly I’d like to highlight data analysis tools if you are dealing with an existing database and are not able to perform a full redesign as that is very expensive sometimes these tools can come in handy You can use them to identify patterns in your data data duplication and inconsistencies that might be symptoms of bad database design and need normalization I have spent hours looking at millions of rows of data in data analysis tools to understand why there is an anomaly in the system it’s exhausting believe me if you can avoid it do it with a good design upfront

One time I was working on a project where the database had not been normalized properly and we were getting duplicate data all over the place Turns out the client table had multiple addresses for the same client because the table was not in 2NF it was a disaster I had to write several scripts to clean the mess and migrate to a correct schema it was like performing database surgery

Here is a small example of a query that can help you to identify this type of problem if we had an order with two or more products you can identify them by the order_id

```sql
SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS product_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

This query will display order ids that have more than one item associated to it if you have a one to many design and you see more than one it could indicate a problem it might not but it is worth checking

One thing to remember is that normalization is not a binary thing it's a spectrum sometimes you might choose to denormalize for performance reasons or other constraints just know the trade offs and why you are doing it

Also a joke I've heard once Why was the database so bad at poker Because it always had too many tables and no relation with the dealer... hehe get it table relations okay sorry it was terrible

Bottom line don't rely solely on tools or websites think about the problem you are trying to solve and apply the normalization principles to your database design Good luck
