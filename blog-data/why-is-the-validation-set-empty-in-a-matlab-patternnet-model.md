Alright, let's tackle this. An empty validation set during training with a `patternnet` in matlab can certainly be frustrating, and it's a problem I’ve encountered more than a few times in my work. I remember one particularly tricky project, a predictive maintenance model for complex machinery where data preparation and proper configuration were paramount. We were experiencing this exact issue, and it wasn't immediately clear why the validation set was consistently empty. It took some careful investigation to pinpoint the root cause and implement the right fix. Let me walk you through what commonly goes wrong and how to effectively address this issue, along with some practical examples.

The core problem stems from how you're structuring your data and defining the training parameters for your neural network. The `patternnet` function within matlab's deep learning toolbox automatically divides your input data into training, validation, and test sets. However, if not configured correctly, the default behavior can result in an empty validation set. Generally, the issue falls into one of these areas: either the data hasn't been prepared correctly, there isn't enough data for all three sets given your chosen split, or the parameters for the data division aren't specified as needed.

Here's a breakdown of these points, keeping things practical:

1. **Insufficient data:** `patternnet`, by default, attempts to split your data into 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. If you provide the function with a very small data set, these default proportions can result in no items being assigned to the validation set. For instance, if your dataset consists of, say, 10 samples, then 15% is 1.5 samples which, being rounded to zero, results in an empty validation set.

2. **Incorrect data format:** The `patternnet` expects the input data to be structured correctly. Specifically, it needs to see data where each column represents a feature and each row represents an instance or sample. If the data is not organized this way, or if your labels (targets) are not appropriately separated, the split might not work as intended. Specifically, be aware that inputs and target matrices need to be transposed so that inputs are in columns, where every column represents an instance, or an example.

3. **Explicit data splitting configuration:** It is possible to define the indices for training, testing and validation sets. If the ranges you specify are not correct, you could inadvertently specify an empty validation set. For example, if you intend to only use the first 80 percent for training and the last 20 percent for testing, your validation indices could be out of range.

Now, let's examine some code snippets illustrating these points:

**Example 1: Insufficient data with default split:**

```matlab
% generate a small dataset with only 10 samples
inputs = rand(5, 10);  % 5 features, 10 samples
targets = round(rand(1, 10)); % Binary classification for simplicity

%create and train patternnet using default configuration
net = patternnet(10);
net = train(net,inputs,targets);

% check number of validation samples
numValidationSamples = length(net.divideFcn);
disp(['Number of validation samples: ', num2str(length(net.divideInd.val))]);
```
In this example, if you execute this, it would likely show that your validation set is empty, because 15% of 10 is 1.5, which rounds down to 0. This demonstrates a straightforward situation where default splits fail due to low sample count. The fix here is either to get more data or modify the split ratios using the next approach.

**Example 2: Configuring data splitting with custom parameters:**

```matlab
% Generate more data for testing custom splits
inputs = rand(5, 100);
targets = round(rand(1, 100));

% Define custom split ratios
net.divideFcn = 'divideind';
trainRatio = 0.7;
valRatio = 0.15;
testRatio = 0.15;

% Calculate indices for each set, ensuring they are integers
numSamples = size(inputs, 2);
trainSize = floor(numSamples * trainRatio);
valSize = floor(numSamples * valRatio);
testSize = numSamples - trainSize - valSize;

% Set the divide indices
net.divideInd.train = 1:trainSize;
net.divideInd.val = (trainSize + 1):(trainSize + valSize);
net.divideInd.test = (trainSize + valSize + 1):numSamples;

% Train the network using explicit splitting parameters
net = patternnet(10);
net = train(net,inputs,targets);


% check number of validation samples
numValidationSamples = length(net.divideInd.val);
disp(['Number of validation samples: ', num2str(numValidationSamples)]);

```

In this second example, we explicitly use the 'divideind' function to control the split ourselves. we calculate the indices to be used for training, validation and testing. You should see that in this case, validation has a valid number of samples.

**Example 3: Incorrect data format:**
```matlab
% Generate data with rows as features
inputs_incorrect = rand(10, 5); % 10 samples as features instead of columns
targets = round(rand(1,10));

% attempting to use incorrectly formatted data
net = patternnet(10);

try
    net = train(net, inputs_incorrect, targets);
catch ME
    disp('Error encountered:');
    disp(ME.message);
end

% Generate data with correct feature format
inputs_correct = rand(5, 10); % 5 features, 10 samples

net = patternnet(10);
net = train(net, inputs_correct, targets);

% check number of validation samples
numValidationSamples = length(net.divideInd.val);
disp(['Number of validation samples: ', num2str(numValidationSamples)]);
```

Here, we demonstrate what happens when the data is structured incorrectly with each *row* representing a feature. Attempting to train a network with that setup will usually result in an error, since the training algorithm expects features to be columns. We then correct the data and show that in that instance, the validation dataset is no longer empty.

To dive deeper into this subject, I strongly suggest focusing on resources covering data preparation and model configuration for neural networks. Specifically, the documentation that accompanies matlab’s deep learning toolbox is very valuable, especially concerning the `patternnet` function. Also, for a more general and foundational perspective on neural network design, *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville is an essential text. And for a mathematical treatment of machine learning algorithms including neural nets, *The Elements of Statistical Learning* by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman will prove useful. These sources provide a robust theoretical framework and practical insights that go far beyond what I have summarized here.

In closing, an empty validation set in a `patternnet` model is generally a consequence of how your data is managed, configured and passed to the network. I have found that methodically evaluating data dimensions, explicit data split parameters and, naturally, double checking the data itself (making sure your features are columns and samples are rows), solves most of the issues. Careful configuration, coupled with understanding the documentation will allow you to train effective models.
