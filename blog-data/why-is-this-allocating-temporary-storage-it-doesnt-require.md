, let’s tackle this. I've seen this pattern countless times, and it’s often more nuanced than it initially appears. It’s frustrating to observe an application seemingly allocating temporary storage unnecessarily, especially when performance and resource management are crucial. The 'why' behind such behavior typically stems from a complex interplay of factors within the code, the underlying environment, and sometimes even the compiler itself. It's rarely just one thing.

First, let’s break down what 'temporary storage' often implies. We’re usually talking about dynamically allocated memory on the heap, or perhaps stack space utilized for intermediate results, like within a function call. When you see this happening unexpectedly, it's typically due to one or more of these root causes: eager evaluation, implicit type conversions, the generation of intermediate objects or copies, inefficient algorithms, or even interactions with external libraries that don’t quite behave as we'd expect.

In my experience, working on a high-throughput data processing engine some years ago, I encountered a similar situation. We had a component that was unexpectedly creating a large number of temporary strings during data transformations. Debugging revealed it wasn't one single line of code, but a combination of factors. Initially, we assumed it was simply a poorly designed algorithm, but the investigation went deeper. We discovered it was a combination of implicit type conversions within our data processing pipeline and the lack of in-place operations within our string manipulation functions. Specifically, our intermediate operations for transformations like removing certain characters resulted in creating entire new strings even though the initial string could have been modified in-place. This unnecessary copying led to excessive temporary storage allocation.

Now, let’s explore specific examples with corresponding code to illustrate.

**Example 1: Implicit Type Conversions and Temporary Objects**

In many languages, especially those with loose typing, implicit type conversions can lead to temporary object creation. Take this python snippet as an example:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return str(result)

num1 = 5
num2 = 10.5
sum_string = calculate_sum(num1, num2)
```

Here, although seemingly straightforward, an integer `num1` is being implicitly promoted to a float during the addition with `num2`. Then, this float result is converted to a string within `calculate_sum` before returning. This process results in a temporary float object and a temporary string object being created. The magnitude of this may not be apparent for single cases like this, but in loops, this can quickly lead to issues. Languages like C++ offer more control, but similar problems can arise if you're not careful with operator overloading.

**Example 2: Eager Evaluation and Intermediate Lists**

Consider this example using a list comprehension in Python:

```python
def process_data(data):
    filtered_data = [x * 2 for x in data if x > 5]
    squared_data = [y ** 2 for y in filtered_data]
    return squared_data

data = list(range(10))
result = process_data(data)
```

This code is fairly common; filtering and then mapping values in two list comprehensions. The issue lies in the creation of the `filtered_data` list, which acts as a temporary intermediary. Although clean, this eager evaluation allocates a whole new list in memory, that is only used to process it further and not for any persistent data storage. In many cases, you could use generator expressions, or itertools functionalities instead, which would lazily evaluate the data and only generate the intermediate data when actually needed.

**Example 3: Inefficient Algorithm and String Manipulation**

Let’s look at a slightly more complex, illustrative C++ example, which I used to see far more often than I care to remember in projects that were not well optimized:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

std::string process_string(const std::string& input) {
    std::string result = "";
    for (char c : input) {
        if (c != 'a') {
            result += c;
        }
    }
    return result;
}


int main() {
  std::string myString = "this is a string with a lot of a's in it";
  std::string processed = process_string(myString);
  std::cout << processed << std::endl;
}
```

In this C++ example, the `+=` operator on a `std::string` within a loop repeatedly allocates new memory, copies the existing content, and appends the new character. This approach can become extremely costly for large strings. A better option would be to use `push_back` on the string or build the resulting string directly with a `std::string::reserve` and `std::string::append` to control the allocation explicitly. The same issue arises in other languages such as Java with string concatenation in loops.

To address these issues, the first thing to consider is profiling. Tools like Valgrind (for C/C++) or Python's `cProfile` can often pinpoint the exact places where excessive allocation occurs, helping to zero in on the 'why.' We always had to profile every critical section of our previous data processing engine to ensure no temporary storage issues were arising. After profiling, techniques like in-place operations, using generator expressions (or similar constructs), and avoiding unnecessary copying are crucial. In the case of our data processing pipeline, we refactored our transformation functions to operate in-place or to use more efficient string builder techniques, drastically reducing the memory footprint.

For further study on these kinds of memory management problems, I would strongly recommend reviewing *Effective C++* by Scott Meyers or *Modern C++ Design* by Andrei Alexandrescu for more in-depth knowledge on how to address such issues in C++. For more general programming considerations, specifically with regards to memory management, “Operating System Concepts” by Abraham Silberschatz is also helpful. Specific books on algorithms and data structures can also provide greater insights into algorithmic choices, ensuring they avoid creating unnecessary temporary storage.

In short, the problem you're facing rarely has one simple cause and solution. The key is careful analysis, profiling, understanding the language specifics you're working with, and using efficient design patterns to avoid unnecessary allocations. This is something I’ve seen, and continue to see frequently, and the solutions always lie within a deeper understanding of your systems.
