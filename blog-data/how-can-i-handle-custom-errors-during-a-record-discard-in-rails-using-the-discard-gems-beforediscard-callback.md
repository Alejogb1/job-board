Okay, let's dive into this. I've definitely been in situations where a simple discard action needs more nuanced handling, particularly when custom business logic and potential errors are involved. Using the `before_discard` callback with the Discard gem in Rails provides a good point for this, but it's essential to structure it correctly to avoid unintended consequences. I remember specifically a project involving a complex inventory system where discarding an item could impact multiple dependent records – a scenario prone to errors if not carefully managed. What I discovered is that we need a methodical approach to ensure data integrity while providing informative feedback.

The core issue is that `before_discard` runs *before* the discard action is actually committed. This means you have a chance to validate conditions, perform related actions, and importantly, halt the discard process if something goes awry. The first mistake many developers make is to treat it like a `before_validation` callback. We need to remember, this is happening after the object has passed its validity checks and has already been selected to be discarded. This callback is a last chance, not a first line of defense against invalid data.

So, how do you handle custom errors? Let’s think about it in the context of a record, say, an `Order` object that you want to discard. Instead of just letting the discard occur, we might need to check, for example, if the order has already been shipped before we can discard it. If it has, we shouldn't let it be discarded and must return a clear error. We don’t just want to block the discard, we need to let the application know *why* and, if needed, prevent the user from taking that path. The `before_discard` callback provides the perfect hook for this.

Here is the general pattern I've seen work well, and I'll explain the code in the snippets below:

1.  **Implement the `before_discard` callback:** In your model, define a method to be executed by the callback, ensuring that it returns `false` if the discard should be prevented.
2.  **Add custom error messages:** Attach meaningful error messages to the model when the discard is prevented, which can be used to provide feedback in your application’s user interface or logging.
3.  **Conditional logic:** Embed business rules in the callback to determine if a discard is permissible, making sure to check all relevant related records to ensure data consistency.

Here's the first code snippet, a basic example demonstrating the fundamental concepts:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include Discard::Model

  before_discard :prevent_discard_if_shipped, if: :discardable?

  def prevent_discard_if_shipped
    if shipped?
      errors.add(:base, "Cannot discard an order that has already been shipped.")
      throw :abort # This prevents the discard
    end
  end

  def shipped?
      # Logic to check if the order is marked as shipped (simplified)
      shipping_date.present? && shipping_date < Time.current
    end

    def discardable?
      # Check if the model should run the before_discard callback
      # this is useful when conditional logic must be run
      true
    end
end
```

In this snippet, if the `shipped?` method returns true, then an error is added and `throw :abort` is executed to stop the discard. It's imperative to use `throw :abort` here, because returning false alone doesn't prevent the discard, but only the callback chain from continuing. It's not intuitive, but that's how Rails' callbacks work in these scenarios. Note the addition of the `discardable?` method and `if: :discardable?`. This ensures that the callback will only run if the condition in `discardable?` returns true.

Building upon that, what about a more complex scenario? Imagine an order might have associated payment records, and we want to ensure there are no pending payments before a discard can occur. Here is our second code snippet, which demonstrates checking for related records with specific statuses:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include Discard::Model

  has_many :payments

  before_discard :prevent_discard_with_pending_payments, if: :discardable?

  def prevent_discard_with_pending_payments
      if payments.exists?(status: 'pending')
          errors.add(:base, "Cannot discard an order with pending payments.")
          throw :abort
      end
  end

    def discardable?
      # Check if the model should run the before_discard callback
      # this is useful when conditional logic must be run
      true
    end
end
```

This example checks for pending payments using an active record query. If any pending payments exist, it appends the error message and prevents the discard. This keeps things consistent. You can extend this method to handle multiple conditions by concatenating validations. This emphasizes the need for careful validation of the data at this point to ensure consistent and accurate data handling.

Now, let's expand upon this even further. What if we need to perform some related actions and log the outcome before discarding (or not discarding), without halting execution of the discard process based on the result? We could use a callback method that doesn’t `throw :abort` and instead stores information or performs logging after checking for errors. Also, let's consider that we have a relationship to an order's `items` and we only want to delete if all items are discarded, otherwise we raise an error.

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include Discard::Model

  has_many :payments
  has_many :items

  before_discard :check_for_discard_eligibility, if: :discardable?

  def check_for_discard_eligibility
    if payments.exists?(status: 'pending')
        errors.add(:base, "Cannot discard an order with pending payments.")
        throw :abort
    end
    unless items.all?(&:discarded?)
        errors.add(:base, "Cannot discard an order if items are not also discarded")
      throw :abort
    end
     # perform logging, updating an audit table, etc without halting the process
    Rails.logger.info("Order discard attempt for order id: #{self.id} has passed validation")
  end

  def discardable?
    # Check if the model should run the before_discard callback
    # this is useful when conditional logic must be run
    true
  end
end
```

In this final code block, we are logging the result of the `before_discard` callback after all the checks have been executed. No matter what, the logging will occur. The key here is that we use `throw :abort` to halt the process if our business conditions are not met, otherwise we allow the discard operation to continue after logging. This allows for an auditing system that can monitor the validity of discard operations for compliance.

For resources to delve deeper into this topic, I recommend focusing on some of the more foundational literature. The core Rails documentation is always the place to start for understanding how callbacks work in general. Additionally, "Agile Web Development with Rails" by Sam Ruby, David Bryant, and Dave Thomas provides an excellent explanation of how to use Rails’ various callbacks with real-world examples. If you're interested in error handling, the section on exceptions in "Confident Ruby" by Avdi Grimm can enhance your approach beyond just the basic `errors.add` approach. And finally, "Refactoring Ruby Edition" by Martin Fowler, et al provides valuable techniques for structuring methods for error validation and making your code more readable and maintainable. Focusing on these will help you build resilient systems capable of gracefully managing custom errors while using Discard.

Remember, the critical aspect is that the `before_discard` callback is your last chance to check the condition of your data before a discard and ensure you’re capturing and reporting those errors correctly. Understanding this will let you manage record discard processes in a controlled and predictable way.
