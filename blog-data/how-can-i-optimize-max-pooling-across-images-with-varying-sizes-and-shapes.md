Right then,  I recall a particularly challenging project a few years back involving medical imaging where we had to process a mountain of scans, all shapes and sizes, using convolutional neural networks. The bottleneck, as it often is, came down to optimizing max pooling operations. The naive implementations just wouldn't cut it, leading to unacceptable processing times. Dealing with variable input dimensions, as you've pointed out, requires some careful thought.

The fundamental problem with max pooling on varying image sizes is that the straightforward, kernel-sliding implementation needs to be generalized. You can't simply define a fixed-size pool and expect it to work gracefully on inputs that are arbitrarily smaller. Furthermore, performance suffers if you’re constantly recalculating pooling parameters or padding all inputs to a common size. This can be particularly wasteful with very small images where the actual pooling might be redundant given the image’s dimensions.

One approach that I found beneficial was a dynamic pooling method, where the pooling window and stride are calculated based on the input’s dimensions. Essentially, instead of using a predefined window size, you calculate the stride to ensure the output has the desired size (typically smaller than the input), and then calculate window size based on that stride. The idea is to scale the pooling operation according to the input size. This usually involves some math upfront, but it pays dividends in terms of computational efficiency, especially when you have many varied image dimensions.

Let's demonstrate this concept with a Python snippet using `numpy`, which is fairly straightforward and transparent. Keep in mind that in real-world projects, you would likely use optimized libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, which provide similar functionality but are heavily optimized for GPU usage. I’m using numpy for illustration because of its clarity:

```python
import numpy as np

def dynamic_max_pool(input_array, output_size):
    input_height, input_width = input_array.shape
    output_height, output_width = output_size

    stride_height = input_height // output_height
    stride_width = input_width // output_width
    
    if stride_height == 0:
      stride_height = 1
    if stride_width == 0:
      stride_width = 1

    pool_height = input_height - (output_height - 1) * stride_height
    pool_width = input_width - (output_width - 1) * stride_width

    output = np.zeros(output_size)

    for y_out in range(output_height):
        for x_out in range(output_width):
            y_start = y_out * stride_height
            y_end = y_start + pool_height
            x_start = x_out * stride_width
            x_end = x_start + pool_width
            
            output[y_out, x_out] = np.max(input_array[y_start:y_end, x_start:x_end])
            
    return output

# Example Usage
image1 = np.random.rand(32, 32)
pooled_image1 = dynamic_max_pool(image1, (8, 8))
print(f"Image1 Input Size: {image1.shape}, Output Size: {pooled_image1.shape}")

image2 = np.random.rand(64, 128)
pooled_image2 = dynamic_max_pool(image2, (16, 32))
print(f"Image2 Input Size: {image2.shape}, Output Size: {pooled_image2.shape}")

image3 = np.random.rand(16, 4)
pooled_image3 = dynamic_max_pool(image3, (4, 1))
print(f"Image3 Input Size: {image3.shape}, Output Size: {pooled_image3.shape}")
```

This `dynamic_max_pool` function calculates the stride based on the desired output size, ensuring consistent output dimensions regardless of the input's size. Notice that I've added checks for when the input size is smaller than the target output size along the dimension. In those cases, I'm setting the stride to 1. This prevents a division by zero, but you should be careful about how the pool is computed when the size of the image is small, as you might not achieve the desired output shape.

Another strategy I've used effectively is adaptive pooling, which is akin to this dynamic pooling, but with a slight difference. Instead of calculating the strides and window size upfront, adaptive pooling aims to force an output of a pre-defined size by calculating pooling parameters on the fly per input image, effectively resizing the feature maps through pooling. Libraries like PyTorch have this built-in, but let's explore how to mimic this in a more general way, building upon the previous `numpy` example:

```python
import numpy as np

def adaptive_max_pool(input_array, output_size):
    input_height, input_width = input_array.shape
    output_height, output_width = output_size
    
    height_ratio = float(input_height) / output_height
    width_ratio = float(input_width) / output_width

    output = np.zeros(output_size)
    
    for y_out in range(output_height):
        for x_out in range(output_width):
            y_start = int(y_out * height_ratio)
            y_end = int((y_out + 1) * height_ratio)
            x_start = int(x_out * width_ratio)
            x_end = int((x_out + 1) * width_ratio)

            # Ensure the indices don't go out of bounds
            y_end = min(y_end, input_height)
            x_end = min(x_end, input_width)

            output[y_out, x_out] = np.max(input_array[y_start:y_end, x_start:x_end])
            
    return output

# Example Usage
image1 = np.random.rand(32, 32)
pooled_image1 = adaptive_max_pool(image1, (8, 8))
print(f"Image1 Input Size: {image1.shape}, Output Size: {pooled_image1.shape}")

image2 = np.random.rand(64, 128)
pooled_image2 = adaptive_max_pool(image2, (16, 32))
print(f"Image2 Input Size: {image2.shape}, Output Size: {pooled_image2.shape}")

image3 = np.random.rand(16, 4)
pooled_image3 = adaptive_max_pool(image3, (4, 1))
print(f"Image3 Input Size: {image3.shape}, Output Size: {pooled_image3.shape}")
```

This `adaptive_max_pool` function calculates the start and end indices for the pooling window based on a ratio between the input and output dimensions. This strategy has proven quite effective when needing to enforce specific output sizes, which can be useful with networks that have a fixed fully connected layer following the convolutional layers.

Finally, consider the batching of images with varying sizes. Instead of padding all images to the same size, a better approach is to sort them by their shape before batching. This strategy can improve batch processing efficiency and minimize computational overhead. This is because you don't waste resources on padding out smaller images. If you’re using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, these frameworks support such dynamic padding and batching quite efficiently. However, if you are rolling your own solution, you would have to implement it explicitly. Here's a simple illustration of how to batch a list of images with varying dimensions and then perform the adaptive max pool on them:

```python
import numpy as np

def batch_adaptive_max_pool(images, output_size):
    pooled_images = []
    for image in images:
        pooled_image = adaptive_max_pool(image, output_size)
        pooled_images.append(pooled_image)
    return np.stack(pooled_images)

# Example Usage
image1 = np.random.rand(32, 32)
image2 = np.random.rand(64, 128)
image3 = np.random.rand(16, 4)

images = [image1, image2, image3]

pooled_batch = batch_adaptive_max_pool(images, (8, 8))
print(f"Pooled batch shape: {pooled_batch.shape}")
```

In this example, we’re simply iterating through each image, performing the adaptive pooling individually, and then stacking the results. In a real-world implementation in PyTorch or TensorFlow, you’d use the built-in batch processing and adaptive pooling mechanisms for optimized performance.

For further exploration on these topics, I recommend researching these resources: "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, for a comprehensive understanding of CNNs and pooling. Look into papers discussing adaptive pooling techniques. In particular, a deep dive into the documentation for PyTorch's and TensorFlow's implementations of adaptive pooling is useful as well. Pay close attention to how their adaptive pooling operations are implemented under the hood to fully understand the performance tradeoffs. These resources should provide a solid foundation for optimizing your pooling operations on images of varying sizes. Remember that profiling and benchmarking are your best friends when fine-tuning such a system.
