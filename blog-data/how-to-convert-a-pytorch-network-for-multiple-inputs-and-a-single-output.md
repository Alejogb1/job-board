so, you're tackling the multi-input, single-output problem with a pytorch network, eh? yeah, been there, done that, got the slightly-dented server rack to prove it. it's a common scenario, especially when you start moving beyond the standard image classification tasks and venture into more complex areas, like, say, sensor fusion or time-series analysis with various data streams.

the core issue, as i see it, is how to effectively combine the different input streams before they feed into the final output layer. pytorch, thankfully, is pretty flexible about this, letting you build solutions in a bunch of ways. the key thing is to plan your architecture beforehand.

let's walk through some common approaches, along with some code snippets to get you started. i'll also throw in some background based on my past debugging nightmares and a couple of resources that i've found helpful.

first, the most straightforward solution often involves concatenating the input tensors. imagine each input is a feature vector; you can treat them as columns and simply stack them up. this is usually the first thing i try when i'm prototyping. it's simple, it's fast to implement, and it often gets you most of the way there. here's what that looks like in pytorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiInputNetConcat(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_sizes, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MultiInputNetConcat, self).__init__()
        self.input_sizes = input_sizes
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.output_size = output_size

        # we'll have a layer for each input that could change the tensor size
        self.input_layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(in_size, hidden_size) for in_size in input_sizes])

        # this fully connected layer will output the result
        self.fc = nn.Linear(sum([hidden_size for i in input_sizes]), output_size)


    def forward(self, inputs):
      transformed_inputs = [input_layer(input_tensor) for input_layer, input_tensor in zip(self.input_layers, inputs)]
      x = torch.cat(transformed_inputs, dim=1)
      x = self.fc(x)
      return x

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # example usage
    input_sizes = [10, 20, 15]
    hidden_size = 32
    output_size = 1

    net = MultiInputNetConcat(input_sizes, hidden_size, output_size)
    inputs = [torch.randn(1, input_size) for input_size in input_sizes]

    output = net(inputs)

    print("output shape:", output.shape)
```

in this code, the `MultiInputNetConcat` class takes a list of input sizes and then uses `nn.modulelist` to store the fully connected layers that will transform each of the incoming tensors. then, in the forward pass, i'm just using torch.cat to combine them along the second dimension (dim=1). the resulting output is then passed to one final layer to get the output. simple, huh? well, not always, as i discovered during the great 'tensor mismatch of '19. basically, i had some input streams changing shapes without warning, leading to runtime errors and a very annoyed me.

a crucial thing to note with this method is that you might need to preprocess each input stream individually, especially if they represent different types of data. i remember once when i tried to combine raw sensor data with image features, the network just completely ignored the image data. the problem was that sensor values were in a very different range than image features. normalizing each input separately to a common range fixed it immediately. this is one of those "lessons learned the hard way" scenarios.

now, sometimes, simply concatenating inputs isn't enough, especially if your input streams have more complex interdependencies. in such cases, you might want to consider a more nuanced architecture that learns how to combine these streams. this could mean using separate subnetworks for each input stream, and then combining the outputs of those subnetworks via some merging network, not just simple concatenation.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiInputNetSubnets(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_sizes, hidden_sizes, output_size):
        super(MultiInputNetSubnets, self).__init__()
        self.input_sizes = input_sizes
        self.hidden_sizes = hidden_sizes
        self.output_size = output_size
        # subnets are stored here in this nn.modulelist
        self.subnets = nn.ModuleList([
           nn.Sequential(
               nn.Linear(in_size, hidden_size),
               nn.ReLU(),
               nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
           ) for in_size, hidden_size in zip(input_sizes, hidden_sizes)
        ])
        # we have a single linear layer to output the result
        self.fc = nn.Linear(sum(hidden_sizes), output_size)

    def forward(self, inputs):
        # each input is passed to its respective subnetwork
        subnet_outputs = [subnet(input_tensor) for subnet, input_tensor in zip(self.subnets, inputs)]
        # the resulting tensors are concatenated
        x = torch.cat(subnet_outputs, dim=1)
        # final processing layer
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # example usage
    input_sizes = [10, 20, 15]
    hidden_sizes = [32, 64, 32]
    output_size = 1

    net = MultiInputNetSubnets(input_sizes, hidden_sizes, output_size)
    inputs = [torch.randn(1, input_size) for input_size in input_sizes]

    output = net(inputs)

    print("output shape:", output.shape)
```

this example uses a simple sequential model as a sub network. but each subnetwork could also be much more complex depending on the complexity of the input. for instance, if one input is a sequence, you could use an rnn here. also, note the use of hidden sizes as a separate input parameter; this can be used to add more flexibility when combining the tensors. i had to debug a similar issue when one input was much more important than another, and the weights needed more flexibility to adjust to the most useful features. i spent a good few days in the lab scratching my head before finally realizing that. this is why modular networks are always preferred.

another approach, and a personal favorite, is to use a transformer network when your different inputs have a time series component. the idea here is to treat each input stream as a sequence of tokens and then use self-attention to learn how to combine them. this is especially handy when dealing with temporal dependencies within and between your different input sources. imagine having several sensors collecting data at slightly different frequencies, you can use a transformer network to combine this information. here's a basic example of how you might start:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn import TransformerEncoder, TransformerEncoderLayer

class MultiInputTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_sizes, hidden_size, output_size, nhead, num_layers):
        super(MultiInputTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.input_sizes = input_sizes
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.output_size = output_size
        self.input_projections = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(in_size, hidden_size) for in_size in input_sizes])

        encoder_layers = TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=hidden_size, nhead=nhead)
        self.transformer_encoder = TransformerEncoder(encoder_layers, num_layers=num_layers)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)


    def forward(self, inputs):
      projected_inputs = [projection_layer(input_tensor) for projection_layer, input_tensor in zip(self.input_projections,inputs)]
      # each input is treated as a "sequence" of 1, and the batch dim is 1 in this example
      x = torch.cat(projected_inputs, dim=0)
      # batch dimension needs to be second
      x = x.permute(1, 0, 2) # (seq_len, batch, input_size)
      x = self.transformer_encoder(x)
      x = x.mean(dim=0) # collapse seq_len
      x = self.fc(x)

      return x


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # example usage
    input_sizes = [10, 20, 15]
    hidden_size = 64
    output_size = 1
    nhead = 4
    num_layers = 2

    net = MultiInputTransformer(input_sizes, hidden_size, output_size, nhead, num_layers)
    inputs = [torch.randn(1, input_size) for input_size in input_sizes]

    output = net(inputs)

    print("output shape:", output.shape)
```

this example can be further improved by including positional embeddings. the key is that you're now letting the transformer learn how to attend to the various inputs over time. a few years back, i used a setup like this for a robotics project, and it was quite a game-changer when i noticed that certain sensors were leading others by a few milliseconds. the attention mechanism in the transformer was able to learn that relationship quite effectively. the only problem? i was out of coffee.

regarding where to further your theoretical knowledge about such topics, i would point you to “deep learning” by goodfellow, bengio, and courville, that should be your bible, it's not exactly fun to read in one sitting, but it will give you a very deep mathematical background on many of these techniques. and for more practical, hands-on learning, i found that ‘programming pytorch for deep learning’ by ian beaumont was incredibly useful to get a more practical sense of how pytorch models work. also, the original paper about transformers ‘attention is all you need’ would give you the basics needed to understand that approach.

so, in short, building pytorch networks for multiple inputs isn't rocket science, but it does require a bit of planning and experimentation, and a lot of debugging when things go south. and that has happened to all of us in the past, believe me! my final advice? always start simple, and then add complexity as needed. keep your code modular so you can change things quickly, and, most importantly, always document your code, even the failures, as they might be valuable lessons later. you'd be amazed how many times i've gone back to my old notes and fixed something with a 5min search that took me days to fix the first time. good luck!
