Let's tackle this one; it's a query that brings back a specific project from a few years ago where we were experimenting with custom training loops in tensorflow 2. That particular scenario forced a deep dive into the gradients API. The short answer to your question is a resounding yes: omitting `apply_gradients` *absolutely* affects the model's prediction behavior during training. It's not a subtle effect, either; it essentially grinds the model's learning process to a halt.

When you're performing gradient descent, which is fundamental to training neural networks, you go through a sequence of steps: forward pass, loss calculation, gradient calculation, and finally, parameter update. The `apply_gradients` step is where the calculated gradients are actually used to adjust the trainable parameters within your model. Without it, those carefully computed gradients, representing the direction and magnitude to tweak your parameters for improved performance, are simply discarded. Think of it like having a detailed map to your destination, but then choosing to stay put instead of using it to navigate.

The loss calculation and gradient computation (using, say, `tf.GradientTape` in tensorflow) are prerequisites, but without `apply_gradients`, you're left with the 'direction' of improvement, and no actual move towards that improvement. Consequently, the model will essentially remain at its initial state or, at best, randomly fluctuate around that state. It won't learn anything meaningful from your training data and will, therefore, output predictions that are, well, not improved based on the data you're providing. The model's internal weights and biases, the very essence of its knowledge, won’t be modified by the iterative process of training. The model becomes, for all practical purposes, frozen.

I remember vividly one occasion where a colleague had painstakingly set up a custom training loop for an image segmentation task. After hours of training, we were scratching our heads at the near-random outputs. Then we realized that the `optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))` line had been commented out for some obscure debugging attempt. Reintroducing that single line immediately started training as intended. This was a very practical lesson in the absolute necessity of `apply_gradients`.

To make this crystal clear, let's explore this with a few code snippets. First, here's the complete, correct sequence with `apply_gradients`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

# Sample optimizer and loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

# Dummy training data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 5))
y_train = tf.one_hot(tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32), depth=2)

# Training loop
@tf.function
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss


epochs = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
    loss = train_step(x_train, y_train)
    if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy():.4f}')
```

In this first example, the training should proceed as expected, the loss will demonstrably decrease, and predictions will improve over training epochs. Now, let's observe what happens when we remove `apply_gradients`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

# Sample optimizer and loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

# Dummy training data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 5))
y_train = tf.one_hot(tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32), depth=2)

# Training loop
@tf.function
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    # optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))   #This line is commented out!
    return loss


epochs = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
    loss = train_step(x_train, y_train)
    if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy():.4f}')
```
When you run the second code snippet, you'll see that the loss value does not meaningfully decrease, and the model fails to learn. The model does not update its trainable parameters, rendering it ineffective.

Let’s illustrate the effect in another way by logging the trainable variables of a single layer, focusing on one specific parameter:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

# Sample optimizer and loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

# Dummy training data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 5))
y_train = tf.one_hot(tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32), depth=2)


# Training loop
@tf.function
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss


epochs = 100
first_layer_parameter_history = []
for epoch in range(epochs):
    loss = train_step(x_train, y_train)
    first_layer_parameter_history.append(model.layers[0].kernel[0][0].numpy())
    if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy():.4f}')

print("\nParameter updates over training (with apply_gradients):")
for i, val in enumerate(first_layer_parameter_history):
    if (i + 1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {i+1}: {val}')

#Now, the code without apply_gradients
model_no_apply = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

@tf.function
def train_step_no_apply(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model_no_apply(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model_no_apply.trainable_variables)
    # optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model_no_apply.trainable_variables)) #This line is commented out!
    return loss

first_layer_parameter_history_no_apply = []

for epoch in range(epochs):
    loss = train_step_no_apply(x_train, y_train)
    first_layer_parameter_history_no_apply.append(model_no_apply.layers[0].kernel[0][0].numpy())
    if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
      print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss (no apply): {loss.numpy():.4f}')
print("\nParameter updates over training (without apply_gradients):")
for i, val in enumerate(first_layer_parameter_history_no_apply):
    if (i + 1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {i+1}: {val}')
```
This snippet logs a single weight from the first dense layer for both with and without `apply_gradients` to show how parameters change over training. You’ll find that without `apply_gradients`, the parameter barely changes after each epoch, further demonstrating how learning cannot occur. This reinforces that the lack of parameter update stops the model from learning.

For a deeper understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of gradient descent and its implementation, I would recommend going through "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. It's considered a foundational text for anyone working in the field. For a closer look at the tensorflow-specific API, including custom training loops and gradient manipulation, the official Tensorflow documentation is the first place to look, and also, the book “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron provides excellent practical guidance. These resources together should solidify your understanding of the core training process.

In conclusion, never forget that the omission of `apply_gradients` will severely disrupt training, rendering all preceding steps useless in the context of model optimization and improvement. In TensorFlow 2, this operation is not a luxury, but an essential part of the training mechanism. It serves as the bridge connecting calculated error signals (gradients) to the adjustment of the model’s internal parameters, directly leading to prediction improvement.
