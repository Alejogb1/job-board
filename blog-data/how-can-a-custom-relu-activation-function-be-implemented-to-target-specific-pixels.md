Let’s dive right into this. Custom activation functions, specifically variations on ReLU that target certain pixels, aren't exactly a standard feature in most frameworks, so you'll need to roll up your sleeves a bit. I remember a project a few years back where I was dealing with satellite imagery; I had to selectively activate certain areas based on sensor calibration data. The standard ReLU was far too blunt for what I needed, so custom implementations became essential.

The core idea here is to modify the standard ReLU operation, which, as we all know, outputs the input if it’s positive and zero otherwise. Instead of a global application, we’re aiming for a *localized* operation. We need to create a function that considers not just the pixel's value but also its position. Let me break down the typical approach, followed by a few code examples.

The foundation for implementing a custom, pixel-targeting ReLU is built on masking. You first need to define which pixels you want to be affected by the custom activation and which ones should follow the standard ReLU, or perhaps even a completely different rule. The masking can be based on various criteria – spatial coordinates, pre-calculated weights, or even features from a different layer. It's common to store this mask in a tensor that has the same spatial dimensions as the input image (or feature map) to your custom ReLU. The mask contains values that determine how the ReLU should behave at each corresponding location.

There are different ways to achieve this. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Binary Masks:** This is the simplest approach. You use a mask where pixels are either 1 (custom ReLU applied) or 0 (standard ReLU applied). You can then use this to perform a piecewise operation. For locations with 1, you would execute a custom logic, which could involve a threshold, a different slope for the negative part of ReLU, or even any other arbitrary transformation; for 0, the normal ReLU activation takes place. This allows you to define the behavior in regions that need special treatment.

2. **Weighted Masks:** Here, mask values aren't binary but rather within a range, say [0, 1]. You then can mix the outputs of the standard ReLU and your custom ReLU activation based on these weights, allowing for a smooth transition between behaviors rather than a sharp cut-off. This works especially well when trying to reduce sharp edges and discontinuities in your overall output.

3. **Coordinate-Based masks:** Instead of relying on precomputed masks, you can generate the masks dynamically using the spatial coordinates of each pixel. This allows you to implement regions or patterns of different activation rules. These masks are more computationally intensive, as they require recalculating their values each time the ReLU function is invoked. However, the flexibility it offers outweighs this cost in some cases.

Now let’s see how you can translate this to code. I'll demonstrate with Python using PyTorch for the numerical operations.

**Example 1: Binary Masking with Custom ReLU Threshold**

This example will showcase a custom ReLU that has a different threshold in a region specified by a precomputed mask.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class CustomReLU_BinaryMask(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, mask, custom_threshold=0.5):
        super().__init__()
        self.mask = mask.float()  # Ensure mask is float for operations
        self.custom_threshold = custom_threshold

    def forward(self, x):
      standard_relu = F.relu(x)
      masked_x = x - self.custom_threshold # Shift for custom behaviour
      custom_relu = F.relu(masked_x)
      output = self.mask * custom_relu + (1 - self.mask) * standard_relu
      return output

# Example usage:
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 10, 10) # Batch, channels, height, width
mask = torch.zeros(1, 1, 10, 10)
mask[:, :, 3:7, 3:7] = 1 # Create a square area where custom ReLU will be applied.

custom_relu_layer = CustomReLU_BinaryMask(mask, custom_threshold=0.3)
output_tensor = custom_relu_layer(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output will be same shape as input.
```

In this snippet, we define a class `CustomReLU_BinaryMask` which takes a mask and threshold as arguments during initialization. During the forward pass, we calculate the standard ReLU and our modified ReLU (shifted by the `custom_threshold`). The mask selects how they are combined in the output.

**Example 2: Weighted Masking for Blended Activation**

Here’s an example using a weighted mask to blend between the standard and a different custom ReLU with a different slope.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class CustomReLU_WeightedMask(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, mask, slope=0.2):
        super().__init__()
        self.mask = mask.float()
        self.slope = slope

    def forward(self, x):
        standard_relu = F.relu(x)
        custom_relu = torch.where(x > 0, x, x * self.slope)  # Leaky ReLU-like custom
        output = (1 - self.mask) * standard_relu + self.mask * custom_relu
        return output

# Example usage
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 10, 10)
mask = torch.rand(1, 1, 10, 10) # Generate a weighted mask

custom_relu_layer = CustomReLU_WeightedMask(mask, slope = 0.1)
output_tensor = custom_relu_layer(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape)
```
In this instance, we've introduced a `CustomReLU_WeightedMask`. The weighted mask controls the degree to which a leaky ReLU is used over the traditional ReLU, enabling a smooth transition. The mask is a tensor with values ranging between zero and one, providing the weights to combine the two activation functions.

**Example 3: Dynamic Coordinate-Based Mask**

In this final example, let’s construct a mask directly using the coordinates.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class CustomReLU_CoordinateMask(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, height, width, center_x, center_y, radius, custom_slope=0.3):
      super().__init__()
      self.height = height
      self.width = width
      self.center_x = center_x
      self.center_y = center_y
      self.radius = radius
      self.custom_slope = custom_slope

    def forward(self, x):
        h_range = torch.arange(self.height).float().unsqueeze(-1)
        w_range = torch.arange(self.width).float().unsqueeze(0)
        mask = ((h_range - self.center_y)**2 + (w_range - self.center_x)**2) <= self.radius**2

        mask = mask.float().unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch and channel dimensions

        standard_relu = F.relu(x)
        custom_relu = torch.where(x > 0, x, x * self.custom_slope)
        output = (1 - mask) * standard_relu + mask * custom_relu
        return output

# Example Usage:
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 10, 10)

custom_relu_layer = CustomReLU_CoordinateMask(height=10, width=10, center_x=5, center_y=5, radius=3, custom_slope=0.1)
output_tensor = custom_relu_layer(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape)
```

Here, the `CustomReLU_CoordinateMask` generates a circle-shaped mask centered at user-defined coordinates and a given radius. This is done dynamically by calculating distances relative to the defined center and will result in the custom behaviour occurring only within this region.

These examples illustrate different methods for implementing custom ReLU activation targeted to specific pixel locations using different masks. The key is to leverage masks in combination with PyTorch's element-wise operations to produce the desired behavior.

If you're looking for further understanding, I highly recommend checking out “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville for a broad theoretical background on activation functions. For a more hands-on approach and discussions about neural network architectures, look at “Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning” by Ian Pointer. These resources provide an in-depth look at activation functions and related topics, and the theoretical basis will be helpful in any custom implementations.

Remember, these are just a few examples. The possibilities for custom ReLU functions are immense, limited only by your requirements and imagination. Good luck!
