 I remember a project a few years back, integrating a real-time data pipeline with an existing RESTful service. We needed to update complex records asynchronously based on incoming PUT requests. This brought the question you've raised front and center: how exactly do you reliably trigger an asynchronous process from a synchronous http endpoint, specifically a PUT? It’s a very common scenario, and there are several ways to handle it; it's more a matter of architectural fit than any single "correct" solution.

The crucial point is that http by default is a synchronous request-response protocol. A PUT request expects a response. You can’t just hang indefinitely waiting for your async job to finish before returning, especially with complex or long running operations; that would tie up resources on the server and potentially lead to timeouts.

The first option, and one I've used successfully in several systems, is to acknowledge the PUT request immediately and initiate the asynchronous operation "behind the scenes." You effectively defer the actual data processing. You return a 202 Accepted or a 200 OK with a status that indicates the update request is being processed. This approach relies on a separate processing queue. The PUT handler enqueues the work item, and a separate worker process consumes the queue and processes the request asynchronously.

Here's a simplified python example using a hypothetical queue system, although this concept is broadly applicable to most languages with async support:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, status, BackgroundTasks
from pydantic import BaseModel
import time
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()

class UpdateData(BaseModel):
    id: int
    value: str

async def process_update(data: UpdateData):
    # Simulate long processing
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print(f"Processed update for id: {data.id} with value: {data.value}")
    # Persist the data to database or external store
    return {"status": "processed", "id": data.id}

@app.put("/data/{item_id}", status_code=status.HTTP_202_ACCEPTED)
async def update_data_endpoint(item_id: int, data: UpdateData, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    if item_id != data.id:
      raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="ID in path does not match request body")
    background_tasks.add_task(process_update, data)
    return {"status": "accepted", "id": item_id}
```

In this example, FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` automatically enqueues the `process_update` function, and it will be executed after the handler returns. You immediately return a 202 Accepted status, informing the client that their request was received and will be processed. This separates the request handling from processing.

Another valid technique is to leverage a "fire and forget" strategy using threading or similar constructs, again acknowledging the request quickly. Here is another python snippet demonstrating this:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from threading import Thread
import time
import json

app = Flask(__name__)

def process_update(data):
    # Simulate time-consuming task
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Processed update: {data}")
    # Persist the data to database or external store

@app.route('/data/<int:item_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_data_endpoint(item_id):
  if request.json and 'id' in request.json and request.json['id'] != item_id:
    return jsonify({'error': 'ID mismatch'}), 400
  data = request.json
  thread = Thread(target=process_update, args=(data,))
  thread.start()
  return jsonify({'status': 'accepted', 'id': item_id}), 202
```

This Flask example starts a new thread to process the update, allowing the API to return quickly. This is less sophisticated than using a dedicated queue system, but often perfectly viable for simple use cases. It's essential, though, to monitor the number of threads if using this technique to prevent resource exhaustion.

Finally, consider using Webhooks. In this strategy, the PUT handler validates the request and adds the data to a processing queue as before. However, instead of immediately acknowledging with a 202, you could return a 200 OK and include information that the update will be performed asynchronously. Then, after the async processing completes, you trigger an event that pushes data via a webhook to another endpoint (often another api or a frontend) to inform the requesting client. Here is a simplified example using a hypothetical webhook mechanism, in a pseudocode manner:

```python
class DataItem:
    id: int
    value: str

async def process_update(data: DataItem):
  #simulate long processing task
  await asyncio.sleep(2)
  #persisting data
  print(f"Persisted data with id: {data.id} value: {data.value}")
  #trigger webhook
  await webhook_client.push_webhook("update_completed", {"id": data.id})

@app.put("/data/{item_id}")
async def update_data_endpoint(item_id: int, data: DataItem, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
  if item_id != data.id:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="ID mismatch")

  background_tasks.add_task(process_update, data)
  return {"status": "accepted", "id": item_id, "message": "update being processed"}
```

This pseudocode example, where we do not delve into concrete webhook implementation details, illustrates the sequence. In a real-world scenario, you'd replace the `webhook_client` part with the appropriate implementation for your specific environment which includes URL and possibly authorization tokens.

Choosing the correct approach boils down to specifics. For high-volume systems where scalability and reliability are paramount, using a message queue is superior. The use of threads is acceptable in lower-volume scenarios, but you must pay attention to resource management. Webhooks can give clients better asynchronous feedback and are a suitable option when real-time responses aren't critical. For more intricate scenarios involving complex transactions and database interactions, you'd want to explore techniques such as sagas or transactional outboxes alongside these core patterns.

To delve deeper into these architectures, I'd recommend looking into *Enterprise Integration Patterns* by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf, this provides a solid grounding in common message-based patterns. Also, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann is invaluable for understanding the underlying principles of scalable systems which includes database and queue strategies. These resources should give you a robust foundation for addressing your challenge with PUT requests and async operations. Finally, if you're using Python, the documentation for FastAPI, Flask, and the Python asyncio library is highly recommended.
