Alright,  The question of `wget` downloading `.jpg` files between Docker containers isn't as straightforward as it initially seems, and it’s definitely a scenario I've encountered more than once during my time building microservices. The short answer is: yes, absolutely, `wget` can download `.jpg` files between Docker containers, *provided* you’ve correctly configured the network and the container serving the files is actually accessible. However, the "how" of it is where things get interesting and, frankly, where many developers stumble.

The core issue revolves around container networking and the visibility of services within that network. Docker containers, by default, exist within their own isolated network namespace. This means a container doesn't inherently know how to find or communicate with another container unless you explicitly define the networking. Think of it like separate offices within a large building; they don't automatically know about each other; you need to set up a communication system.

First, let's look at the most common scenario: containers residing on the same Docker network. This is often the case when you use Docker Compose or when you manually create a bridge network. In such a setup, containers can typically communicate with each other via their container names or through service names if using docker-compose, provided you have enabled dns resolution in docker. Let’s say you have an image server container that is running a basic http server and serving images in a directory at the path `/images`. Here is a basic Dockerfile for the image server:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for the Image Server
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY ./app.py .
COPY ./images ./images

RUN pip install flask

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

And the corresponding basic python flask app `app.py`:
```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/images/<path:filename>")
def image(filename):
    return send_from_directory("images", filename)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000, debug=True)
```

And an `images` directory with a `test.jpg` file, you would then build this using `docker build -t image-server .`. Now, If you were to launch this container onto a docker network called 'my-net' you can run this image using:

```bash
docker run --name image-server --net my-net -p 8000:8000 image-server
```

Assuming that this image server is running, you can now download this image from another container which is also running on the same network using `wget`. For example, if you were to execute into a different docker container with bash, you could download the image with the following command:

```bash
wget http://image-server:8000/images/test.jpg
```

This works because Docker, by default, provides DNS resolution for containers on the same network. `image-server` resolves to the IP address of the server container due to this DNS functionality. Now, to get that other docker container to run on the same network we will also need to specify `my-net` in the docker run command. For example:

```bash
docker run -it --net my-net ubuntu bash
```

This is fairly straightforward when you understand how the networking works. But what if you don’t want to expose a port on your host machine? Or what if you want to avoid using container names, say, because you’re dynamically spinning up instances? This is where Docker's service discovery and custom DNS setup becomes relevant. This becomes more important when you’re scaling your application with something like Kubernetes where port forwarding on a node becomes less practical. In such a scenario, you are working more and more with service names that are resolved by a service discovery mechanism.

Here’s a practical example of creating and using a custom network:

```bash
docker network create my-custom-net
docker run -d --name image-server --net my-custom-net image-server
docker run -it --net my-custom-net ubuntu bash
```

Then inside the `ubuntu` bash shell you can run `wget http://image-server:8000/images/test.jpg`. Docker's embedded DNS resolves container names on that network, making internal communication simple without needing to expose ports on the host, or using more complex service discovery methods. This is a very common and effective method for communication between containers.

There are, however, some caveats to be aware of. One of the most common mistakes I see is assuming the container you're trying to access is ready to respond the second it starts up. A newly-launched container, especially if it needs to initialize services, may take time before it's listening on the network. Using `docker logs -f <container-name>` is a really useful method to monitor the logs of the service and debug when you're experiencing issues. Another common error is using the wrong port or protocol. A container might expose port `8080` internally, but if your Dockerfile doesn’t expose it to a certain port on the host or another container using `-p` or `--expose`, then that port would not be accessible from another container on the network.

Now, what if your situation involves containers that aren't on the same network or are on completely different Docker hosts, say, in a distributed setup? This is where things get a bit more complicated and it really depends on how your infrastructure is structured. If these servers can resolve each other, then they would function similarly to containers on the same network using their IPs or Domain names. However, if the containers aren't able to resolve each other, then you can expose a port on the host that another server can access, but this is not the most ideal practice. You can also implement a more involved setup that includes a service discovery or a load balancer in front of the server, but this depends on the scale and the specific requirements of your project.

For deeper dives into networking and more advanced setups I'd recommend the following resources: "Docker in Action" by Jeff Nickoloff and Stephen Kuenzli which provides a very well explained deep dive into Docker networking. For further exploration of networking concepts, particularly relevant when dealing with distributed systems, I'd suggest the classic “Computer Networks” by Andrew S. Tanenbaum or “TCP/IP Illustrated” by W. Richard Stevens. These resources are very foundational and provide a deeper insight into all the underlying mechanisms involved with networking.

In summary, `wget` can absolutely download `.jpg` files between Docker containers, but only if the networking configuration allows it and the container providing the image is available. The key is understanding Docker's networking capabilities and appropriately configuring your containers to ensure they can communicate effectively. By ensuring that your containers are on the same network (or appropriately configured networks) and are running as expected, you can easily utilize tools like `wget` for communication between containers. It's always about understanding the underlying mechanism, not just memorizing commands, which can really save you a lot of frustration down the line.
