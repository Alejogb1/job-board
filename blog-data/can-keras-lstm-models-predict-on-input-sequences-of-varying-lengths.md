Okay, let’s tackle this. I’ve certainly spent my fair share of time wrestling—erm, *working*—with sequence data in various projects, and the question of varying sequence lengths and lstm models is a persistent one. It’s something I confronted directly several years back when building a predictive model for time-series data related to machine sensor outputs, where sensor data streams had inconsistent periods of reporting. The core issue stems from the inherent design of most traditional neural network architectures, which expect fixed-size input. lstms, however, offer some interesting flexibility.

The short answer, unequivocally, is yes, a keras lstm model *can* handle input sequences of varying lengths, but it's not a magic bullet. It requires a thoughtful approach during both model design and data preprocessing. The "trick," if you can call it that, lies in how we manage the input shapes, primarily using techniques like padding or masking. I'll elaborate, starting with a fundamental understanding of the issue.

Fundamentally, an lstm layer in keras expects input data in the form of a 3d tensor: `(batch_size, time_steps, features)`. ‘Batch_size’ is the number of sequences processed together in a single step, ‘time_steps’ represents the length of each sequence (the part we’re discussing), and ‘features’ refers to the number of variables for each time point. If we simply feed the model sequences of varying lengths without preprocessing, we’ll run into issues because the second dimension, ‘time_steps’, would be inconsistent across our training and test data, leading to shape mismatch errors.

The solution most often deployed is sequence padding. Padding involves taking sequences shorter than a pre-defined maximum length and appending a special ‘padding’ value (usually zero) to the end of them to make them all equal in length. Sequences that are longer than this maximum length are either truncated or split. This maximum length can be derived from analysis of the length distribution in your training dataset or set to some arbitrary practical limit. While straightforward, padding also introduces a challenge, as these added values are technically inputs, and we might not want them to influence the model's learning. That is precisely where masking comes into the picture.

Masking tells the lstm layer to ignore these padded timesteps during both training and prediction. In keras, this is typically accomplished using the `Masking` layer or directly setting `mask_zero=True` within an `Embedding` layer. When using `Masking`, you have to indicate the value that will be treated as the padding value.

Here’s a practical example of the process using the Keras functional api:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Example data (variable length sequences)
sequences = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9, 10, 11],
    [12, 13, 14]
]

# Determine maximum sequence length
max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
print(f"Maximum sequence length: {max_len}")

# Pad sequences
padded_sequences = keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_len, padding='post')
print(f"Padded Sequences: {padded_sequences}")

# Model definition
input_layer = layers.Input(shape=(max_len,))
embedding_layer = layers.Embedding(input_dim=100, output_dim=32, mask_zero=True)(input_layer) # Using embedding with mask_zero
lstm_layer = layers.LSTM(64)(embedding_layer)
output_layer = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(lstm_layer)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy Labels for demonstration
labels = [0, 1, 0, 1]

# Reshape data to fit into the model
padded_sequences_reshaped = padded_sequences.reshape(padded_sequences.shape[0], padded_sequences.shape[1])
# Training
model.fit(padded_sequences_reshaped, labels, epochs=10, verbose=0)

print("Model training completed.")

# Make prediction with new sequence that is different in length from trained sequences
new_sequence = [1, 2, 3]
new_padded_sequence = keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences([new_sequence], maxlen=max_len, padding='post')
prediction = model.predict(new_padded_sequence)
print(f"Prediction for new sequence: {prediction}")

```

In this code, we first pad the sequences with zeros to match the maximum sequence length. We then use an embedding layer with `mask_zero=True` to ignore these padded zeros in the lstm layer, thus preventing them from affecting the model's output. The model uses the functional API, allowing for clean separation and easier management of input layers. A very critical step that you may be missing if you are running into trouble with input shape errors is explicitly reshaping the padded sequences before passing them to the model. This ensures that the dimensions match what the model expects. Notice also that prediction on new unseen sequences are done with sequences that have also been padded with the same method to the maximum sequence length used during training.

Another example that demonstrates the use of a `Masking` layer directly when not needing an embedding is shown below, where the input is already numeric and does not need to be embedded:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Example data (variable length numerical sequences)
sequences = [
    np.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4]),
    np.array([5.5, 6.6]),
    np.array([7.7, 8.8, 9.9, 10.0, 11.1]),
    np.array([12.1, 13.1, 14.1])
]


# Determine max sequence length
max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
print(f"Maximum sequence length: {max_len}")

# Pad the sequences with a special padding value e.g. -1
padded_sequences = keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_len, padding='post', dtype='float', value=-1)
print(f"Padded Sequences: {padded_sequences}")

# Model definition
input_layer = layers.Input(shape=(max_len,))
masking_layer = layers.Masking(mask_value=-1)(input_layer)
lstm_layer = layers.LSTM(64)(masking_layer)
output_layer = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(lstm_layer)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy Labels for demonstration
labels = [0, 1, 0, 1]

# Reshape the sequences for training
padded_sequences_reshaped = padded_sequences.reshape(padded_sequences.shape[0], padded_sequences.shape[1])

# Training
model.fit(padded_sequences_reshaped, labels, epochs=10, verbose=0)
print("Model training completed.")

# Predict with a new sequence
new_sequence = np.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3])
new_padded_sequence = keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences([new_sequence], maxlen=max_len, padding='post', dtype='float', value=-1)
prediction = model.predict(new_padded_sequence)
print(f"Prediction for new sequence: {prediction}")
```

In this version, we’re using float data and padding the sequences with `-1`. We then use the `Masking` layer explicitly, indicating that values of `-1` should be ignored. It is absolutely important that the mask_value parameter matches the value with which sequences are padded. The rest of the process is similar to the embedding example.

For more complicated use cases, where performance is key, it would be wise to delve into more advanced sequence handling techniques. For instance, you might explore techniques such as bucketization, which involves grouping similar-length sequences and then padding within those buckets, or even attention mechanisms which allow the model to give greater consideration to particular time steps within a sequence. The core is that they all revolve around managing the fact that different input sequences will have different lengths, either directly during preprocessing or indirectly via the neural network architecture.

If you want to dive deeper, I would recommend checking out “Deep Learning with Python” by François Chollet (the creator of Keras) or the relevant sections in the “TensorFlow 2.0” book by Aurélien Géron. These texts provide solid foundations and practical examples that expand on the basics I've touched upon here. Moreover, research papers discussing sequence-to-sequence models and attention mechanisms, particularly those from the early days of sequence learning and later extensions, are essential resources for comprehending these approaches fully. I have found that getting down to the math behind the layers helps to understand why different techniques work so well, so do pay attention to those.

In summary, while lstms, and keras implementations of them, can readily handle varying sequence lengths, achieving this requires thoughtful planning and preprocessing, mainly through padding and masking. Properly applying these principles will allow your models to leverage all available data without compromising accuracy due to the inconsistencies in input size.
