Alright,  It's a common frustration, and I remember banging my head against this wall quite a bit when I was first setting up distributed training systems a few years back for a deep learning project that was pushing the boundaries of our hardware. It's incredibly demoralizing to see only one GPU sweating away while the others are just… idle. So, let me break down why you might be facing this, and we can then explore some potential solutions with code.

The core issue isn't usually a bug in Keras’s distributed training itself, but rather often boils down to a misunderstanding of how distributed strategies are activated and configured. Specifically, when it comes to TensorFlow and Keras’s `tf.distribute` strategies, the single most common pitfall is not properly initializing or scoping the strategy when defining your model and optimizer. The guide, while generally comprehensive, often assumes a certain level of background knowledge that a newcomer might not possess.

The crux of the problem lies in how TensorFlow constructs its computational graph. When you use a distribution strategy, like `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`, you're essentially telling TensorFlow to replicate your model and data across multiple devices. However, this replication only occurs within the *scope* of the strategy. Anything built *outside* that scope will not be distributed. This means that if you define your model, compile it with an optimizer, and load your data *before* applying the strategy's scope, your training will inevitably default to the primary device, commonly GPU 0. TensorFlow doesn’t magically distribute things retrospectively; it needs to know that these operations need to be replicated from the beginning.

To make this clear, consider this simplistic scenario using `MirroredStrategy`. Imagine, you've got your model definition, optimizer, and datasets defined *before* the strategy is applied. You run your training, and boom, one GPU is carrying all the weight.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Model definition (outside of distribution scope)
model = keras.Sequential([
  keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Optimizer definition (also outside the scope)
optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Example dataset (still outside the scope)
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784).astype("float32") / 255.0
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 784).astype("float32") / 255.0

train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(64)

# Distribution strategy
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

# Training (still using only one GPU)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=3)

print("Training is done...")

```

In this example, the `model`, `optimizer`, and the dataset are created without the distribution strategy's influence. The subsequent training process isn't distributed, even though we *create* the `MirroredStrategy`. This is because the compiled model and compiled `fit` call operate outside the strategy's context, leading to single GPU usage. It’s a common mistake, and it’s precisely why many people find themselves struggling with distributed training.

Now, let’s see what happens when we *correctly* scope the model and associated logic within the strategy:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Distribution strategy
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    # Model definition (inside of distribution scope)
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

    # Optimizer definition (inside the scope)
    optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam()

    # Compilation (inside the scope)
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Example dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784).astype("float32") / 255.0
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 784).astype("float32") / 255.0

train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(64)

# Training (now utilizing multiple GPUs)
model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=3)

print("Training is done...")
```

The key change here is the `with strategy.scope():` block. Everything defined *within* this block, including the model construction, optimizer definition, and the compilation stage, will be created within the distribution strategy's context, thus ensuring proper replication and distribution. Your model, optimizer, and other resources are now distributed, and your training should leverage all available GPUs. Notice, though, that the dataset loading remains outside the scope - this is , as TensorFlow handles dataset distribution internally if you are working with `tf.data.Datasets`, but more specific distribution strategies may need to be employed if you have more unique use cases with custom data sources or augmentations.

It’s important to note that your data pipeline should ideally also be optimized for distributed training, but in many typical setups using `tf.data`, simply using the `MirroredStrategy` is enough as TensorFlow handles the sharding for you. However, for very complex scenarios, consider using `tf.data.experimental.distribute.ShardedDataset`.

Finally, let’s explore a more complex setup using custom training loop, which is a pattern you’ll see frequently as you push into more advanced distributed training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
num_devices = strategy.num_replicas_in_sync

with strategy.scope():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam()
    loss_object = keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(
        from_logits=False, reduction=tf.keras.losses.Reduction.NONE)
    train_loss = tf.keras.metrics.Mean(name='train_loss')
    train_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='train_accuracy')

    def compute_loss(labels, predictions):
        per_example_loss = loss_object(labels, predictions)
        return tf.nn.compute_average_loss(per_example_loss, global_batch_size=64 * num_devices)

    def train_step(inputs):
        images, labels = inputs
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(images)
            loss = compute_loss(labels, predictions)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
        train_loss.update_state(loss)
        train_accuracy.update_state(labels, predictions)

    @tf.function
    def distributed_train_step(dataset_inputs):
        strategy.run(train_step, args=(dataset_inputs,))

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784).astype("float32") / 255.0
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 784).astype("float32") / 255.0

train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(64).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE).repeat()
options = tf.data.Options()
options.experimental_distribute.auto_shard_policy = tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy.DATA
distributed_train_dataset = strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset(train_dataset.with_options(options))


epochs = 3
steps_per_epoch = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
    train_loss.reset_states()
    train_accuracy.reset_states()
    for _ in range(steps_per_epoch):
        distributed_train_step(next(iter(distributed_train_dataset)))

    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {train_loss.result()}, Accuracy: {train_accuracy.result()}")
```

In this snippet, everything related to the model building, the metrics, the loss function and the gradient application is inside the strategy scope. The key point here is `strategy.run` is used to wrap the train step, which ensures it's executed across all available devices. Also notice, that the dataset is now distributed with `strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset`. Using custom loops gives you significantly more flexibility.

For deeper dives, I'd highly recommend looking into the official TensorFlow documentation for distributed training (search for `tf.distribute` on the tensorflow website). Beyond that, “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron has a fantastic section on distributed TensorFlow. Also, the research paper "TensorFlow: A System for Large-Scale Machine Learning" provides insight into TensorFlow’s core design choices. Finally, if you are keen on performance tuning you may need to look into topics like "NCCL" if you are using GPUs, and the paper "Towards Optimal Distributed Training of Deep Learning Models" can also be very helpful.

In my experience, these types of issues are less about TensorFlow being "broken" and more about carefully adhering to its specific requirements regarding scope when distributing tasks across different devices. By scoping your model construction and training logic correctly within the distribution strategy, you should be able to leverage all available computational power without leaving GPUs unused.
