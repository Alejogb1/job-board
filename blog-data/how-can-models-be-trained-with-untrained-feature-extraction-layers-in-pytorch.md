Right,  It's not uncommon to encounter situations where you'd want, or indeed need, to train a neural network where the feature extraction component isn’t itself pre-trained. I've seen this pop up a fair bit in custom applications, particularly when dealing with highly specialized data where readily available pre-trained models just don't cut it. Now, the immediate reaction might be, 'Won’t that lead to poor initial feature representations and, hence, slow or ineffective training?' And, well, yes, it can. However, we can address this with a considered approach.

The core challenge here lies in simultaneously training the feature extractor *and* the downstream task-specific layers from scratch. With no pre-existing structure in the feature extraction layers, we're essentially throwing a bunch of random numbers at the problem initially. This often leads to highly unstable gradients during the initial training phases, and a high chance the model will get stuck in a poor local minimum. The key isn’t to just hope for the best; it’s about applying strategies to navigate this instability and gradually coax the feature extractor to learn meaningful representations.

From my experience, we’ve found a combination of careful initialization, adaptive learning rates, and, where appropriate, a kind of staged training helpful. Let me break these down, using PyTorch to make things concrete.

Firstly, let’s talk about initialization. Simply using the default uniform initialization in PyTorch is often not ideal for deep networks, especially untrained feature extractors. For convolutional layers, He initialization (also known as Kaiming initialization) is often preferred over Xavier or uniform, and it’s available via `torch.nn.init.kaiming_normal_` or `torch.nn.init.kaiming_uniform_`. It essentially scales the initial weights based on the number of input connections to a neuron, helping to keep the variance of activations consistent during forward passes and, thus, reducing vanishing or exploding gradients. You might be wondering, do we apply a uniform initialization across the entire feature extractor? The answer is not necessarily. Sometimes, initializing certain layers differently might be advantageous, depending on their nature. For example, if you’re working with an autoencoder as part of your feature extractor, you might initialize the encoder differently than the decoder.

Let me illustrate this. Suppose I have a simple convolutional feature extractor followed by a linear classification layer. Here’s a snippet:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.init as init

class SimpleFeatureExtractor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, hidden_channels, num_classes):
        super(SimpleFeatureExtractor, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(input_channels, hidden_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(hidden_channels, hidden_channels * 2, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_channels * 2 * 7 * 7, num_classes) #Assuming input is 28x28

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool1(self.relu1(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool2(self.relu2(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Example usage:
model = SimpleFeatureExtractor(input_channels=1, hidden_channels=32, num_classes=10)

# He initialization for conv layers
for m in model.modules():
    if isinstance(m, nn.Conv2d):
        init.kaiming_normal_(m.weight, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='relu')
    elif isinstance(m, nn.Linear):
        init.xavier_uniform_(m.weight)

print(model) #prints model architecture with initialized layers
```

Here, we initialize the convolutional layers with `kaiming_normal_`, specifying `fan_out` because we’re using ReLU activations. The linear layer, I've initialized with `xavier_uniform_`. This is an area you might need to fine-tune, but it's a solid starting point.

Now, let’s discuss adaptive learning rates. Simply setting a fixed, global learning rate across all parameters can be detrimental to our process, especially with the initially random feature extractor. Adam or AdamW, for example, are preferred to SGD due to their per-parameter learning rate adaptation. Moreover, you might want to employ learning rate scheduling to reduce the learning rate as the training progresses. `torch.optim.lr_scheduler` in PyTorch offers a number of useful schedulers (e.g., `StepLR`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`). The `ReduceLROnPlateau` is quite useful when your learning rate needs to be adapted based on the validation loss.

Here is a simple example with Adam and `ReduceLROnPlateau`:

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ReduceLROnPlateau

# Assume 'model' is already initialized as in the previous snippet
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, 'min', patience=5, factor=0.5, verbose=True)

# Inside the training loop:
def train_step(data, labels, model, optimizer, criterion):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  outputs = model(data)
  loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
  return loss

def train(epochs, train_loader, val_loader, model, optimizer, criterion, scheduler):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        model.train()
        for data, labels in train_loader:
            loss = train_step(data, labels, model, optimizer, criterion)

        model.eval()
        val_loss = 0
        with torch.no_grad():
          for val_data, val_labels in val_loader:
            outputs = model(val_data)
            val_loss += criterion(outputs, val_labels).item()

        avg_val_loss = val_loss / len(val_loader)

        scheduler.step(avg_val_loss)

# Sample Data Loaders, Criterion
import torch.utils.data as data_utils
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

#Dummy Data Generation for Example
train_data_t = torch.rand(1000, 1, 28, 28)
train_labels_t = torch.randint(0, 10, (1000,))
val_data_t = torch.rand(200, 1, 28, 28)
val_labels_t = torch.randint(0, 10, (200,))


train_dataset = TensorDataset(train_data_t, train_labels_t)
val_dataset = TensorDataset(val_data_t, val_labels_t)

train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

train(epochs=20, train_loader = train_loader, val_loader = val_loader, model = model, optimizer = optimizer, criterion = criterion, scheduler = scheduler)

```

The learning rate will automatically reduce when validation loss plateaus. This helps in fine-tuning the model and avoiding oscillations during training. This is very important when both feature extractor and classification layers are trained simultaneously.

Finally, consider staged training or a phased approach. Sometimes, rather than directly training the entire model end-to-end from the start, you can pre-train the feature extractor with a simpler auxiliary task. For example, if your ultimate goal is classification, you might first train the feature extractor as an autoencoder using the same input data. Although the features extracted by such a network are typically different than a class-specific extraction network, using an autoencoder initialization can greatly speed up the training process. After pre-training, you then train the entire model. Or, you could use a contrastive loss, or some other self-supervised learning method, to learn somewhat meaningful feature representations *before* attempting classification.

Here is an illustration of how an autoencoder can be used to pre-train the feature extractor:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.init as init
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Define Autoencoder Class
class Autoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, hidden_channels):
        super(Autoencoder, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
          nn.Conv2d(input_channels, hidden_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Conv2d(hidden_channels, hidden_channels*2, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        )

        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(hidden_channels*2, hidden_channels, kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(hidden_channels, input_channels, kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Sigmoid() # use sigmoid for pixel values range from 0 to 1
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        encoded = self.encoder(x)
        decoded = self.decoder(encoded)
        return decoded
# Assume model is our SimpleFeatureExtractor from above.
autoencoder = Autoencoder(input_channels = 1, hidden_channels = 32)

# Initialize Autoencoder weights with Kaiming
for m in autoencoder.modules():
    if isinstance(m, nn.Conv2d) or isinstance(m, nn.ConvTranspose2d):
        init.kaiming_normal_(m.weight, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='relu')

optimizer_ae = optim.Adam(autoencoder.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion_ae = nn.MSELoss()

#Pre-Train autoencoder - assume train_data_t is available from the previous example

ae_dataset = TensorDataset(train_data_t, train_data_t) #Autoencoder is trained on the input itself
ae_loader = DataLoader(ae_dataset, batch_size = 32, shuffle=True)

def train_ae(epochs, autoencoder, optimizer_ae, criterion_ae, ae_loader):
  for epoch in range(epochs):
    autoencoder.train()
    for data, labels in ae_loader:
      optimizer_ae.zero_grad()
      outputs = autoencoder(data)
      loss = criterion_ae(outputs, labels)
      loss.backward()
      optimizer_ae.step()

train_ae(epochs=10, autoencoder=autoencoder, optimizer_ae=optimizer_ae, criterion_ae=criterion_ae, ae_loader = ae_loader)

# Transfer weights from the encoder part to our main Feature Extractor
with torch.no_grad():
  model.conv1.weight.copy_(autoencoder.encoder[0].weight)
  model.conv1.bias.copy_(autoencoder.encoder[0].bias)
  model.conv2.weight.copy_(autoencoder.encoder[3].weight)
  model.conv2.bias.copy_(autoencoder.encoder[3].bias)


print("autoencoder pre-training completed")
# Now we can continue with end-to-end classification training
# Continue with the same classification code as before with optimizer, loss, data loaders, epochs, etc.
```

You would then continue training the whole feature extraction model and the task specific layer as illustrated earlier.

In summary, training with initially untrained feature extraction layers requires careful initialization, adaptive learning rates, and sometimes a staged or phased training approach. It’s not a magic bullet, but a combination of these strategies has often proven effective in my experience. It's worth noting that the exact configuration will vary by the dataset and your specific use-case. Experimentation and diligent monitoring of training and validation performance is key. For more theoretical details, I would highly recommend delving into “Deep Learning” by Goodfellow et al., for a broader theoretical perspective, and the original He initialization paper, “Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification.” And for an understanding of optimization techniques, consider “An overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms” by Sebastian Ruder. These resources will provide a deeper foundational understanding behind these techniques.
