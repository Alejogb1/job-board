Okay, let’s unpack this. Updating claims values without leveraging `UserManager` in a .net 6 application is, shall we say, a scenario I've found myself navigating more often than I’d initially anticipated. It usually boils down to specific architectural constraints or performance considerations, and while `UserManager` simplifies many identity-related tasks, it's not always the most appropriate tool for surgical claim manipulation. I recall a particularly hairy project where we were integrating with a legacy system that had its own robust user management layer, rendering `UserManager` somewhat redundant and even obstructive. We couldn’t simply shoehorn it in, so we had to get creative.

The core problem stems from how claims are generally associated with a user's authentication context – typically represented by an `ClaimsPrincipal` object. `UserManager` is an abstraction designed to handle the complexities of user persistence, including managing and updating user claims within its own underlying data store. When you bypass `UserManager`, you're dealing directly with the `ClaimsPrincipal` and its underlying identity representation, which often requires a more hands-on approach.

Firstly, it's crucial to understand that the `ClaimsPrincipal` is, in many contexts, immutable once it's established for the current request. This immutability ensures data integrity and prevents accidental modifications to the current session's claims set. What we *can* do is generate a *new* `ClaimsPrincipal` with the modified claims, and update the current authentication ticket or cookie accordingly.

Let’s consider a scenario. Imagine you’ve got an application that authenticates users against a third-party system that provides access tokens enriched with claims. Upon successful authentication, you create an authentication cookie containing these claims for your application. Now, let's say you need to modify a user's role based on an internal event. Instead of making changes to the user store managed by `UserManager`, you must update the authentication cookie with modified claim values.

Here’s the typical workflow I often adopt in these situations:

1.  **Retrieve the Current User:** Obtain the existing `ClaimsPrincipal` associated with the request, typically from `HttpContext.User`.
2.  **Extract Current Claims:** Access the user's `Claims` collection from the `ClaimsPrincipal` and determine which claims need modification.
3.  **Create Modified Claims List:** Generate a new collection of `Claim` objects, keeping all the existing claims that should remain unchanged and replacing those that require updates.
4.  **Generate New Identity:** Create a new `ClaimsIdentity` object using the modified claims collection. You need to provide the same authentication type (e.g., `CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme`) as the original `ClaimsIdentity` to preserve the authentication context.
5.  **Create New Principal:** Construct a new `ClaimsPrincipal` using the new `ClaimsIdentity`.
6.  **Update Authentication:** Finally, re-sign the user with the modified `ClaimsPrincipal`, updating the current session’s cookie or ticket.

To illustrate, let's look at some code examples.

**Example 1: Updating a Simple Claim (e.g., user's nickname)**

```csharp
using System.Security.Claims;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

public async Task UpdateUserNickname(HttpContext context, string newNickname)
{
  var currentPrincipal = context.User;
  if (currentPrincipal == null) return; // Or throw an appropriate exception

  var currentIdentity = (ClaimsIdentity?)currentPrincipal.Identity;
    if(currentIdentity is null) return;
  
  var claims = currentIdentity.Claims.ToList();
    var nicknameClaim = claims.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.GivenName);
    if (nicknameClaim != null)
    {
        claims.Remove(nicknameClaim);
    }

  claims.Add(new Claim(ClaimTypes.GivenName, newNickname));

  var newIdentity = new ClaimsIdentity(claims, currentIdentity.AuthenticationType, currentIdentity.NameClaimType, currentIdentity.RoleClaimType);
  var newPrincipal = new ClaimsPrincipal(newIdentity);

    await context.SignInAsync(
        CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        newPrincipal,
        new AuthenticationProperties { IsPersistent = true });

}
```

**Example 2: Updating User Roles**

```csharp
using System.Security.Claims;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

public async Task UpdateUserRoles(HttpContext context, List<string> newRoles)
{
  var currentPrincipal = context.User;
  if (currentPrincipal == null) return; // Handle null principal

  var currentIdentity = (ClaimsIdentity?)currentPrincipal.Identity;
    if(currentIdentity is null) return;

    var claims = currentIdentity.Claims.Where(c=> c.Type != ClaimTypes.Role).ToList();

    foreach(var role in newRoles){
      claims.Add(new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, role));
    }

    var newIdentity = new ClaimsIdentity(claims, currentIdentity.AuthenticationType, currentIdentity.NameClaimType, currentIdentity.RoleClaimType);
    var newPrincipal = new ClaimsPrincipal(newIdentity);

    await context.SignInAsync(
        CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        newPrincipal,
        new AuthenticationProperties { IsPersistent = true });
}
```

**Example 3: Removing a Custom Claim**

```csharp
using System.Security.Claims;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

public async Task RemoveCustomClaim(HttpContext context, string claimType)
{
    var currentPrincipal = context.User;
    if (currentPrincipal == null) return; // Handle null principal

    var currentIdentity = (ClaimsIdentity?)currentPrincipal.Identity;
        if(currentIdentity is null) return;


    var claims = currentIdentity.Claims.Where(c => c.Type != claimType).ToList();

    var newIdentity = new ClaimsIdentity(claims, currentIdentity.AuthenticationType, currentIdentity.NameClaimType, currentIdentity.RoleClaimType);
    var newPrincipal = new ClaimsPrincipal(newIdentity);

    await context.SignInAsync(
        CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        newPrincipal,
        new AuthenticationProperties { IsPersistent = true });
}
```

In all these examples, the key is to not modify the original `ClaimsPrincipal` object but to create new ones. The call to `context.SignInAsync` with the new principal updates the authentication cookie, reflecting the changes immediately. The `AuthenticationProperties` object allows for customization of the authentication session, in this case setting `IsPersistent` to `true`, to keep the user logged across browser sessions unless the cookie is deleted.

For further, in-depth exploration of claims-based authentication and authorization, I'd recommend a few resources:

*   **"Programming Microsoft ASP.NET Core" by Dino Esposito:** This book provides a comprehensive overview of the entire ASP.NET Core framework, including detailed coverage of authentication and authorization, with a practical and applied focus.
*   **"Professional ASP.NET Core 6" by Jason N. Gaylord et al.:** A valuable resource for deep diving into various features of ASP.NET Core 6, including detailed insights into identity management and claims-based authentication. It is particularly useful if you encounter more complex integration requirements.
*   **The Official Microsoft Documentation:** The .net documentation, particularly the sections on ASP.NET Core Security, Claims-Based Identity, and Cookie Authentication, are invaluable. It offers the most up-to-date information on APIs and best practices.

Ultimately, while `UserManager` provides a convenient abstraction, it’s not the only pathway to updating claims. Direct manipulation of `ClaimsPrincipal` and authentication mechanisms provides us with the flexibility necessary when working with pre-existing user systems or when optimization is needed. Just remember to create a new `ClaimsPrincipal` when modifying claims, not the existing one, and to update the authentication context, typically using `SignInAsync`. It's a nuanced approach, yes, but one I've found incredibly helpful in situations where a "one-size-fits-all" approach doesn't apply.
