Let’s dive straight into it. I recall a particularly challenging project back in the day, involving real-time image processing where we were tasked with dramatically reducing the dimensionality of feature maps without losing crucial information. We ended up leveraging ArrayFire’s max pooling functionality, and frankly, it was a lifesaver. Avoiding custom CUDA kernels, as you're aiming for, significantly simplifies the development and deployment process, which is often paramount in time-sensitive environments. ArrayFire excels at abstracting away a lot of the underlying complexity, and that's exactly what we need here.

Essentially, ArrayFire's max pooling operation efficiently selects the maximum value within predefined regions of an input array. This is extremely effective for feature downsampling in applications like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where preserving dominant features is essential while reducing the spatial dimensions for efficiency. In Rust, interacting with ArrayFire's max pooling is straightforward, using a readily available function.

The crucial element lies in understanding `af::pool2`, which is the core function we'll be employing. This function requires a few parameters: the input array, the kernel dimensions, the stride (the distance between the starting points of adjacent pooling regions), and the padding.

Before we jump into code, it’s important to appreciate that this isn’t just a black box operation. To understand the finer points, I’d recommend reading 'Deep Learning' by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. The chapter on convolutional networks offers invaluable insight into the mathematical foundations and practical significance of pooling operations. Also, for a deeper dive into the parallel processing underpinnings and GPU computation used by ArrayFire, 'Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach' by David B. Kirk and Wen-mei W. Hwu is a fantastic resource.

Now, let's move into some Rust examples to make things concrete. Here’s a basic example demonstrating how to perform 2x2 max pooling with a stride of 2 and no padding, which is a common configuration:

```rust
use arrayfire as af;

fn main() {
    // Example Input Array (4x4)
    let input_array = af::Array::new(&[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0], af::Dim4::new(&[4, 4, 1, 1]));

    // Kernel dimensions: 2x2
    let kernel_dims = af::Dim4::new(&[2, 2, 1, 1]);
    // Stride: 2 in each dimension
    let strides = af::Dim4::new(&[2, 2, 1, 1]);
    // Padding is 0 for no padding.
    let padding = af::Dim4::new(&[0, 0, 0, 0]);

    // Perform Max Pooling
    let output_array = af::pool2(&input_array, kernel_dims, strides, padding, af::PoolMode::MAX);

    // Print the output.
    println!("Output Array:\n{}", output_array);
}
```

This snippet first constructs an input array, defines the kernel and stride dimensions as well as padding, and subsequently performs max pooling via `af::pool2` using `af::PoolMode::MAX`. The output will show the pooled array, which will be half the size of the input array in both dimensions due to the 2x2 kernel and a stride of 2. Notice how we specified `af::PoolMode::MAX`; this is what directs ArrayFire to implement the max-pooling operation.

Next, let's consider a slightly more complex scenario. Suppose we have a larger input and want to introduce some padding to maintain the output dimensions similar to those of the input in a more controlled way, or reduce them slower. We'll use a 3x3 kernel, a stride of 1, and a padding of 1:

```rust
use arrayfire as af;

fn main() {
    // Example input (6x6)
    let input_array = af::Array::new(&[
        1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
        7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0,
        13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0, 17.0, 18.0,
        19.0, 20.0, 21.0, 22.0, 23.0, 24.0,
        25.0, 26.0, 27.0, 28.0, 29.0, 30.0,
        31.0, 32.0, 33.0, 34.0, 35.0, 36.0
        ], af::Dim4::new(&[6, 6, 1, 1]));

    // Kernel dimensions: 3x3
    let kernel_dims = af::Dim4::new(&[3, 3, 1, 1]);
    // Stride: 1 in each dimension
    let strides = af::Dim4::new(&[1, 1, 1, 1]);
    // Padding: 1 in each dimension
    let padding = af::Dim4::new(&[1, 1, 0, 0]);

    // Perform Max Pooling
    let output_array = af::pool2(&input_array, kernel_dims, strides, padding, af::PoolMode::MAX);

    // Print the output.
    println!("Output Array:\n{}", output_array);

}
```

Here, we use a 6x6 array, a 3x3 pooling kernel, a stride of 1, and padding of 1. The padding ensures that the output dimensions will be closer to the input (not reduced by the simple kernel size). Pay close attention to how the `padding` parameter impacts the size of the output array. Padding effectively adds a border of zeros around the image during pooling. With a padding of 1 and a stride of 1, the pooling operation overlaps significantly. This specific configuration, often termed “same” padding, is frequently used in CNNs to keep the spatial dimensions from changing dramatically with each layer.

Finally, let’s look at a case involving color channels. Even though these are handled implicitly by ArrayFire, having the dimensionality explicitly demonstrated will prove instructive. Here is an example that uses an input array that is 4x4 and three channels deep (a small color image example):

```rust
use arrayfire as af;

fn main() {
    let input_data: Vec<f32> = (1..=48).map(|x| x as f32).collect();
    let input_array = af::Array::new(&input_data, af::Dim4::new(&[4, 4, 3, 1]));

    let kernel_dims = af::Dim4::new(&[2, 2, 1, 1]);
    let strides = af::Dim4::new(&[2, 2, 1, 1]);
    let padding = af::Dim4::new(&[0, 0, 0, 0]);

    let output_array = af::pool2(&input_array, kernel_dims, strides, padding, af::PoolMode::MAX);
     println!("Output Array:\n{}", output_array);

}
```

In this scenario, our input is 4x4 with 3 channels (simulating a small color image) – thus, the third dimension of the `Dim4` structure is 3. The same 2x2 pooling operation is applied, but ArrayFire correctly handles the three channels. The output shows a 2x2 array that also maintains the same three channels in depth.

From these examples, it is clear that while you don't need custom CUDA kernels, it's crucial to understand how to set the parameters of `af::pool2` to achieve your desired pooling behavior. This includes adjusting the kernel size, stride, and padding as well as the pooling mode itself. You might want to explore other modes such as average pooling with `af::PoolMode::AVG`, for alternative behavior.

Through careful parameter configuration, you gain significant control over how ArrayFire handles the pooling operation, and its ability to take advantage of the GPU provides very fast execution of these operations. By leveraging ArrayFire directly through its rust interface, you not only save time in development but also have access to a highly optimized implementation of this core functionality, without having to go the route of custom kernel creation and maintenance.
