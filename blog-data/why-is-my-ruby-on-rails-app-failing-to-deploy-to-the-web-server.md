Okay, let's tackle this deployment head-scratcher. I've seen this exact scenario play out more times than i care to count, and each time it feels like unraveling a new kind of knot. So, your rails app is refusing to play nice on the web server, eh? It's not uncommon, and the root cause can be a surprisingly diverse set of gremlins. Often, it isn’t a single showstopper, but a combination of factors that, when ignored, accumulate to a deployment nightmare.

Let’s get down to brass tacks. Typically, the failure to deploy a rails app to a web server falls into a handful of recurring categories. The most frequent culprits, in my experience, boil down to environment misconfigurations, dependency issues, and faulty application code that only reveals itself under deployment conditions. It could also involve the server environment not having necessary system packages or configurations.

First and foremost, the environment discrepancies. This is where "it works on my machine" hits a brick wall. Your development environment is almost certainly configured differently from your production server. This can involve ruby versions, gem versions, database configurations, and even differences in system libraries. For instance, I remember back in 2015, I was working on a social analytics platform; the development environment had an older version of `libxml2` which was causing no issue locally but when deployed to production with a newer version, the gem `nokogiri` was raising a fit. It turned out, the specific version of the library required careful pinning in the deployment scripts.

Let's start with an illustrative example. Here's a common issue involving incorrect ruby version:

```ruby
# Example 1: Ruby Version Mismatch

# In your Gemfile, you might have:
# source 'https://rubygems.org'
# ruby '3.1.0'
# gem 'rails', '~> 7.0'
# ... other gems

# On your server, the ruby might be a different version, such as:
# ruby 2.7.0

# To avoid this, explicitly manage your ruby version on the server via rvm/rbenv
# For rbenv use the below command:
# rbenv install 3.1.0
# rbenv global 3.1.0
# rbenv local 3.1.0 # To set the version for this app
```

This snippet showcases a basic, yet frequently encountered issue: a ruby version mismatch. The gemfile specifies `ruby '3.1.0'`, but if the server runs an older version, it's a recipe for deployment failure, where gems cannot find required dependencies, or the program cannot start with the syntax. Use of tools like `rbenv` or `rvm` is paramount in ensuring consistency. The recommended approach, as shown in the example, is to install the version specified in the `Gemfile` on your server, and activate it for your project.

Next up, the wild west of gem dependencies. Sometimes the dependencies required for the gem set are not available or not consistent between your environments. This often manifests as the server not having the correct version of a specific library or even just not having a specific dependency. The `Gemfile.lock` is your friend here; but you have to be sure it is properly created and committed to version control. Ignoring it can create problems where the dependencies pulled from the gem server during production deployments are different versions than what was tested locally, leading to runtime errors.

Let’s illustrate:

```ruby
# Example 2: Gem Dependency Issues

# Gemfile.lock on local development might have:
# nokogiri (1.13.4)
#  ... other gems

# However on your server, a fresh install using bundle install may inadvertently pick a newer version:
# nokogiri (1.15.0)
#   ...other gems

# When the newer version introduces an API break, the code relying on old APIs will fail

# To mitigate: Ensure to use `bundle install --deployment` during deployment
# This will force bundle to use what's defined in Gemfile.lock
```

This second snippet shows how different versions of the same gem can be problematic. The `Gemfile.lock` file is essential and should always be committed with your code. This ensures that the deployment environment utilizes the precise gem versions tested in the development environment. Using `bundle install --deployment` during deployment is vital to enforce the use of the `Gemfile.lock`. Otherwise, you may end up with updated gem versions that break your application.

Lastly, faulty application code. You might have written code that works fine in development, but crashes spectacularly on the server. One common reason for this is environmental configurations specific to development that do not apply to a production setting. For instance, during development, you might be allowing all connections to a particular service, whereas the production environment might be set up with more restrictive rules. Another common issue can be missing environment variables in the production environment, which you might be passing during local development.

Let's see an example:

```ruby
# Example 3: Missing Environment Variables

# In config/environments/production.rb

# Example of needing an environment variable that may not be set up on the server
# config.email_service_api_key = ENV['EMAIL_API_KEY']

# Your application may crash with the following error:
#  `undefined method [] for nil:NilClass`
#  Because ENV['EMAIL_API_KEY'] may be nil

#Solution:
#Make sure to set up the env variable in your production server, via environment variables or dotenv files:
#export EMAIL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
#Also, consider adding some error handling logic

# config.email_service_api_key = ENV['EMAIL_API_KEY'] || raise "EMAIL_API_KEY environment variable not set in production"
```
The third snippet highlights the importance of environmental variables. Often, APIs or services require specific keys or credentials which are stored as environment variables. When these are absent on the production server, the application might crash. Explicit error handling can prevent these errors from bringing down the application silently. Ensuring all the configurations are present on the target environment is paramount.

Now, how do you tackle these issues systematically? Begin with a solid deployment strategy, preferably using tools such as capistrano or similar automation scripts. These tools help automate the deployment process and ensure that crucial steps such as dependency installation and database migrations are performed correctly. Inspect your logs closely. Server logs are your best friend here; they should clearly point you to the root cause of the error. Make sure you are capturing enough log output to be helpful.

For deepening your understanding, I’d highly recommend these resources. Start with "The Twelve-Factor App" methodology (available online) for best practices in building scalable and deployable web applications. Then, dive into "Agile Web Development with Rails 7" by Sam Ruby et al. It's a comprehensive book which tackles deployment concerns in detail. Another invaluable resource is "Effective DevOps" by Jennifer Davis and Katherine Daniels, to understand a broader view of infrastructure management and deployment best practices.

The process can be complex, but with careful attention to detail and a systematic approach, the deployment issues can be overcome. The key is consistency, meticulous error handling, and understanding that the production environment is a beast that has to be tamed carefully. This issue is less of a black art, and more an exercise in thoroughness and careful debugging; and with enough patience, your application will be deployed.
