Alright,  I've seen my share of Ruby installation headaches over the years, and a refusal to install version 2.2.1 on macOS is definitely a familiar tune. It’s often less about ruby itself and more about the environment it's trying to inhabit. From my experience, issues with older Ruby versions on modern macOS systems usually stem from a few primary suspects, and we can approach troubleshooting them methodically.

The first, and perhaps most frequent cause, is the incompatibility of the version of `openssl` that Ruby 2.2.1 depends on. Ruby versions prior to 2.4 (and arguably even later for some edge cases) relied on older `openssl` libraries. macOS versions released after 2016 typically ship with newer versions which aren’t compatible out of the box. When Ruby 2.2.1 tries to compile, it looks for specific headers and libraries that are no longer present or organized differently by the system.

Secondly, while less frequent than `openssl` issues, the C compiler toolchain plays a crucial role. Ruby is, at its core, written in C, and requires a functional C compiler to build. The version of Xcode and its accompanying command-line tools installed on the system might be too new for the requirements of the Ruby 2.2.1 build process. Xcode updates can introduce changes that lead to compilation failures with older software that isn't aware of newer compiler standards or configurations.

Lastly, the `ruby-build` tool itself, if that's the method being used, might not handle older Ruby versions gracefully if it's out-of-date. This tool is what's often behind the `rbenv` or `rvm` installations, and it needs to know how to build older rubies correctly on newer systems. Sometimes a missing build dependency or a subtle change in how `ruby-build` expects the build environment to be set up can be the culprit.

Now, let's break these potential issues down with some code examples and practical solutions I've personally used:

**Scenario 1: `openssl` mismatch:**

This is a classic. The build log often throws errors related to `ssl.h` not being found or linker errors about undefined symbols related to `openssl`. Here's what we often need to do: pre-emptively install an older `openssl` and instruct the Ruby build to use it:

```bash
# Install an older version of openssl
brew install openssl@1.0

# Ensure it’s in the PATH for the build process
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0/bin:$PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0/include"

# Then, when installing ruby with rbenv or rvm:
RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0" rbenv install 2.2.1 # or rvm install ruby-2.2.1

#Important: remember to re-set the env vars for any new terminal session that attempts to install
```

What this does is specifically tell the ruby build process to look for and use the `openssl@1.0` version we've installed via Homebrew, instead of relying on the system default. The `LDFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS` flags make sure the build process can find the necessary libraries and include files. This approach, in my experience, resolves the majority of `openssl`-related build issues.

**Scenario 2: Compiler issues**

If after tackling openssl, you still face issues, suspect the toolchain. Older Ruby versions might not play well with modern clang. Often, we need to point the build process to an older compiler:

```bash
# Forcing rbenv or rvm to use an older compiler
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.9
export CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.9

# Then, install ruby
rbenv install 2.2.1 #or rvm install ruby-2.2.1
```

This example assumes you have an older version of gcc installed, such as `gcc-4.9`. This might involve installing from a legacy installer or via Homebrew tap. The key thing here is ensuring the build process uses these specifically designated compiler versions instead of the system default clang version which can cause havoc. It's also important to remember to unset these compiler settings after installation to avoid inadvertently using them for newer installations that may not compile with an old GCC version, or having them interfere with the overall system behavior.

**Scenario 3: `ruby-build` related hiccups:**

Sometimes, despite addressing openssl and compiler issues, `ruby-build` might have problems because it lacks updates for legacy Ruby versions. This can be solved with a simple update or a specific `ruby-build` version:

```bash
# Ensure ruby-build is up to date
rbenv update

# or if that doesn't work, install ruby-build manually, pointing to an earlier version
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
cd ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
git checkout <specific commit or tag of ruby-build known to support older rubies, such as a commit from around 2015/2016>
```
This snippet first attempts an update. If updating doesn't suffice, manually cloning `ruby-build` and checking out an older revision, as was common when working with 2.2.1 back in the day, will sometimes fix it, as that older version might still have the necessary workarounds or knowledge of old rubies.

Beyond these specific examples, it’s essential to carefully examine the build output. The compiler’s error messages can point directly to what dependency or configuration is causing the build to fail. Don't dismiss verbose output – the devil is in the details.

For deeper understanding and background, I'd recommend a few resources. “Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development” by Jeff Langr can be incredibly helpful in understanding the underlying compilation process, and this book can help decipher cryptic compiler errors. Also, for understanding how these older ruby versions rely on openssl, take a look at the official ruby documentation for versions prior to 2.4 which go into the specifics about openssl binding and requirements, as well as the release notes for openssl itself around the period, which details the significant breaking changes that caused older builds to fail. While the specifics will not be for macOS per se, it's important to understand the underlying mechanisms to troubleshoot correctly.

Finally, I’d stress patience. Debugging these issues often requires an iterative approach – changing one factor, then rebuilding, to pinpoint the exact cause. And remember to revert changes if they don't fix the problem, so you don't get lost in all sorts of potential fixes. Working with legacy software, especially when it collides with modern systems, always has the potential to be a learning opportunity, even if it's a bit frustrating at times. I trust these steps will shed some light on why your installation is misbehaving and help get your Ruby 2.2.1 environment back on track.
