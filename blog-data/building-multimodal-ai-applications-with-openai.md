dude so this openai vid was totally rad  it's all about how they're building these super-powered multimodal models and the insane things you can do with them  think way beyond just chatbots—we're talking images videos audio all working together like some crazy awesome symphony of ai  the whole point was to show off what's possible and get devs stoked about building the next gen of apps

 so first off the setup they're like "hey we're openai and we make killer ai models  we're not just about research we're about actually *using* this stuff to solve real-world problems"  patrick and simone are the peeps leading the charge on the apply side—getting these things out into the wild  they even dropped that 2024 is gonna be the "year of multimodal models"—totally stole my idea  i'm trademarking "yearofmultimodal.com"  don't even think about it


one key moment was how they described the current state of multimodal ai  it's like a bunch of islands—dalle for images whisper for audio gpt-4 with vision—all separate things  they're totally awesome on their own but not exactly chatting with each other yet  text though that's the connective tissue  like the internet's super-glue holding all these different model islands together for now.


another key bit was this idea that they showed of using text as this bridge between different modalities  like imagine you take a picture of your messy room  you feed it to gpt-4 with vision  it describes it like "a chaotic pile of clothes a half-eaten pizza and a mountain of dirty dishes dominate the space"  then you feed that description to dalle-3 and boom it generates an image of a totally messy room  then you use gpt-4 again to compare the image it made with the original photo then maybe iterate again  you see what i mean?  it's like a feedback loop  and that's a super powerful concept


then there's the whole "human in the loop" thing  in the past you'd have a model create an image a human would look at it judge it  and then give new instructions but now the models can do this comparing and iterating on their own—which is mind-blowing


here's some code that would totally do something like that  just imagine


```python
import openai

def image_generation_loop(initial_image_path, iterations=3):
    """Generates images iteratively based on model feedback."""

    description = openai.Image.create_edit(
        image=open(initial_image_path, "rb"),
        mask=open("mask.png", "rb"), #optional mask
        prompt="improve the image detail and lighting",
        n=1,
        size="1024x1024"
    )

    for i in range(iterations):
        image_url = description["data"][0]["url"]
        response = openai.Image.create(
            prompt=f"Describe the image at {image_url}",
            n=1,
            size="1024x1024"
        )
        new_description = response["data"][0]["url"]

        improved_image = openai.Image.create_edit(
            image=open(image_url, "rb"),
            prompt=f"improve the image based on this description: {new_description}",
            n=1,
            size="1024x1024"
        )

        print(f"Iteration {i+1}: Image URL: {improved_image['data'][0]['url']}")

# example usage
image_generation_loop("my_messy_room.jpg")

```

this isn’t perfect python code and it relies on openai's image and edit apis  but you get the idea  it's a basic loop that gets a description generates an image gets feedback and repeats the process  you could do a similar thing for video by generating keyframes  analyzing them with gpt-4 vision and then using that info to improve future video processing  it's crazy flexible


another huge thing was the video summarization  they showed this thing where they take a video chop it up into frames use gpt-4 with vision to describe each frame  then use whisper to transcribe the audio  then they combine all this textual data to create a super detailed summary—it's like a full multisensory recap of the video in text form!  that’s insane!


here's a snippet that shows how you could approach the frame description part


```python
import openai
from PIL import Image

def describe_video_frames(video_path, num_frames=5):
    """Describes video frames using OpenAI's image captioning."""
    try:
        from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip # you'll need to install moviepy: pip install moviepy
        clip = VideoFileClip(video_path)
        total_duration = clip.duration

        descriptions = []
        for i in range(num_frames):
            time = (i * total_duration) / num_frames
            frame = clip.get_frame(time)
            image = Image.fromarray(frame)
            image.save(f"frame_{i}.jpg")  # save the frame

            response = openai.Image.create(
                image=open(f"frame_{i}.jpg", "rb"),
                prompt="Describe the image in detail",
                n=1,
                size="256x256"  #adjust size as needed
            )
            descriptions.append(response['data'][0]['caption'])

        clip.close()
        return descriptions

    except ImportError:
        print("Error: MoviePy is not installed. Please install it using 'pip install moviepy'")
        return None

# example usage
video_descriptions = describe_video_frames("my_video.mp4")
print(video_descriptions)

```


this code uses moviepy to grab frames from a video and then openai to get captions  obviously you’d need to add the whisper transcription part and combine the data but this is a solid start


and finally the resolution  it's like "hey devs get ready to build awesome multimodal stuff  think big text is the bridge for now  but the future is all about seamless integration of all kinds of data"  it's a call to arms for developers to get creative  to think about how all these crazy new multimodal powers can reshape what we can build  they emphasized that having an agent that can do image inputs will be sick


here's a little something to show you how you could chain together different models using the text-as-bridge concept



```python
import openai

def multimodal_workflow(image_path, query):
    image_description = openai.Image.create(
        image=open(image_path, "rb"),
        prompt="Describe this image",
        n=1,
        size="256x256"
    )

    prompt = f"""
    Image Description: {image_description['data'][0]['caption']}

    User Query: {query}

    Answer:
    """

    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003", # or a suitable multimodal model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )

    return response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()


#example usage
answer = multimodal_workflow("my_room.jpg", "What furniture should I add?")
print(answer)

```

this is a super simple example but it shows how you could feed an image description into another model to get more complex answers  that's the beauty of this text-as-glue idea—it lets you combine models in all kinds of creative ways


basically  the whole video was a total blast of awesomeness  it showed how multimodal models are evolving rapidly how we can use text as a bridge and the kinds of amazing things we'll be able to build in the near future  it was super inspirational  and yeah i'm totally on board with the year of multimodal models  let's make some magic happen
