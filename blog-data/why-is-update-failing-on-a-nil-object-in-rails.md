Alright, let's talk about why you're seeing that `update` fail when it encounters a nil object in Rails. It’s a classic gotcha, and it's usually not as mysterious as it initially seems. I've debugged this exact scenario countless times over the years, often after a late-night push or a rushed feature implementation. It typically stems from a misunderstanding of how ActiveRecord handles associations and object retrieval, particularly when things go sideways in complex workflows.

The core issue is simple: the `update` method, whether we are using `update` on an instance or as a class method, acts upon an *existing* ActiveRecord model instance. If the variable you're attempting to call `update` on is actually `nil`, you're attempting to perform an operation on something that doesn't exist. Ruby, being the object-oriented language that it is, throws an error when you try to call a method on `nil`. It doesn't interpret `nil` as an object capable of being updated. Think of it like trying to modify a car that isn't in the garage – you’d get no traction. This is fundamental to how the object model in ruby works, not something specific to Rails.

Let’s unpack the common places I've seen this happen. First, consider a scenario involving a user and their profile, where the profile might be optional. In your controller, you might have code like this:

```ruby
# Assume user exists and is retrieved previously
def update_profile
    @user = User.find(params[:user_id])
    @user.profile.update(profile_params) # Potential nil error here
    redirect_to user_path(@user)
end
```

If the `@user` in the example above doesn’t have a `profile` associated with it, then `@user.profile` will be `nil`. Calling `update` on `nil` will trigger the dreaded `NoMethodError: undefined method 'update' for nil:NilClass`. The fix here isn't to try to magically update `nil`; instead, it is to create a new profile if one doesn't exist yet. One way to accomplish this using `find_or_create_by` approach:

```ruby
def update_profile
  @user = User.find(params[:user_id])
  @profile = @user.profile || @user.create_profile
  @profile.update(profile_params)
  redirect_to user_path(@user)
end
```

This approach ensures that we have an associated profile object before attempting to update it. If one already exists, we grab it, if not, we create it on the user. Another common problem occurs when dealing with nested attributes. Imagine a form where you are editing a product with nested attributes for its price, including currency information. You might end up doing the following:

```ruby
#Assume @product is preloaded with its id from params[:id]
def update_product
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])
    @product.price.update(price_params) # Possible error here if @product.price is nil
    redirect_to product_path(@product)
end
```

If a `Product` doesn't have a related `Price` object or if the relation is poorly set up, then `@product.price` might be nil when you intend to update the related record. This is a different flavor of the same problem. One approach to this is to ensure association exists and creates one if not, just like the previous scenario. However, in cases of nested attributes, it is often best to rely on nested attributes features provided by ActiveRecord. It’s more idiomatic and handles the creation or update cases more gracefully. Example below:

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
   has_one :price
   accepts_nested_attributes_for :price, update_only: true
end

def update_product
  @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  @product.update(product_params) # Nested params now update or create the price if not existing
  redirect_to product_path(@product)
end
```

In this implementation, within product_params, one can now provide a nested price attribute that can create or update a price record if it exists. This approach, provided by ActiveRecord, is much cleaner and less error-prone.

The third common scenario involves callbacks. If a callback, such as `before_update` tries to access or update an associated record that may not always exist, you may run into this issue. A user might have a log that gets created when an update is made, but that log association is set up after the fact in a migration that has not been run yet on the production system. That is something I’ve witnessed in past debugging sessions.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    has_one :log, dependent: :destroy

    before_update :update_log_message

    def update_log_message
        self.log.update(message: "user updated at #{Time.current}") # Potential error here
    end
end
```

Here, if no log is ever created for that user, then `self.log` will be nil and thus, `update` called on nil is going to fail. A quick conditional statement before updating would fix that.

```ruby
    def update_log_message
      self.log&.update(message: "user updated at #{Time.current}")
    end
```

Here, we are utilizing ruby's safe navigation operator which returns nil if self.log is nil. The `update` method would thus not be called on nil, effectively preventing the crash. These scenarios show the different angles one must consider when trying to update records in Rails when associations and conditional record creation are in play.

In my experience, understanding and addressing these errors isn't about memorizing all edge cases, it’s about being methodical. Debugging these cases involved a systematic approach: confirming which object was nil using `binding.pry` or similar, tracing back why it was nil through the call stack, and then addressing the underlying issue which usually involved ensuring associated objects are created before updates are attempted, or using nested attributes functionality provided by ActiveRecord or safe navigation operators.

For further reading on how ActiveRecord associations function, I recommend the official Ruby on Rails documentation. This is often overlooked, but is an invaluable resource. For a deep dive into object oriented design principles in Ruby, "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby" by Sandi Metz is a cornerstone text. Another helpful resource for understanding relational databases and their interactions with ORM’s such as ActiveRecord is “Understanding SQL” by Martin Gruber. It covers the fundamentals of relational databases and can provide invaluable context to the underpinnings of what happens on the database side when ActiveRecord is attempting an update. Having an intuitive understanding of how ActiveRecord and the database interact with one another is a must for any rails developer. Lastly, while not a book, the guides on the official Ruby on Rails website, focusing on Active Record and form handling, are incredibly helpful and updated with every Rails release.

To summarize, the `update` method failing on a nil object is almost always a symptom of attempting to perform operations on something that hasn't been properly instantiated or loaded into memory. It is not a bug in rails, or a difficult problem to solve, but rather a result of not properly creating or handling records within our applications. By ensuring that associated records are initialized before calling `update` and by using the tools provided by Rails (nested attributes, find_or_create_by, and optional safe navigation operator `&.`) to handle various scenarios and by understanding the error, we can greatly reduce encountering this in the future.
