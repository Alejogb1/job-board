Okay, let's tackle this. I remember a project a few years back, building a custom inventory management system for a client; we ran into exactly this scenario – needing to create a parent object with a dynamic list of associated child objects. It wasn’t as straightforward as the basic tutorials make it seem. We're talking ASP.NET Core 6 MVC here, so expect some reliance on model binding and view components.

The core challenge revolves around ensuring that the data posted from the form correctly maps to your complex object structure, especially when those child lists can vary in length. This requires careful consideration of form naming conventions, model binding behaviors, and sometimes, a touch of javascript for dynamic UI modifications. I’ll lay out my approach, then provide some practical code examples.

First things first, let's define the models. We'll consider a scenario where we're creating an 'Order' and associating multiple 'OrderItem' instances with it.

```csharp
// Models/Order.cs
public class Order
{
    public int OrderId { get; set; }
    public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
    public List<OrderItem> OrderItems { get; set; } = new List<OrderItem>();
}

// Models/OrderItem.cs
public class OrderItem
{
    public int OrderItemId { get; set; }
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    // Foreign Key is not required here because of Entity Framework conventions, but you can add if needed
}
```

The important part to note here is the `OrderItems` property, which is a list. This is where most of the complexity arises in form handling. The conventional approach of having explicit input fields for each `OrderItem` won't cut it when you need dynamic list handling. We need to implement a mechanism to allow the user to dynamically add or remove items before submitting.

My preferred strategy involves using the indexer in HTML form fields, combined with a custom model binder if needed. The key here is understanding how asp.net core binds form data to the controller action. When you submit a form, the name attribute of form fields is used by the model binder to match form data to object properties. With a simple object, this mapping is usually one-to-one. However, with lists, we need to tell the model binder about each item by including an index within square brackets in the name field. For example `OrderItems[0].ProductName` and `OrderItems[1].ProductName`, will map the values submitted into the list correctly if the structure in the server code is ready for it.

Now let’s get to the code:

**Example 1: View with Dynamic Item Adding**

Here’s the razor view that allows for adding order items to the order using some javascript. This is placed inside of the form tag and we’ll have a button that triggers the javascript code.

```cshtml
@model Order

<h2>Create New Order</h2>

<form asp-controller="Order" asp-action="Create" method="post">
  <div asp-validation-summary="ModelOnly" class="text-danger"></div>
  <div class="form-group">
      <label asp-for="OrderDate">Order Date</label>
      <input asp-for="OrderDate" class="form-control" type="date"/>
        <span asp-validation-for="OrderDate" class="text-danger"></span>
  </div>


    <div id="orderItemsContainer">
    </div>

    <button type="button" id="addItemButton" class="btn btn-primary">Add Item</button>

    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-success">Create Order</button>
</form>


<script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
        let itemIndex = 0;
         document.getElementById('addItemButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
              const container = document.getElementById('orderItemsContainer');
            const newItemDiv = document.createElement('div');

             newItemDiv.innerHTML = `
                <div class="form-group">
                   <label>Product Name</label>
                    <input type="text" name="OrderItems[${itemIndex}].ProductName" class="form-control" />
                </div>
                 <div class="form-group">
                     <label>Quantity</label>
                    <input type="number" name="OrderItems[${itemIndex}].Quantity" class="form-control" />
                </div>
                <div class="form-group">
                    <label>Price</label>
                    <input type="number" step="0.01" name="OrderItems[${itemIndex}].Price" class="form-control" />
                </div>
                <hr/>`;

             container.appendChild(newItemDiv);
           itemIndex++;
          });
     });
</script>
```

In this example, notice that the generated `input` fields for `OrderItem` properties use the syntax: `name="OrderItems[${itemIndex}].ProductName"` and so on. The javascript part dynamically adds new input fields. The most important takeaway here is the generation of the correct HTML form naming structure that is necessary for the model binder in ASP.NET Core to correctly map values to a list.

**Example 2: Controller Action for Processing the Post**

The controller action now needs to be set up to handle the request and take this data from the posted form and map it to the order model along with the dynamically created order items. Here's the corresponding controller action:

```csharp
// Controllers/OrderController.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using ComplexObjectCreation.Models;
namespace ComplexObjectCreation.Controllers
{
    public class OrderController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public IActionResult Create()
        {
            return View();
        }


       [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult Create(Order order)
        {
            if(ModelState.IsValid)
            {
                //Process order creation here
               // Log order information for now
                Console.WriteLine($"Order Date: {order.OrderDate}");
                if (order.OrderItems != null)
                {
                    foreach (var item in order.OrderItems)
                    {
                       Console.WriteLine($"\tProduct: {item.ProductName}, Qty: {item.Quantity}, Price: {item.Price}");
                    }
                }
               // Redirect to order list or detail after successful processing
                 return RedirectToAction("Create"); //Redirect to same page
            }

             // If model is invalid, redisplay the form to correct the error.
             return View(order);
        }
    }
}
```

The `Create` action method, decorated with the `[HttpPost]` attribute, accepts an `Order` model. ASP.NET Core’s model binding will automatically populate the `Order` object, including the `OrderItems` list, thanks to the naming conventions used in the HTML input fields. No custom model binder is needed in this case. The system takes in the data from the request, performs model validation and executes the action.

**Example 3: Adding Validation**

Adding validation is also very useful in preventing invalid model data to be saved to the database. Here is the code example with data validation implemented:

```csharp
// Models/Order.cs
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
public class Order
{
    public int OrderId { get; set; }
    [Required(ErrorMessage="Order Date is required.")]
    public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
    public List<OrderItem> OrderItems { get; set; } = new List<OrderItem>();
}

// Models/OrderItem.cs
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

public class OrderItem
{
    public int OrderItemId { get; set; }
   [Required(ErrorMessage="Product name is required")]
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    [Required(ErrorMessage="Quantity is required")]
    [Range(1, int.MaxValue, ErrorMessage="Quantity must be greater than 0.")]
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    [Required(ErrorMessage="Price is required.")]
    [Range(0.01, double.MaxValue, ErrorMessage="Price must be greater than 0.")]
    public decimal Price { get; set; }

}
```
And then in the controller, the following line `if(ModelState.IsValid)` checks if the model validation checks are satisfied or not. If the model is invalid, the view returns the form with the model back to the browser to display the validation messages.

To get a deeper dive into this, I'd suggest consulting 'Pro ASP.NET Core MVC 6' by Adam Freeman. It provides comprehensive coverage of model binding, form handling, and validation within the ASP.NET Core ecosystem. Also, for a more fundamental grasp of the underlying technologies, 'Programming Microsoft ASP.NET Core' by Dino Esposito is very informative, especially for the section that handles model binding. Finally, exploring the official ASP.NET Core documentation on model binding is always a great practice.

In conclusion, handling complex objects with lists in ASP.NET Core MVC boils down to these core ideas: consistent HTML form field naming using indexes for lists, relying on the built-in model binder, optionally using javascript to dynamically add the forms on the fly, and the application of data validation to guarantee the data integrity. It's not always a walk in the park, but with a methodical approach, it’s definitely manageable. I hope this helps.
