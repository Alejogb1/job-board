Okay, let's delve into this. I've bumped into this particular quirk with cancellation tokens more times than I care to recount, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations that involve delays or timeouts. The core issue, as you've observed, isn’t that the cancellation token *always* waits for the full delay duration before triggering the cancellation; it's that, often, the cancellation logic isn't implemented in a way that actively monitors the cancellation token during the delay. The delay itself doesn't inherently care about the cancellation. It's how that delay is *used* in conjunction with the token. Let’s explore how this happens, and more importantly, how we can rectify it.

The problem isn’t with the token itself; cancellation tokens are designed to signal when an operation should stop. It's the *implementation* of the delayed operation which might be failing to check for this cancellation signal during the delay period. We often tend to use operations like `Task.Delay` or other blocking delay mechanisms. These, by themselves, are inert to cancellations unless you programmatically tell them to check for it. This means if you simply call `Task.Delay(someDelay)` then attempt to cancel it halfway through, the delay will simply continue until it’s finished, completely ignoring the cancellation token you might have associated with it.

I recall a particular incident during my time building a service that processed real-time sensor data. We had a situation where a data fetch operation would time out after, say, ten seconds if no data arrived. We dutifully implemented a cancellation token in our logic, thinking we had the bases covered. But, on occasion, we noticed the system would still hold up for the full ten seconds, even when we explicitly triggered the cancellation after only three seconds. It took a bit of debugging to trace the problem back to how we were handling the `Task.Delay` associated with our timeout logic. We weren’t actively checking for cancellation during the delay.

So, what's the typical culprit, and what are some practical remedies? Typically, naive implementations use `Task.Delay` without checking `CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested`. This means the thread will sleep, and it won't wake up and check the cancellation status until the full delay is over. Now, let me illustrate this with a few code snippets.

**Snippet 1: The Problematic Approach**

This snippet demonstrates the typical issue. We initiate a delay using `Task.Delay`, but we never actively check for cancellation status.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class DelayExample
{
    public static async Task DoWorkAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken, int delayMilliseconds)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting work...");
        try
        {
            await Task.Delay(delayMilliseconds, cancellationToken);
            Console.WriteLine("Work completed successfully."); // This will not print on cancellation
        }
        catch(OperationCanceledException)
        {
             Console.WriteLine("Operation cancelled.");
        }
    }

    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
        var workTask = DoWorkAsync(cts.Token, 5000);

        await Task.Delay(2000); // Wait 2 seconds
        Console.WriteLine("Cancelling operation.");
        cts.Cancel();

        try
        {
             await workTask; // This will return when task completes, it might finish if the cancel does not reach it in time, thus no cancel exception will be thrown.
        } catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Operation cancellation was caught.");
        }
        Console.WriteLine("End Program.");
        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
```

In this case, even though we call `cts.Cancel()` after 2 seconds, the `Task.Delay(5000, cancellationToken)` will *continue for the full 5000 milliseconds* unless we check explicitly for cancellation in the delay loop itself. The `OperationCanceledException` is only thrown once the delay is over.

**Snippet 2: The Corrected Approach with Cancellation Monitoring**

Here's where the magic happens. We explicitly check `cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested` within the delay loop, and if the token has signalled cancellation, we throw an `OperationCanceledException`. This pattern provides the desired behavior of immediate cancellation when the token is signaled.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class BetterDelayExample
{
    public static async Task DoWorkAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken, int delayMilliseconds)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting work...");

        try
        {
            for(int i = 0; i < delayMilliseconds; i+= 100)
            {
                if(cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
                {
                   cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
                }
                await Task.Delay(100);
            }
             Console.WriteLine("Work completed successfully.");
        }
         catch(OperationCanceledException)
        {
             Console.WriteLine("Operation cancelled.");
        }

    }

    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
         var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
         var workTask =  DoWorkAsync(cts.Token, 5000);
         await Task.Delay(2000); // Wait 2 seconds
        Console.WriteLine("Cancelling operation.");
        cts.Cancel();
        try{
            await workTask;
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Operation cancellation was caught.");
        }
        Console.WriteLine("End Program.");
        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
```
With this approach, the `DoWorkAsync` method will check the cancellation token status within the delay loop. As such, it will throw a `OperationCanceledException` as soon as the token is cancelled.

**Snippet 3: Using `Task.WaitAsync` for Cancellable Delays (Advanced)**

For more fine-grained control, you can combine `Task.Delay` with `Task.WaitAsync` which accepts a `CancellationToken`. This approach is especially helpful for managing more complex asynchronous workflows.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class WaitAsyncExample
{
    public static async Task DoWorkAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken, int delayMilliseconds)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting work...");
        try
        {
            await Task.Delay(delayMilliseconds).WaitAsync(cancellationToken);
            Console.WriteLine("Work completed successfully.");
        }
        catch(OperationCanceledException)
        {
             Console.WriteLine("Operation cancelled.");
        }
    }

    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
        var workTask = DoWorkAsync(cts.Token, 5000);
        await Task.Delay(2000);
        Console.WriteLine("Cancelling operation.");
        cts.Cancel();
        try
        {
          await workTask;
        }
        catch(OperationCanceledException)
        {
           Console.WriteLine("Operation cancellation was caught.");
        }
         Console.WriteLine("End Program.");
         await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
```
Here, `Task.Delay(delayMilliseconds).WaitAsync(cancellationToken)` will effectively cancel the delay if the token is cancelled. This offers a more streamlined way of managing cancellable delays.

These three snippets illustrate that the problem is not with the cancellation token itself but with how we implement delays and check for the cancellation signal during those delays. For further understanding, I would recommend reviewing the documentation for `Task.Delay`, `CancellationToken`, and `Task.WaitAsync`. Specifically, focus on the asynchronous programming models within the Microsoft .NET documentation or equivalent platform for your tech stack. Further, the book "Concurrency in C# Cookbook" by Stephen Cleary is an excellent resource for more in-depth knowledge about asynchronous programming and cancellation tokens in C#, and it provides practical guidance in managing these scenarios effectively. Understanding the nuances of asynchronous operations and cancellation will help in building more robust and responsive applications. It's a common pitfall, but with a bit of vigilance and proper implementation, it's entirely avoidable.
