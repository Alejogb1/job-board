Okay, let's dive into this. Sending attachments via MailKit from a website is a common need, and while the library makes it relatively straightforward, there are nuances that can trip you up. I remember a project back in '18, where we were building a customer support portal, and getting file attachments into email responses was a critical feature. We ran into several challenges, ranging from file encoding to ensuring the correct mime types, so I’ve certainly had my hands dirty with this topic.

First off, let's establish that MailKit doesn't magically handle file uploads from your web framework – you need to handle that part independently. Whether you are using asp.net, node.js, python's django, or something else is irrelevant to Mailkit. You need to first receive the file on the server, then integrate with MailKit. Once you have the file available on the server-side as a stream, or file path it's smooth sailing. The core of sending attachments hinges on using the `MimeKit.BodyBuilder` class to construct the message body.

Here's the basic workflow: You'd typically create a `MimeMessage` instance, populate the to, from, subject, and optionally plain text body. Then, you utilize `BodyBuilder` to add the attachments. `BodyBuilder` automatically determines the `mime-type` from the file extension in most cases but, sometimes you need to manually specify it. When a user uploads a file to our web application, we handle the upload on the server then create a `MimePart` from the uploaded file and append it to the `BodyBuilder.Multipart` array. Finally, we assign `BodyBuilder.ToMessageBody()` to the `mimeMessage.Body` before sending it using `SmtpClient`.

Let's get into some code examples to illustrate this.

**Example 1: Attaching a file from a file path (C#):**

```csharp
using MailKit;
using MailKit.Net.Smtp;
using MimeKit;
using System.IO;

public class EmailSender
{
    public void SendEmailWithAttachment(string toEmail, string subject, string body, string filePath, string smtpServer, int smtpPort, string smtpUsername, string smtpPassword)
    {
        var message = new MimeMessage();
        message.From.Add(new MailboxAddress("Your Name", "your_email@example.com"));
        message.To.Add(new MailboxAddress("Recipient Name", toEmail));
        message.Subject = subject;

        var builder = new BodyBuilder();
        builder.TextBody = body;

        var attachment = new MimePart()
        {
            Content = new MimeContent(File.OpenRead(filePath), ContentEncoding.Default),
            ContentDisposition = new ContentDisposition(ContentDisposition.Attachment),
            ContentTransferEncoding = ContentEncoding.Base64,
            FileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath)
        };
        builder.Attachments.Add(attachment);
        message.Body = builder.ToMessageBody();

        using (var client = new SmtpClient())
        {
            client.Connect(smtpServer, smtpPort, false); // Consider true for SSL/TLS
            client.Authenticate(smtpUsername, smtpPassword);
            client.Send(message);
            client.Disconnect(true);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SendEmailWithAttachment` method takes the recipient's email address, subject, body, and the path to the file you want to attach. The code creates a `MimeMessage`, populates the header details, and then creates a `BodyBuilder`. The crucial step is creating a `MimePart` from the file path. The `MimeContent` object manages the file's data, `ContentDisposition.Attachment` tells the recipient's email client it's an attachment, and the `FileName` is the suggested name for the saved file. Notice `ContentEncoding.Base64`; this is almost always the appropriate encoding for attachments. Finally, the `BodyBuilder`'s `Attachments.Add()` method adds the `MimePart` object.

**Example 2: Attaching a file from a Stream (C#):**

```csharp
using MailKit;
using MailKit.Net.Smtp;
using MimeKit;
using System.IO;
using System.Net.Mime;

public class EmailSenderStream
{
    public void SendEmailWithAttachment(string toEmail, string subject, string body, Stream fileStream, string fileName, string smtpServer, int smtpPort, string smtpUsername, string smtpPassword)
    {
        var message = new MimeMessage();
        message.From.Add(new MailboxAddress("Your Name", "your_email@example.com"));
        message.To.Add(new MailboxAddress("Recipient Name", toEmail));
        message.Subject = subject;

        var builder = new BodyBuilder();
        builder.TextBody = body;

        var attachment = new MimePart()
        {
             Content = new MimeContent(fileStream, ContentEncoding.Default),
             ContentDisposition = new ContentDisposition(ContentDisposition.Attachment),
             ContentTransferEncoding = ContentEncoding.Base64,
             FileName = fileName
        };

        builder.Attachments.Add(attachment);
        message.Body = builder.ToMessageBody();

        using (var client = new SmtpClient())
        {
            client.Connect(smtpServer, smtpPort, false); // Consider true for SSL/TLS
            client.Authenticate(smtpUsername, smtpPassword);
            client.Send(message);
            client.Disconnect(true);
        }
    }
}
```

This example does exactly the same but instead accepts a stream as input instead of a file path. Using a `Stream` object is very flexible. Imagine the file coming directly from the user's browser or a web API call.  This shows how the core logic stays consistent, whether the file originates from a file path or an in-memory representation. You will almost always need to use this technique for any user generated attachment. Also, note the addition of the filename as an argument to the method.

**Example 3: Explicitly setting the Mime-type (C#):**

```csharp
using MailKit;
using MailKit.Net.Smtp;
using MimeKit;
using System.IO;

public class EmailSenderExplicitMime
{
    public void SendEmailWithAttachment(string toEmail, string subject, string body, string filePath, string smtpServer, int smtpPort, string smtpUsername, string smtpPassword)
    {
        var message = new MimeMessage();
        message.From.Add(new MailboxAddress("Your Name", "your_email@example.com"));
        message.To.Add(new MailboxAddress("Recipient Name", toEmail));
        message.Subject = subject;

        var builder = new BodyBuilder();
        builder.TextBody = body;
        var mimeType = MimeTypes.GetMimeType(Path.GetFileName(filePath));

        var attachment = new MimePart(mimeType)
        {
            Content = new MimeContent(File.OpenRead(filePath), ContentEncoding.Default),
            ContentDisposition = new ContentDisposition(ContentDisposition.Attachment),
            ContentTransferEncoding = ContentEncoding.Base64,
            FileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath)
        };

        builder.Attachments.Add(attachment);
        message.Body = builder.ToMessageBody();

        using (var client = new SmtpClient())
        {
            client.Connect(smtpServer, smtpPort, false); // Consider true for SSL/TLS
            client.Authenticate(smtpUsername, smtpPassword);
            client.Send(message);
            client.Disconnect(true);
        }
    }
}
```

This example shows how you can explicitly set the mime type of an attachment. While MailKit can usually infer this from the file extension, sometimes you may need to set it manually. In this example I have called the static `MimeTypes.GetMimeType()` method to get the mime type of the file based off the file name. If MailKit can't figure out the mime type, it will default to `application/octet-stream`. In my experience, it's beneficial to be explicit if you can, especially if you handle less common file types. For a more thorough solution, you could add custom mapping logic if needed.

The `MimeKit` documentation is the most crucial resource here. Specifically, review the sections on `MimeMessage`, `BodyBuilder`, and `MimePart`. The [MimeKit documentation](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit) is your best source for practical insights, as it's directly from the author. For a deeper understanding of internet email, I would also recommend studying *RFC 5322*, *Internet Message Format*. Understanding this will give you a more thorough understanding of what is going on under the hood when sending attachments. Also, for a deeper understanding of mime types, check out the `mime-types` package specification *RFC 6838* and the relevant IANA registry. These are standard documents and not necessarily programming specific but understanding these will allow you to troubleshoot any issues you might have with sending attachments via email.

In my past experience, these practical concepts and deep understanding of standards helped avoid countless hours of head-scratching, and I trust they'll be useful to you as well. Remember, attention to detail in mime types and file encoding can be the key to a smooth email experience for your users.
