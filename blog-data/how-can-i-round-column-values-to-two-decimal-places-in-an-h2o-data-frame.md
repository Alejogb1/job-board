Okay, let's tackle this. The task of rounding numeric columns to a specific number of decimal places is a common one when working with data, especially for presentation or downstream analysis. I've bumped into this countless times, particularly when dealing with financial or scientific datasets where precision is critical but excessive decimal places can clutter the view. Let’s walk through how to do it effectively with H2O data frames.

H2O, being designed for scalable machine learning, provides several ways to manipulate data. We're not limited to simple, in-place modifications. We can create new columns, effectively working in a functional programming paradigm, which I generally find cleaner and safer when dealing with large datasets. This avoids any unexpected mutations of our original data.

First, let's consider the most direct approach: using the `round()` function on the specific columns. If you’re just after a simple conversion, this is your go-to method.

```python
import h2o
from h2o.estimators import H2OGradientBoostingEstimator

h2o.init()

# create a sample h2o dataframe
data = {'col1': [1.2345, 2.5678, 3.9123, 4.6789, 5.3210],
        'col2': [6.7890, 7.1234, 8.4567, 9.8765, 10.5432],
        'col3': [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]}
h2o_df = h2o.H2OFrame(data)

# Round col1 and col2 to two decimal places. We need to convert them to float first.
h2o_df["col1_rounded"] = h2o_df["col1"].asnumeric().round(2)
h2o_df["col2_rounded"] = h2o_df["col2"].asnumeric().round(2)

print(h2o_df)
```

In the snippet above, I've created a small H2O frame. We access the columns using bracket notation – very similar to pandas. We use `asnumeric()` to ensure that the data is in the correct format to be rounded (this would be redundant here since the columns are already numeric, but good practice if they might be something else, like strings). Then, the `round(2)` method efficiently handles rounding to two decimal places. Crucially, note that we create new columns ("col1_rounded", "col2_rounded") rather than modifying the originals. I find this approach greatly reduces debugging overhead in the long run.

Now, let's say you have a larger data frame with many numeric columns that require rounding. It becomes cumbersome to list them individually. We could instead create a helper function that iterates through all numeric columns and applies rounding. This is more scalable.

```python
def round_numeric_columns(h2o_frame, decimal_places):
    for col_name in h2o_frame.columns:
        if h2o_frame[col_name].isnumeric():
            h2o_frame[col_name + "_rounded"] = h2o_frame[col_name].round(decimal_places)
    return h2o_frame

# Reuse the previous h2o_df
rounded_df = round_numeric_columns(h2o_df, 2)
print(rounded_df)
```

Here, the `round_numeric_columns` function iterates through all columns, checks if each one is numeric using `isnumeric()`, and then rounds the numeric ones and appends the rounded result as a new column. While this function is convenient and scalable, there are some caveats to consider. We're still creating new columns with the "_rounded" suffix, which is necessary if you want to keep the original unrounded data. Also, while I've not included an example here, there might be cases where you have numeric-like data coded as a string or factor, and they will not be handled unless they are converted to numeric explicitly beforehand. I generally avoid in-place modification, but if that's what you need for your task, you could modify the code to write to the original column name instead.

Finally, it's worthwhile exploring using `h2o.H2OFrame.apply()` for similar tasks. I find that a functional approach can sometimes result in more readable and maintainable code, particularly when dealing with more complex transformations. `apply` allows you to pass a lambda function or a pre-defined function that is executed on each row or column of the frame, with the flexibility to access and manipulate data at a finer grain than other more direct approaches.

```python
import h2o
h2o.init()
# Again, create a sample h2o dataframe
data = {'col1': [1.2345, 2.5678, 3.9123, 4.6789, 5.3210],
        'col2': [6.7890, 7.1234, 8.4567, 9.8765, 10.5432],
        'col3': [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]}
h2o_df = h2o.H2OFrame(data)

# Use apply to selectively round columns.
cols_to_round = ["col1", "col2"]

def round_func(row, cols, decimal_places):
    new_row = list(row) # make a copy of the row
    for i, col in enumerate(cols):
        col_index = h2o_df.names.index(col) # find the index of the column
        if h2o_df[col].isnumeric():
            new_row[col_index] = round(row[col_index], decimal_places)
    return new_row
    
rounded_df = h2o_df.apply(round_func, axis=1, args=[cols_to_round, 2], column_names = h2o_df.names)
print(rounded_df)
```

Here, I've created a `round_func` that takes a row and the names of the columns we want to change along with the desired number of decimals. I make a copy of the row to avoid in-place modification, find the columns by index, and check if the column is numeric, then apply `round`. The `axis=1` means it's operating on each row, with args passing in column names and decimals, and column_names ensures the original names are maintained. Note that this implementation does modify the original columns, so if you need to preserve those, you need to handle this appropriately, typically by writing to new columns. I find the functional aspect of apply especially helpful in large transformation pipelines, where there may be multiple complex operations on different subsets of the data before downstream processing.

In summary, the best approach to rounding depends on the specifics of your task. For a simple, one-off rounding of one or two columns, direct access with `round()` is convenient. For larger datasets or repeated operations, using a function to iterate over numeric columns provides better scalability and maintainability. When more control or complex logic is involved, `apply` with a custom function will be more robust.

For a deeper dive into data manipulation with H2O, I’d strongly recommend reading through the official H2O documentation. For more general concepts around data wrangling, "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney is a classic and well worth studying. While it is centered around pandas, it covers many similar concepts that apply broadly. I’d also suggest “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” by Martin Kleppmann for a deeper conceptual understanding of data processing and architecture, if you are interested in the underlying engineering of systems that manage large datasets. The key is not just learning the syntax, but also understanding the underlying principles of data handling, so you choose the correct and efficient method for your data processing workflows.
