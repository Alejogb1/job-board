,  I’ve certainly bumped into this exact headache more times than I care to recall, especially back during my time working on those complex image segmentation models. Debugging tensor shape mismatches can feel like chasing shadows initially, but it's almost always rooted in a straightforward logical error within the code. So, when tensors 'a' and 'b' exhibit a dimension 3 size discrepancy, it boils down to the operations attempting to be performed on them not aligning with their respective shapes.

Think of it this way: tensors, at their core, are just multi-dimensional arrays. Each dimension represents a different axis of the data. Dimension 0 might be the number of samples, dimension 1 the features, dimension 2 spatial height in an image, and so on. When dimension 3 has mismatched sizes between tensors 'a' and 'b', it indicates that either the inputs were not prepared correctly for a specific operation or there’s an incorrect expectation of the tensor shapes before an action occurs (like an element-wise operation or matrix multiplication that needs compatible dimensions).

A common reason for this is when you’re dealing with broadcasting. Broadcasting is a powerful feature that allows operations between tensors with differing shapes, but it has strict rules. For two tensors to be broadcastable, their dimensions need to be compatible. They are compatible if they are equal or if one of them is one. If dimension 3 is, say, 10 for tensor 'a' and 12 for tensor 'b', and you attempt a simple addition or multiplication without the ability to correctly broadcast, this exception is the result. The system can't 'stretch' the dimensions to match if they don't fulfill the criteria for broadcasting.

Another scenario I've encountered involves reshaping. If tensor 'a' is reshaped before an operation and the developer miscalculates the target shape, or if there was a miscalculation when generating the data, this will lead to mismatched sizes at dimension 3, or other dimensions of course. Sometimes, it's simply a matter of a mistake in the index used when accessing or slicing parts of these tensors. Or when assembling tensors.

To illustrate these situations, let me give you some code examples.

**Example 1: Broadcasting issues**

```python
import torch

# Assume a batch size of 5, 3 color channels, and 256x256 image
a = torch.randn(5, 3, 256, 256)
# Assume a per-pixel offset but with incorrect dimensions:
b = torch.randn(5, 3, 200, 200)

try:
  #This will throw an exception since 256 != 200 in dimension 3
  result = a + b
except RuntimeError as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}")

#Correct broadcasting needs shapes that are equal or one
b = torch.randn(1,1,1,256)
result = a + b #Now this will correctly broadcast
print(f"Shape after broadcasting:{result.shape}") # Shape will be 5,3,256,256
```

In this example, tensor ‘a’ is a 4-dimensional tensor, and tensor ‘b’ is created with mismatched spatial dimensions in dimensions 2 and 3. In the first attempt to add them, it results in a runtime error, specifically due to broadcasting limitations. Tensor broadcasting allows shapes to be expanded but only in the cases where one of them is 1 or they are identical. The second case correctly broadcasts.

**Example 2: Reshaping Errors**

```python
import torch

# Original tensor
a = torch.randn(10, 20, 30, 40)

# Intended reshape to 10, 20, 60, 20. The number of total elements has to remain the same.
try:
    b = a.reshape(10, 20, 60, 20) # This results in an error
except RuntimeError as e:
   print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correctly reshaping the tensor to keep total elements the same.
b = a.reshape(10, 20, 40, 30)

#Correct tensor multiplication, which now succeeds after correct reshaping.
c = torch.randn(10,20,40,30) #Random tensor with a matching shape as b
result = b*c
print(f"Shape of result: {result.shape}")
```

Here, tensor ‘a’ initially has dimensions 10x20x30x40. The reshape to 10,20,60,20 was attempted, which is incorrect since that results in a different number of total elements (10x20x30x40 != 10x20x60x20). The error informs of this discrepancy. The corrected version keeps the number of elements correct, and a multiplication is then successful. This highlights that the dimensions may align but the elements need to align. This is why we have the mismatch errors.

**Example 3: Incorrect Indexing/Slicing**

```python
import torch

a = torch.randn(2, 3, 4, 5) #Batch of 2, 3,4,5
b = torch.randn(2, 3, 4, 5) #Batch of 2, 3,4,5

# Extracting slices from a with a misaligned dimension in dimension 2.
a_slice = a[:, :, 1:4, :] # Size will be 2,3,3,5
b_slice = b[:,:,2:5, :] # Size will be 2,3,3,5
# Both slices have compatible sizes.

try:
    result = a_slice + b_slice
    print(f"Result: {result.shape}")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

a_slice_2 = a[:,:,1:3, :] # Size will be 2,3,2,5
b_slice_2 = b[:,:,2:5,:] # Size will be 2,3,3,5

try:
    result = a_slice_2 + b_slice_2
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this example, a and b are created with matching dimensions. The first slice for both a and b keeps dimension 3 the same size, and broadcasting is successful. However the second attempt on a_slice_2 and b_slice_2 generates tensors that differ in dimension 2, thus the runtime error.

From my experience, the best approach is to methodically go through your code and pay close attention to these details:

1.  **Data Preparation**: Where do tensors ‘a’ and ‘b’ come from? Check the source to verify if their shapes are as expected.
2.  **Reshape Operations**: Review all `.reshape()` or similar functions and confirm the target shape calculations are correct and keep the number of elements consistent. A simple mistake in these calculations can lead to unexpected shape issues.
3.  **Slicing Operations**: Check all your slicing operations. Slicing and indexing can introduce errors that create differing dimensions between tensors.
4.  **Broadcasting Expectations**: Understand how broadcasting works. Be clear about which dimensions should align or be singleton (equal to one) for operations.
5. **Debugging Tools**: Leverage debugging tools effectively. PyTorch, for example, allows you to print shapes or use debuggers for step-by-step analysis.

In terms of further resources, I'd recommend taking a close look at:

*   **"Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet:** This provides a very good foundation on working with tensors and their shapes. This is a very practical guide that helped me early in my deep learning career.
*   **"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop:** A more theoretical approach, but the foundational math and concepts around array manipulations are explained clearly and in detail, offering insights for advanced debugging.
*   **The PyTorch documentation itself:** The official documentation has excellent explanations of tensor operations, broadcasting rules, and reshaping functions with real-world examples.

The underlying principle is always the same: a mismatch in dimension 3 implies that the mathematical operations are trying to work on tensors that are fundamentally incompatible. Through rigorous analysis, careful calculation, and mindful code writing, those pesky shape errors can be efficiently resolved.
