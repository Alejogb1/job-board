, let’s tackle this. The discrepancy between a shape represented as `(None, 784)` and one represented as `(None, 28, 28)` is a common stumbling block, particularly when working with image data, and I've seen it crop up countless times in my own projects. This isn't some abstract theoretical issue; it’s a very real, practical concern that usually manifests when you're processing data for machine learning models, especially neural networks. The core issue here is about data representation and how your model expects its inputs.

Essentially, the `(None, 784)` shape is indicative of a flattened vector, a one-dimensional array where, in this context, each of the 784 elements represents a pixel value. The `None` dimension usually signifies a batch size, meaning your model can process multiple examples simultaneously, but the number isn't fixed beforehand. On the other hand, `(None, 28, 28)` suggests a two-dimensional structure, specifically a 28x28 matrix, also with a flexible batch size. This is typically the format of grayscale image data or sometimes a single-channel image. The underlying problem stems from data being structured differently, despite ultimately representing the same information.

From experience, when I've encountered this, it usually comes down to either pre-processing steps or a mismatch in expectations between data loaders and model architecture. For example, you might have a dataset where images are stored as flat vectors, or perhaps a model expecting a flattened vector while you are passing in a matrix, or vice versa. It is also possible that image data are being read as a flat vector at some point during data loading, so understanding how your data is read, transformed and passed to the model is key.

The solution, naturally, revolves around reshaping the data. We need to convert the flattened vector into its matrix equivalent or flatten a matrix back into vector. Depending on the situation, we might use libraries such as numpy, tensorflow, or pytorch, to make these changes. It is essential to remember that reshaping isn't just about changing the numbers of rows and columns; it's about changing the *interpretation* of those numbers.

Let's illustrate this with some code examples.

**Example 1: Reshaping a flattened vector into a 2D matrix (using numpy).**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate a flattened image
flattened_image = np.random.rand(784)  # shape is (784,)
batch_flattened = np.random.rand(10, 784) # shape is (10,784)

# Reshape it to 28x28
reshaped_image = flattened_image.reshape((28, 28))  # shape is (28, 28)

# Reshape a batch of images into a batch of 2D matrices.
batch_reshaped = batch_flattened.reshape((-1, 28, 28)) # shape is (10, 28, 28)

print(f"Shape of flattened image: {flattened_image.shape}")
print(f"Shape of reshaped image: {reshaped_image.shape}")
print(f"Shape of batch flattened image: {batch_flattened.shape}")
print(f"Shape of batch reshaped image: {batch_reshaped.shape}")
```

In this example, we're creating a simulated flattened image vector with 784 elements, then using numpy’s reshape function to convert it into a 28x28 matrix. The `-1` in the reshape operation ensures that the batch size remains the same while the flattened vector is correctly reshaped. This can be very handy when processing batches of data. The batch is reshaped to `(number of samples, 28, 28)`.

**Example 2: Reshaping a 2D matrix into a flattened vector (using numpy).**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate a 28x28 image
image_2d = np.random.rand(28, 28) # shape is (28, 28)
batch_image_2d = np.random.rand(10, 28, 28) # shape is (10, 28, 28)

# Flatten it into a vector
flattened_image_2 = image_2d.flatten() # shape is (784,)

# Flatten a batch of images
flattened_batch_2 = batch_image_2d.reshape((-1, 784)) # shape is (10, 784)

print(f"Shape of 2D image: {image_2d.shape}")
print(f"Shape of flattened image: {flattened_image_2.shape}")
print(f"Shape of batch 2D image: {batch_image_2d.shape}")
print(f"Shape of batch flattened image: {flattened_batch_2.shape}")
```

Here, we’re going the opposite way, turning the matrix into its flattened form. This is needed when input to model expects a flattened input. Using `.flatten()` does this without needing to specify dimensions. The batch is reshaped to `(number of samples, 784)`.

**Example 3: Reshaping within a model using TensorFlow/Keras.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Model expects (None, 784) as input
model_flattened_input = models.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


# Model expects (None, 28, 28) as input
model_2d_input = models.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(28, 28)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Example 2D Image data
example_2d_image = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28))
flattened_input = tf.reshape(example_2d_image, (1, 784)) # Reshape the data

# Example flat image data
example_flattened_image = tf.random.normal((1, 784))
reshaped_input = tf.reshape(example_flattened_image, (1, 28, 28)) # Reshape the data

# Passing reshaped flattened data
model_flattened_input(flattened_input)

# Passing reshaped 2D data
model_2d_input(reshaped_input)

print(f"Model with flattened input expects input shape : {model_flattened_input.input_shape}")
print(f"Model with 2D input expects input shape : {model_2d_input.input_shape}")

```

In this more complex example, I've defined two Keras models. The first expects a flattened input, `(None, 784)`, while the second expects a 2D input `(None, 28, 28)`. Notice the inclusion of `layers.Flatten()` within the second model. That layer is performing the flattening of the data automatically for us, but the input data format should be specified to be 2D instead of a flat vector. The example shows that data can be reshaped on the fly before passing it to the model. This example clearly demonstrates that if the input data is of the incorrect format, it can be reshaped to the correct format. If you input flattened data to a model expecting a 2D matrix, and it is not reshaped, you will observe a shape mismatch error.

Key takeaway: reshaping data correctly is critical. Whether you are using numpy or within a model pipeline it is essential to perform the correct operation. Incorrect reshaping will lead to poor model performance or shape mismatch errors.

For further reading, I highly recommend diving into the following resources:

1. **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville**: This comprehensive book is a must-have for anyone working in deep learning. It delves deep into the mathematics and intuition behind many concepts and practical techniques in deep learning, including image processing and data representations. Pay close attention to sections discussing multi-dimensional arrays, convolutional neural networks and data pre-processing.
2. **The Numpy Documentation**: Specifically, the section on array manipulation. Numpy is a cornerstone library in data science, so having a firm understanding of its array operations is essential. Focus on the `reshape` and `flatten` functionalities.
3. **The TensorFlow and PyTorch documentation**: These libraries offer various functionalities for working with tensors and models. Exploring the sections relating to data loading, data transformation and preprocessing is important to gaining a better understanding of how models receive data. In tensorflow the `tf.reshape` operation, and in Pytorch, the `torch.reshape` and `torch.view` function. Both are important for reshaping tensors.

Understanding shape and dimensionality is a vital skill for deep learning practitioners. It is a common cause of errors, as we have seen here, but with careful consideration of how data is structured it is possible to effectively avoid and debug problems. Remember, debugging shape issues isn't about guessing, it’s about meticulously tracing the data and understanding how the model, data loaders, and data pre-processing steps are all working together. When you come across this, try working methodically, visualizing your data shapes as you go, and don’t hesitate to refer back to the fundamental data transformation documentation. These techniques and an understanding of your data will lead you to a solution and better results.
