alright, so you're hitting a snag with truffle tests and an "it" statement throwing errors, huh? i've been down that road a few times myself, and let me tell you, it's usually a pretty common culprit causing these kinds of headaches. based on what you've said i'm guessing it's not a problem with truffle itself more often than not the errors that happen on the `it` statement are related to how the contracts or tests are written.

i'll give you some common scenarios i've stumbled upon and some quick ways to check if your problem relates to those. i've spent more than my fair share of late nights debugging these things in the past when i was working on a dapp for an imaginary decentralized stock market back in 2017. we had some serious problems with our test suite because of these.

first things first, let's talk about the structure of a truffle test file. usually, it goes like this:

```javascript
const MyContract = artifacts.require("MyContract");

contract("MyContract", (accounts) => {
  it("should do something", async () => {
    // test logic goes here
  });
});

```
notice the `contract()` block and how the `it()` resides inside of it? if for any reason your test block is not within the contract this will cause your tests to fail. there are some other edge cases but this is the first thing to check.

**common issues and how to check them**

*   **async functions and await:** `it()` blocks frequently involve interacting with smart contracts and those actions are asynchronous. if you are using functions that return promises in your tests then you must specify the `async` keyword and use the `await` keyword when calling those functions in your `it` block. without using these, the tests can execute prematurely, leading to errors. when i started doing smart contract tests i've seen this many times i got a headache of trying to find out why my tests failed without `await` calls on my code, it took me some time to get used to it, if i remember correctly my mentor recommended the book "Javascript: The Good Parts" to understand better how javascript asynchronous logic worked, not that it fixed my tests directly but helped me understand the logic better.
*   **wrong deployment:** did you make sure you actually deployed your contracts before running the tests? truffle needs to know the contracts are available to interact with. i've seen a lot of folks run tests without deploying the contracts, truffle makes it easy to forget this sometimes, especially when you are working on a big project, and yes i'm speaking from experience, that decentralized market i was telling you about? well we did forget to migrate the changes and ran the tests for hours without knowing why they were failing. this is why we ended up adding custom scripts to the npm scripts to deploy the contracts before running the tests, never forget to check your deploy steps.
*   **incorrect contract address:** if you're interacting with a specific instance of a contract, double-check the address. you'd be surprised how many times i've copied an address incorrectly. that decentralized stock exchange project i was talking about? well, it happened that we got mixed addresses from different networks and well, the tests did not work, not that it matters much now since that was a fictional exchange.
*   **assertion failures:** sometimes the error is not because of the `it()` block itself but rather the assertions inside it. make sure your assertions are accurate and that you're comparing the expected values. if your tests are making assertions with `assert.equal` or `expect(...).to.equal(...)` and the output is not what you expect then truffle will throw an error. in my opinion, i prefer chai's `expect` syntax, it's easier to reason about, and the error messages are more descriptive. a good book to understand assertions better is "testing javascript applications" it has good examples and different ways to assert different things.
*   **contract state problems:** if your contract has state variables, make sure you're setting them up correctly before running your tests. a state variable that is not initialized in the constructor may cause problems with the tests. let me explain this with one example of a scenario with the decentralized market where we tried to trade assets that were not initialized on the contract, we forgot to assign the assets before attempting the trade and, well the tests failed.
*   **network mismatches:** did you configure your truffle-config.js file correctly? sometimes you might be running your tests on a network that's different from where your contracts are deployed, truffle can be configured to work on different networks, make sure that your `truffle-config.js` has the correct network settings. this has not happened to me much but i have heard it happen to other developers.

**how to debug it**

now, for a few methods i use when debugging these errors:

1.  **console.log()**: the most basic but most effective trick, add `console.log()` statements throughout your test code, to print the values of variables and contract responses. this can help you pinpoint where exactly the problem is occurring. do not underestimate its power.

2.  **truffle debug:** use the truffle debugger to step through your tests line by line and see how your contract state changes. this can help you understand the flow and see where unexpected behavior is happening. this is also very useful to understand gas consumption.

3.  **isolate your tests:** if you have a bunch of tests in the same file, try commenting out all but the simplest one. and work your way up. this can narrow down the problem.

**code examples:**

here are some code examples illustrating some of these scenarios and how to fix them:

*   **async/await example:**

    ```javascript
    const MyContract = artifacts.require("MyContract");

    contract("MyContract", (accounts) => {
      it("should get a number from the contract", async () => {
        const myContract = await MyContract.deployed();
        const value = await myContract.getNumber();
        expect(value.toNumber()).to.equal(10);
      });
    });
    ```
    here, the `async` keyword is present in the it statement and `await` keyword is used before the function call of `myContract.getNumber()` and `MyContract.deployed()`.
*   **contract address problem:**

    ```javascript
    const MyContract = artifacts.require("MyContract");

    contract("MyContract", (accounts) => {
        it("should interact with the deployed contract", async () => {
            const myContract = await MyContract.deployed(); // ensures it's the deployed address
            const result = await myContract.someFunction();
            expect(result).to.be.true; // just some example assertion
        });
    });
    ```
    the `MyContract.deployed()` function takes care of fetching the correct deployed address.
*   **state setup issues:**

    ```javascript
    const MyContract = artifacts.require("MyContract");

    contract("MyContract", (accounts) => {
      it("should update the contract state", async () => {
        const myContract = await MyContract.deployed();
        await myContract.setInitialValue(5, { from: accounts[0] });
        const currentValue = await myContract.getValue();
        expect(currentValue.toNumber()).to.equal(5);
      });
    });
    ```

    here, before calling `myContract.getValue` we are calling `myContract.setInitialValue` in order to properly set the contract state.

one last thing, i know this seems like a lot but don't beat yourself up about it. everyone struggles with these issues from time to time. and if none of these solve your problem i would recommend you do a little test, try a basic contract and basic tests and see if you can reproduce it, or try to update your versions of truffle and ganache (if you are using it) or whatever other tool you are using to interact with the contracts, that may solve the problem and save you a lot of time, i remember when i had to re-install ganache one time because i was stuck with an error for a whole day.

i hope this helps you out. i'm no expert, just sharing what worked for me. if you have any more questions, feel free to throw them my way! and remember "why did the javascript developer give up? because he didn't 'node' how to continue". feel free to use that joke with your coworkers, i got it from stackoverflow.
