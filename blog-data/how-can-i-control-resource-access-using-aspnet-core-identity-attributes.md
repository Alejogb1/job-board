Alright, let's tackle this. I've spent my fair share of time knee-deep in ASP.NET Core Identity, and attribute-based authorization is a feature I've leaned on quite heavily for controlling resource access. The beauty of this approach lies in its declarativeness; you specify *what* kind of access is required directly on your controllers and actions, making your intent clear and keeping things maintainable. It's a vast improvement over, say, relying solely on procedural checks buried within methods.

To begin, understand that attribute-based authorization in ASP.NET Core is built upon the concept of *policies*. These policies act as named bundles of authorization requirements, which might include roles, claims, or custom requirements. Then, these policies are applied using the `[Authorize]` attribute.

When I first started with this, many years ago, I was working on a large e-commerce platform with quite complex permission needs. We had customers, vendors, administrators, and even specific roles for customer service. Relying on simple role-based authorization quickly became cumbersome. We needed more granularity. That's where crafting specific authorization policies became vital.

Let’s break down how you actually implement this, starting with a simple role-based policy and progressing to more intricate ones.

**Example 1: Simple Role-Based Authorization**

In this first snippet, we're configuring the simplest kind of policy: one based on roles. Suppose we want to restrict access to an administrator's panel. Here’s how we’d set it up:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace MyWebApp.Controllers
{
    [Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]
    public class AdminController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            // Admin-specific logic here
            return View();
        }

         [Authorize(Roles = "Manager,Administrator")]
        public IActionResult UserManagement() {
            return View();
        }
    }

    public class CustomerController : Controller
    {
       [Authorize(Roles="Customer")]
       public IActionResult MyOrders()
       {
           return View();
       }
    }
}
```

In this code, `[Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]` ensures that only users with the "Administrator" role can access the `AdminController`'s `Index` action. The  `[Authorize(Roles = "Manager,Administrator")]` ensures that only users with the "Manager" or "Administrator" role can access the `UserManagement` action. Similarly, the customer controller allows only "Customer" role access to the `MyOrders` view. This is a very direct application of `Authorize` with built-in role functionality. ASP.NET Core handles the user's authentication and role retrieval behind the scenes.

**Example 2: Policy-Based Authorization with Claims**

Moving to a more real-world scenario, imagine you need to grant access based not just on roles, but on specific claims associated with the user. For example, you might have a claim called "SubscriptionLevel" with values like "Basic," "Premium," or "Enterprise." Here's how you'd define a policy based on a claim, and then how you'd apply it:

First, in your `Startup.cs` (or `Program.cs` in .NET 6 and above), you'd define the authorization policy:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;


public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
       services.AddControllersWithViews();
       services.AddAuthorization(options =>
        {
            options.AddPolicy("PremiumSubscription", policy =>
                policy.RequireClaim("SubscriptionLevel", "Premium", "Enterprise"));
                
            options.AddPolicy("EnterpriseSubscription", policy=>
               policy.RequireClaim("SubscriptionLevel", "Enterprise"));
        });
        
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
            app.UseHsts();
        }
            
        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
        app.UseStaticFiles();
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseAuthentication(); // Ensure authentication is enabled
        app.UseAuthorization();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
           endpoints.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
        });
    }
}

```

Here, we've configured two policies: "PremiumSubscription," which requires the claim “SubscriptionLevel” to be either “Premium” or “Enterprise”, and "EnterpriseSubscription," which requires the claim to specifically be "Enterprise." The `Startup` class configures the authorization policies, which are now available for use by the authorization system.

Now, in a controller:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace MyWebApp.Controllers
{
    public class SubscriptionFeaturesController : Controller
    {
        [Authorize(Policy = "PremiumSubscription")]
        public IActionResult PremiumFeature()
        {
            return View(); // Access granted only for "Premium" or "Enterprise" subscribers.
        }

         [Authorize(Policy = "EnterpriseSubscription")]
        public IActionResult EnterpriseFeature()
        {
            return View(); // Access granted only for "Enterprise" subscribers.
        }

        public IActionResult FreeFeature()
        {
            return View(); // Access granted for all authenticated users
        }
    }
}
```
The key here is `[Authorize(Policy = "PremiumSubscription")]`. This applies the policy we just defined, meaning that only users with the correct claim values can access the `PremiumFeature` action. The `EnterpriseFeature` action is protected using the policy `EnterpriseSubscription`, therefore, only user with 'Enterprise' subscription level will have access.

This approach is far more flexible than roles alone; you can build authorization logic based on all sorts of custom user properties and then encapsulate it neatly within policies. It provides clarity and makes maintaining authorization checks significantly easier as your application grows.

**Example 3: Custom Authorization Handlers**

For the most intricate scenarios, you'll need to write custom authorization handlers. Let's consider a situation where resource access depends on user permissions stored in a database. This requires custom logic beyond claims or roles.

First, you'll need a *requirement* class:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;

public class ResourcePermissionRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement
{
    public string ResourceName { get; }
    public string RequiredPermission { get; }

    public ResourcePermissionRequirement(string resourceName, string requiredPermission)
    {
        ResourceName = resourceName;
        RequiredPermission = requiredPermission;
    }
}
```
This `ResourcePermissionRequirement` holds the resource and permission needed.

Next, you implement a *handler* that performs the actual access check:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using MyWebApp.Data; // Example data access

public class ResourcePermissionHandler : AuthorizationHandler<ResourcePermissionRequirement>
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepository; // A hypothetical repository for retrieving user data

    public ResourcePermissionHandler(IUserRepository userRepository)
    {
        _userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    protected override async Task HandleRequirementAsync(AuthorizationHandlerContext context, ResourcePermissionRequirement requirement)
    {
        if (!context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return;
        }

        // Fetch the user's permissions from the database (example logic)
        var userId = context.User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value;
        if(userId==null)
            return;


        var user = await _userRepository.GetUserPermissionsAsync(userId);

        if (user != null && user.HasPermission(requirement.ResourceName, requirement.RequiredPermission))
        {
            context.Succeed(requirement);
        }
    }
}

```

This custom handler fetches the user's permissions from a hypothetical repository, `IUserRepository`, and then compares the required permission to those the user has.

Finally, you need to register the handler and set the policy:
```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;


public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
       services.AddControllersWithViews();
       services.AddScoped<IUserRepository, UserRespository>(); // Add your user repository
       services.AddSingleton<IAuthorizationHandler, ResourcePermissionHandler>(); // Register the handler
       services.AddAuthorization(options =>
        {
            options.AddPolicy("EditArticle", policy =>
                policy.Requirements.Add(new ResourcePermissionRequirement("Article", "Edit")));
        });
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
            app.UseHsts();
        }
            
        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
        app.UseStaticFiles();
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseAuthentication(); // Ensure authentication is enabled
        app.UseAuthorization();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
           endpoints.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
        });
    }
}

```

And then, in your controller:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace MyWebApp.Controllers
{
    public class ArticleController : Controller
    {
        [Authorize(Policy = "EditArticle")]
        public IActionResult Edit(int id)
        {
            // Logic for editing the article with the given id if the user has 'Edit' permission on 'Article'
            return View();
        }
    }
}

```
This advanced approach makes authorization extremely flexible and specific to your application’s needs.

**Further Learning**

If you're serious about digging deeper into authorization, I'd recommend reviewing “Programming Microsoft ASP.NET MVC” by Dino Esposito; it’s an older title, but it provides deep understanding and reasoning regarding core concepts. The official Microsoft documentation on ASP.NET Core Security is also incredibly thorough and should be your go-to resource. For more in-depth knowledge on claims, the OpenID Connect specifications, which are freely available online, are a great read. Additionally, consider books dedicated to OAuth 2.0 as those concepts directly affect token authorization in API-driven scenarios.

Attribute-based authorization using policies is definitely the way to go for most applications. It gives you a clean, maintainable, and extensible approach to resource protection. Remember that this is a fundamental aspect of any application, and taking the time to implement it correctly will save you significant headaches down the line.
