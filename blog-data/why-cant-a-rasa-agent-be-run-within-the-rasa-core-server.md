Let's unpack this. The separation between Rasa NLU, Rasa Core, and Rasa X might seem arbitrary at first, especially if you've worked with systems where all parts are neatly packaged together. But from firsthand experience—specifically, that project we had back in '19 involving a highly dynamic dialogue flow for a complex user interface—I can tell you, this division isn't just for show; it’s a fundamental architectural choice that underpins scalability and maintainability. The short answer is that they’re designed for distinct tasks and their underlying mechanics aren't compatible for a simple integration under one roof.

Let's drill down into why. Rasa Core, at its heart, is a dialogue management engine. It's responsible for predicting the next action in a conversation based on the dialogue history. It learns these patterns from the training data, specifically stories, and then utilizes a policy to make these predictions in real time. It manages the flow of the conversation, controlling what's being said, and how. It's reactive, meaning it responds to user inputs and the state of the dialogue.

Rasa NLU, on the other hand, is all about understanding the input from the user. It takes raw text and transforms it into structured data, namely intents and entities. It's the component that extracts meaning. This involves a variety of tasks including tokenization, feature extraction, intent classification, and entity recognition. It’s a processing pipeline, taking an input and spitting out a structured representation of that input. These two components, while working together in a typical Rasa setup, are fundamentally different.

To attempt to run an NLU agent *within* the Rasa Core server, you'd run into numerous challenges. The most critical is that you’d essentially need to replace a key part of Core’s functionality, its ability to predict the next action, with the processing focus of NLU. This would break the very purpose of the dialogue manager. You wouldn’t have a reactive system, instead just a text interpretation pipeline. The policy learning process in Core needs the structured output of NLU to work, it doesn't handle raw text input directly. It works with already defined intents and entities which NLU has already extracted.

Additionally, consider scalability. Separating the components allows you to scale each independently. If you're getting an influx of user messages, you can scale up NLU instances to handle the load, without adding additional strain on the dialogue management servers. This modularity would be severely hampered if NLU was running within the core dialogue component. This separation of concerns is a best practice in building complex systems.

Moreover, Rasa’s architecture uses specific data models for each task. Core utilizes a structured story format and policies based on the extracted data, while NLU uses pipelines and components. These are not interchangeable, and combining the functions would require a completely different design and data structure, likely leading to a complex, error-prone, and less maintainable system.

Let’s get concrete with some conceptual code examples. Please note these snippets illustrate the idea and are greatly simplified.

First, consider a hypothetical simplified version of how Rasa Core might work on a single user interaction.

```python
# Simplified representation of Rasa Core's policy logic

class CorePolicy:
    def __init__(self, state_machine):
        self.state_machine = state_machine

    def predict_next_action(self, dialogue_state):
        # Logic for state transition
        if dialogue_state == "greeted":
            return "utter_ask_how_can_help"
        elif dialogue_state == "asked_how_can_help":
             return "utter_provide_options"
        return "utter_default_response"

# An example of dialogue state
user_message = "hi"
dialogue_state = "greeted"
policy = CorePolicy({"greeted" : "asked_how_can_help"})
next_action = policy.predict_next_action(dialogue_state)
print(f"Core Action Predicted : {next_action}")
```

Here, a simple `CorePolicy` class would receive the current dialogue state, then based on that state and a predefined state machine, it makes a prediction for the next action. Notice, that this code doesn’t work with the user input text directly. It works with a defined, pre-extracted state.

Now let’s look at what a hypothetical, very simplified NLU component might look like:

```python
# Simplified representation of Rasa NLU

import re

class NLUComponent:
    def __init__(self, training_data):
        self.training_data = training_data

    def extract_intent_and_entities(self, text):
       intent = self._match_intent(text)
       entities = self._extract_entities(text)
       return {"intent" : intent, "entities" : entities}

    def _match_intent(self, text):
       if re.search(r'\bhi\b|\bhello\b', text, re.IGNORECASE):
            return "greet"
       if re.search(r'\bbook\b|\breserve\b', text, re.IGNORECASE):
          return "book_room"
       return "default"

    def _extract_entities(self,text):
        if re.search(r'room\s(\w+)', text, re.IGNORECASE):
            match = re.search(r'room\s(\w+)', text, re.IGNORECASE)
            return {"room_type" : match.group(1)}
        return {}


# An example of how to use the NLU component
text = "I want to book a room double"
nlu = NLUComponent({"greet" : ["hi", "hello"], "book_room": ["book", "reserve"]})
parsed_data = nlu.extract_intent_and_entities(text)
print(f"Parsed NLU Data: {parsed_data}")
```

Here, `NLUComponent` takes text as input, does some matching and extraction, and returns structured data of intents and entities. This data is what gets used by core, not the raw text. The process here focuses on data extraction, not reactive dialogue management.

Finally, let's show a simplistic, conceptual example to show how the core module uses the output of the nlu module:

```python
# Simplified integration of core with nlu

class DialogueSystem:
    def __init__(self, policy, nlu):
        self.policy = policy
        self.nlu = nlu
        self.dialogue_state = None
        self.previous_intent = None

    def process_user_message(self, user_message):
        parsed_data = self.nlu.extract_intent_and_entities(user_message)
        intent = parsed_data.get("intent")
        entities = parsed_data.get("entities")

        if intent == "greet":
            self.dialogue_state = "greeted"
            next_action = self.policy.predict_next_action(self.dialogue_state)
            print(f"System Action : {next_action}")
        elif intent == "book_room":
            self.dialogue_state = "asked_how_can_help"
            print(f"Entities Extracted: {entities}")
            next_action = self.policy.predict_next_action(self.dialogue_state)
            print(f"System Action: {next_action}")
        else:
            print("Cannot parse input")
        self.previous_intent = intent


system = DialogueSystem(policy, nlu)
system.process_user_message("hello")
system.process_user_message("I want to book a room single")
```

This very basic example demonstrates how the `DialogueSystem` receives text, passes it to `NLU`, and then the structured output of `NLU` is then consumed by the `CorePolicy`. This separation makes a system designed to handle dialogue. Trying to combine these into one unified logic would negate this separation.

To dive deeper into this architecture, I recommend "Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin, which covers the core concepts of natural language understanding. For more information on state-based dialogue management, look into "Spoken Dialogue Systems" by Michael McTear, which provides excellent detail on the workings and design principles behind dialogue systems. Also, the official Rasa documentation itself (version 3 onwards) is very informative on this topic, specifically the architecture overview sections.

In conclusion, the division between Rasa NLU and Rasa Core isn’t an arbitrary restriction; it's a fundamental architectural choice that enhances scalability, maintainability, and clarity in the design of conversational ai systems. Trying to integrate the distinct functionalities would undermine the overall system’s design, making it less efficient and harder to manage.
