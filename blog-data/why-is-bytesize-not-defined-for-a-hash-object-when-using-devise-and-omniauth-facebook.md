Okay, let's unpack this. I've definitely run into this peculiar `bytesize` issue myself, specifically when combining Devise, OmniAuth, and particularly Facebook authentication. It's one of those problems that initially makes you scratch your head, but the root cause, once understood, stems from the subtle ways these libraries handle data. Essentially, the problem boils down to a mix of how Ruby handles strings, how `OmniAuth` parses authentication responses, and how `Devise` interacts with user attributes.

The core issue is not that a `Hash` inherently lacks a `bytesize` method (it doesn’t), but that you are attempting to invoke `bytesize` on a Hash object, often unintentionally, during the authentication process. This typically happens when the authentication data, especially that coming from OmniAuth providers like Facebook, is not properly sanitized or transformed into a string format before Devise attempts to use it, specifically when dealing with attributes during model creation or updates.

Let's consider a scenario. Imagine you've set up Devise with OmniAuth for Facebook authentication. After a successful user login via Facebook, OmniAuth hands off a hash of information to your application. This hash can include details about the user's profile, such as their email, name, profile picture url, and potentially other attributes depending on the permissions requested. When Devise processes this information, it often attempts to persist some of these attributes into your user model's database columns.

Now, the problem arises because some of this data, especially data associated with Facebook user fields like the 'raw_info' section in the `omniauth.auth` hash, may not be strings as expected by Devise. These might be nested hashes or even arrays. Devise, at some point in its attribute assignment or validation process, might indirectly call `bytesize` on an object it assumes to be a string, but which turns out to be that complex `Hash`. Hence, the `NoMethodError: undefined method `bytesize' for Hash` is raised.

So, how do we actually handle this issue? Well, it's a multi-faceted approach, but the key is to selectively extract and transform the relevant information into strings. This involves inspecting the `omniauth.auth` hash and extracting only the string data needed, or coercing the data into strings before passing it to the devise user creation process.

Let's illustrate this with some code examples.

**Example 1: Targeted extraction and coercion**

The most direct solution is to extract the necessary attributes from the `auth` hash in our `User` model (or wherever you handle your omniauth callbacks) and carefully convert them to strings. I’ve seen this approach be effective in many scenarios. Consider this code snippet within a model that has a method like `from_omniauth`:

```ruby
def self.from_omniauth(auth)
  where(provider: auth.provider, uid: auth.uid).first_or_create do |user|
    user.email = auth.info.email
    user.password = Devise.friendly_token[0,20]  # Generate a random password
    user.name = auth.info.name.to_s if auth.info.name
    user.image_url = auth.info.image.to_s if auth.info.image
     # Handle raw info data more carefully, converting keys and values to strings
    if auth.extra.raw_info
      # Example of iterating through keys and values for string conversion
      auth.extra.raw_info.each do |key, value|
          # Directly access each key to stringify it before creating attribute or avoid if non-string type.
          # Ensure attributes exist in the model and are set safely. This is an example and should be adapted for each particular case
          user.send("#{key}=", value.to_s) if user.respond_to?("#{key}=") && value
      end
    end
  end
end
```
Here, we are explicitly converting attributes like `auth.info.name` and `auth.info.image` to strings using `.to_s`. Crucially, within the conditional `auth.extra.raw_info`, we iterate and perform string coercion, ensuring nested data or any other unexpected object becomes a string when it is passed to the user object. The `send` method helps us to set the attributes, but we use `respond_to?` to ensure that we don't throw errors on non-existent attributes.

**Example 2: Sanitizing OmniAuth data using helper methods**

To prevent code duplication and enhance readability, you can move the sanitization logic into helper methods. This way, you can apply the same cleaning process across multiple callbacks.

```ruby
def self.from_omniauth(auth)
  where(provider: auth.provider, uid: auth.uid).first_or_create do |user|
    user.email = safe_string(auth.info.email)
    user.password = Devise.friendly_token[0,20]
    user.name = safe_string(auth.info.name)
    user.image_url = safe_string(auth.info.image)
    sanitize_raw_info(user,auth.extra.raw_info)
  end
end

private

  def self.safe_string(str)
    str.to_s if str
  end

  def self.sanitize_raw_info(user, raw_info)
    return unless raw_info
    raw_info.each do |key, value|
      user.send("#{key}=", safe_string(value)) if user.respond_to?("#{key}=")
    end
  end
```
Here, `safe_string` is a private helper method that checks if a value exists and if it does, converts it to a string. The `sanitize_raw_info` method is a dedicated function to deal with nested hash elements, which keeps the `from_omniauth` method more readable. This approach improves code maintainability.

**Example 3: Using a dedicated `OmniAuth` initializer**

In some complex scenarios, it's preferable to have an `OmniAuth` initializer specifically for attribute extraction and sanitization. While the logic remains similar to above, structuring it in an initializer provides a dedicated space for attribute management. This keeps the user model cleaner and allows the logic to be more easily reused and managed.

In `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
OmniAuth.config.on_failure = Proc.new do |env|
  # Handle failure logic
  # Could log or redirect to a custom error page
end
OmniAuth.config.before_callback_phase do |env|
  request = Rack::Request.new(env)
  auth = env['omniauth.auth']
  if auth
    # Process raw info
      raw_info = auth.extra.raw_info
    if raw_info.is_a?(Hash)
      raw_info.each do |k, v|
        if v.is_a?(Hash)
          raw_info[k] = v.to_s
        elsif v.is_a?(Array)
          raw_info[k] = v.map(&:to_s)
        else
            raw_info[k] = v.to_s
        end
      end
      end

     #Process info
     info = auth.info
    if info.is_a?(Hash)
        info.each do |k,v|
          if !v.is_a?(String)
              auth.info[k] = v.to_s
          end
        end
    end
  end
  env['omniauth.auth'] = auth

end
```

In this setup, we intercept the `omniauth.auth` hash before it reaches our application code. We check each value and, if it's not a string, convert it to a string. After this initialization, the application can assume that the auth hash data mostly contains strings, reducing the chance of the bytesize errors we talked about.

To further understand this issue and improve your knowledge of authentication systems, I recommend looking into *“The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework”* (RFC 6749), and *“Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide”* by Dave Thomas for a deeper look at Ruby’s string handling characteristics. Reading the Devise and OmniAuth documentation thoroughly also proves invaluable. These resources cover the fundamentals and specific implementation details that often lead to this kind of problem.

In conclusion, the `bytesize` error with Hash objects during Devise and OmniAuth authentication is typically a result of unexpected data types in the authentication hash, mainly non-string values being processed as strings by Devise. This problem is not inherent to Hash but rather a consequence of inconsistent data handling. The solution involves careful inspection, extraction, and explicit string coercion within your authentication callback logic. This approach, combined with robust error handling and thoughtful data sanitization, will solve your problem, and hopefully prevent it from happening again. Remember, dealing with external authentication providers often requires meticulous data processing, and being explicit about types is paramount.
