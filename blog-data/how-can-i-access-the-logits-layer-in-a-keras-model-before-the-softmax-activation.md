Alright,  I remember a project back in '18, we were working on a custom object detection system and needed to fine-tune some intermediate layers. Getting pre-softmax activations—the logits—was absolutely crucial for our loss functions. So, yeah, I've been down this road. It’s a fairly common need when you’re manipulating model internals, not just using them as black boxes. Accessing logits in a Keras model, before that final softmax squashing, isn’t something Keras directly exposes as a simple attribute. You need a bit of surgical precision.

The core problem stems from the way Keras constructs models. Layers are chained, and each one typically outputs its transformed tensor, which is then immediately fed to the next layer. The softmax activation, usually bundled into the final dense layer, is part of this process. To capture the pre-softmax output, we effectively need to ‘tap’ into the model’s computational graph before that final activation. We do this using techniques that manipulate the model’s functional API or create a custom model that duplicates the layers up to the desired output.

The approach you take depends significantly on whether you built your model using the sequential API or the functional API. With sequential models, you’re somewhat constrained as they are designed for a linear stack of layers. Functional models are much more flexible, letting us define precisely what output we want. However, the basic principles remain the same; we're creating a new model that outputs the activations we want, reusing the weights from the original model.

Let's illustrate with some code examples. Imagine we have a very basic Keras model constructed sequentially:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Example Sequential model
model_seq = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Here is the softmax layer
])

model_seq.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Now, to extract the logits—the output from the second dense layer *before* the softmax activation in our third dense layer—we'd need to make a new model that copies all layers up to, but not including, the softmax layer:

```python
# Extracting logits from Sequential Model
output_layer = model_seq.layers[-2] # Second last layer
logits_model_seq = keras.Model(inputs=model_seq.input, outputs=output_layer.output)

# Example usage with random input
import numpy as np
random_input = np.random.rand(1,10) # sample batch
logits_seq_output = logits_model_seq.predict(random_input)
print("Shape of logits from Sequential Model:", logits_seq_output.shape)
```

Here, we created a new model `logits_model_seq` whose output is the output tensor of the *second last* layer, before the softmax function is applied. We effectively "snipped" the model. The key thing to recognize is that we are not modifying the original model. This approach works well, although slightly more verbose, and is necessary for sequential models.

Now, if we have a functional model, things get a tad cleaner. Consider this functional model:

```python
# Example Functional model
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
hidden1 = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_layer)
hidden2 = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(hidden1)
output_layer_functional = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(hidden2)

model_func = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer_functional)

model_func.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

```

To extract logits from *this* functional model, you follow a similar pattern but can directly choose which output you want.

```python
# Extracting logits from Functional Model
logits_model_func = keras.Model(inputs=model_func.input, outputs=hidden2) # Direct output of 'hidden2'

# Example usage with random input
random_input = np.random.rand(1,10) # sample batch
logits_func_output = logits_model_func.predict(random_input)
print("Shape of logits from Functional Model:", logits_func_output.shape)
```

In this case, `hidden2` is the tensor just before our desired output layer, and we directly create a new model that has that as its output. This is one of the primary reasons the functional API is so flexible for custom manipulations. I remember using this approach extensively while debugging segmentation models.

As a third illustration, let’s look at extracting logits from a model, but this time we'll assume we have a more complicated custom model, constructed using the functional API:

```python
# Example Functional model with a custom block
def custom_block(input_tensor, filters):
    x = layers.Conv1D(filters, 3, padding='same', activation='relu')(input_tensor)
    x = layers.MaxPool1D(2, padding='same')(x)
    return x

input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(20,1))
x = custom_block(input_tensor, 32)
x = custom_block(x, 64)
x = layers.Flatten()(x)
logits_before_softmax = layers.Dense(10)(x)  # no activation yet
output_softmax = layers.Softmax()(logits_before_softmax)

model_custom = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_softmax)
model_custom.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Now, extract those logits:

```python
# Extracting logits from a Functional Model
logits_model_custom = keras.Model(inputs=model_custom.input, outputs=logits_before_softmax)

# Example usage with random input
random_input = np.random.rand(1,20,1)
logits_custom_output = logits_model_custom.predict(random_input)
print("Shape of logits from a Custom Model:", logits_custom_output.shape)
```

Notice here, we have explicitly named the intermediate layer we're after, `logits_before_softmax`. This makes it very clear, even in more complex models, what we are doing.

A critical point to consider is that when creating these new ‘logits’ models, they share the *same* weights as your original model. You are simply creating a way to access specific outputs. This avoids the need to copy weights or manually replicate model parts, thereby conserving memory and computation.

Now, if you’re looking for a deeper dive into the mechanics of Keras and TensorFlow’s computational graphs, the TensorFlow documentation itself is a treasure trove, but specifically, I recommend delving into books that detail the functional API in detail. Additionally, research papers on *gradient-based explanation methods* often showcase these approaches of capturing intermediate outputs. For instance, anything touching on techniques like *Grad-CAM* or *SmoothGrad* will indirectly demonstrate accessing pre-activation layers.

In summary, accessing the logits layer before the softmax in Keras is accomplished by creating a new model whose output is the tensor you desire. This new model shares weights with your original model, but simply provides a different output. The approach you use depends on if you are using the sequential or functional API, but understanding the Keras model object allows for straightforward extraction of any intermediate outputs. This is more of an approach rather than a feature, but is central to doing any advanced operations with deep learning models.
