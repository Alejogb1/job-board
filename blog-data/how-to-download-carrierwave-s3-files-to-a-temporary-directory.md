Alright, let's tackle this. I've seen this scenario pop up quite a few times, usually when dealing with background jobs that need local access to files stored in s3, managed by carrierwave. The challenge, of course, is to download these remote files to a temporary location, use them, and then clean up effectively. It's less about ‘magic’ and more about carefully orchestrating file retrieval and management.

The typical approach, which I've refined across multiple projects over the years, involves several key steps: first, retrieving the remote file url, then using Ruby's standard libraries for downloading and file operations, and lastly, ensuring proper cleanup. It's a matter of precision. Let's unpack this in detail, starting with the core process.

First, obtaining the remote file's url is straightforward, assuming you've configured carrierwave correctly with s3. You'll likely have an instance of your uploader class associated with your model. You can access the s3 url through the uploader.url method. This is your point of entry. I’ve found the need to explicitly check that the url is not blank before proceeding invaluable. This saves you from debugging downstream issues caused by empty file urls.

Now, downloading the file itself requires a bit more interaction. We'll use `net/http` from the Ruby standard library, along with `tempfile` for managing temporary files. The crux of it is making an http request, writing the response body to a temp file, and handling potential errors along the way. The temp file class is crucial here because it handles the creation of a unique file path and ensures the temporary file is deleted when it’s no longer needed. This avoids the pitfalls of orphaned temporary files lying around.

I've found that the implementation can get a bit repetitive if you need to do this download across multiple projects. That’s why I often refactor this into a helper method, a kind of download utility, that can take a remote url and return the path of the local downloaded file.

Here's the first example, focusing on a basic download function. This assumes you have a valid `file_url` that points to an s3 object:

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'
require 'tempfile'

def download_file_to_temp(file_url)
  return nil if file_url.blank?

  uri = URI(file_url)
  begin
    Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, use_ssl: uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
      request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri)
      response = http.request(request)

      response.value # This raises an error if the request wasn't successful
      Tempfile.create do |temp_file|
        temp_file.binmode
        temp_file.write(response.body)
        temp_file.path
      end

    end
  rescue Net::HTTPError => e
     puts "Error downloading file: #{e.message}"
     nil # return nil if there was an error during the download
  rescue StandardError => e
    puts "Unexpected error during download: #{e.message}"
    nil
  end
end

# Example usage (assuming you have a valid carrierwave uploader and model):
# file_url = my_model.my_uploader.url
# temp_file_path = download_file_to_temp(file_url)
# if temp_file_path
#   puts "File downloaded to: #{temp_file_path}"
#  # Do something with the file
# else
#   puts "Failed to download file"
# end
```

Notice that the code uses `response.value` to explicitly raise errors if the HTTP request fails. Catching these errors early is critical, it’s a habit I’ve developed that has saved me hours of debugging. This example handles the basic download and returns the path. But in real applications, especially those with more stringent demands, you need more sophistication. We may need to handle large files. Downloading the entire file into memory may cause issues. This leads us to the second example which uses chunked downloads:

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'
require 'tempfile'

def download_file_to_temp_chunked(file_url)
  return nil if file_url.blank?

  uri = URI(file_url)
  begin
    Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, use_ssl: uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
      request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri)
      response = http.request(request)
      response.value

      Tempfile.create do |temp_file|
        temp_file.binmode
        response.read_body do |chunk|
           temp_file.write(chunk)
        end
        temp_file.path
      end

    end
  rescue Net::HTTPError => e
    puts "Error downloading file: #{e.message}"
    nil
   rescue StandardError => e
    puts "Unexpected error during download: #{e.message}"
    nil
  end
end

# Example usage:
# file_url = my_model.my_uploader.url
# temp_file_path = download_file_to_temp_chunked(file_url)
# if temp_file_path
#  puts "File downloaded (chunked) to: #{temp_file_path}"
#  # Do something with the file
# else
#  puts "Failed to download file"
# end

```

The second example employs a chunked approach, which streams the file content directly into the `temp_file`. This prevents excessive memory consumption when downloading larger files, a significant benefit. The `response.read_body` method is the key to streaming and writing directly in chunks. This optimization is important in real-world scenarios dealing with large media files often stored in S3.

However, just downloading the file is usually not the entire story. You might want to validate the file before further processing. This brings us to the third example. Here, I’m showing you how to include a basic file validation example after the download. This validates the size of the downloaded file against an expected file size which is generally available through the Carrierwave uploader's `size` method.

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'
require 'tempfile'

def download_and_validate_file(file_url, expected_size)
  return nil if file_url.blank?

  uri = URI(file_url)
  begin
      Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, use_ssl: uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
        request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri)
        response = http.request(request)
        response.value
        Tempfile.create do |temp_file|
          temp_file.binmode
          response.read_body do |chunk|
            temp_file.write(chunk)
          end
          if temp_file.size != expected_size
              puts "File size validation failed. Expected: #{expected_size}, Actual: #{temp_file.size}"
              temp_file.unlink # Delete the file if validation fails
              return nil
          end
          temp_file.path
        end
    end
  rescue Net::HTTPError => e
    puts "Error downloading file: #{e.message}"
    nil
    rescue StandardError => e
      puts "Unexpected error during download: #{e.message}"
      nil
  end
end

#Example Usage:
#file_url = my_model.my_uploader.url
#expected_size = my_model.my_uploader.size # or calculate based on database metadata
#temp_file_path = download_and_validate_file(file_url, expected_size)
#if temp_file_path
#  puts "File downloaded and validated at: #{temp_file_path}"
#   #Do something with the downloaded file
#else
#  puts "Failed to download or validate the file"
#end
```

This third example demonstrates an important practice – always include some form of integrity check after downloading files, to minimize downstream issues due to corruption. This will help prevent a lot of headaches.

For further reference on http interactions, I recommend the “HTTP: The Definitive Guide” by David Gourley and Brian Totty. It covers the intricacies of the protocol in detail. For a solid understanding of Ruby's file handling, the official Ruby documentation is invaluable. I’d also suggest reading up on more advanced networking topics in “TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1” by W. Richard Stevens for background knowledge, even if it’s more fundamental.

In conclusion, efficiently downloading carrierwave-s3 files to a temporary directory boils down to a few key factors: correctly obtaining the s3 url, handling downloads using Ruby’s built-in libraries, managing file operations through the `tempfile` class, and implementing proper error handling. These details matter significantly, especially in production scenarios where efficiency and reliability are paramount. While this provides a robust starting point, always tailor these solutions to your specific requirements.
