Let’s tackle this head-on. I’ve spent enough time debugging quirky deployment issues across different cloud platforms to have a pretty good feel for what might be going on when a Meteor.js client view fails to update correctly, especially when an Nginx reverse proxy is thrown into the mix on something like AWS Lightsail. It's almost never a single root cause but a confluence of factors. I'm going to focus here on the usual suspects, and we'll see if this helps nail down the issue.

The core problem you're describing, client views not updating, suggests a disconnect between the Meteor server and the client browser. Meteor relies heavily on WebSockets for real-time updates, using DDP (Distributed Data Protocol). This means anything that interferes with the establishment or maintenance of that WebSocket connection can lead to the symptoms you're seeing. Nginx, acting as a reverse proxy, is often the intermediary where things can go awry if not configured properly.

First, the most common mistake, and one I've stumbled upon myself in previous projects, is misconfigured WebSocket proxying in Nginx. By default, Nginx treats HTTP connections differently from WebSockets. When it sees an initial HTTP request, it can often pass that through smoothly to your Meteor server. However, it needs specific directives to correctly manage WebSocket upgrade requests. If this isn't set up, the initial connection might succeed, but the WebSocket part, which Meteor uses for live updates, will fail. In those situations, the server will be doing its part, sending data, but the client will be blissfully ignorant.

The fundamental principle is that you need to pass through headers necessary to upgrade a connection from HTTP to WebSocket. This includes the `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers, and additionally we often need `X-Forwarded-For` to let Meteor know the correct client IP. If these headers are stripped or not correctly passed through, the WebSocket connection will fail or be broken.

Here is a basic, but functional, nginx configuration snippet that illustrates what you need:

```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name your_domain.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # Or your Meteor app's port
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
```

In this example, notice the `proxy_set_header` lines that explicitly pass through the `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers, and then set the `Host` and `X-Forwarded-For` headers as well. It's critically important that `proxy_http_version 1.1` is set, since websockets are dependent on HTTP/1.1. Without it, websocket handshakes often don't work. This is the bare minimum for allowing websockets to function, but in the real world additional options might be required.

Secondly, another frequent oversight is the way Meteor is configured. Meteor's environment variables are often critical to its functionality, especially in a production context. The `ROOT_URL` environment variable should be set to the domain name your application is served from. This is particularly important when using a reverse proxy like Nginx since the client-side code generates URLs to connect to the server based on `ROOT_URL`. If it is incorrect or absent, the WebSocket connection might be directed to the wrong location, or even worse, get blocked because of mismatched security policies.

To ensure this is set correctly on your AWS Lightsail instance, you need to ensure you're setting this variable during startup of the application. For instance, if you use `pm2`, you could include this directly in your `ecosystem.config.js` file.

Here's an example of how this would look:

```javascript
    module.exports = {
      apps : [{
        name   : "your-app-name",
        script : "./bundle/main.js", // Assuming you bundled your app
        env: {
            "ROOT_URL": "https://your_domain.com",
            "PORT": 3000, // Or your preferred port
           "MONGO_URL": "mongodb://...", // Include your mongo connection string
           "NODE_ENV": "production"
        }
      }]
    }
```

In this `ecosystem.config.js` file, we're setting the `ROOT_URL` environment variable to what our domain is, allowing client to correctly connect to websockets. In my experience, failing to do this can result in the client not being able to receive server updates, giving the impression that the application isn't reacting to server changes. If you are starting Meteor with another tool or directly, the appropriate command-line syntax to add these variables would be necessary.

Thirdly, it's worth considering potential firewalls or security groups that could be impeding the WebSocket connection. AWS Lightsail instances, like most cloud platforms, have firewalls enabled by default, and you might need to specifically allow traffic on the port that your Meteor server is listening on (typically 3000, if that’s what you’re using), in addition to port 80 and 443 for standard web traffic. A security group misconfiguration is, in my past experiences, a common but easily overlooked cause of this type of problem. Ensure that both your load balancer or Lightsail instance and underlying server's security groups allow WebSocket connections. If you're using something else, you need to follow its specific configuration mechanisms for opening ports.

You might find that even with the correct Nginx configuration and environment variables, the connection still isn't optimal because of load balancing configurations. To illustrate, here's a slightly more complex nginx configuration that uses a load balancing feature. It helps to demonstrate the importance of managing connections when a backend isn't necessarily a single server.

```nginx
    upstream meteor_backend {
        server localhost:3000; # Example address; ensure your meteor instances are here
        # Add other backend servers here as needed
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name your_domain.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://meteor_backend;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_buffering off; # Crucial for websockets
        }
    }
```

In this case, we're adding `proxy_buffering off;`. This is often critical in scenarios where connection latency between the proxy and the server is high or data must be passed through without buffering. Buffering is a good feature for static assets or HTTP requests, but it interferes with the bi-directional nature of websocket communication. It's quite common to forget this option when setting up load balancing for websocket systems and often this can be the root of weird errors that are difficult to debug.

For further learning on these topics, I highly suggest taking a look at "High Performance Browser Networking" by Ilya Grigorik. It’s a fantastic resource that delves into the complexities of how web protocols work, including WebSockets, and will give you a solid theoretical grounding on how things function. Also, check the official Nginx documentation; they are very detailed on proxy_pass and other related configurations. For Meteor specific configuration, the official Meteor deployment documentation is the best starting point and it is comprehensive. There's no substitution for knowing these core technologies.

In summary, the lack of client view updates with Meteor on AWS Lightsail with Nginx is typically due to improperly configured WebSocket proxying, missing or incorrect environment variables, or firewall restrictions. Checking the Nginx configuration, the meteor environment configuration, and the underlying networking will usually solve the issue. By carefully addressing these points, and with the help of the above code snippets and resources, you should be well-equipped to get your Meteor application working seamlessly on your AWS Lightsail instance.
