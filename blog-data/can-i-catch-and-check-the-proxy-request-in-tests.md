Alright, let's tackle this one. I remember battling a very similar issue back in my days with a large-scale e-commerce platform; dealing with asynchronous communication and verifying network interactions was, shall we say, a challenging experience, particularly when proxies were involved. The question of intercepting and verifying proxy requests in tests isn't just an academic curiosity; it's crucial for robust and reliable systems. Specifically, we want to know if it’s possible to observe, validate, and potentially manipulate outgoing proxy requests during testing. The short answer is yes, absolutely, and there are several effective techniques to do so.

Firstly, let’s define the core problem. When you make a request that transits through a proxy, that proxy acts as an intermediary, and your test environment likely doesn’t directly see the final, modified request going out over the network. To check if it's occurring correctly, we need to intercept it before it leaves the testing environment. This usually involves hooking into the networking layer or using dedicated mocking or proxying libraries. The critical detail to grasp is that the "proxy request," the request *after* the initial request you generate in your test goes through the proxy logic of your application, is the one we need to examine.

Now, how do we achieve this? One very common approach involves using mocking libraries. These libraries allow you to replace the networking components of your system with controlled substitutes. The substitute captures the outgoing request that would have gone to the proxy, and then you can make assertions against it. For example, let’s assume you're using Python with the `requests` library for making HTTP requests and `unittest` for testing. Here’s a basic example using the `requests_mock` library to intercept the requests *before* they reach the actual network proxy:

```python
import unittest
import requests
import requests_mock

class TestProxyRequests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_proxy_request_intercepted(self):
        with requests_mock.Mocker() as m:
            m.post('http://example.com/api', text='resp',
                   request_headers={'Proxy-Authorization': 'Basic someauth'})

            # Your application's code that makes the request, including proxy setup.
            proxies = {'http': 'http://your.proxy:8080',
                       'https': 'https://your.proxy:8080'}
            headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer token123'} # Initial request headers.
            response = requests.post('http://example.com/api',
                                     headers=headers, proxies=proxies)

            # Assertions on the intercepted proxy request.
            self.assertEqual(response.text, 'resp')
            # Assert request headers, including those that should have been added or modified.
            self.assertTrue(m.request_history[0].headers['Proxy-Authorization'] ==
                            'Basic someauth')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this code snippet, `requests_mock.Mocker()` acts as a substitute for the usual networking layer. When your application code attempts to make a request through a proxy, `requests_mock` intercepts it. We can then access the `request_history` to inspect the headers and other details. In our case, we verify that the `Proxy-Authorization` header has been added by the proxy logic, as we mocked it to do in the setup. Note that this only captures requests directed to the mocked endpoint and not the actual proxy.

Another approach involves creating a small, lightweight, in-memory proxy server in your test setup. Your application then points to this local proxy during tests, and you can programmatically inspect and verify the requests arriving at this proxy. This is more flexible than pure mocking because it better mimics the real network flow but requires more setup. It's especially useful when testing applications that employ complex proxy logic. Let's consider an example using Python's `http.server` for a simple proxy and then capturing incoming requests:

```python
import unittest
import requests
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler
import threading
import json
import time

class ProxyRequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_POST(self):
       self.server.captured_request = {
           'path': self.path,
           'headers': dict(self.headers)
       }
       self.send_response(200)
       self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')
       self.end_headers()
       self.wfile.write(json.dumps({'status':'ok'}).encode())

class TestLocalProxy(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
       self.server_address = ('localhost', 8001)
       self.httpd = HTTPServer(self.server_address, ProxyRequestHandler)
       self.httpd.captured_request = None
       self.server_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.httpd.serve_forever)
       self.server_thread.daemon = True
       self.server_thread.start()
       time.sleep(0.1) # Let the server spin up

    def tearDown(self):
        self.httpd.shutdown()
        self.server_thread.join()


    def test_proxy_request_verification(self):
        proxies = {'http': 'http://localhost:8001'}
        headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer token123'}
        requests.post('http://example.com/api', headers=headers, proxies=proxies)

        # Assert the request was captured and verify its content.
        captured = self.httpd.captured_request
        self.assertIsNotNone(captured)
        self.assertEqual(captured['path'], '/api')
        self.assertTrue('Authorization' in captured['headers'])
        self.assertEqual(captured['headers']['Authorization'], 'Bearer token123')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```

This example creates a simple local proxy that captures request headers and paths and stores them. We then assert that our outgoing request went through this proxy as intended and that headers were correctly modified or forwarded. Although rudimentary, it demonstrates how to insert a controlled intermediary.

Finally, if dealing with more complex environments, specialized testing tools that act as HTTP(s) proxies can be invaluable. For example, tools like `mitmproxy`, can act as proxy servers and are capable of intercepting, inspecting, and modifying HTTP(s) traffic flowing through them. You could run your test, route all outgoing traffic through `mitmproxy`, and then programmatically inspect the traffic log using its API or provided interfaces. Here's a conceptualized example assuming the usage of the `mitmproxy` library's scripting capability:

```python
# Python Script for mitmproxy (e.g., mitmproxy_script.py):
from mitmproxy import http

captured_requests = []

def request(flow: http.HTTPFlow) -> None:
    captured_requests.append({
        "url": str(flow.request.url),
        "headers": dict(flow.request.headers)
    })

def get_captured_requests():
    return captured_requests
```

The testing process in Python would look something like this:

```python
import unittest
import requests
import subprocess
import time
import json
import os

class TestMitmProxy(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        script_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "mitmproxy_script.py")
        self.mitmproxy_process = subprocess.Popen(['mitmproxy', '--script', script_path, '-p', '8002'],
                                                 stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        time.sleep(1)  # Ensure mitmproxy server is up.

    def tearDown(self):
        self.mitmproxy_process.terminate()
        self.mitmproxy_process.wait()

    def test_mitmproxy_request(self):
        proxies = {'http': 'http://localhost:8002', 'https': 'http://localhost:8002'}
        headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer token123'}
        requests.post('http://example.com/api', headers=headers, proxies=proxies)
        time.sleep(0.5) # Time to capture the request.

        # Retrieve the captured requests using a file-based approach,
        # the actual retrieval may differ depending on your mitmproxy setup
        # This part here is conceptual as there is no easy native API to retrieve stored mitmproxy request.
        # I recommend utilizing mitmproxy events logging to a file and reading that during testing.

        captured_requests = [] # In real situation, read this data from log files that can be configured with mitmproxy
        self.assertTrue(any(req['url'] == 'http://example.com/api' and
                            'Authorization' in req['headers'] and
                            req['headers']['Authorization'] == 'Bearer token123'
                            for req in captured_requests))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```

This approach is quite powerful but more complex to setup and interpret than mocking. The mitmproxy example demonstrates how an external proxy server can be used to intercept and verify requests.

In summary, yes, you can absolutely catch and check proxy requests in tests. Your methods involve: mocking libraries for simplified tests, in-memory custom proxy servers for more realistic network simulations, and specialized proxy tools like `mitmproxy` for in-depth analysis and complex scenarios. The choice depends on the complexity of your proxy implementation and the rigor you require in your testing.

For further exploration into these topics, I'd highly recommend investigating: the documentation of the `requests` and `requests_mock` libraries (for Python specifically), the official documentation for `mitmproxy`, and, for a deep dive into network programming concepts, I would recommend “TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols” by W. Richard Stevens. This book provides an exceptional foundation for understanding network interaction and proxy behavior, which can help refine testing techniques further.
