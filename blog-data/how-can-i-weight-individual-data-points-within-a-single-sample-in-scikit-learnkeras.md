Let's unpack this, shall we? I've encountered this specific challenge more than once, often when dealing with imbalanced datasets or data sources that possess inherently varying levels of reliability. Weighting individual data points within a single sample—as opposed to weighting entire classes or samples—is a nuanced problem but it's incredibly useful when you need fine-grained control over how your model learns. Let me break down how it works in scikit-learn and Keras, sharing some experiences and code snippets from my past projects.

Essentially, the problem stems from wanting the model to pay more or less *attention* to particular examples within the data it's learning from, even within the same input instance. Consider a scenario where you're analyzing sensor data, and certain sensors are known to be more accurate than others. Instead of discarding the less precise readings, you can downweight their influence during training. Or, perhaps you are working on a time series and some timestamps are more relevant than the others. Or you have some error bounds for each measurement, which can also be treated as weights. These cases require you to assign weights at the element level within your sample.

**Scikit-learn's Approach: Sample Weights for Algorithms**

Scikit-learn supports sample weighting natively in many of its algorithms through the `sample_weight` parameter. This parameter accepts an array-like structure of the same length as the training data. Crucially, it weights the contribution of each *sample* to the loss function during the training process. Now, what if you need to apply weights within an instance? Well, one of the ways to achieve this is to preprocess the data before feeding it into the algorithm and modify the instance as required, then pass the weight to `sample_weight` as well. Let's look at an example involving regression:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Creating sample data with 3 features and weights for each feature
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15]])
y = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
feature_weights = np.array([[0.5, 1, 0.2], [0.8, 0.7, 0.9], [1, 0.5, 0.5], [0.3, 0.7, 1], [1, 0.9, 0.8]])

# applying element-wise weight to each instance
X_weighted = X * feature_weights
# Generating sample weights (all ones in this example)
sample_weights = np.ones(X_weighted.shape[0])
# Splitting the data into training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, weights_train, _ = train_test_split(X_weighted, y, sample_weights, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
# Fit the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train, sample_weight=weights_train)

# predict and output coefficients
print("Coefficients:", model.coef_)
print("Predictions:", model.predict(X_test))
```

In this first snippet, we simulate data with features (X) and corresponding target values (y), along with weights for each *feature* inside each sample. We perform element-wise multiplication to create the weighted data (X_weighted) that we then pass to the model. Note that this transformation is not done inside the model, but rather, is done externally. In addition to weighting the features, we also pass a `sample_weight` parameter (equal to ones).  In real life scenarios, you could use a `sample_weight` array reflecting how much you want to weigh particular samples.

**Keras' Flexibility: Sample Weights and Custom Loss Functions**

Keras, operating with a deeper learning approach, allows more control through the `sample_weight` parameter within its model's `fit` method as well. Similar to scikit-learn, you pass in an array-like structure of the same length as the training data to weight the contribution of a sample to the loss function. Keras also supports weight masks and custom loss functions if you want to use a more targeted weight structure. For instance, you can use masked tensors which allow for weighting individual elements of the tensor.

Let's illustrate this using a simple neural network:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Example data
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15]])
y = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
feature_weights = np.array([[0.5, 1, 0.2], [0.8, 0.7, 0.9], [1, 0.5, 0.5], [0.3, 0.7, 1], [1, 0.9, 0.8]])

# apply element-wise weights
X_weighted = X * feature_weights

# Create sample weights equal to 1, meaning all samples are equally important,
# however, within each sample, the different features were weighted differently
sample_weights = np.ones(X_weighted.shape[0])

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, weights_train, _ = train_test_split(X_weighted, y, sample_weights, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=500, sample_weight = weights_train, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss}')
```

In the second code snippet, we again weight the data before passing it to the model. Here, we construct a simple dense network, then we pass sample weights as a parameter to the fit method. The model learns based on the weighted input.

**More Advanced Control: Keras Masking Layer**

For even more granular control, especially in sequence data, Keras provides `tf.keras.layers.Masking`, and also masking support within the loss functions. You can use these to ignore specific elements within an instance during the loss calculation. This is typically more involved than sample weights but allows incredibly specific weighting and filtering logic. Let me show a basic example:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Example data, padded sequences
X = np.array([
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [0, 0, 0]],
    [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13,14,15]],
    [[16,17,18], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
])
y = np.array([10, 20, 30])
feature_weights = np.array([
     [[1, 1, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0,0,0]],
     [[1, 1, 1], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0,0,0]],
      [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
])

# Apply element-wise weights
X_weighted = X*feature_weights

# create a mask based on the position of the zero padding, in a real scenario, this
# mask can also be computed from other sources
mask = np.array([
    [1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0],
])
# Define model with masking layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Masking(mask_value = 0, input_shape = (X.shape[1],X.shape[2])),
    keras.layers.LSTM(32),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])


# compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')


# Fit the model
model.fit(X_weighted, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)
# Predict
predictions = model.predict(X_weighted)

print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

In the third snippet, we are dealing with time-series-like input data. Here we weight the features first. Then we apply masking based on zero padding to mask certain elements when training our LSTM. This allows even more fine-grained control, enabling the model to focus on only some of the elements inside the input.

**Further Reading and Resources:**

For more detailed information, I recommend looking into the following resources:

*   **"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop:** This classic text provides a strong foundation in the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning, including concepts related to weighted loss functions.
*   **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This book provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning models, including detailed explanations of loss functions and how they are implemented in practice, especially in the context of Keras and TensorFlow.
*   **The scikit-learn and Keras documentation:** The official documentation is invaluable for gaining a deep understanding of the specific parameters and capabilities of each library. Pay close attention to sections on `sample_weight`, `loss` functions, and masking layers.
*   **Research papers on imbalanced learning:** If you're weighting for imbalanced data scenarios, look for papers on techniques such as cost-sensitive learning and focal loss. These go into great depths regarding the theory and application of per-element weighting.

In summary, weighting data within a single sample is a problem that can be solved with various methods in scikit-learn and Keras, from applying weights in the pre-processing stage, to using sample weights during training, to applying masks or custom loss functions. Choosing the right solution depends on the specific nature of your data and the specific nuances of your task. I've found that understanding these methods to be incredibly advantageous in many of my past projects, enabling me to build models that were both more accurate and robust.
