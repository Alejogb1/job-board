Okay, let's tackle this. I remember a particularly tricky project a few years back where we were heavily reliant on configurable data validation. The challenge was, we needed the flexibility to swap validation rules dynamically, without resorting to a massive, monolithic class filled with conditional logic. We were essentially looking at how to pass constraints, not as static configuration, but as arguments to our validation methods or services. Java, being Java, doesn’t have a direct way to pass constraints as first-class objects the way some more dynamic languages might, but we found some effective workarounds leveraging its strong type system and object-oriented features.

At the core of the issue is that “constraints” themselves are typically expressed as annotations or, less often, as a set of predefined rules. They're not inherently objects we can directly manipulate as parameters. However, we can create abstractions that represent constraints and pass *those* abstractions around. Think about it, we're not passing the annotation itself, but something that *represents* what the annotation *does*. There are several effective strategies, and the best one will usually depend on the specifics of your situation. Let’s look at a few common approaches and illustrate them with some code examples.

One powerful method is using the *Strategy Pattern*. This pattern allows you to encapsulate different validation algorithms in separate classes (our "strategies") that implement a common interface. That interface can represent the abstract notion of a “constraint." The validation logic itself then becomes independent of the specific constraint it’s applying, making it highly flexible and testable.

Here’s a simplified example:

```java
interface ValidationStrategy {
    boolean validate(String input);
}

class NotEmptyValidation implements ValidationStrategy {
    @Override
    public boolean validate(String input) {
        return input != null && !input.trim().isEmpty();
    }
}

class LengthValidation implements ValidationStrategy {
    private int minLength;
    private int maxLength;

    public LengthValidation(int minLength, int maxLength) {
        this.minLength = minLength;
        this.maxLength = maxLength;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean validate(String input) {
        if (input == null) return false;
        int length = input.length();
        return length >= minLength && length <= maxLength;
    }
}

class Validator {
    public boolean isValid(String input, ValidationStrategy strategy) {
        return strategy.validate(input);
    }
}

public class StrategyPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Validator validator = new Validator();
        ValidationStrategy notEmpty = new NotEmptyValidation();
        ValidationStrategy lengthCheck = new LengthValidation(5, 10);

        System.out.println("Is 'hello' not empty? " + validator.isValid("hello", notEmpty));
        System.out.println("Is '' not empty? " + validator.isValid("", notEmpty));
        System.out.println("Is 'testing' between 5 and 10 chars? " + validator.isValid("testing", lengthCheck));
        System.out.println("Is 'test' between 5 and 10 chars? " + validator.isValid("test", lengthCheck));

    }
}
```

In this snippet, `ValidationStrategy` is our abstraction for a constraint. We have concrete strategies such as `NotEmptyValidation` and `LengthValidation`. The `Validator` class doesn’t care which strategy is used; it just calls the `validate` method. This allows you to pass these validation strategies as arguments to the `isValid` method. This worked incredibly well for us, particularly when we had multiple variations of validation based on the data context.

Another robust approach, particularly when dealing with complex rules or composing validation constraints, involves building a *specification pattern* on top of a functional interface, usually involving `java.util.function.Predicate`. A `Predicate` acts as a test, which maps beautifully to the concept of a validation check.

Here’s how it could look:

```java
import java.util.function.Predicate;

class StringValidator {

    public boolean isValid(String input, Predicate<String> specification) {
        return specification.test(input);
    }

    public static Predicate<String> notEmptyPredicate(){
        return  str -> str != null && !str.trim().isEmpty();
    }


    public static Predicate<String> lengthPredicate(int minLength, int maxLength) {
         return str -> str != null && str.length() >= minLength && str.length() <= maxLength;
    }

    public static Predicate<String> containsPredicate(String substring) {
       return str -> str != null && str.contains(substring);
    }
}

public class PredicateExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringValidator validator = new StringValidator();
        Predicate<String> notEmpty = StringValidator.notEmptyPredicate();
        Predicate<String> lengthCheck = StringValidator.lengthPredicate(5,10);
        Predicate<String> containsTest = StringValidator.containsPredicate("test");


        System.out.println("Is 'example' not empty? " + validator.isValid("example", notEmpty));
        System.out.println("Is '' not empty? " + validator.isValid("", notEmpty));
        System.out.println("Is 'testing' between 5 and 10 chars? " + validator.isValid("testing", lengthCheck));
        System.out.println("Is 'test' between 5 and 10 chars? " + validator.isValid("test", lengthCheck));
        System.out.println("Does 'test sample' contain test? " + validator.isValid("test sample", containsTest));
    }
}
```

Here, `Predicate<String>` itself serves as the abstraction. Instead of creating multiple strategy classes, we create static factory methods on our `StringValidator` to generate the relevant predicates. Then we pass these predicates to the validator. The benefit here is composability: it’s straightforward to combine multiple predicates using `.and()`, `.or()`, or `.negate()` to create complex validation criteria without introducing new classes. The `Predicate` interface is also well-established in the standard Java API which makes it easy to integrate with other parts of the codebase. This approach proved particularly effective in situations requiring flexible rule combinations.

Finally, if your constraints are heavily annotation-driven and you need to dynamically access and interpret these, you can use reflection combined with a custom validator. This is more complex and carries some performance implications but it is sometimes necessary. You would define a custom annotation, then create a validator that looks for this annotation and performs actions based on it.

Here’s an example showing how this can be implemented:

```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;
import java.lang.reflect.Field;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.FIELD)
@interface CustomConstraint {
    String pattern();
}

class ValidatedObject {
    @CustomConstraint(pattern = "^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$")
    private String alphanumericField;
    public ValidatedObject(String alphanumericField){
        this.alphanumericField = alphanumericField;
    }

    public String getAlphanumericField() {
        return alphanumericField;
    }
}
class AnnotationValidator {
     public boolean isValid(Object obj){
         try {
           for(Field field : obj.getClass().getDeclaredFields()){
              if(field.isAnnotationPresent(CustomConstraint.class)){
                  field.setAccessible(true);
                  Object value = field.get(obj);
                  if(value instanceof String){
                     String pattern = field.getAnnotation(CustomConstraint.class).pattern();
                     String strValue = (String) value;
                     if(!strValue.matches(pattern)){
                        return false;
                     }
                  }
              }
           }

         } catch(IllegalAccessException ex){
           return false;
         }
         return true;
     }
}


public class AnnotationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationValidator validator = new AnnotationValidator();
        ValidatedObject valid = new ValidatedObject("test1234");
        ValidatedObject invalid = new ValidatedObject("test@#");

        System.out.println("Is 'test1234' a valid string? " + validator.isValid(valid));
        System.out.println("Is 'test@#' a valid string? " + validator.isValid(invalid));


    }
}
```

In this scenario, `CustomConstraint` defines our validation rule (in this case a regular expression). The `AnnotationValidator` uses reflection to find fields with this annotation and then performs the validation logic based on that annotation. This technique is more involved and should be used cautiously, mostly in scenarios where you have heavy use of annotations. The performance overhead of reflection can be significant if not used sparingly, or cached accordingly.

For deeper understanding, I'd suggest looking into "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Gamma et al (for Strategy and general design patterns), "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch (for idiomatic Java), and the official Java documentation on reflection and functional interfaces. Additionally, explore "Implementing Domain-Driven Design" by Vaughn Vernon for a more strategic view of validation in complex domains and how the specification pattern can help.

So, to summarize, passing constraints as arguments in Java isn't about directly passing the constraint mechanisms themselves, but about passing abstractions or representations of those constraints. Techniques like the strategy pattern, functional interfaces like `Predicate`, and annotation processing using reflection allow you to achieve dynamic and flexible validation logic, adapting to varying requirements without over-complicating the code. Choose the approach that best suits the complexity and context of your validation needs.
