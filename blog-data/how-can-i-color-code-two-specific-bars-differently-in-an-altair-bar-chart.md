Alright, let's tackle this. Getting specific bars to stand out in an Altair chart is a fairly common task, and thankfully, it’s achievable with a few different strategies. I remember facing a similar challenge years ago while visualizing server performance metrics where highlighting peak usage times was crucial. We needed certain bars to pop, and the standard single-color output wasn’t cutting it. We ended up using a combination of conditional logic and encoding, which proved quite effective.

The crux of the matter is that Altair, being declarative, doesn't directly offer a "color this bar specifically" command. Instead, we manipulate the underlying data and encoding to achieve the desired result. The key lies in adding a new field to your data that dictates the color, and then mapping that field to the `color` channel in your encoding.

Here's the breakdown of the techniques I often resort to, along with practical examples:

**Method 1: Using a Conditional Encoding**

This approach involves adding a new column to your pandas dataframe or data source. This new column will represent a color value based on a condition, and this column is then mapped to the color channel. It's particularly useful when the condition for highlighting is straightforward.

Let’s assume you have a pandas dataframe `df` with columns `category` and `value`. You wish to highlight the bars where the category is ‘A’ and ‘C’ with ‘red’ and ‘blue’, respectively, and the rest of bars with ‘gray’ color. Here’s how you would achieve this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
        'value': [10, 15, 7, 20, 12]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def assign_color(category):
    if category == 'A':
        return 'red'
    elif category == 'C':
        return 'blue'
    else:
        return 'gray'

df['bar_color'] = df['category'].apply(assign_color)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q',
    color='bar_color:N'
).properties(
    title="Categorical Bar Chart with Conditional Colors"
)

chart.show()
```

In this snippet, we first define a function `assign_color` that returns a color based on the category. Then we apply this function to create a new column named 'bar_color' in our pandas dataframe. Finally, we encode the chart, mapping the new column to the `color` channel. Notice the `N` type specification, this is important because this is a nominal column, it will tell Altair not to interpolate colors.

**Method 2: Using a Specific Data Structure with Explicit Color Encoding**

This method uses a list of dictionaries, which can be very useful if your color assignments are arbitrary or if you are dealing with data not originating from a pandas dataframe. Each dictionary represents a single bar, including its associated category, value, and color. It’s direct and easy to control but requires a bit more manual assembly.

Suppose we wish to visualize the same data as the above example but this time using a list of dictionaries with pre-defined colors. Here’s the approach:

```python
import altair as alt

data = [
    {'category': 'A', 'value': 10, 'color': 'red'},
    {'category': 'B', 'value': 15, 'color': 'gray'},
    {'category': 'C', 'value': 7, 'color': 'blue'},
    {'category': 'D', 'value': 20, 'color': 'gray'},
    {'category': 'E', 'value': 12, 'color': 'gray'}
]


chart = alt.Chart(alt.Data(values=data)).mark_bar().encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q',
    color='color:N'
).properties(
    title="Categorical Bar Chart with Predefined Colors"
)
chart.show()
```

In this approach, we define our data directly as a list of dictionaries, specifying the color for each category explicitly. This provides maximum control but also implies a less flexible data structure compared to a pandas dataframe approach. The `alt.Data(values=data)` structure makes this usable directly within Altair without the need to reference a DataFrame object.

**Method 3: Leveraging Altair's `condition` Transform**

This approach, while also utilizing conditional logic, is performed directly within Altair's specification, without modifying the original dataframe. This is convenient when you don't want to directly manipulate your data. It requires a bit more understanding of Altair's API but is very powerful for more complex conditional formatting.

Consider we have the dataframe, as in the first method, but this time, we want to encode our color conditional logic directly in Altair without adding a new color column.

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
        'value': [10, 15, 7, 20, 12]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

color_scale = alt.Scale(domain=['A','C'], range=['red', 'blue'])

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q',
    color=alt.condition(
        alt.selection_single(
            fields=['category'], 
            empty='none', 
            name='category_selector'
        ),
        'category:N',
        alt.value('gray'),
        scale = color_scale
    )
).properties(
    title="Categorical Bar Chart with Altair Conditional Logic"
)
chart.show()
```

This example utilizes a single selection to identify the categories we wish to color conditionally. We then pass this selection to the conditional encoding, which colors bars with "red" and "blue" if they match the specified categories, using a specific scale, and a "gray" otherwise. This method keeps our data clean and expresses the visualization logic directly in Altair. Note, the `empty='none'` parameter forces an active selection in the visualization.

**A Few Closing Remarks**

Choosing between these methods generally depends on the specifics of your task. If your conditional logic is simple and your source is a pandas dataframe, adding a color column (Method 1) is often the most straightforward. If you have pre-defined, granular colors, using a list of dictionaries (Method 2) is cleaner. If your data structure is complex or you don't wish to directly manipulate your data, using Altair's condition transform (Method 3) provides the greatest flexibility, albeit with a slightly steeper learning curve.

For further understanding, I recommend delving into the official Altair documentation, particularly the sections on data transformation and encoding. Specifically, look into `alt.condition`, `alt.selection_single` and `alt.Scale`. While there isn’t a singular book covering just Altair in depth, exploring the broader area of declarative data visualization, particularly in the context of statistical graphics, through resources like Wilkinson’s "The Grammar of Graphics" will provide a great understanding of the foundational principles underpinning these tools and visualizations. Understanding these fundamental principles will elevate your usage of Altair. Remember, as with any technical skill, practice and experimentation are key to mastering data visualization techniques. These techniques should get you started, happy charting!
