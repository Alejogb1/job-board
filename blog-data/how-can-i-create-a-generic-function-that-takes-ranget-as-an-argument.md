Alright,  I've dealt with generic range handling more times than I care to count, and it always comes down to a few key principles. The core challenge with a generic function accepting `range<t>` is that `range<t>` itself isn't directly usable as a *type* in many languages. It's a parameterized type, and you need to ensure your function can handle whatever underlying concrete type `t` ends up being. I'm going to approach this by breaking it into two major steps: type constraints and leveraging interfaces. Let's go.

First, type constraints. This is the bedrock of making a generic function actually useful. You need to place limitations on what type `t` can be. For example, let's say you're operating on numerical ranges. You'd likely need some way to compare `t` values and possibly perform arithmetic operations on them. In languages like c# or java, you'd rely on type constraints using interfaces or base classes. Here's a scenario from one project I did where we needed a way to determine if a number fell inside *any* given numerical range:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public static class RangeExtensions
{
    public static bool IsWithinRange<T>(this Range<T> range, T value) where T : IComparable<T>
    {
        return range.Start.CompareTo(value) <= 0 && range.End.CompareTo(value) >= 0;
    }

    public static bool IsWithinAnyRange<T>(this IEnumerable<Range<T>> ranges, T value) where T : IComparable<T>
    {
      foreach (var range in ranges)
      {
        if(range.IsWithinRange(value)) return true;
      }
        return false;
    }
}

public class Example
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    var ranges = new List<Range<int>>();
    ranges.Add(new Range<int>(0, 10));
    ranges.Add(new Range<int>(20, 30));

    Console.WriteLine($"Is 5 in any range? {ranges.IsWithinAnyRange(5)}"); // Output: true
    Console.WriteLine($"Is 15 in any range? {ranges.IsWithinAnyRange(15)}"); // Output: false
    Console.WriteLine($"Is 25 in any range? {ranges.IsWithinAnyRange(25)}"); // Output: true

    var floatRanges = new List<Range<float>>();
    floatRanges.Add(new Range<float>(0.5f, 1.5f));
    floatRanges.Add(new Range<float>(2.5f, 3.5f));
    Console.WriteLine($"Is 1.0f in any range? {floatRanges.IsWithinAnyRange(1.0f)}"); // Output: true
  }

  public struct Range<T>
  {
    public T Start { get; }
    public T End { get; }

    public Range(T start, T end)
    {
        Start = start;
        End = end;
    }
  }
}

```

In this snippet, `IsWithinRange` and `IsWithinAnyRange` are both extension methods that operate on `Range<T>` and collections of `Range<T>`, respectively. The critical part is the `where T : icomparable<t>` constraint. this ensures that the type `t` we are using, like int or float, is capable of comparison operations, which are necessary for determining if a value falls within the specified range. We couldn't use this with some custom type without implementing `icomparable<t>` first. Note that i used extension methods to illustrate how you might enhance existing classes.

Next, let's consider a slightly more complex example, where we might need to also perform some mathematical operations. Imagine a scenario where you need to calculate the midpoint of a range. You'd need `t` to be a type that supports addition and division and can return a value of the same type.

```java
public class RangeUtils {

    public static <T extends Number & Comparable<T>> T calculateMidpoint(Range<T> range) {
        T start = range.getStart();
        T end = range.getEnd();

        if(start instanceof Integer) {
          return (T) Integer.valueOf((((Integer) start) + ((Integer) end)) / 2);
        } else if (start instanceof Double){
            return (T) Double.valueOf((((Double) start) + ((Double) end)) / 2);
        }else if (start instanceof Float){
          return (T) Float.valueOf((((Float) start) + ((Float) end)) / 2);
        }
        else {
          throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported number type.");
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
         Range<Integer> intRange = new Range<>(5, 15);
         System.out.println("Midpoint of integer range: " + calculateMidpoint(intRange)); // Output: 10
         
         Range<Double> doubleRange = new Range<>(2.5, 7.5);
         System.out.println("Midpoint of double range: " + calculateMidpoint(doubleRange)); // Output: 5.0

         Range<Float> floatRange = new Range<>(2.5f, 7.5f);
         System.out.println("Midpoint of float range: " + calculateMidpoint(floatRange)); // Output: 5.0
    }

    private static class Range<T> {
        private T start;
        private T end;

        public Range(T start, T end) {
            this.start = start;
            this.end = end;
        }

        public T getStart() {
            return start;
        }

        public T getEnd() {
            return end;
        }
    }
}
```

Here, I've used generics in Java, and the `<T extends Number & Comparable<T>>` shows that `T` needs to inherit `Number` and implement `Comparable`. In addition, since Java does not support generic math, explicit type casts are required to avoid compilation errors. This code could be more generalized using something like apache commons-math to avoid manual if statements for every number type, but it demonstrates a concrete approach.

Finally, let's consider a scenario where we’re dealing not with numbers, but with comparable objects, such as dates. Here's a python example:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, List

T = TypeVar('T')
class Range(Generic[T]):
  def __init__(self, start: T, end: T):
      self.start = start
      self.end = end

def is_within_range(range: Range[T], value: T) -> bool:
  if not isinstance(range.start, type(value)) or not isinstance(range.end, type(value)):
    raise TypeError("Value must be of the same type as the range endpoints")
  return range.start <= value <= range.end

def check_ranges(ranges: List[Range[T]], value: T) -> bool:
    for range in ranges:
        if is_within_range(range, value):
            return True
    return False

if __name__ == '__main__':
    date_ranges = [
        Range(datetime(2023, 1, 1), datetime(2023, 1, 10)),
        Range(datetime(2023, 2, 1), datetime(2023, 2, 10))
    ]
    test_date = datetime(2023, 1, 5)
    print(f"Is {test_date} in any date range? {check_ranges(date_ranges, test_date)}") #output: True

    test_date = datetime(2023, 1, 15)
    print(f"Is {test_date} in any date range? {check_ranges(date_ranges, test_date)}") #output: False

    int_ranges = [
        Range(1, 10),
        Range(20, 30)
    ]

    test_int = 5
    print(f"Is {test_int} in any integer range? {check_ranges(int_ranges, test_int)}") #output: True
```

Here, I'm using Python and type hints to showcase a more dynamic approach. Note how the generic `range` structure is implemented, and how the logic of determining if a value is within a range is consistent and type safe due to the conditional type check. This flexibility is one of python's strengths.

For a deeper dive, I recommend looking into the specifics of type constraints and generics in your language of choice. “Effective Java” by Joshua Bloch has excellent advice on generics. Also, any good language specific documentation will clarify the constraints available in your given environment. Another book, "generic programming" by David R. Musser and Alexander A. Stepanov, outlines some of the original rationale behind generic programming principles that underly many modern techniques used for this type of problem. Finally, if you have to deal with specific numeric or date-time type calculations, look at the specific number and date/time libraries in each language (e.g., `java.time` in java).

The common thread across all examples is that you need a way to establish the contract for how the generic `t` operates, such as comparisons, mathematical operations or simply having a defined type. Without these, it is difficult to create a meaningful implementation of a generic function handling the `Range<T>` type. Hopefully this has been helpful.
