it's a common head-scratcher, i've definitely bumped into this one a few times myself when tinkering with golearn. let me share my experience and what i've found.

the core issue, usually, stems from golearn's expectations about how you're structuring your data when you're using algorithms that require feature attributes or 'columns'. if golearn sees no attributes or an empty list of attributes that it needs to fit your data it will complain. this error "no class attributes are defined" means that your data structure doesn't have these attributes correctly setup so golearn knows which features to use.

when i started using golearn, i made this mistake often, i was porting some python scikit-learn projects and wasn't thinking about the data structure, it is easy to fall into this pit. my initial approach for example was just throwing in a simple `[][]float64` type variable (a slice of slices of floats) to golearn models.

let me give you an example.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn/base"
	"github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn/linear_models"
)

func main() {
	// this will fail as there are no attributes
	data := [][]float64{
		{1.0, 2.0, 3.0},
		{4.0, 5.0, 6.0},
		{7.0, 8.0, 9.0},
	}

	inst := base.NewDenseInstancesFromSlice(data)
    
    // the error happens here
	cls := linear_models.NewLogisticRegression()
	err := cls.Fit(inst)
    if err != nil{
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
}

```

this piece of code will generate the error you're seeing because i created the instances directly from the [][]float64 slice and this does not include information about the attributes or column names. golearn doesn't automatically interpret the columns by default and needs you to specify this.

i learnt this lesson the hard way when i was working on a small project trying to predict some user behavior patterns from a set of numerical inputs. i had my data loaded perfectly into a slice, but i was scratching my head for hours wondering why i couldn't make the simplest model to work!

the fix, and what i’ve found to be the common solution, is to properly define your attributes when creating the `base.Instances` object, you need to give names to your columns. golearn will not magically know how to name your columns. you can think of it like this, you are building a table the columns are the attribute names, the data values are the cells of the table, golearn expects to know the names.

the way to do that using the `base.NewDenseInstances()` which allows you to specify the attributes.

here's how i adjusted the earlier example that actually worked:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn/base"
	"github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn/linear_models"
)

func main() {
	data := [][]float64{
		{1.0, 2.0, 3.0},
		{4.0, 5.0, 6.0},
		{7.0, 8.0, 9.0},
	}

    attrs := base.Attributes{
        base.NewFloatAttribute("feature_1"),
        base.NewFloatAttribute("feature_2"),
        base.NewFloatAttribute("feature_3"),
    }

    // Create the instances with defined attributes
    inst, err := base.NewDenseInstances(attrs, data)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
		return
    }

	cls := linear_models.NewLogisticRegression()
	err = cls.Fit(inst)

    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("model fitted successfuly!")
    }
}

```

this second example actually works, now the attributes for our features are defined. you can see that i used `base.NewFloatAttribute` to define each attribute with a name, feature_1, feature_2, and feature_3 respectively. then i create an instance of `base.NewDenseInstances` which uses the attributes and the data together to create the data structure expected by golearn.

the attribute names i used are arbitrary, you could use any name you want that describes the feature correctly, i tend to use the name of the variable or feature that the value represents, sometimes i name them col1, col2, col3, that depends on the particular project, or the input data. it makes it easier to keep track when you are debugging.

another situation where this error can happen is when you're using a dataset from a file or some data source where the schema isn't loaded properly. if you load data from a csv for example, you will need to make sure that you read the headers and create the attributes from that. 

i once had a case with a big csv of sensor data with 200 columns, and golearn was just not processing it and i couldn't figure it out initially, because i was just reading all the values as data without looking at the headers. i realized that i was not creating the correct attributes, so i updated my data loading function to read the csv headers, and then i created the attributes dynamically with the headers names.

here is a basic example of how you can use the `csv` library to dynamically read the header and create the attributes.

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/csv"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"os"
    "strconv"
	"github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn/base"
	"github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn/linear_models"
)

func main() {
    
    file, err := os.Open("data.csv")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("error opening csv")
        return
    }
    defer file.Close()

    reader := csv.NewReader(file)

    header, err := reader.Read()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("error reading headers")
        return
    }
    
    attrs := make(base.Attributes, len(header))
    for i, colName := range header {
        attrs[i] = base.NewFloatAttribute(colName)
    }
    
    var data [][]float64
    for {
        record, err := reader.Read()
        if err == io.EOF {
            break
        }
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("error reading record")
            return
        }
		row := make([]float64, len(record))
        for i, val := range record {
			row[i], err = strconv.ParseFloat(val,64)
			if err != nil{
				fmt.Println("error converting to float", err)
				return
			}

		}
		data = append(data, row)

    }

    inst, err := base.NewDenseInstances(attrs, data)
    if err != nil{
        fmt.Println("error create instances", err)
		return
    }
	cls := linear_models.NewLogisticRegression()
	err = cls.Fit(inst)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }else {
        fmt.Println("model fitted successfuly!")
    }
}
```

in this code example i read the csv file, i extracted the headers and then i create attributes with the names from the csv file, i also parsed the values into floats, this is very important because the csv is just plain text, then i create the instances using these values.

you can create a `data.csv` file to test this example with some comma separated values for example `col1,col2,col3` as headers in the first line, and then some data rows with float values in each column.

by taking care of these things, i was able to solve this problem, and now i usually double check my code to make sure the attributes are properly setup before trying to fit a model. it saves you time.

for further reading, there aren't specific golearn-focused books but understanding the underlying principles of machine learning data structures helps a lot. "the elements of statistical learning" by hastie, tibshirani, and friedman is a good book for the theoretical background, also "hands-on machine learning with scikit-learn, keras & tensorflow" by aurélien géron, while not directly about go, it provides a lot of useful insights into practical data structuring techniques, also the golearn project documentation and go itself will greatly help you understand more about this topic. and why did the programmer quit his job? because he didn’t get arrays...

i hope this helps and let me know if you run into more issues.
