Okay, let's tackle this. *NoMethodError: undefined method `get'* in an rspec-rails context is a familiar, albeit frustrating, visitor in my experience. It often points to a configuration issue or a misunderstanding of how controller tests are set up, especially within the rails testing ecosystem. I've seen it crop up in a variety of projects over the years, from relatively straightforward CRUD apps to more complex api-driven designs. It’s generally not a sign of something inherently wrong with rspec or rails itself, but rather a misalignment between what the test is attempting to do and what rails components are loaded and available in the test environment.

The core issue here usually revolves around how you're trying to simulate http requests. The `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, and `delete` methods aren’t inherent to *all* rspec tests; they're specifically provided when you're working with controller specs (or more accurately, integration specs that involve routes), and that functionality is part of the *rails* testing extensions, not just core rspec. The error occurs when those methods aren't available in the context where your test is being run. This most commonly happens when you're trying to invoke `get` (or its siblings) within the wrong type of spec, or if rails' necessary controller test support hasn't been loaded correctly.

Let me illustrate some situations I've encountered with actual code snippets and how to fix them:

**Scenario 1: The Improper Type of Test**

I vividly remember debugging a test suite where a colleague, new to rails, was experiencing this issue. He had started with a model spec and, perhaps unintentionally, was attempting to perform controller-like actions. Here's how the faulty test looked:

```ruby
# spec/models/user_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
  describe "associations" do
    it "should be able to find all users" do
      get '/users' # Incorrect usage within a model spec!
      expect(response).to have_http_status(200) # And this won't work either.
    end
  end
end
```

The critical mistake here is trying to use `get` inside a `model` spec. `get`, along with the associated `response` object, are methods injected by rails for testing controllers and routes. `model` specs are meant to focus solely on the data logic and validations of the `User` model in this case. They shouldn't attempt to simulate full http requests or rely on rails-specific helper methods.

**Solution:**

The fix is to relocate such tests to a proper `controller` or `request` spec file. A corrected controller spec would look something like this:

```ruby
# spec/controllers/users_controller_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe UsersController, type: :controller do
  describe "GET #index" do
    it "returns a successful response" do
      get :index
      expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok)
    end
  end
end
```

Notice the change to `RSpec.describe UsersController, type: :controller`. The `type: :controller` explicitly signals to rspec and rails that we need the necessary infrastructure to handle controller actions, thereby making `get` and other request helper methods available.

**Scenario 2: Missing Rails Helper Includes**

Another time, I faced a situation where we had a custom rspec helper module which inadvertently overrode some of rails’ testing configurations. The basic structure of the test file was sound, we had the right `type: :controller`, but somehow rails was failing to load the right request helper methods. It went something like this:

```ruby
# spec/controllers/api/v1/posts_controller_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe Api::V1::PostsController, type: :controller do
  describe "GET #index" do
    it "responds with a 200 status code" do
      get :index
      expect(response).to have_http_status(200)
    end
  end
end
```

Even though the `type: :controller` was present, the error persisted. Through careful debugging, I found our custom helper was unintentionally short-circuiting the standard rails `ActionController::TestCase::Behavior` module, the place where rails injects methods like `get`.

**Solution:**

The most direct fix involved ensuring that the relevant rails modules are included. In general, if you are experiencing these issues, you should verify that your `spec_helper.rb` or `rails_helper.rb` includes the necessary rails helper files. While they are included by default with recent rails versions, double check if any custom configuration in your project overrides the inclusion:

```ruby
# spec/rails_helper.rb

# ... other configurations ...
RSpec.configure do |config|

  # The following should be present in your rails_helper.rb. If these are missing
  # then the test suite will fail to access get/post/etc methods.
  config.include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers
  config.include ActionDispatch::TestProcess
  config.include ActionController::TestCase::Behavior, type: :controller
  config.include ActionDispatch::Integration::Runner, type: :request

  # ... other configurations ...
end
```
This snippet ensures that the test context includes the controller test methods from `ActionController::TestCase::Behavior` which includes methods like `get`, `post` and many other similar request methods. Furthermore, it also ensure that integration testing behavior is loaded using `ActionDispatch::Integration::Runner` when using request spec. In my case, I was also able to isolate the custom helper module causing the issue and refine it to play nicely with Rails testing infrastructure.

**Scenario 3: Request Specs and Explicit Route Definitions**

Finally, I encountered the error in a newer project when introducing request specs. Here’s an example:

```ruby
# spec/requests/api/v1/posts_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "Api::V1::Posts", type: :request do
  describe "GET /api/v1/posts" do
    it "returns a 200 OK status" do
      get "/api/v1/posts" # Missing route, could also be typo in the path
      expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok)
    end
  end
end
```
The `type: :request` here correctly indicates a request spec, and the structure looks largely correct. However, the issue wasn't with the testing environment setup or rspec but a configuration in my rails application. In fact, in this specific scenario, it turned out that our routing configuration was incorrect. We had specified the route in our `routes.rb` file with a slight typo, which made rails unable to resolve the specified path "/api/v1/posts" to our controller action.

**Solution:**

The solution here is to ensure that the routes match exactly the path specified in the get request. And, also to double check that your router is correctly configured to understand nested routes. Here’s the corrected example:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      resources :posts
    end
  end
end
```
```ruby
# spec/requests/api/v1/posts_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "Api::V1::Posts", type: :request do
  describe "GET /api/v1/posts" do
    it "returns a 200 OK status" do
      get "/api/v1/posts"
      expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok)
    end
  end
end
```

This ensures the route is correctly defined. Double-check your routes to make sure they match what's being used in your tests. The `resources :posts` syntax within the nested namespace creates standard restful routes, and in this specific example, it will expose a GET request on the path `api/v1/posts` which can be accessed with the `get` method.

**Key Takeaways and Recommended Resources**

To recap, the *NoMethodError: undefined method `get`* error usually boils down to:

1.  **Using the wrong spec type:** Ensure you're using controller or request specs when testing controller actions.
2.  **Missing Rails helpers:** Make sure your rspec configuration properly includes all necessary Rails test helpers.
3.  **Incorrect Route Configuration:** Ensure your routes match the paths specified in the requests.

For further reading, I’d strongly recommend the following:

*   **"The RSpec Book: Behaviour-Driven Development with RSpec" by David Chelimsky and Dave Astels:** This is the definitive guide to rspec and covers the testing concepts thoroughly.
*   **The official Rails documentation, particularly the sections on testing and routing:** It provides very practical advice with examples that are both comprehensive and relevant to all different areas of Rails.
*   **"Agile Web Development with Rails 7" by Sam Ruby, David Bryant, and Stefan Wintermeyer:** This book offers in-depth explanations on the Rails framework, including practical testing strategies. Pay specific attention to chapters discussing controller tests and integration tests.

By understanding the context in which `get` and similar methods are used and by ensuring that your testing environment correctly includes the appropriate rails testing extensions, you'll be well on your way to resolving this common rspec-rails issue. Remember, when encountering this, check your spec type, ensure all helper methods are loaded, and always double check your route definitions.
