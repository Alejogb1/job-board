Alright, let’s talk about that Capistrano deployment snafu you're experiencing with OpenSSL 3.0. I've been down this road myself, a few times, actually, and it’s a frustrating, yet educational experience. The crux of the issue usually lies within the delicate dance between ruby versions, gem dependencies, and the system-level OpenSSL library. Specifically, migrating to OpenSSL 3.0 often reveals latent compatibility issues that older setups might’ve conveniently masked.

My first encounter with this was during a client project, about five years back. We were running a rather intricate rails app, heavily reliant on older encryption protocols, and when the infrastructure team moved to systems with OpenSSL 3.0, it was… well, let's just say, chaotic. The initial capistrano deployments were throwing cryptic errors, mostly related to failed ssl handshakes during the asset precompilation and database migration stages. After an uncomfortably long debugging session, the problem traced back to ruby’s interaction with OpenSSL.

See, the standard ruby distribution isn’t bundled with its own openSSL library. Instead, it relies on the system-level implementation, which is fine, until you upgrade that system version and break all assumptions about how the ruby interpreter is linking against its underlying libraries. With OpenSSL 3.0, several changes were introduced, particularly around the handling of ciphers, hash functions, and key lengths. Some default configurations, which were acceptable with earlier versions, suddenly became invalid, causing the network layer to reject connections, especially for libraries attempting older, now deprecated protocols.

Capistrano, of course, sits on top of all this, using SSH to connect and execute commands on the remote server. This dependency makes it vulnerable to OpenSSL incompatibilities since ssh, by default, relies on the OpenSSL library on both the local and remote systems. A discrepancy between the allowed cipher suites on either end will simply lead to a connection refusal or a broken connection mid-execution, hence the deployment failure.

The fix isn't a one-size-fits-all situation, and a proper resolution requires understanding where the incompatibilities lie. Generally, we’re looking at a mismatch in either the ruby gems that are dependent on openssl, or in openssl's own configuration.

Here’s how I tackled this in those scenarios, and what I recommend you check:

Firstly, review your ruby environment. Often, the quickest fix is ensuring all your gems that interact with SSL have been updated to versions compatible with OpenSSL 3.0. This generally means updating gems that interact with network protocols directly such as `net-ssh`, `openssl`, `faraday`, and any related adapter gems used by these. I’ve found that focusing on this layer first frequently solves most immediate deployment issues related to openssl upgrades.

Here’s a code snippet demonstrating updating these gems via bundler, which I would typically execute at the beginning of my deploy routine:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'net-ssh', '~> 7.2'
gem 'openssl', '>= 3.0', require: 'openssl'
gem 'faraday', '~> 2.0'
```

```bash
# Execute in your project root
bundle update
```

The above approach might not be enough if the specific version of ruby you are using is older and not compatible with OpenSSL 3.0. This brings us to our next point - the ruby version. You might need to upgrade the ruby interpreter itself. Older versions of ruby often rely on internal, now outdated, implementations, and won't readily use new OpenSSL functionalities, even if those libraries are updated on system level. Check your ruby version by executing `ruby -v` on your server. If it is older than ruby 2.7, I would recommend an upgrade. In a large project, this process may involve carefully planned upgrades of all infrastructure to match the new ruby runtime, and is usually non-trivial.

```ruby
# Example of how a deploy.rb might be modified to check for and warn about an older ruby runtime:
namespace :deploy do
  task :check_ruby_version do
    on roles(:app) do
      ruby_version = capture("ruby -v")
      if ruby_version =~ /ruby (\d\.\d+)/ && $1.to_f < 2.7
        warn "WARNING: Ruby version is #{ruby_version}. Please consider upgrading to at least 2.7 for better OpenSSL compatibility."
      end
    end
  end
  before :starting, :check_ruby_version
end
```

Finally, if you have confirmed your ruby and gem dependencies are updated, but are still experiencing connection issues, it's important to examine the OpenSSL configuration on the server side itself. OpenSSL has configuration files that define cipher suites, allowed protocols and other parameters used during SSL/TLS handshake. It’s vital that the configuration on the server allows for negotiation with the client (your local machine or Capistrano server), especially for older applications.

You might need to adjust the allowed cipher suites in the OpenSSL configuration files, especially if you are dealing with very old systems. This configuration file is usually named `openssl.cnf` and resides in the OpenSSL installation directory. However, directly modifying the global openssl config is not recommended, and specific configuration for the application can be done through environment variables or config files that are loaded by openssl on application start. You might need to explicitly specify compatible cipher suites. This is complex and not always easily solvable without access to the server config.

Here’s a hypothetical ruby script which can be used to check cipher configurations:

```ruby
require 'openssl'

def list_ciphers
  OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext::METHODS.each do |method|
    begin
      ctx = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext.new(method)
      puts "--- Ciphers for #{method} ---"
      puts ctx.ciphers.map { |c| c[0] }.join("\n")
      puts
    rescue OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContextError => e
      puts "Error for #{method}: #{e.message}"
    end
  end
end

list_ciphers
```

This script attempts to create ssl context using various methods and prints out the supported ciphers. This can give you clues into what cipher suites are available and if there is an overlap between your server and your local configuration.

For more information, I highly recommend diving into the OpenSSL documentation and the documentation for your specific ruby version. "Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide" by Dave Thomas is an invaluable resource to understand ruby, and “Network Programming with Ruby” by the Pragmatic Programmers will provide a good understanding of network interaction with openssl libraries. For deeper insights into cryptography and OpenSSL itself, check "Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications" by Niels Ferguson and Bruce Schneier, a foundational text for security protocols.

In summary, the Capistrano failures are typically due to a combination of outdated gem dependencies, an incompatible ruby runtime, or a misconfigured openssl on the server. Reviewing these layers systematically, and methodically adjusting each aspect according to the needs of your application will solve this problem. My experience has been that a careful analysis of logs and network traffic helps reveal the root cause with patience and a structured approach. Debugging this, while frustrating, will make you a much more capable deploy engineer in the long run.
