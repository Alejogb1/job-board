Alright, let's tackle this. Dealing with variable image sizes in TensorFlow training and inference is something I've personally encountered quite a few times, and it can indeed introduce some wrinkles if not handled correctly. The key lies in understanding that convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the workhorses for image processing, generally don't operate directly on images of arbitrary dimensions. They expect fixed-size input tensors for efficient batch processing and consistent calculations. However, real-world scenarios rarely present us with perfectly standardized images. This discrepancy necessitates careful preprocessing and leveraging certain TensorFlow functionalities to accommodate variable input sizes.

My early experiences with this were, frankly, a bit bumpy. I remember back in 2017, I was working on a project involving satellite imagery. The source imagery came from different sensors and acquisition angles, resulting in substantial variation in image dimensions. Trying to force everything into a fixed size caused significant distortion and ultimately, a significant drop in model performance. That's when I started to really understand the need for flexible input pipelines.

There are several strategies I've found effective, and while they might seem subtle, they make all the difference. First, *resizing or padding* to a fixed size is a very common technique, and probably the first thing most people try. TensorFlow provides tools like `tf.image.resize` for this. While straightforward, it’s not ideal for all use cases because, as I witnessed in my satellite project, it can stretch or squish the images, losing valuable information, or introduces artificial borders where padding is used.

Another, often preferred, option is to maintain the aspect ratio while resizing to a fixed size, often using a combination of padding and resizing. In this scenario, you resize the image so the *shorter* side matches your required input size and then pad the longer side with zeros. This is generally a more robust approach. For those situations where you absolutely need to process raw images without any manipulation, strategies like fully convolutional networks (FCN) and using techniques involving adaptive pooling layers come into play. FCNs, unlike conventional CNNs, don't have fully connected layers at the end and they can receive input of arbitrary dimensions as they only depend on convolutional operators, which are size agnostic by nature. This is a great solution when the semantic structure of images is vital and you want to maintain the original image properties.

Let's dive into some code examples to illustrate these points. The first example focuses on simple resizing:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def resize_image(image, target_size):
  """Resizes an image to a fixed target size using tf.image.resize."""
  resized_image = tf.image.resize(image, target_size)
  return resized_image

# Example Usage:
image = tf.random.normal((100, 150, 3)) # Example image (height, width, channels)
target_size = (224, 224)
resized_image = resize_image(image, target_size)
print(f"Original Image Shape: {image.shape}")
print(f"Resized Image Shape: {resized_image.shape}")

```
This snippet demonstrates a simple resizing operation. However, as mentioned before, simply resizing to a given shape might not be the best strategy in all situations, as it will distort the original aspect ratio of the images.

Now, let's look at a more advanced approach – resizing with aspect ratio preservation and padding:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def resize_and_pad_image(image, target_size):
  """Resizes an image to a target size preserving aspect ratio and padding."""
  image_height = tf.shape(image)[0]
  image_width = tf.shape(image)[1]
  target_height = target_size[0]
  target_width = target_size[1]

  ratio = tf.minimum(target_height / tf.cast(image_height, tf.float32), target_width / tf.cast(image_width, tf.float32))

  new_height = tf.cast(tf.cast(image_height, tf.float32) * ratio, tf.int32)
  new_width = tf.cast(tf.cast(image_width, tf.float32) * ratio, tf.int32)

  resized_image = tf.image.resize(image, (new_height, new_width))

  padding_height = target_height - new_height
  padding_width = target_width - new_width
  
  padding_top = padding_height // 2
  padding_bottom = padding_height - padding_top
  padding_left = padding_width // 2
  padding_right = padding_width - padding_left

  padded_image = tf.pad(resized_image, [[padding_top, padding_bottom], [padding_left, padding_right], [0, 0]])

  return padded_image


# Example Usage:
image = tf.random.normal((80, 200, 3)) # Example image (height, width, channels)
target_size = (224, 224)
resized_padded_image = resize_and_pad_image(image, target_size)
print(f"Original Image Shape: {image.shape}")
print(f"Resized and Padded Image Shape: {resized_padded_image.shape}")

```

This second code snippet showcases a more involved approach where we resize the image whilst maintaining its aspect ratio, and then we pad the image. This typically leads to better performance than just simple resizing.

Finally, let’s consider a more specialized case – using an FCN architecture and allowing the network to accept various sizes using an adaptive pooling layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def build_fcn_model(num_classes):
    """Builds a simple FCN model using an adaptive average pooling layer."""
    input_layer = layers.Input(shape=(None, None, 3))
    x = layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(input_layer)
    x = layers.Conv2D(128, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
    x = layers.Conv2D(256, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(x)

    # Adaptive pooling to resize output to a known size
    x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x) # Instead of using adaptive pooling explicitly, we use a global pooling

    # Output classification layer
    output_layer = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)

    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    return model

# Example usage:
model = build_fcn_model(num_classes=10)

# Input with varying sizes is now accepted
image_1 = tf.random.normal((1, 100, 150, 3))
image_2 = tf.random.normal((1, 200, 250, 3))
image_3 = tf.random.normal((1, 120, 120, 3))


output_1 = model(image_1)
output_2 = model(image_2)
output_3 = model(image_3)

print(f"Output shape for image_1: {output_1.shape}")
print(f"Output shape for image_2: {output_2.shape}")
print(f"Output shape for image_3: {output_3.shape}")
```

This final example shows how to create an FCN model using global average pooling. Here, the convolutional layers are capable of receiving an image of arbitrary size. The adaptive average pooling takes the variable-sized output from the last convolutional layer and generates a fixed-sized tensor. This strategy allows us to handle any input size, but it might not be optimal when local feature information is important.

For further reading and a deeper understanding of these concepts, I'd recommend delving into *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow et al., particularly the sections on convolutional networks and preprocessing techniques. For more specific information regarding image manipulation, the TensorFlow documentation itself and related research papers on data augmentation and image resizing are great resources. Additionally, papers on fully convolutional networks, such as the original FCN paper by Long et al. are very valuable. It's important to select techniques carefully, always keeping in mind the specifics of your data and the type of problem you’re trying to solve. Every strategy has its pros and cons.
