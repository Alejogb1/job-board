Okay, let's tackle this array manipulation issue. I've certainly seen my share of scenarios where efficient element removal and contiguous indexing were crucial, particularly in game development where continuous memory blocks are paramount for performance. There's no magic bullet, but rather a set of techniques that leverage the underlying mechanics of arrays, each with its own pros and cons. Let's break down the approaches I've often found myself using, complete with code examples.

The fundamental problem you're facing is maintaining a contiguous index space after deleting an element from an array. When you think of an array conceptually, it's helpful to picture a series of memory locations right next to each other. Deleting an item in the middle leaves a hole; if not handled correctly, you can end up with gaps in the index space or a 'null' element residing in the array.

Let's go through the common techniques, and you'll see why careful consideration of the context is vital.

**Technique 1: The Shift-Left Method**

This is probably the most straightforward approach, and I’ve used it countless times. The core idea is that after removing an element at index *i*, we iterate from *i+1* to the end of the array, moving each element one position to the left. This effectively overwrites the element at *i* and shifts all subsequent elements to the beginning of the 'hole'. This maintains the contiguous index, but it does have an inherent cost. It needs to physically move a number of elements in memory; therefore, time complexity increases linearly depending on the position and size of the array.

Here’s an example in python which i’ve found to be reasonably clear:

```python
def delete_element_shift_left(arr, index_to_delete):
  if index_to_delete < 0 or index_to_delete >= len(arr):
      return arr  # or raise an exception, depending on the requirements

  for i in range(index_to_delete, len(arr) - 1):
      arr[i] = arr[i+1]

  arr.pop() # reduce size of array by popping the last element
  return arr


# Example
my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_array = delete_element_shift_left(my_array, 2)
print(new_array) # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
```

In the provided example, we eliminate element `3` from the array, subsequently moving the element `4` into the `3`'s original location, `5` in to `4`'s original location and removing the last item in the array which was previously the location of the second `5`. This method is easy to understand and implement, but it can be slow when deleting elements near the beginning of a very large array.

**Technique 2: The Swap and Pop Method (or 'Last Element Swap')**

This is a more efficient alternative when the order of the array is not critical. Instead of shifting elements, you simply swap the element you want to delete with the last element in the array and then remove the last element which is now effectively a duplicate, and therefore, redundant. This minimizes the number of operations required and generally reduces runtime, as no shifting is required.

Here’s a python version that’s often faster in practical use:

```python
def delete_element_swap_pop(arr, index_to_delete):
  if index_to_delete < 0 or index_to_delete >= len(arr):
    return arr  # or raise an exception, depending on the requirements

  if index_to_delete != len(arr) - 1:  # Avoid swapping if it's already the last
    arr[index_to_delete] = arr[-1] # replaces the target with the final element

  arr.pop() # reduces the length of the array by removing the final element
  return arr

# Example
my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_array = delete_element_swap_pop(my_array, 2)
print(new_array) # Output: [1, 2, 5, 4]
```

In this example, to remove element `3`, we effectively replace it with element `5` and then delete the last element, keeping the array contiguous. The order changes, but the operation is much more efficient. Use this technique if element order is not important, or when an alternative data structure (such as a dictionary) is being used to manage ordering.

**Technique 3: Using a `deque` in Python**

Python's `collections.deque` provides efficient ways to add and remove elements at both ends of a 'list'. In some scenarios, particularly where there are frequent deletions and additions near the start, this can be preferable to a plain list because it is inherently optimised for this type of activity, although the implementation has memory overhead. While not strictly an array, it provides very similar functionality that suits certain situations and helps maintain order efficiently. It’s more efficient when there are frequent removals or insertions at both ends of a sequence.

Here’s how you would typically handle element deletion using `deque`:

```python
from collections import deque

def delete_element_deque(arr, index_to_delete):
    if index_to_delete < 0 or index_to_delete >= len(arr):
        return arr # or raise an exception

    deq = deque(arr)
    if index_to_delete == 0 : # removing from beginning of queue
       deq.popleft()
    elif index_to_delete == len(arr) -1: # removing from end of queue
        deq.pop()
    else:
        temp = [] # creating temp store for the non removed elements
        while(len(deq)>0 and len(temp)<index_to_delete): # loop to iterate to before the index
            temp.append(deq.popleft())

        deq.popleft() # remove the target

        while(len(temp)>0): # move the temp items back into the deque
             deq.appendleft(temp.pop())


    return list(deq)


# Example
my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_array = delete_element_deque(my_array, 2)
print(new_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
```

This example is slightly more complex than the previous two, but the advantage in performance is apparent where there are more frequent additions and removals across a list. The flexibility of deque is useful in several other common algorithms.

**Considerations and Further Reading**

The choice of technique depends on your specific needs, especially the size of your array and the frequency of deletions, as well as the importance of maintaining the order within the array. If you are repeatedly deleting elements from the beginning of a large array, using a linked list or a deque might offer superior performance. Always profile your code with realistic data if you need to make the right choice for your task, but these three examples should serve as useful starting points.

To delve deeper into the topic, I recommend starting with “Introduction to Algorithms” by Cormen et al., it provides a solid theoretical foundation on array operations and data structures. For a more implementation-focused view, “Effective C++” by Scott Meyers (if you work in C++) offers excellent practices for memory management and array handling. Additionally, the standard library documentation for whatever language you're using (like the Python documentation for lists and deques) are indispensable resources. They often clarify the exact behaviour and time complexity of various operations. Knowing the nuances of these operations can have a tangible benefit on a variety of algorithm designs.

I hope this has provided a useful overview. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions.
