alright, so you've got a situation with sinon stubs and static methods not playing nice across multiple files, i've been there, and it's a classic gotcha. let's break it down.

the core of the problem usually isn't with sinon itself, but more with how javascript (and most module systems in node.js) handles module caching and how static methods are bound to specific classes in memory. it's a bit of a dance of references and instances, and when the music stops, things can get confusing.

first, the basic issue we're facing is that node.js caches modules after they're first required. this means that if you have two files requiring the same module, they're getting the same *instance* of that module. that's normally good for avoiding memory leaks and keeping things efficient. but it also means that if we try to stub a static method on a class in one file, that stub affects only that specific version of the class object cached there, not necessarily everywhere else where the class is also imported.

let's say we have the following scenario.

file `my_class.js`:

```javascript
class myclass {
  static calculate(value) {
    return value * 2;
  }
}

module.exports = myclass;
```

and then file `file_a.js`:

```javascript
const myclass = require('./my_class');

function do_something_a(value){
   return myclass.calculate(value);
}

module.exports = do_something_a;
```

and also `file_b.js`:

```javascript
const myclass = require('./my_class');

function do_something_b(value){
   return myclass.calculate(value);
}

module.exports = do_something_b;
```

and we want to test `file_a.js` and `file_b.js`, here's a test example using mocha and sinon with `test.js`:

```javascript
const sinon = require('sinon');
const assert = require('assert');

const do_something_a = require('./file_a');
const do_something_b = require('./file_b');
const myclass = require('./my_class'); // important, more on that later


describe('my test', () => {
    it('should mock method on file_a.js', () => {
      const calculateStub = sinon.stub(myclass, 'calculate').returns(10);
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_a(2), 10, "should be using the stub method");
      calculateStub.restore();
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_a(2), 4, "should be using the original method");
    });

    it('should mock method on file_b.js', () => {
      const calculateStub = sinon.stub(myclass, 'calculate').returns(20);
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_b(2), 20, "should be using the stub method");
      calculateStub.restore();
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_b(2), 4, "should be using the original method");

    });
});
```

if you run that test, it seems that both are working but if you tried to do both in the same test block things will go south. we can show that like this:

```javascript
const sinon = require('sinon');
const assert = require('assert');

const do_something_a = require('./file_a');
const do_something_b = require('./file_b');
const myclass = require('./my_class'); // important, more on that later


describe('my test', () => {
    it('should mock method on file_a and file_b.js', () => {
      const calculateStub = sinon.stub(myclass, 'calculate').returns(10);
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_a(2), 10, "should be using the stub method");
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_b(2), 10, "should be using the stub method");
      calculateStub.restore();
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_a(2), 4, "should be using the original method");
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_b(2), 4, "should be using the original method");

    });
});
```
the problem with this is that if you try to add another test case for only `file_b.js` or only `file_a.js`, and using the stub, it will use the last stub used.

the main reason is that `file_a.js` and `file_b.js` uses the same reference of `myclass`. this is why the test seems to work when used isolated but will not when using both stubs in the same test block.

how have i seen this before? oh, plenty of times. i remember this one project, we were building this image processing pipeline, and we had a static method in a class responsible for some fancy color space conversion. the method would need to be mocked out in different test scenarios. at first, we tried to mock it out only once, and that blew our tests because other parts of the system weren't getting the stubbed version, it created a lot of confusion. it took a while to realize that module caching was the root cause there. it was like trying to catch a fish using two nets at different times, but the nets where in the same place but only on one try, it didn't work as expected.

there are a few ways to tackle this issue. first, the most common approach is to explicitly require the class module in your test file for the stubbing to work. the idea here is that if we directly `require` `my_class` into the test file we are using a reference that's used only in the test context, and that is what we are using to stub the methods of the class.

the other way is to mock out the module using a tool like proxyquire. that approach will not be needed in this case and will complicate the solution, but it's good to know that this alternative exists.

let me provide an example using the most common approach, this fixes the previous example:

```javascript
const sinon = require('sinon');
const assert = require('assert');

const do_something_a = require('./file_a');
const do_something_b = require('./file_b');
const myclass = require('./my_class');


describe('my test', () => {
    it('should mock method on file_a.js', () => {
      const calculateStub = sinon.stub(myclass, 'calculate').returns(10);
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_a(2), 10, "should be using the stub method");
      calculateStub.restore();
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_a(2), 4, "should be using the original method");

    });

    it('should mock method on file_b.js', () => {
      const calculateStub = sinon.stub(myclass, 'calculate').returns(20);
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_b(2), 20, "should be using the stub method");
      calculateStub.restore();
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_b(2), 4, "should be using the original method");

    });
});
```

the `myclass` was required directly in the test, it should work now with no problem.

i have used that approach for many years and it never failed me, but it's important to remember that it is an specific case of test case, but that problem shows up more often than what you think.

another solution is to use dependency injection and instead of requiring the `myclass` in the other files, pass the class as an argument to the function that needs it, this also forces you to think of code design when coding, an example:

`file_a.js`:
```javascript

function do_something_a(myclass, value){
   return myclass.calculate(value);
}

module.exports = do_something_a;
```
`file_b.js`:
```javascript

function do_something_b(myclass, value){
   return myclass.calculate(value);
}

module.exports = do_something_b;
```

and the new test case:

```javascript
const sinon = require('sinon');
const assert = require('assert');

const do_something_a = require('./file_a');
const do_something_b = require('./file_b');
const myclass = require('./my_class');


describe('my test', () => {
    it('should mock method on file_a.js', () => {
      const calculateStub = sinon.stub(myclass, 'calculate').returns(10);
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_a(myclass, 2), 10, "should be using the stub method");
      calculateStub.restore();
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_a(myclass, 2), 4, "should be using the original method");

    });

    it('should mock method on file_b.js', () => {
      const calculateStub = sinon.stub(myclass, 'calculate').returns(20);
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_b(myclass, 2), 20, "should be using the stub method");
      calculateStub.restore();
      assert.strictEqual(do_something_b(myclass, 2), 4, "should be using the original method");

    });
});
```

the dependency injection is the preferred way for testing since you are using different instances and are testing the function behaviour in isolation. this can be also a very valuable pattern to follow and will help a lot in the long run when dealing with complex software. but the first approach is faster to implement and will solve the problem, i have used that for years and only migrated to the other approach recently since it requires more effort. it's a matter of how much you want to invest in your software and how complex it will be in the long run.

as for resources, i'd recommend a couple of great reads. martin fowler's "patterns of enterprise application architecture" can be dense but it really changed how i viewed decoupling modules and objects, and the concept of dependency injection. for module caching and how it works on node.js, you have the official node.js documentation, just search for "module system". it explains the logic behind it and what caveats can be encountered. you have a few videos on youtube of module caching and that can help you understand visually how it works, also there are multiple articles online about the subject.

remember, javascript can feel a bit like a "choose your own adventure" sometimes. it's good to use this knowledge and experience to choose your right adventure, that's how you grow as a developer. i hope this explanation is useful and have fun testing.
