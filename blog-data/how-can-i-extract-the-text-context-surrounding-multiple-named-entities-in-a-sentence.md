Let’s delve into this. I've tackled this precise issue multiple times over the years, particularly when building information extraction pipelines for various projects involving large text corpora. The core problem, as you've posed, lies in efficiently identifying not only the named entities themselves but also the text segments that surround them, effectively providing the context necessary for further analysis. It's more involved than simply locating the entities; we need to understand their relationship to the surrounding words.

The approach that works best involves a combination of named entity recognition (ner) and clever text manipulation. We need to first identify the entities using an established ner library or model and then, based on the identified positions, carefully slice the original text to retrieve the surrounding context. Crucially, the definition of "context" is project-dependent; it might be a fixed number of words, a complete sentence, or even paragraphs. Let’s break down how to accomplish this in a systematic way.

First, we’ll focus on the ner component. I strongly suggest using a robust library like spaCy or transformers for this. SpaCy, for its ease of use and speed, is a solid starting point, while transformers offers state-of-the-art models but with a slightly steeper learning curve. My preference usually leans towards spaCy for quick prototyping and transformers when the accuracy needs to be exceptionally high.

Let’s say we're using spaCy. The workflow would be: load a pre-trained language model, process the sentence, and then iterate through the identified entities. For each entity, we can then define the surrounding context by accessing the appropriate slice of the document object. Here's a basic python code snippet showcasing this:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_context(text, context_size=5):
    doc = nlp(text)
    entity_contexts = []
    for ent in doc.ents:
        start_index = max(0, ent.start - context_size)
        end_index = min(len(doc), ent.end + context_size)
        context_tokens = doc[start_index:end_index]
        context_text = context_tokens.text
        entity_contexts.append({
          'entity': ent.text,
          'entity_type': ent.label_,
          'context': context_text
          })
    return entity_contexts

text_example = "Apple acquired a new AI company in San Francisco last week. This marks a significant move for Tim Cook’s company."
contexts = extract_context(text_example, context_size=3)

for c in contexts:
    print(f"Entity: {c['entity']} ({c['entity_type']}) | Context: {c['context']}")
```

In this example, `context_size` defines how many tokens around the entity to include. This simple example already gives a reasonable approximation of the surrounding context.

Now, what if our context needs to be sentence-based, not token based? This requires a slight modification, utilizing spaCy's sentence iterator. Instead of calculating token indices directly, we need to find the sentence containing the entity. Here’s an updated code snippet that achieves that:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_sentence_context(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    entity_contexts = []
    for ent in doc.ents:
        for sent in doc.sents:
            if ent.start >= sent.start and ent.end <= sent.end:
              entity_contexts.append({
                    'entity': ent.text,
                    'entity_type': ent.label_,
                    'context': sent.text
                })
              break
    return entity_contexts


text_example = "Apple acquired a new AI company in San Francisco last week. This marks a significant move for Tim Cook’s company."
sentence_contexts = extract_sentence_context(text_example)

for c in sentence_contexts:
    print(f"Entity: {c['entity']} ({c['entity_type']}) | Context: {c['context']}")
```

Notice how this snippet finds the entire sentence containing the entity, providing a richer context compared to fixed token windows. In most practical applications, this approach delivers more insightful contextual data.

Finally, consider a more intricate scenario where you might require a larger context encompassing multiple sentences before and after an entity. We could adjust the previous script to grab `n` sentences around our target. This gets more computationally intensive with large n values, so it's good to balance context with performance considerations:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_multi_sentence_context(text, context_sentences=1):
    doc = nlp(text)
    entity_contexts = []
    for ent in doc.ents:
      entity_sentence_index = -1
      for i, sent in enumerate(doc.sents):
        if ent.start >= sent.start and ent.end <= sent.end:
          entity_sentence_index = i
          break

      if entity_sentence_index != -1:
        start_index = max(0, entity_sentence_index - context_sentences)
        end_index = min(len(list(doc.sents)), entity_sentence_index + context_sentences + 1)
        context_sentences_list = list(doc.sents)[start_index:end_index]
        context_text = " ".join([s.text for s in context_sentences_list])

        entity_contexts.append({
            'entity': ent.text,
            'entity_type': ent.label_,
            'context': context_text
        })
    return entity_contexts


text_example = "Apple acquired a new AI company in San Francisco last week. This marks a significant move for Tim Cook’s company. The details of the acquisition are still unclear, but it signifies expansion."
multi_sentence_contexts = extract_multi_sentence_context(text_example, context_sentences=1)

for c in multi_sentence_contexts:
    print(f"Entity: {c['entity']} ({c['entity_type']}) | Context: {c['context']}")
```

This example demonstrates how to expand the context to include full sentences surrounding the one containing the named entity. This approach is helpful in understanding relationships between entities and ideas across sentences, though the computational cost can go up, especially for large values of `context_sentences`.

Several key considerations emerge from these experiences. First, always experiment with different values for context size. A fixed number of words might be adequate for some tasks but inadequate for others. Second, be aware of potential edge cases like entities located near the start or end of the text, as the context might be limited. Third, preprocessing the text by normalizing whitespace and handling special characters can improve accuracy and prevent unexpected behavior.

For a deeper dive into this area, i would suggest starting with "Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin. This offers a fantastic theoretical grounding in natural language processing, including named entity recognition and text analysis. Further, for an applied approach, familiarize yourself with the spaCy documentation and the specific implementation details related to entity recognition and text manipulation. "Natural Language Processing with Python" by Steven Bird et al. provides practical knowledge on text manipulation using various Python tools, although it might not be as up-to-date with the most modern deep learning-based approaches. Furthermore, researching papers related to specific ner models on platforms such as arxiv.org would also prove beneficial for a deeper understanding of how these models are trained.

In summary, extracting the context surrounding named entities effectively involves employing a combination of robust ner techniques and carefully orchestrated text manipulation. The 'best' approach is always context-dependent; experiment with token-based context, sentence-based context, and multi-sentence context as needed to achieve the goals of your task. Always start simple and gradually refine your method as the specific requirements of your project become more clear.
