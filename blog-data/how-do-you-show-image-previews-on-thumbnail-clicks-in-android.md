Alright, let’s delve into this. I've tackled image preview implementations more times than I can count, and it's a surprisingly nuanced area. The core issue, as you’re probably facing, is smoothly transitioning from a small thumbnail to a larger preview on demand, all while ensuring performance and a pleasing user experience. It’s not simply a case of enlarging the existing view; you need to handle loading, potential scaling, caching, and, of course, the transition itself.

My initial thought process usually goes straight to the image loading library, given how critical that component is. I recall one project, a photo-editing app from a few years back, where we were dealing with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of photos within a user’s gallery. A naive approach, loading full-resolution images for thumbnails, would have crippled the app instantly. That's where a library like Glide or Picasso becomes indispensable. They handle decoding, resizing, and caching images with remarkable efficiency. For this specific problem, they also simplify the asynchronous loading, which is crucial because we absolutely shouldn’t block the ui thread while getting images ready.

The general flow I'd recommend is: Display a grid (or list) of thumbnails using `RecyclerView` or a similar approach, and associate a unique identifier (typically the image uri or path) with each thumbnail view. When a thumbnail is clicked, use that identifier to load the corresponding full-resolution image in a separate preview view. We aim to animate the transition in a way that makes it feel fluid.

Let me demonstrate with three examples of how you could approach this problem, moving from a simple solution to more advanced ones:

**Example 1: Basic Transition with Image Loading**

This first snippet provides the foundational pieces. It doesn’t include animations or more advanced features but is a great starting point. Assume we have a `RecyclerView` adapter that binds image uris to an `ImageView` within each view holder.

```kotlin
import android.view.View
import android.widget.ImageView
import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
import com.bumptech.glide.Glide

class ImageAdapter(private val imageUris: List<String>, private val onItemClick: (String) -> Unit) :
    RecyclerView.Adapter<ImageAdapter.ImageViewHolder>() {

    class ImageViewHolder(itemView: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView) {
        val imageView: ImageView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.thumbnail_image)
    }

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ImageViewHolder {
        val view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context).inflate(R.layout.thumbnail_item, parent, false)
        return ImageViewHolder(view)
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ImageViewHolder, position: Int) {
        val imageUri = imageUris[position]
        Glide.with(holder.itemView.context)
            .load(imageUri)
            .into(holder.imageView)

        holder.itemView.setOnClickListener {
            onItemClick(imageUri)
        }
    }

    override fun getItemCount() = imageUris.size
}


// In your Activity or Fragment:
fun handleThumbnailClick(imageUri: String) {
    // Assuming you have an ImageView called 'previewImageView'
    Glide.with(this)
        .load(imageUri)
        .into(previewImageView)
    previewImageView.visibility = View.VISIBLE // Or animation code here
}
```

In this basic implementation, upon clicking a thumbnail, the selected image uri gets passed to the click handler, triggering the loading and display of the full-sized image. Crucially, the loading is handled by `Glide`, so it happens in the background.

**Example 2: Transition with Shared Element Animation**

This approach enhances the user experience by animating the image transition. We will use shared element transitions, which provides the illusion of a seamless transformation.

```kotlin
import android.app.ActivityOptions
import android.content.Intent
import android.os.Bundle
import android.view.View
import android.widget.ImageView
import androidx.core.view.ViewCompat
import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
import com.bumptech.glide.Glide

class ImageAdapter(private val imageUris: List<String>, private val activity: Activity) :
    RecyclerView.Adapter<ImageAdapter.ImageViewHolder>() {

    class ImageViewHolder(itemView: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView) {
        val imageView: ImageView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.thumbnail_image)
    }

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ImageViewHolder {
        val view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context).inflate(R.layout.thumbnail_item, parent, false)
        return ImageViewHolder(view)
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ImageViewHolder, position: Int) {
        val imageUri = imageUris[position]
        Glide.with(holder.itemView.context)
            .load(imageUri)
            .into(holder.imageView)

        holder.itemView.setOnClickListener {
            val intent = Intent(activity, PreviewActivity::class.java)
            intent.putExtra("image_uri", imageUri)

            val options = ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation(
                activity,
                holder.imageView,
                ViewCompat.getTransitionName(holder.imageView)!!
            )

            activity.startActivity(intent, options.toBundle())
        }

        ViewCompat.setTransitionName(holder.imageView, "image_$position")
    }

    override fun getItemCount() = imageUris.size
}

// PreviewActivity.kt
class PreviewActivity : AppCompatActivity(){
    private lateinit var previewImageView: ImageView

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_preview)
        previewImageView = findViewById(R.id.preview_image)

        val imageUri = intent.getStringExtra("image_uri")
        Glide.with(this)
            .load(imageUri)
            .into(previewImageView)
    }

}

```

Here, we create a shared transition between the thumbnail's `ImageView` and the `ImageView` within a separate activity (`PreviewActivity`). We need to set a unique transition name (`ViewCompat.setTransitionName`) and then pass this name in `ActivityOptions` object when starting the new activity. This gives a visually seamless and pleasant experience. The `PreviewActivity` simply loads and displays the image.

**Example 3: ViewPager for Gallery-Style Preview**

Finally, if you're looking for more of a gallery-like approach where users can swipe through multiple images, using a `ViewPager` (or `ViewPager2` now) becomes essential. This gives a swiping gesture to navigate between previews. This example would assume you have a full list of image uris.

```kotlin
import android.view.View
import android.view.ViewGroup
import android.widget.ImageView
import androidx.viewpager.widget.PagerAdapter
import com.bumptech.glide.Glide

class ImagePagerAdapter(private val imageUris: List<String>) : PagerAdapter() {

    override fun getCount() = imageUris.size

    override fun isViewFromObject(view: View, `object`: Any) = view == `object`

    override fun instantiateItem(container: ViewGroup, position: Int): Any {
        val imageView = ImageView(container.context)
        Glide.with(container.context)
             .load(imageUris[position])
             .into(imageView)

        container.addView(imageView)
        return imageView
    }

    override fun destroyItem(container: ViewGroup, position: Int, `object`: Any) {
        container.removeView(`object` as View)
    }

}

// In your Activity or Fragment:
fun showPreviewDialog(startIndex: Int) {
    val dialog = Dialog(this, android.R.style.Theme_Black_NoTitleBar_Fullscreen)
    dialog.setContentView(R.layout.dialog_preview)
    val viewPager = dialog.findViewById<ViewPager>(R.id.preview_pager)

    val adapter = ImagePagerAdapter(imageUris) // Assume imageUris is available
    viewPager.adapter = adapter
    viewPager.currentItem = startIndex

    dialog.show()
}
```

This shows a dialog using a `ViewPager`, providing the ability to swipe through the full list of images. The `ImagePagerAdapter` manages loading each image into an `ImageView` within the `ViewPager` on demand.

These snippets show different approaches to the problem, from simple to more complex.

For further exploration on this topic, I'd recommend looking into the following resources:

*   **"Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch:** While not strictly Android related, it covers vital aspects of memory management, which is highly pertinent when handling images.

*   **"Android Architecture Components" by the Google Android Team:** Official documentation on architectural components (like ViewModels and LiveData) which can help you manage the lifecycle of data while loading images.

*   **The Official documentation for Glide (or Picasso):** Each of these libraries has extensive documentation, covering specific best practices on image loading and caching. These official guides will greatly help on how to use the libraries effectively.

*   **"Advanced Android App Development" by Chris Haseman:** This book delves into more complex topics including custom view animations, offering a deeper understanding of how to implement a smooth and performant user experience.

In summary, showing image previews on thumbnail clicks involves more than simply displaying a bigger image. It's a mix of clever image loading techniques, careful consideration of performance implications, and the subtle, yet significant, transitions that enhance the user experience. Hope these examples give you a good starting point for your project, good luck!
