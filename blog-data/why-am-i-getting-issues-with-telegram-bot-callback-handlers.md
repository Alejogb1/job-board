Let's dive into why you might be encountering issues with Telegram bot callback handlers. I've certainly spent more than a few late nights debugging these exact scenarios in projects past, and it often boils down to a few common culprits, which, from my experience, tend to surface in surprisingly consistent patterns.

Firstly, and this is a big one, the asynchronous nature of webhooks combined with how you manage states within your bot can frequently cause problems. When a user interacts with an inline keyboard button (generating a callback query), that action triggers a webhook. Your bot needs to be ready to handle that query independently of any other ongoing operations. If your handler code isn't properly structured to account for this, you'll easily get into trouble.

For instance, let's say you're expecting a specific sequence of actions from a user. A common, albeit naive, approach is to hold user context within a global variable. Something like this, which I've sadly seen more than I’d like:

```python
# example 1: problematic state management (python)
user_states = {}

async def handle_callback_query(update: Update, context: CallbackContext) -> None:
    query = update.callback_query
    await query.answer()

    user_id = query.from_user.id

    if user_id not in user_states:
        user_states[user_id] = "waiting_for_first_response"

    if user_states[user_id] == "waiting_for_first_response":
       await query.edit_message_text("Please choose an option")
       user_states[user_id] = "waiting_for_second_response"
    elif user_states[user_id] == "waiting_for_second_response":
       await query.edit_message_text("Processing your choice...")
       del user_states[user_id] # clear state
```

The obvious issue here is that this dictionary `user_states` is shared across all concurrent requests. If two users click callback buttons almost simultaneously, you could easily get a user’s state being overwritten or used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior. One user's interaction could overwrite the context for another. This is obviously undesirable. This isn't hypothetical, I had a system that did precisely this, and it resulted in some, let’s say, *interesting* and confusing user experiences until the root cause was identified. I recall spending a good 2-3 hours tracking down the source of that one. It’s a lesson I've applied to future bot work, certainly.

The robust solution is to use persistent storage to maintain user states. This might involve a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a key-value store (Redis, Memcached). This avoids race conditions and allows you to reliably manage conversations. Using the `context` object, provided by libraries such as `python-telegram-bot`, to store per-user data in conjunction with persistence is a far superior option:

```python
# example 2: using context.user_data with persistence (python-telegram-bot)
async def handle_callback_query(update: Update, context: CallbackContext) -> None:
    query = update.callback_query
    await query.answer()

    if context.user_data.get("state") is None:
        context.user_data["state"] = "waiting_for_first_response"

    if context.user_data["state"] == "waiting_for_first_response":
       await query.edit_message_text("Please choose an option")
       context.user_data["state"] = "waiting_for_second_response"
    elif context.user_data["state"] == "waiting_for_second_response":
       await query.edit_message_text("Processing your choice...")
       del context.user_data["state"]
       context.dispatcher.persistence.flush() #save to persistent storage
```

Here, `context.user_data` offers a per-user dictionary where you can store conversational states. This is inherently safer, however, depending on your library, you need to ensure your persistence layer is configured and that you are committing the changes. The library `python-telegram-bot`, for example, requires you to explicitly commit by using `context.dispatcher.persistence.flush()`. Failure to do so will mean your state is only kept in memory, and won't persist.

Secondly, a common mistake that I've seen repeatedly is failure to correctly differentiate between callbacks. Each button click on inline keyboards sends a unique callback data string. It’s your responsibility to parse this string and determine what action the user is requesting.

Imagine a situation where you are using multiple inline keyboards, and you are only checking for one keyword or relying on substring matching. You’ll run into problems, this is another scenario I've witnessed several times. Instead, it is much more effective to adopt a unique callback data scheme. I find prefixing the action and encoding some form of relevant identifiers using a separator is quite effective. This leads to much cleaner and more understandable code. For instance, instead of just "details", the data could be "show_details|item_123".

Let's illustrate with an example, focusing on the data parsing:

```python
# example 3: robust callback data parsing (python)
import json

async def handle_callback_query(update: Update, context: CallbackContext) -> None:
  query = update.callback_query
  await query.answer()

  callback_data = query.data

  try:
     data = json.loads(callback_data)
  except json.JSONDecodeError:
     print(f"Failed to parse callback data: {callback_data}")
     await query.edit_message_text("An error occurred processing your request")
     return

  action = data.get("action")

  if action == "show_details":
    item_id = data.get("item_id")
    await query.edit_message_text(f"Displaying details for item: {item_id}")
  elif action == "add_to_cart":
    item_id = data.get("item_id")
    qty = data.get("qty")
    await query.edit_message_text(f"Added {qty} of item {item_id} to your cart.")
  else:
     await query.edit_message_text("Unknown action requested.")

# Example on how to create the data
def generate_button(action, item_id = None, qty=None):
    data = {"action": action}

    if item_id:
       data["item_id"] = item_id

    if qty:
      data["qty"] = qty

    return json.dumps(data)
```

Here, we use json to serialize and deserialize the data. This is more robust, and you can pass a richer data structure as opposed to just strings. We then parse the `action` from it, and, depending on the value, dispatch it. This approach greatly increases the maintainability and extensibility of your code.

Finally, make sure you're catching exceptions in your callback handlers. Any unhandled exceptions will result in your bot silently failing and potentially not responding to users. Always use `try...except` blocks to capture potential errors and log them, ensuring your users are informed of issues if they arise rather than just a bot silently failing.

To deepen your understanding, I would recommend several key resources. For a comprehensive explanation of asynchronous programming, "Concurrency in Go" by Katherine Cox-Buday is a fantastic resource, even if you're not using Go. The concepts are broadly applicable and provide a strong foundation. For a more Telegram-bot specific perspective, I highly suggest reviewing the official telegram bot api documentation directly, along with the documentation of the bot library you are using (such as `python-telegram-bot` or `aiogram`). The documentation for these libraries usually includes sections about state management, error handling, and working with callback queries. Understanding the specifics of your chosen library is critical for success.

In closing, a well-structured bot is key. It takes some care and patience to get right, but applying these techniques to the way you handle callback requests, paying attention to state management, properly parsing callback data, and carefully structuring your exception handling will substantially reduce the likelihood of these annoying problems. The time you take to set up your foundation correctly will be returned in the form of much simpler debugging in the long run, which, I can tell you, will prove to be a rather valuable investment.
