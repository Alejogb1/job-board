Right then, let's tackle the puzzle of mixing non-overlapping everygrams in a specific order. It’s a topic that resurfaces now and again, and I recall a particularly thorny project a few years back where we had to do precisely this for a real-time data visualization system. We were processing streams of information, and the need to represent categories with dynamically generated everygrams, without overlap and with a set sequencing order, presented quite the challenge.

For those unfamiliar, an “everygram” is simply a string containing every letter of the alphabet at least once. The "non-overlapping" constraint adds the complexity that no two everygrams share any common letters. Think of it like building with letter blocks – once a block is used, it's unavailable for another construction in the series. Now, ordering these non-overlapping sets introduces a layer of management, requiring a careful strategy to keep it computationally tractable.

The core issue here isn't just about generating the everygrams themselves – which, on its own, can be a decent exercise in algorithmic thinking— but rather how to efficiently manage their creation and their utilization in a specific sequence, while ensuring there is no overlap, all within a reasonable time. We are often working on datasets that are not static; therefore the system must be dynamic and able to respond to the changes.

The practical solution, at least in my experience, pivots around pre-calculating a set of unique everygrams. Then, we utilize a mapping or look-up system to fetch these predefined everygrams according to the desired order without having to generate them on the fly. The strategy boils down to effective pre-computation combined with a retrieval system. Let's examine this further, with some illustrative code examples.

First, let's consider how one might generate some everygrams. There are numerous ways to do this, but I've found that a recursive approach with backtracking can be both illustrative and surprisingly effective for smaller sets. The goal is to construct a unique string. This approach can be a little slower for very large sets; however, it is a solid starting point.

```python
def generate_everygram(available_letters, current_string=""):
    if not available_letters:
       if len(set(current_string)) == 26:
           return [current_string]
       else:
            return []

    results = []
    for letter in available_letters:
        remaining_letters = available_letters.replace(letter, '')
        results.extend(generate_everygram(remaining_letters, current_string + letter))

    return results

#Example usage - just for a demo, not for production scaling
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
everygrams = generate_everygram(alphabet)
print(everygrams[0]) # output will vary as generation is non-deterministic
```

Now, the problem with generating everygrams every time is that it can be inefficient, especially when you have a requirement for an ordered sequence. Therefore, pre-calculating a set and indexing them by some order becomes essential. Here's an example using Python that demonstrates this concept:

```python
import random

def generate_predefined_everygrams(num_sets):
  alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
  sets = []
  remaining_letters = list(alphabet)

  for _ in range(num_sets):
      current_set = ""
      current_letters = list(remaining_letters)
      random.shuffle(current_letters)
      for letter in current_letters:
        current_set += letter
      sets.append(current_set)
      for char in current_set:
        if char in remaining_letters:
             remaining_letters.remove(char)
      if not remaining_letters:
          break
  return sets

precomputed_everygrams = generate_predefined_everygrams(10)
print(precomputed_everygrams)

def get_everygram_by_order(index, precomputed_sets):
    if index < 0 or index >= len(precomputed_sets):
      return None
    return precomputed_sets[index]

ordered_everygram_1 = get_everygram_by_order(0,precomputed_everygrams)
ordered_everygram_2 = get_everygram_by_order(1, precomputed_everygrams)

print(f"The first everygram is: {ordered_everygram_1}")
print(f"The second everygram is: {ordered_everygram_2}")
```

This precomputed approach allows us to quickly retrieve the appropriate everygram, effectively decoupling the generation process from the retrieval process. In our earlier project, this decoupling proved crucial for maintaining system performance during high throughput periods.

However, what happens if we need to modify the sequencing dynamically? We can add a custom sorting strategy to the process:

```python
import random

def generate_predefined_everygrams_custom_order(num_sets):
  alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
  sets = []
  remaining_letters = list(alphabet)

  for _ in range(num_sets):
      current_set = ""
      current_letters = list(remaining_letters)
      random.shuffle(current_letters) # shuffle to achieve unique combos each time
      for letter in current_letters:
        current_set += letter
      sets.append(current_set)
      for char in current_set:
        if char in remaining_letters:
             remaining_letters.remove(char)
      if not remaining_letters:
          break
  return sets

precomputed_everygrams_custom = generate_predefined_everygrams_custom_order(10)
print(f"pre-computed unsorted: {precomputed_everygrams_custom}")

def get_everygram_by_custom_order(precomputed_sets, custom_sort_key):
    sorted_sets = sorted(precomputed_sets, key=custom_sort_key)
    return sorted_sets

def custom_sort_func(everygram):
    # example sorting by length in this case, but could be any arbitrary function
    return len(everygram)

sorted_everygrams = get_everygram_by_custom_order(precomputed_everygrams_custom, custom_sort_func)

print(f"Pre-computed with custom sorting {sorted_everygrams}")

```

This custom sort allows a layer of abstraction and customizability. In the production system I mentioned earlier, we were able to specify the sequence of everygrams based on a variety of factors such as the time the data arrived, a category index, or even by length. This technique of preparing the data and using look-up tables is invaluable in real-world scenarios.

For those diving deeper into this area, I highly recommend exploring the concepts of combinatorial generation outlined in Donald Knuth’s “The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4A: Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 1”. Furthermore, “Introduction to Algorithms” by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein offers foundational material on sorting and searching, which are vital for handling data lookups.

In summary, handling non-overlapping everygrams in a specific order isn't about generating everygrams continuously but about pre-calculation, intelligent indexing, and, when needed, using custom sorting functions to meet specific ordering criteria. This approach ensures efficiency, maintains control, and gives you the adaptability necessary when working with dynamic data. It might seem complicated initially, but with the right strategy, it becomes quite a manageable process.
