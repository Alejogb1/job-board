Alright, let’s tackle this. It's a question I've seen pop up countless times, and frankly, the elegant solution often lies just outside the immediate, conventional approach. I recall a project, back in the early days of Rails 3, where we had a complex product configurator, and pushing data back from the view to the model felt like… well, let’s just say ‘challenging’ is an understatement. So, let's break down how to capture form field data from a product view into a Rails model effectively, avoiding the common pitfalls.

The core issue is that the view’s html form elements aren't directly bound to the model in the way one might initially expect. You don't magically connect the `<input>` tag to a model's attribute. Instead, we utilize the power of Rails' form helpers and controller logic to mediate this transfer of data. The process involves routing the form data to a specific controller action, where we instantiate or find a model instance, and then update its attributes using the submitted parameters. It’s fundamentally about separating presentation from the application logic.

First, let’s consider a basic scenario. Imagine a ‘Product’ model with attributes like `name`, `description`, and `price`. In your view, typically within an ERB file, you'd use Rails’ form builder to generate the html:

```erb
<%= form_with(model: @product, url: products_path, method: :post) do |form| %>
  <%= form.label :name %>
  <%= form.text_field :name %>

  <%= form.label :description %>
  <%= form.text_area :description %>

  <%= form.label :price %>
  <%= form.number_field :price %>

  <%= form.submit "Create Product" %>
<% end %>
```

In this snippet, `form_with` generates the `<form>` tag. Critically, the `model: @product` part tells the form builder to expect data related to an instance of a Product model, typically from the `@product` instance variable set in your controller. The `:name`, `:description`, and `:price` within the form helpers like `text_field`, `text_area`, and `number_field` directly correspond to the attribute names of your Product model. The `url: products_path` points the form submission to the correct route and controller action. This form now generates HTML that, when submitted, sends data via HTTP parameters.

Now, in your controller, you’d have a corresponding action that handles this submission, usually the `create` action for a new product:

```ruby
# app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController

  def create
    @product = Product.new(product_params)
    if @product.save
      redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def product_params
    params.require(:product).permit(:name, :description, :price)
  end
end

```

The magic happens within the `product_params` method. This is where strong parameters are defined; essentially a whitelist of permitted attributes that can be updated on the `Product` model from the submitted form data, which are housed within the `params` hash. This is essential for security; without it, you'd be vulnerable to mass assignment vulnerabilities. The `params.require(:product)` ensures a `:product` key is present in the parameters and `.permit(...)` then specifies the allowed attributes.

The controller then uses these parameters when instantiating the new Product instance: `@product = Product.new(product_params)`. Upon successful save, the user is redirected and a success notice is displayed. Otherwise, the `new` form is re-rendered, showing potential validation errors.

Let's up the ante slightly. Suppose our product has associated options, say ‘size’ and ‘color’. Instead of attributes directly on the ‘Product’ model, we'll use a nested form and model, creating ‘ProductOption’ records linked to the ‘Product’. We'd need models with a has_many association:

```ruby
#app/models/product.rb
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :product_options, dependent: :destroy
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :product_options, allow_destroy: true
end
#app/models/product_option.rb
class ProductOption < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :product
end
```

Here's how your view might look, using the `fields_for` helper:

```erb
<%= form_with(model: @product, url: products_path, method: :post) do |form| %>
  <%= form.label :name %>
  <%= form.text_field :name %>

  <%= form.fields_for :product_options do |option_form| %>
    <%= option_form.label :size, "Size" %>
    <%= option_form.text_field :size %>

    <%= option_form.label :color, "Color" %>
    <%= option_form.text_field :color %>
  <% end %>

  <%= form.submit "Create Product" %>
<% end %>

```

The crucial piece here is `form.fields_for :product_options`. This renders a nested form area for each 'product_option', allowing you to capture data specifically for product options.

Then your controller action needs an update to permit those nested attributes, and deal with the new data.

```ruby
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @product = Product.new(product_params)
    if @product.save
      redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def product_params
    params.require(:product).permit(:name, product_options_attributes: [:id, :size, :color, :_destroy])
  end

end

```

Key additions here are in `product_params`: `product_options_attributes: [:id, :size, :color, :_destroy]`. This allows us to accept a hash of product options, with their respective attributes and the magical `_destroy` attribute, which enables us to delete associated records via checkboxes if they are rendered using `fields_for`. It is important to have the `:id` key included here as it will allow you to update existing options, rather than always creating new ones.

Finally, consider a scenario with dynamic form fields - maybe you want the user to add more options ‘on the fly’. This often involves a bit of JavaScript to add new form sections to the page. A good approach to manage such dynamic fields is through a combination of a partial and more javascript. I will not go into the javascript side here. Instead, I'll present a partial with the relevant Rails code.

```erb
# app/views/products/_product_option_fields.html.erb

<div class="nested-fields">
  <%= form.label :size, "Size" %>
  <%= form.text_field :size %>

  <%= form.label :color, "Color" %>
  <%= form.text_field :color %>
  <%= link_to_remove_association "remove option", f %>
</div>

```
And your main form:

```erb
<%= form_with(model: @product, url: products_path, method: :post) do |form| %>
  <%= form.label :name %>
  <%= form.text_field :name %>

  <div id="product-options-container">
    <%= form.fields_for :product_options do |option_form| %>
    <%= render "product_option_fields", f: option_form %>
    <% end %>
  </div>

  <%= link_to_add_association "add option", form, :product_options %>

  <%= form.submit "Create Product" %>
<% end %>
```

The important part of this code is the `link_to_add_association`. Assuming you have the `cocoon` gem installed, this will generate the HTML/javascript needed to dynamically add `_product_option_fields` to the page. The controller will remain the same as before.

To deepen your understanding, I'd strongly recommend looking into the following resources: *Agile Web Development with Rails 7*, which covers all these concepts in detail, along with *Effective Ruby* by Peter J. Jones, which emphasizes writing clean and efficient Ruby code. For a deeper dive into form management techniques, the Rails documentation itself is invaluable. These resources will solidify your grasp on not just the ‘how’ but the ‘why’ behind these approaches.

In conclusion, capturing form field data in Rails isn’t about directly linking HTML elements to your model. It's about understanding the flow of data—from view to controller, using form helpers and parameters. By controlling what data is permissible, and properly employing Rails’ features, you can create robust and secure applications. Remember, this was how we conquered that product configurator so long ago, and it remains a reliable strategy even today.
