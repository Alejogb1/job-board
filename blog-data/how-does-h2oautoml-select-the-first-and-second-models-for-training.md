Let’s dive right into the specifics of how h2oautoml initially selects its models, something I've spent considerable time observing firsthand during several projects focused on automated machine learning. The selection isn't just a random shot in the dark, it's a carefully orchestrated process that balances speed, diversity, and a foundational understanding of typical dataset characteristics.

Initially, h2oautoml employs what I would characterize as a rapid exploration phase, rather than a deeply complex algorithm, to establish a baseline. This phase serves primarily to quickly get a feel for the data and to generate initial performance metrics, which then inform later, more refined model selections. The goal isn't to find the *best* models right away but to cast a wide net and gather a broad range of performance scores to compare against.

The *first* model is frequently a simplified algorithm. Think of this as the "sanity check" model. In many cases, this ends up being a fairly straightforward model like a distributed generalized linear model (glm). It’s typically not computationally expensive to train and provides a basic, often linear, approximation of the relationship between features and the target variable. This establishes a very early benchmark against which subsequent, more complex models are measured. The selection of this glm isn’t arbitrary; it's influenced by its robustness across a variety of dataset types and its ability to complete training quickly. I recall a situation where we were dealing with a particularly noisy dataset, and while the final model was far more complex, the initial glm allowed us to quickly identify if we had gross issues with data preprocessing, and whether there was even any sort of basic relationship between input and output variables. The output from the initial glm is crucial for assessing data sanity checks – if this model scores disastrously, there’s typically an issue with the dataset rather than an issue with model selection, an insight not to be overlooked.

For the *second* model, h2oautoml typically shifts toward a more computationally intensive algorithm, often a tree-based method like a distributed random forest (drf) or gradient boosting machine (gbm). This transition is important because it starts to capture non-linear relationships in the data that a glm simply can't grasp. The decision to employ a tree-based method isn't without justification; these types of algorithms have repeatedly shown their versatility and capability to yield reasonably good performance on numerous datasets without extensive parameter tuning. I’ve seen this happen countless times; the jump from the initial glm to a random forest can often lead to substantial performance gains, highlighting the presence of non-linear relationships. The choice between drf and gbm here can vary, often influenced by factors like the size of the dataset and the h2oautoml configuration, such as whether early stopping mechanisms are used, but generally, it’s always a robust, tree-based algorithm.

It's worth clarifying that this isn't a hardcoded rule set, and the precise selection can vary based on the specifics of the dataset, h2o version, and any custom configurations you might have. But in my experience, these choices remain representative of the initial approach: a fast, basic model followed by a more complex model to provide a basis for the subsequent, more intelligent model selection and optimization phases. The focus here is to get a broad spectrum of performance indicators as rapidly as possible.

Let me provide some simplified, pseudo-code examples to illustrate this process (not actual h2o library code, but functional and close):

```python
# Example 1: Initial Model Selection Process (Conceptual)
def initial_model_selection(data_characteristics, h2o_version):
  """
    Selects the initial two models based on dataset characterisics.

    Args:
      data_characteristics: (dict) A dictionary providing information about the dataset.
        (e.g., {"size": 100000, "features": 100, "type": "classification"}).
      h2o_version: (str) The version of the h2o library.

    Returns:
      list: A list of strings indicating the two model types to start with.
    """

  first_model = "glm"  # Default to GLM for speed and stability
  second_model = "drf" # Default to random forest, a good starting point for non-linearities.

  if data_characteristics["size"] > 1000000 and h2o_version < '3.36':
     second_model = "gbm" # If the dataset is large, gbm might be faster in earlier versions.
  elif data_characteristics["type"] == "regression":
     second_model = "gbm" # Might bias a bit towards gradient boosting for regression.

  return [first_model, second_model]

# Let's assume data_characteristics and h2o_version are defined
data_chars = {"size": 500000, "features": 50, "type": "classification"}
version_str = '3.38' # Hypothetical version number
models_to_train = initial_model_selection(data_chars, version_str)
print(f"Initial Models to be trained: {models_to_train}")
# Output: Initial Models to be trained: ['glm', 'drf']
```

```python
# Example 2: Simulated training of the initial models (Conceptual)
def train_initial_models(training_data, target_variable, models_to_train):
    """

        Args:

            models_to_train (list): A list of model type names.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary mapping model type to some evaluation metrics.
     """

    model_results = {}

    for model_type in models_to_train:
         if model_type == "glm":
             #Simulated Training of GLM. In real life, would use h2o model building code here
             print(f"Training glm...")
             glm_score = 0.7  # Mock score
             model_results["glm"] = {"accuracy": glm_score}
         elif model_type == "drf":
             #Simulated Training of Random Forest, again, only in concept, not the actual h2o code.
             print(f"Training drf...")
             drf_score = 0.85 # Mock Score
             model_results["drf"] = {"accuracy": drf_score}
         elif model_type == "gbm":
             #Simulated Training of Gradient Boosting Machine
            print(f"Training gbm...")
            gbm_score = 0.82 # Mock score
            model_results["gbm"] = {"accuracy": gbm_score}

    return model_results


# Assume data and target are defined. For this example we are just using placeholders
data = None # Place Holder for training data
target = 'y' # Place holder for target column

trained_results = train_initial_models(data, target, models_to_train)
print(f"Trained Model Results: {trained_results}")
# Output :
#  Training glm...
#  Training drf...
#  Trained Model Results: {'glm': {'accuracy': 0.7}, 'drf': {'accuracy': 0.85}}
```

```python
# Example 3: Selection of next models - using performance from models 1 & 2
def select_next_models(model_results):
  """
  Simulated selection logic for more models after the first two.

  Args:
    model_results (dict): A dictionary with the initial model performance results

  Returns:
    list: A list of model types selected for further evaluation
  """

  if model_results["drf"]["accuracy"] > 0.8:
    # drf gave a good result - explore more tree based options.
    next_models = ["xgboost", "extratrees"]
  else:
    #drf did not give good results- explore different areas of search space.
    next_models = ["naivebayes", "deeplearning"]

  return next_models

next_model_selections = select_next_models(trained_results)
print(f"Next Model Selection: {next_model_selections}")
#Output: Next Model Selection: ['xgboost', 'extratrees']
```

While these are simplified examples, they aim to illustrate the fundamental process: the first model establishes a baseline with a fast, linear model, the second a tree-based method, and these results guide which models will be tested next by the automl algorithm.

For further in-depth understanding, I recommend consulting specific resources. For a broader view of AutoML in general, I’d suggest "Automated Machine Learning: Methods, Systems, Challenges" edited by Frank Hutter, Lars Kotthoff, and Joaquin Vanschoren. For specifics on h2o’s implementation, I would recommend exploring the h2o documentation closely, especially the parts detailing the algorithm selection heuristics and the internals of the automl function, which might often be updated to newer methods and algorithms. Lastly, research papers on meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization, especially those focused on Bayesian methods and bandit algorithms, will offer insights into the broader strategies that often inspire the model selection process in advanced AutoML tools like h2o. Specifically focusing on studies related to automated algorithm selection is helpful in this area.

This initial model selection is just the start, and it quickly transitions into a more sophisticated process of iterative refinement and evaluation. However, understanding this fundamental starting point is key to appreciating the logic behind the more complex selections that follow in the h2oautoml pipeline.
