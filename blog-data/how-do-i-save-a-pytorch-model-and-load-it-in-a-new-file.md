 I remember a particularly hairy project a few years back involving real-time object detection on embedded systems. The model training was done on a beefy server, but then we had to deploy it onto resource-constrained hardware. Saving and loading that PyTorch model efficiently and reliably became absolutely critical. I learned a few things along the way, and it’s a scenario many developers encounter.

So, you’re looking to persist your trained PyTorch model, allowing you to load it up in another script or even on a completely different machine, which is a common need. Essentially, you need to serialize the model’s state and architecture to disk, and then deserialize it when required. Let's break down the process.

The primary method for saving and loading models in PyTorch revolves around the `torch.save()` and `torch.load()` functions. The `torch.save()` function can serialize arbitrary python objects including our model’s state_dict.

The first approach, and arguably the most common, is saving and loading the model's `state_dict`. This `state_dict` is simply a python dictionary containing all learnable parameters of your model – namely, the weights and biases. The advantage here is that this method separates the model's architecture from the learned parameters, providing flexibility. You can create a different instance of the same model class, and load the saved state dict in that instance.

Here’s an illustrative example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple neural network
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the model
model = SimpleNet()

# Generate some dummy data and do a training run
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
for i in range(20):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  outputs = model(dummy_input)
  target = torch.tensor([1], dtype = torch.long)
  loss = criterion(outputs, target)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
#Save state dict
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "simple_net_state_dict.pth")

print("Model State dict saved successfully")
```

This piece of code defines a simple neural network `SimpleNet`, performs a few training steps, and saves the model’s `state_dict` into a file named "simple_net_state_dict.pth". It's crucial to note that this doesn't save the model architecture itself, but rather just its learnt parameters.

Now, let’s load it in a separate script:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the model architecture again
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x


# Instantiate the model and load saved state dict
loaded_model = SimpleNet()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("simple_net_state_dict.pth"))
loaded_model.eval() # important to set to eval mode for inference

#Testing to confirm loaded model
dummy_input_load = torch.randn(1,10)
output_loaded = loaded_model(dummy_input_load)
print("Loaded model output:", output_loaded)
```

Here, you will see that you have to re-define the `SimpleNet` class before loading the saved state dict. The `load_state_dict()` function is used to restore the model's weights and biases. The `loaded_model.eval()` is very important as this sets the model to evaluation mode, which disables training features such as dropout or batchnorm.

Alternatively, you can save and load the entire model object directly. This bundles both the model architecture and the parameters into a single file. While convenient, it's less flexible if you need to change the architecture later, or if you intend to load it on a different machine where there might be issues loading external libraries. Also, it makes the saved model slightly less portable. But this can be very useful and simple if that is your need. Here is how you do it.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple neural network
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the model
model = SimpleNet()
# Generate some dummy data and do a training run
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
for i in range(20):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  outputs = model(dummy_input)
  target = torch.tensor([1], dtype = torch.long)
  loss = criterion(outputs, target)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()

# Save the entire model
torch.save(model, "simple_net_entire.pth")
print("Entire Model saved succesfully")
```
Now let us see how we can load the model:

```python
import torch

# Load the entire model
loaded_model = torch.load("simple_net_entire.pth")
loaded_model.eval()
#Testing to confirm loaded model
dummy_input_load = torch.randn(1,10)
output_loaded = loaded_model(dummy_input_load)
print("Loaded model output:", output_loaded)
```

Here, you see that you don't need to define the model architecture when loading since the model object already includes that information in its structure. Note however, that you still need to set it in eval mode.

Which approach you use often depends on your workflow and requirements. If you foresee needing to make architectural changes without retraining, saving just the `state_dict` is more flexible. For simple scenarios, saving the entire model object is often quicker to set up.

Important considerations: when saving the model using `torch.save()`, ensure the save path is valid and you have write access. When loading, remember the model should be set to evaluation mode (`model.eval()`) if you're going to use it for inference and not training. Also, when sharing models with others, or deploying them, it's generally best to save and load the `state_dict` for greater control and portability.

For a deep dive into model serialization and best practices, I highly recommend reading through the official PyTorch documentation related to saving and loading models. Additionally, “Deep Learning with PyTorch” by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann provides comprehensive coverage of this subject. To truly understand the inner workings of model serialization, delve into the source code of the `torch.save()` and `torch.load()` functions in the PyTorch library; it can be illuminating. Finally, some excellent resources about software engineering around deploying ML models might shed some insight into the best practices of using these two save/load methods.

In closing, saving and loading PyTorch models are fundamental operations. Understanding both the `state_dict` approach and saving the entire model offers a solid toolkit to address diverse practical scenarios, from research and development to deployment and collaboration. The right method depends on your specific use case and priorities.
