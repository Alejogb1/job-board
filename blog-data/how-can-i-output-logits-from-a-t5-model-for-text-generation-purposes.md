Let's dive into this, shall we? It's a frequent requirement when you're working with sequence-to-sequence models like T5—accessing those raw, pre-softmax logits. It's far more common than folks new to transformers might initially think. I've certainly been there, many times, when I needed finer control over the generation process, or for purposes beyond just direct text output, like implementing custom beam search algorithms or employing techniques to explore model uncertainties.

The default behavior of the `T5ForConditionalGeneration` class, which you likely use, is to output text strings, sequences of token ids, or a `ModelOutput` object that already includes the decoded text. This is great for most cases, but not for us. We need to get our hands on those logits prior to the softmax function. Getting there does require a small adjustment in how you interact with the model. I'll walk you through how I generally handle it and provide a few practical examples.

The core trick lies in leveraging the `return_dict=True` and manipulating the `output_attentions` and `output_hidden_states` options, if needed, but *most importantly*, bypassing the usual `generate()` method when you need direct access to the logits. Instead, you use the model directly as a function. This might seem like a subtle difference, but it provides crucial flexibility. The `generate()` method is a high-level abstraction; bypassing it allows for granular control.

Here’s the general approach, focusing on the T5 model class:

1. **Load your Model:** You start by loading the pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer, as you normally would. Ensure that the tokenizer is paired with the model to ensure vocabulary compatibility.

2. **Prepare Your Input:** Input text must be tokenized and converted to the proper tensor format. Here, you'll use the tokenizer to encode your input string(s) into a suitable tensor representation.

3. **Direct Model Call:** This is the key step. Instead of calling `model.generate()`, you call `model()` directly with your tokenized input. This returns an output dictionary, not a string, or a decoded tensor of tokens.

4. **Accessing Logits:** Within the returned dictionary, the *decoder logits* are usually present under the key 'logits'. These are the unnormalized log probabilities produced by the final linear layer of the decoder prior to the softmax.

5. **Further Processing:** Once you have the logits, you can then perform further operations, like applying softmax to obtain probabilities or applying argmax to get the most probable tokens, or do whatever else you need to achieve your specific objectives.

Now, let’s illustrate with some code. I'll provide three examples, each with slight variations to illustrate the common situations you might encounter.

**Example 1: Basic Logit Extraction**

This first snippet is the most straightforward case. I'm assuming you want the logits for a single sequence.

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

input_text = "translate English to German: Hello, world!"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs, return_dict=True)
    logits = outputs.logits

print(f"Shape of Logits Tensor: {logits.shape}")
print(f"First Few Logits: {logits[0, :3, :5]}") # Showing first sequence, first 3 tokens and first 5 logit positions

# Note: no softmax was applied and they are the raw outputs of the linear layer.
```

In this example, `return_dict=True` is crucial. It ensures that the output is a dictionary, which facilitates easy access to the `logits` key. Notice how we disable gradient calculation using `torch.no_grad()`—we generally don't need to compute gradients for inference. The output shape you see will typically be `[batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]`. Here we are showing the first part of the logits tensor. The first dimension will be the number of sequences in our batch (1 in this case), second the sequence length and last the vocab size which will correspond to each token in your tokenizer.

**Example 2: Handling Multiple Sequences (Batch)**

Often, you're processing multiple sequences simultaneously. This example demonstrates that.

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

input_texts = [
    "translate English to French: How are you?",
    "translate English to Spanish: What time is it?"
]
inputs = tokenizer(input_texts, return_tensors="pt", padding=True) # Added padding

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs, return_dict=True)
    logits = outputs.logits

print(f"Shape of Logits Tensor: {logits.shape}")
print(f"First Few Logits of Sequence 1: {logits[0, :3, :5]}")
print(f"First Few Logits of Sequence 2: {logits[1, :3, :5]}")

```

Here, I've introduced a list of texts, which the tokenizer handles efficiently, also adding padding. The output tensor now reflects a batch size of two. Note the `padding=True` added to tokenizer. This is important in batching several inputs because every tensor must have the same length in a batch. Therefore, shorter sequences will be filled with pad tokens. The model automatically handles this padding appropriately.

**Example 3: Logits at Specific Decoding Steps**

This last example delves into the specific decoding step. This situation arises when working on an iterative decoding process such as beam search where you need the logits produced at each step. Because the model generates tokens autoregressively, we can modify the call slightly to access the logits for specific output token. In T5, this is achieved by passing target (output) tokens to the model.

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

input_text = "translate English to German: This is a test."
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Let's assume we have a starting token of "<pad>"
decoder_input_ids = torch.tensor([[0]])  # 0 is typically the <pad> id in T5
with torch.no_grad():
    # Get logits for the first decoding step
    outputs = model(**inputs, decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids, return_dict=True)
    logits_step1 = outputs.logits

print(f"Shape of Logits Tensor for Step 1: {logits_step1.shape}")
print(f"First Few Logits of Step 1: {logits_step1[0, :3, :5]}")
# Note that logits tensor for step 1 is [batch, 1, vocab_size]


# Let's assume that the first output token is the token with the id 1
decoder_input_ids_step2 = torch.tensor([[0,1]])
with torch.no_grad():
    # Get logits for the second decoding step
    outputs = model(**inputs, decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids_step2, return_dict=True)
    logits_step2 = outputs.logits

print(f"Shape of Logits Tensor for Step 2: {logits_step2.shape}")
print(f"First Few Logits of Step 2: {logits_step2[0, :3, :5]}")
# Note that logits tensor for step 2 is [batch, 2, vocab_size]. The last position are logits to predict next token


```
Here we are passing the `decoder_input_ids` to the model to access the logits of specific decoder tokens. This is important to get intermediate decoder states, as discussed. As you can see the shape of the logits tensor change as you generate more tokens, with the last position of the second dimension corresponding to the logits for predicting the next token.

**Further Learning**

For deeper understanding, I’d recommend focusing on these resources:

*   **The original Transformer paper "Attention is All You Need"**: Vaswani, Ashish; Shazeer, Noam; Parmar, Niki; Uszkoreit, Jakob; Jones, Llion; Gomez, Aidan N.; Kaiser, Łukasz; Polosukhin, Illia (2017). This sets the stage for all transformer based models like T5.

*   **The T5 paper “Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer”**: Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narayanan, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J. Liu (2019). Here you will find more about the specific T5 architecture.

*   **Hugging Face documentation**: Read through the T5 model and tokenizer class documentation in detail as well as the Transformers library in general. This documentation is constantly updated with new information and examples.

*   **"Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin**: A comprehensive textbook that provides a good foundation for NLP and concepts about tokenization and language models in general.

Remember to carefully align tokenizers and models and pay special attention to how sequence lengths, batching, and padding affect your logits. It's a powerful approach once you have a good grasp of the basics, enabling much more sophisticated interaction with these complex models.
