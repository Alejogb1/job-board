Alright, let’s tackle this. Updating a Unity UI element based on a two-parameter event isn’t terribly complex, but a clear understanding of the process is key to keeping your code maintainable and scalable. I’ve been down this road countless times, especially when dealing with inventory systems or complex UI interactions where a single event needs to convey more than just a simple trigger. We're talking, for instance, about something like a ‘item selected’ event that provides both the item's id and its display name. Instead of just having a boolean to tell us something changed, we need data.

The core idea revolves around using C#’s event system, specifically with `System.Action<T1, T2>` delegates when you need to pass two pieces of information. These delegates define the signature of the methods that will be called when the event is triggered. Let’s break this down, starting with establishing the event and publisher.

First, you’ll need a script where the event is raised. This script acts as the “publisher.” We will assume we are working with a script on a button that sends info about what was clicked. Consider the scenario where you have multiple items in a menu and want a click event to send the id of the item, as well as its display name to the UI.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using System;

public class ItemButton : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int itemId;
    public string itemName;

    public static event Action<int, string> OnItemClicked;

    private void Start()
    {
        GetComponent<Button>().onClick.AddListener(OnButtonClicked);
    }

    private void OnButtonClicked()
    {
        OnItemClicked?.Invoke(itemId, itemName);
    }
}
```

In this example, `OnItemClicked` is the event. Notice the signature: `Action<int, string>`. This indicates that the subscribers must have methods with two parameters—one an `int` and the other a `string`. We’re using the `?.Invoke` pattern to ensure the event is only triggered if there are any listeners, avoiding null reference exceptions. The start method adds a button click listener to this gameObject, so when this button is pressed, the OnButtonClicked() method is run. This runs the invoke and sends out the information.

Next, we need to create the "subscriber"—the script that listens for the event and updates the UI. This script will be attached to the gameobject with the UI element to be updated. Here's how you might set that up:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class ItemDisplay : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Text itemNameText;
    public Image itemImage; // Assume you have an image

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        ItemButton.OnItemClicked += UpdateDisplay;
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        ItemButton.OnItemClicked -= UpdateDisplay;
    }

    private void UpdateDisplay(int itemId, string itemName)
    {
        // This is where you would update the UI. For this example, we just update the text and placeholder image
        itemNameText.text = "Selected Item: " + itemName;
        //Placeholder to demonstrate we can use the itemID
        itemImage.color = new Color(itemId / 255f, itemId / 255f, itemId / 255f, 1f);

    }
}
```

Here, `UpdateDisplay` is the handler. Critically, it accepts an `int` and a `string` just as our delegate definition specified. In the `OnEnable` function, we subscribe to the event using `+=`. It’s crucial to unsubscribe using `-=` in `OnDisable` to avoid issues when the gameobject is disabled or destroyed. Failing to unsubscribe often leads to a common, and very hard to track down, error: the infamous "leaking subscriber problem". Your UI element will end up updating itself even if you have changed scenes or the object is no longer actively being used by the user.

Finally, let's look at an example of a different UI element being changed by another script, for instance one that displays a description of the item.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class ItemDescription : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Text descriptionText;

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        ItemButton.OnItemClicked += UpdateDescription;
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
       ItemButton.OnItemClicked -= UpdateDescription;
    }

    private void UpdateDescription(int itemId, string itemName)
    {
      // For demo we will have hardcoded data based on itemID
        switch(itemId)
        {
            case 1:
                descriptionText.text = "This item is a red item";
                break;
             case 2:
                 descriptionText.text = "This item is a blue item";
                 break;
             default:
                descriptionText.text = "Default item";
                break;
         }
    }
}
```

This example shows a different use case but the core implementation remains. The `ItemDescription` script has an `UpdateDescription` method that subscribes to the same `ItemButton.OnItemClicked` event, but manipulates a different UI element. This illustrates the flexibility of using events to communicate across scripts in your project, and also how you can send data and make each script that listens do something different with the same data.

Here are some considerations as you expand on this:

*   **Event Management:** If your game has a large number of events, it can become difficult to track which events are linked where. This is normal, but one of my methods for keeping track of all of this is keeping a single central class for event calls. Think of it like a traffic controller: one spot where I can look to see all of the potential calls, and what they mean. It helps with debugging and maintainability over time.
*   **Data Encapsulation:** Instead of passing individual parameters, you could use a custom `struct` or `class` to encapsulate the data and pass that as a single parameter (e.g., `Action<ItemData>`). This allows more complex data types to be managed, and as well, it also opens up the use of inheritance. Instead of always sending the specific classes of information, we could also make an inherited class and send that out as a base class, and then within the listening script, downcast it. This saves time down the line.
*   **Performance:** Be mindful of creating too many events. While the performance overhead of events is generally low, an excessive number, especially on a frequently triggered event, might cause performance issues, especially on lower-powered platforms such as mobile devices. Profile your application, and do not over optimize too early, and also remember to not underestimate the cost of a bad design pattern. Always look for other ways to accomplish tasks.
*   **Thread Safety:** Unity’s API must always be called on the main thread. If your event is potentially triggered from another thread (for example, if you're implementing networking or some heavy computation using threading), be sure to use `UnityMainThreadDispatcher` to execute any UI updates back on the main thread. I use coroutines in Unity frequently to get the same effect without introducing threads myself, so it's worth looking into the use of coroutines.

For further reading and a deeper dive into related concepts, I would strongly recommend taking a look at “Game Programming Patterns” by Robert Nystrom. This book dedicates a significant portion to patterns of event handling, and also addresses the wider issues of proper software architecture for game development. Also, the "Effective C#" by Bill Wagner has been indispensable over the years in clarifying how C# features should be implemented. This is not Unity specific, but the details covered in this book will help to solidify C# knowledge, and in turn, help you make better design decisions.

In my experience, using events effectively has been crucial for building robust and maintainable Unity projects. While this concept may seem initially basic, mastering these patterns opens up a host of possibilities for creating engaging and dynamic user interfaces.
