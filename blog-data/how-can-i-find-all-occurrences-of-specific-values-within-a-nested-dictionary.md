Okay, let’s tackle this. It's a problem I've certainly encountered more times than I'd care to admit, especially when dealing with complex configurations or data structures extracted from apis. The straightforward methods work well for simple cases, but things quickly become more intricate when nested dictionaries are involved, demanding a more systematic approach. This isn't just about finding a value once; it’s about efficiently locating *all* instances of a given value within the potentially labyrinthine structure of nested dictionaries.

My experience includes developing backend services for a now-defunct e-commerce platform. We relied heavily on hierarchical configuration files loaded as nested dictionaries. Debugging issues often meant having to sift through these to pinpoint specific settings, which is precisely where having robust methods for this type of search became crucial. We learned the hard way that brute-force approaches can be incredibly inefficient when dealing with even moderately complex structures.

The key, as is often the case, lies in recursion. Recursion allows us to effectively "walk" the dictionary tree, examining each key-value pair and delving deeper when a value is itself another dictionary. It avoids overly complicated iterative constructs and keeps the logic relatively clear. The essential function will check if the current value matches our target. If it doesn't, and if the value happens to be another dictionary, it recursively calls itself on that nested dictionary. It also maintains an accumulator to collect results, essentially a list of the full key paths where a specific value is found.

Here's the breakdown of a simple example implementation in python:

```python
def find_all_occurrences(data, target_value, path=None, results=None):
    if path is None:
        path = []
    if results is None:
        results = []

    if isinstance(data, dict):
        for key, value in data.items():
            new_path = path + [key]
            if value == target_value:
                results.append(new_path)
            elif isinstance(value, dict):
                find_all_occurrences(value, target_value, new_path, results)
    elif isinstance(data, list):
        for index, item in enumerate(data):
           new_path = path + [index]
           if item == target_value:
               results.append(new_path)
           elif isinstance(item,(dict, list)):
               find_all_occurrences(item, target_value, new_path, results)

    return results
```

Let’s walk through this. First, we initialize path and results with empty values if they are not provided by the initial call, allowing the function to be called easily by users. Then we check the type of the current data – it can be a dict or a list. If it's a dictionary, we iterate through its key-value pairs. We construct a new path by appending the current key to the existing path. If the value matches our target, we add the full path to results. If the value is itself a dictionary, we make that recursive call. If the data is instead a list, we iterate through it similarly. We return the accumulator list at the end.

Now, let’s illustrate it with a concrete example:

```python
nested_dict = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 1, 'e':{'f': 3, 'g':1}},
    'h': [1, {'i': 4, 'j':1},5]
}


occurrences = find_all_occurrences(nested_dict, 1)
print(occurrences) # Output: [['a'], ['b', 'd'], ['b', 'e', 'g'], ['h', 0], ['h', 1, 'j']]

occurrences = find_all_occurrences(nested_dict, 4)
print(occurrences) # Output: [['h', 1, 'i']]


occurrences = find_all_occurrences(nested_dict, 5)
print(occurrences) #Output: [['h', 2]]
```

This output clearly demonstrates how the function is able to locate all values irrespective of their nesting depth, including inside lists within a dictionary. The key here is that the path represents the full trajectory through the data structure to find that specific value.

Here's a more complex scenario, where we might want to find more specific information with a larger and more complex dataset:

```python
config = {
  "server": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "ports": {
        "http": 80,
        "https": 443,
        "custom": 9090
     }
   },
  "database": {
    "type": "mysql",
    "credentials": {
       "user": "admin",
       "pass": "securePassword"
    },
     "options":[
      {"key1":"value1", "key2": "value2"},
      {"key3": "value3", "key4":"value4"}]
   },
    "features":[
     {"name": "featureA", "status": True, "configuration":{"option1":123}},
     {"name": "featureB", "status": False, "configuration":{"option2":"abc"}},
       {"name": "featureC", "status": True, "configuration":{"option3":99}}
     ]
}


occurrences = find_all_occurrences(config, True)
print(occurrences) # Output: [['features', 0, 'status'], ['features', 2, 'status']]

occurrences = find_all_occurrences(config, 9090)
print(occurrences) # Output: [['server', 'ports', 'custom']]

occurrences = find_all_occurrences(config, "securePassword")
print(occurrences) # Output: [['database', 'credentials', 'pass']]

```

This demonstrates the effectiveness of recursive searching even in configurations that are deeply nested and hold various different types of data.

As you delve deeper into these kinds of problems, you might consider some resources. Firstly, I would highly recommend *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman. It’s a foundational text on programming that covers recursion rigorously. Another valuable resource, particularly for algorithms and data structures, is *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen et al., which provides detailed explanations and analyses of algorithms. For a more focused dive into data structures in Python, look at *Fluent Python* by Luciano Ramalho which has excellent coverage of working with dictionaries and other python data structures, and their usage in different scenarios. These texts helped significantly in solidifying my understanding of how to handle problems like these.

In closing, effective search within nested dictionaries pivots on utilizing recursion for a clean, efficient, and understandable solution. It's about navigating complex structures systematically, identifying the path to targeted data, and aggregating results for further processing or analysis. Keep in mind that path representation is not the only viable solution. Depending on your needs, you could represent the path as a string, or you could even return the value directly instead of the path. However, the essence of the problem remains the same: Recursively navigate complex structures to locate the desired information.
