Alright,  It's frustrating when your beautifully constructed airflow dag decides to only execute a single, solitary dummy operator, leaving all the others in a perplexed, un-triggered state. I’ve seen this happen more times than I care to count, and it usually boils down to a handful of common misconfigurations or misunderstandings. I’m not talking about simple typos here; these are more nuanced issues that can trip up even experienced developers.

The core problem you’re experiencing suggests that airflow's scheduler isn't recognizing the dependencies that should trigger other tasks. This isn't usually a bug in airflow itself, but rather an indication that the dag's definition isn't structured the way you intend. The crucial part to understand is that Airflow relies heavily on understanding task dependencies, and if these aren’t defined or interpreted correctly, it will execute only the tasks that are explicitly not dependent on anything else, frequently the dummy operator you've likely included as a starting point.

One of the most common culprits is incorrect or missing task dependencies. In airflow, you explicitly define how tasks relate to each other using operators like `>>` and `<<`, or `set_upstream()` and `set_downstream()`. These define the directed acyclic graph (DAG) airflow uses to determine the order of execution. A missing or incorrectly placed dependency can prevent downstream tasks from executing. It's like telling the system to bake a cake without outlining the proper order; if you don't define to mix before baking, it won't automatically happen.

Another area to examine closely is the handling of trigger rules within your tasks. Trigger rules determine under what conditions a task will execute, even if upstream dependencies are in states like skipped or failed. If, for example, all your downstream tasks depend on an upstream task succeeding, and that upstream task always fails, but does not have a trigger rule that accounts for that scenario, those downstream tasks will never be triggered.

I once had a particularly thorny situation involving a complex dag with dynamically generated tasks. These are tasks that are not pre-defined at dag load time, but rather created during the execution of the dag itself, based on external data. This was a process that involved reading from a database, generating a list of tasks and then passing the results as a dictionary. I kept adding to the result dictionary while in the loop, forgetting that the keys are immutable and causing the result to not update with the correct values. This made it seem like only the initial, non-dynamically generated tasks were running. My error was that I was using a string as a key that I was manipulating and didn’t consider how this immutable value would impact the rest of the process. The issue here wasn’t immediately obvious, and it took some focused debugging to discover the root cause, a subtle manipulation of a string based key that rendered the dynamic task generation ineffective.

Let's illustrate these common errors with some code snippets.

**Example 1: Missing Task Dependency**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def print_hello():
    print("Hello from task two!")

with DAG(
    dag_id='missing_dependency_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    task_one = DummyOperator(task_id='task_one')
    task_two = PythonOperator(
        task_id='task_two',
        python_callable=print_hello
    )
    # Intent is task_one >> task_two, but the relationship is missing here.
```

In this example, we’ve defined two tasks, `task_one` and `task_two`. However, there's no explicit dependency between them. As a result, airflow only schedules `task_one`, because it doesn't depend on any other task. `task_two` is left hanging, never triggered.

**Example 2: Incorrect Trigger Rule**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime
from airflow.utils.trigger_rule import TriggerRule

with DAG(
    dag_id='trigger_rule_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    task_one = BashOperator(
        task_id='task_one',
        bash_command='exit 1'  # Task always fails
    )
    task_two = DummyOperator(
        task_id='task_two',
        trigger_rule=TriggerRule.ALL_SUCCESS  # Defaults to this behavior.
    )
    task_one >> task_two
```

Here, `task_one` is designed to fail intentionally. `task_two` has a trigger rule that, by default, requires all upstream tasks (in this case, `task_one`) to succeed. Because `task_one` fails, `task_two` will never be triggered, and the dag execution appears to stop after the first task.

**Example 3: Dynamic Task Generation Issues (Simplified)**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def create_tasks(**kwargs):
    task_list = ['task_a', 'task_b', 'task_c']
    tasks = []
    for task_id in task_list:
        task = DummyOperator(task_id=task_id)
        tasks.append(task)
    return tasks

with DAG(
    dag_id='dynamic_tasks_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    start = DummyOperator(task_id='start')
    dynamic_tasks = PythonOperator(
        task_id='create_tasks',
        python_callable=create_tasks
    )
    # We're missing how to connect to created dynamic tasks in correct execution order.
    start >> dynamic_tasks # this doesn't connect start to the dummy operators.
    # This will lead to airflow only executing the start and create_tasks ops, and no dynamic ops.
```

This example, while simplified, showcases the common issue of creating tasks dynamically but not properly integrating them into the DAG's execution order. While the `create_tasks` operator generates new tasks, the dag doesn't know how to relate `start` to them, so only the initial `start` and `create_tasks` tasks will execute, leaving the dynamically generated operators in a dormant state. You can correct this by using a method such as passing results from the python operator to the next task, or using `TaskGroup`.

To further understand and avoid these issues, I would suggest investing time in studying foundational concepts through specific resources. Specifically, for a deep dive into airflow architecture and scheduling, I would recommend "Airflow in Action" by Marc Lamberti and "Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow" by Bas P. van der Ploeg. These books offer a comprehensive understanding of airflow's core concepts and best practices. Additionally, thoroughly understanding the official Airflow documentation, especially sections on DAG structure, task dependencies, and trigger rules, will greatly reduce troubleshooting time. Finally, it’s useful to investigate case studies of complex DAG designs, which are often presented in talks and workshops at data engineering conferences. These present real world scenarios and allow you to learn from the mistakes and successes of other experts in the field.

In summary, the root of your issue likely lies in how dependencies and trigger rules are defined in your DAG. Always double-check how tasks are connected, and be extra careful when dealing with dynamic task generation or conditional triggering. Carefully reviewing your dag, examining airflow's logs, and applying the foundational knowledge provided in the resources mentioned above should resolve the issue of having only your dummy operator execute.
