Let’s tackle this from a practical perspective. I've certainly faced this scenario multiple times throughout my career, and it usually comes down to understanding how Rails handles form data submissions. It's not inherently complex, but there are some nuances to be aware of. The core challenge, as you’ve posed it, is retrieving the checked values from a group of checkboxes as a clean, accessible array in our controller.

Essentially, when working with multiple checkboxes, Rails interprets the incoming form data as a series of parameters with the same name. What we need to do is instruct Rails to treat them not as individual parameters, but as an array. This is achieved using a specific naming convention in your HTML form.

Let's dive into how this is done, and I'll walk you through some specific examples using both basic form helpers and, in contrast, a slightly more controlled form setup. This should give you a robust understanding of what’s happening under the hood.

**Understanding the Underlying Mechanism**

The key is the syntax within the `name` attribute of your HTML checkbox elements. When you provide a name like `items[]`, Rails will collect all checked values associated with that name and automatically assemble them into an array when the form is submitted. The square brackets are doing all the magic here. Without them, only the last selected value for that parameter name would be kept and no array is formed.

**Example 1: Using Rails Form Helpers**

Let’s say you’re building a form to allow users to select specific categories for an item. In your view (`app/views/items/_form.html.erb`), you might have something like:

```erb
<%= form_with(model: @item, local: true) do |form| %>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :categories, 'Select Categories' %><br/>
    <% @categories.each do |category| %>
      <%= form.check_box :category_ids, {multiple: true}, category.id, nil %>
      <%= form.label "category_ids_#{category.id}", category.name %><br/>
    <% end %>
  </div>

  <%= form.submit 'Submit' %>
<% end %>
```

Here, `@categories` is an instance variable, likely populated by your controller, holding a list of categories. Notice the magic happens within the `check_box` helper call. The `:category_ids` is passed as the method and the `{multiple: true}` option instructs Rails to treat this as an array and `category.id` is provided as the value for the checkbox. `nil` is provided as the value for the unchecked box, and Rails will omit it from the array.

Now, in your controller (`app/controllers/items_controller.rb`), when you receive this form submission in the `create` or `update` action, you will find the selected ids in `params[:item][:category_ids]`, which will automatically be structured as an array, when checkboxes are checked. For example:

```ruby
def create
  @item = Item.new(item_params)
  if @item.save
    redirect_to @item, notice: 'Item was successfully created.'
  else
    render :new
  end
end

private
def item_params
  params.require(:item).permit(:name, category_ids: [])
end
```

Crucially, notice the `category_ids: []` in the `permit` call. This tells Rails to accept an array of integers for `category_ids`. Without this, Rails will reject these values due to strong parameter enforcement.

**Example 2: Manual HTML Form Element Construction**

You don't always need the rails helpers; direct HTML can be more controlled. This often comes into play when dealing with particularly complex form behaviors or custom UI/UX. Here is an example of this type of implementation within the same view:

```erb
<form action="/items" method="post">
  <div>
    <label>Select Options</label><br>
    <% @options.each do |option| %>
      <input type="checkbox" name="options[]" value="<%= option.id %>" id="option_<%= option.id %>">
      <label for="option_<%= option.id %>"><%= option.name %></label><br>
    <% end %>
  </div>

  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

Again, we see the `name="options[]"` usage. The significant difference here is the lack of the form helper; instead, we're directly creating the HTML element. This means that now in our controller, the data will be sent within the main parameters rather than within the `item` scope (as it was with the form helper). Here's how the controller will access it:

```ruby
def create
  @item = Item.new(item_params)

    if @item.save
        redirect_to @item, notice: "Item was successfully created."
      else
        render :new
    end

end

private

def item_params
  params.permit(:name, options: [])
end

```

This time, when we submit the form, the controller will receive data structured as `params[:options]` and that will already be set as an array. Note how in the `permit`, we directly request the `options` parameter, and once again specify the `[]` to receive an array.

**Example 3: Handling Pre-Checked Values**

Often, you need to pre-populate checkboxes from existing data, like in an edit form. This is a common scenario and one that requires careful attention to detail. Here’s an example that combines the Rails helper usage and the need to check some options based on an existing item:

```erb
<%= form_with(model: @item, local: true) do |form| %>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :tags, 'Select Tags' %><br/>
      <% @tags.each do |tag| %>
      <%= form.check_box :tag_ids, {multiple: true}, tag.id, @item.tag_ids.include?(tag.id) %>
      <%= form.label "tag_ids_#{tag.id}", tag.name %><br/>
      <% end %>
  </div>

  <%= form.submit 'Submit' %>
<% end %>
```

The most important aspect here is the fourth argument passed to the `check_box` helper. ` @item.tag_ids.include?(tag.id) ` checks if the current tag's id is present in the item’s already selected tags. If this condition evaluates to true, the checkbox will render as checked by default. Otherwise, it renders as unchecked. In our controller we would permit the `tag_ids` parameter:

```ruby
def update
  if @item.update(item_params)
    redirect_to @item, notice: 'Item was successfully updated.'
  else
      render :edit
  end
end

private

def item_params
    params.require(:item).permit(:name, tag_ids: [])
end
```

**Recommended Reading:**

To further your understanding, I suggest diving into these resources. They should help crystallize your understanding of the finer points of form handling and parameter sanitization:

1.  **"Agile Web Development with Rails" by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson:** This is a classic and essential resource for learning Rails in depth. It covers form handling and parameter usage very thoroughly.
2. **"The Rails 6 Way" by Obie Fernandez:** Another invaluable guide that delves into all aspects of Rails development. It provides very practical guidance and explores real-world applications of concepts.
3. **Official Rails Documentation:** Specifically, refer to the sections on form helpers and strong parameters. The official documentation is an ever-evolving, authoritative source for the latest practices.

The primary takeaway here should be that achieving this functionality relies less on complicated code tricks and more on understanding Rails conventions. By using the bracket notation in your checkbox names and properly permitting the parameters in your controller, you're set. The examples above should cover a majority of scenarios you'll encounter, whether you lean on Rails' helpers or not. And as always, be sure to refer to the resources listed for a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of these concepts.
