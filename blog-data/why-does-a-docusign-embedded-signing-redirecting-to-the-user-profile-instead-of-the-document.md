alright, so you're hitting that classic docusign embedded signing redirect snag, where instead of landing back at the document, users are getting bounced to their profile page. i've definitely been there, and it's usually a few common culprits. let’s break it down.

first, let’s talk about my experience, this isn’t my first rodeo with docusign. way back, probably 2015 when i was just starting out at a small startup, we had this clunky integration. we were embedding signatures using the docusign api, and for the life of me, some users would finish signing and end up staring at their own account page instead of our beautiful "success" landing. it was… frustrating. i spent days tracking down the error. it made me consider switching careers a few times. the worst was, it was intermittent; not every user, not every time, made it infinitely more complex to pin down. after lots of trial and error, i realised the devil was in the details of the return url.

the core problem is almost always tied to how you're configuring the `returnurl` parameter within your embedded signing request. docusign expects this parameter to point to the specific page where you want the user to land *after* they've completed the signing process. if it's incorrect, blank, or points to something unexpected, you’re going to have problems. the profile redirect is docusign's default behavior when this return url isn't properly configured or interpreted. think of it like a gps that lost its signal, instead of getting home you end up in the middle of nowhere.

here’s how we can typically resolve this issue.

1. **double check your `returnurl`**: verify that the url you're passing is absolutely correct and accessible. this includes making sure the domain, protocol (http or https), and path are all spot-on. also, take into consideration any url encoding issues, it's easy to miss. i cannot stress this enough i remember spending hours debugging one time only to find out i had included an extra space in a url. yes, a space!. you could also be using relative paths, but make sure these are properly resolved with your current web root or the docusign iframe won’t understand your instructions.

2. **session management**: if you’re using sessions to maintain state, make absolutely sure the session remains valid throughout the signing flow. if the session expires or it is invalidated for any reason, docusign may have trouble redirecting to the correct place. sometimes, there is a disconnect with cookies or some other session-related configuration. it may be useful to ensure your session configuration matches the needs of the integration, and also that the server-side session is also properly being updated.

3. **embedded signing configuration**: it's also good to review your docusign account settings. there might be configurations at the account level that are overriding your specified return url. docusign does have specific options to configure defaults, and they can sometimes get in the way of the functionality your application needs. double check the docusign admin settings to make sure there are no hidden surprises.

let’s get into some code snippets so we can get a good grasp on a typical scenario. remember, this is a generalized example, and you may need to adapt it to the docusign sdk/api you are using. i will be using pseudo-javascript here but you can translate it to your language of choice.

**example 1: simple embedded signing request (simplified)**

```javascript
function createEmbeddedSigningRequest(documentId, recipientEmail, recipientName, returnUrl) {
  const apiClient = new docusign.ApiClient();
  apiClient.setBasePath(your_docusign_base_path);
  apiClient.addDefaultHeader('Authorization', `Bearer ${your_access_token}`);

  const envelopesApi = new docusign.EnvelopesApi(apiClient);

  const envelopeDefinition = {
    emailSubject: 'please sign this document',
    documents: [{
      documentId: documentId,
      name: 'your_document.pdf',
      fileExtension: 'pdf',
      documentBase64: base64EncodedDocumentContent, //replace this with your base64 doc
    }],
    recipients: {
        signers: [{
            email: recipientEmail,
            name: recipientName,
            recipientId: '1',
            routingOrder: '1',
        }],
    },
    status: 'sent',
  };

    const results = await envelopesApi.createEnvelope(accountId, { envelopeDefinition });

  const recipientViewRequest = {
    returnUrl: returnUrl,
    authenticationMethod: 'email',
    clientUserId: '1', // must match the recipient's clientuserid
  };

  const viewResults = await envelopesApi.createRecipientView(accountId, results.envelopeId, { recipientViewRequest });

  return viewResults.url;
}
// usage:
const signingUrl = createEmbeddedSigningRequest(
    'your_doc_id',
    'user@example.com',
    'john doe',
    'https://your-app.com/signing-success',
);
```

in this example, pay close attention to the `returnUrl`. if it points to your profile page for any reason you have found the problem, double check that you have specified a valid url.

**example 2: handling the redirect on your application (simplified - javascript nodejs express)**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/signing-success', (req, res) => {
  // you can add custom logic here if required after a succesful docusign event
  res.send('congratulations! signing completed successfully.');
});
```

this is a very simple example of how you can intercept the successful return to your application by using `express` but the principle applies to any web technology. this is where the magic should happen and where you can give the user visual feedback, or whatever you need. make sure your return url in example 1 matches your endpoint in example 2.

**example 3: debugging approach using a console.log (simplified)**

```javascript
function createEmbeddedSigningRequestWithLog(documentId, recipientEmail, recipientName, returnUrl) {
 // ... (same api client and envelope definition as example 1)

 const viewResults = await envelopesApi.createRecipientView(accountId, results.envelopeId, { recipientViewRequest });
 console.log(`docusign signing url : ${viewResults.url}, returnurl : ${returnUrl}`);
 return viewResults.url;

}
// call with
const signingUrl = createEmbeddedSigningRequestWithLog(
    'your_doc_id',
    'user@example.com',
    'john doe',
    'https://your-app.com/signing-success'
);
```

this example helps you to be sure that the `returnurl` is correct. if it's not as expected you need to go back and check example 1 to see what is generating the url. debugging is often about being methodical.

some extra notes that can help you are:
*   **check docusign api documentation:** the official docusign api documentation is a goldmine, even if it can feel like a maze sometimes.
*   **look for community forums:** resources like stackoverflow or other docusign communities can offer insights from others who have faced similar challenges.
*   **read about oauth flows:** docusign heavily relies on oauth for authentication. understanding how tokens and refresh tokens work can be crucial for maintaining a robust integration. "oauth 2 in action" by justin richer and antonio sanso is a pretty good reference if you need to deep dive.
*   **be patient** the docusign api can sometimes behave in unexpected ways. take a deep breath, double check your setup and consider using a proper debugger to look into your code execution line by line, rather than relying on `console.log` alone. and, don't be afraid to ask for help!

i hope this helps you with your docusign redirect problem. i am sure that with these details, you will be able to get your user back on your app after they sign. good luck!
