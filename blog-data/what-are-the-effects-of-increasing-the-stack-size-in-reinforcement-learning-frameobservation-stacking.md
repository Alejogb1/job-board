Right, let’s tackle this. I’ve spent my fair share of time elbow-deep in reinforcement learning (rl) pipelines, and the impact of frame stacking on performance, specifically in relation to stack size, is something I’ve encountered quite a few times. It's definitely not a one-size-fits-all scenario, and the consequences of fiddling with stack size can be substantial, sometimes in unexpected ways. It's worth unpacking this piece by piece.

The fundamental idea behind frame stacking, or observation stacking as you rightly put it, is to provide an rl agent with a history of recent observations rather than just a single, instantaneous view of the environment. This is often crucial, especially in environments with partial observability. Imagine, for instance, learning to play pong using only a single frame of pixel data at any given moment. The agent might struggle to infer the direction and speed of the ball, since it lacks the temporal context.

Increasing the stack size, therefore, is effectively providing the agent with a longer temporal window. This has several direct effects. Firstly, it improves an agent's ability to perceive movement and velocity. Instead of seeing the ball in a single static position, the agent sees a series of positions, making it much easier to infer its trajectory. This increased perception of motion can significantly accelerate learning in dynamic environments. For environments where actions have delayed consequences, larger stack sizes might help agents associate actions with results that occur after a delay.

However, the benefits aren't unbounded. As the stack size increases, the dimensionality of the input state also grows linearly, which introduces a few challenges. One of them, particularly for neural network-based agents, is an increase in the computational burden. A larger input layer translates to more parameters to learn and more computations during both forward and backward passes. This can lead to slower training times and also increase the memory footprint of your model.

Furthermore, a large stacked state might introduce redundancy. Especially with pixel-based observations, there's often significant similarity between consecutive frames. Past a certain point, adding more frames doesn't really add much new information, and can make the learning process more challenging by essentially injecting noise or unnecessary complexity into the input space. The agent might also start learning dependencies between consecutive frames that are simply not helpful and can, in some cases, hinder the generalization capabilities.

Another subtle but important point is the increased likelihood of overfitting, especially if the training dataset is not sufficiently diverse. A larger input vector, as a result of larger frame stacking, gives the agent a greater capacity to memorize the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns, and this can decrease performance on unseen environments. It's essentially a more complex model to tune with the possibility of needing more regularization.

Let’s dive into some practical examples. I once worked on a project involving a simple car-racing environment where I had to control a vehicle using only pixel input. We started with a stack of just one frame. Learning was extremely slow, and the vehicle's behavior was erratic and unstable. The agent simply couldn't perceive the track well enough to make effective driving decisions. Then I gradually increased the stack size. We saw a significant boost in performance at a stack size of four. However, when pushing it further, to say eight or ten, gains were negligible and the training process became much slower. The increased compute cost, coupled with lack of significant additional benefit led to a decision to settle around a stack size of four. Here is some sample python-esque code to illustrate how a frame stacking approach would typically be constructed:

```python
import numpy as np

class FrameStacker:
    def __init__(self, stack_size, observation_shape):
        self.stack_size = stack_size
        self.observation_shape = observation_shape
        self.stack = np.zeros((stack_size,) + observation_shape, dtype=np.float32)

    def push(self, observation):
        self.stack[:-1] = self.stack[1:]
        self.stack[-1] = observation
        return self.stack

    def get_stacked_observation(self):
        return self.stack

# Example usage:
observation_shape = (84, 84, 3) # Example RGB observation
stacker = FrameStacker(stack_size=4, observation_shape=observation_shape)
observation = np.random.rand(*observation_shape).astype(np.float32)

stacked_obs_1 = stacker.push(observation)
print(f"Shape of stacked observation after 1 push: {stacked_obs_1.shape}")

stacked_obs_2 = stacker.push(np.random.rand(*observation_shape).astype(np.float32))
print(f"Shape of stacked observation after 2 pushes: {stacked_obs_2.shape}")
```

This snippet demonstrates a rudimentary implementation of a frame stacker. Notice how `push` function effectively shifts the stack to append the new observation. The stack maintains its set `stack_size`, in this case 4, thus ensuring a consistent input size to the agent.

Let's delve into another example. Consider an rl task using a discrete action space, like a simple game where the agent can move in four cardinal directions. In one iteration, I experimented with stacking encoded observation states instead of raw pixel data. These encoded states represented abstract environment states, not raw pixels. The environment emitted a 1-hot vector representing a tile the agent currently occupied, say, a grid of 10 x 10. With a stack size of 1, the agent had only access to its current location. Increasing the stack size provided the agent with its recent positional history.

```python
import numpy as np

class DiscreteStateStacker:
    def __init__(self, stack_size, state_size):
        self.stack_size = stack_size
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.stack = np.zeros((stack_size, state_size), dtype=np.float32)

    def push(self, state):
        self.stack[:-1] = self.stack[1:]
        self.stack[-1] = state
        return self.stack

    def get_stacked_state(self):
        return self.stack

# Example Usage:
state_size = 100  # 1-hot encoding
stacker = DiscreteStateStacker(stack_size=5, state_size=state_size)
state = np.random.rand(state_size).astype(np.float32) # Random 1-hot vector for example

stacked_state_1 = stacker.push(state)
print(f"Shape of stacked state after 1 push: {stacked_state_1.shape}")

stacked_state_2 = stacker.push(np.random.rand(state_size).astype(np.float32))
print(f"Shape of stacked state after 2 pushes: {stacked_state_2.shape}")
```

As seen in the example above, in this scenario, a stack size of 5 provides information about recent positional changes. This was beneficial for our agent’s policy convergence. However, as with visual input, there was a point of diminishing returns in terms of increased stack size.

Lastly, let me show a simplified example integrating it into a standard deep learning framework (though not training it). This should highlight how the stacked input would fit within a policy network:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SimplePolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_shape, num_actions):
        super(SimplePolicyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.flattened_dim = np.prod(input_shape) # Flattened input size
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(self.flattened_dim, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, num_actions)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(-1, self.flattened_dim)  # Flatten the stack
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return F.softmax(x, dim=1) # Action probabilities

# Example Usage:
observation_shape = (4, 84, 84, 3) # Stack size 4
num_actions = 4 # Example number of discrete actions
model = SimplePolicyNetwork(observation_shape, num_actions)
stacked_obs = torch.randn(1, *observation_shape)  # Example stacked observation (single batch example)
action_probs = model(stacked_obs)
print(f"Shape of action probabilities: {action_probs.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates a basic policy network designed to accept a stacked observation. It shows how the stacked input is flattened and used as an input into a fully connected layer of a basic neural network, ultimately outputting a set of action probabilities. As is readily seen, changing the stack size in the initial observation will have an impact on the architecture of the neural network since it will influence the `flattened_dim`.

For anyone looking to dive deeper, I’d recommend starting with the original papers on deep reinforcement learning like ‘Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning’ by Mnih et al. (2013), as well as David Silver's lectures on reinforcement learning. Another great resource would be Sutton and Barto's 'Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction', as it's considered a cornerstone in the field. Additionally, research papers on the impact of temporal context and sequence learning in deep learning, available in journals such as JMLR, are highly relevant.

In conclusion, selecting the optimal stack size is a matter of empirical exploration combined with a solid understanding of the environment being modeled. It's a hyperparameter that interacts with other aspects of the rl system, including the learning algorithm and network architecture. Start small, increment strategically and always validate your choices against real-world performance. This ensures you get the benefit of increased temporal context without the costs associated with overly large stacked observations.
