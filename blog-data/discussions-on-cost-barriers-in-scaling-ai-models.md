, so we're talking about the big money problem with scaling AI models, right? Like, it's one thing to train a little model for your project but when you want to make it huge, it's suddenly a whole other ball game. 

First off, the hardware. Training these big models needs tons of GPUs, we're talking racks and racks of them. Plus, you've got storage costs for all the data and the model itself. Think about it, you can't just train a model on your laptop, you need some serious infrastructure. 

Then there's the electricity bill, which can be a real killer. These models are computationally intense, so they eat up power like crazy. It's like, you need to be careful you're not running a power plant just to train your AI.

And don't forget the human cost. You need a whole team of engineers, data scientists, and researchers to work on these models, and their salaries can really add up. It's not cheap to keep all those brains busy. 

Now, let's look at a little example: 

```python
# A tiny example of training a model with PyTorch
import torch 

# Define the model
class MyModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(5, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Initialize model and optimizer
model = MyModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# Train the model (imagine this loop running for days)
for epoch in range(1000): 
    # Get data
    inputs, targets = ...
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    # Calculate loss
    loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(outputs, targets)
    # Backward pass
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    # Update weights
    optimizer.step()
```

This is just a basic example, but even this tiny model needs to be run for a long time to train properly. Imagine a much more complex model, maybe something with millions of parameters. You can see how the costs would explode.

So, the bottom line is that scaling AI models is expensive. It's not just the hardware and electricity, but also the human resources and the sheer amount of data needed.  It's a real challenge for the industry, but one that's being tackled by companies like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. We'll have to see what the future holds, but it's definitely an exciting time to be involved in AI!
