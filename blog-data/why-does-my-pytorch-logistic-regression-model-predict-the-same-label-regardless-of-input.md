Okay, let's tackle this. I've seen this particular issue with logistic regression models in pytorch quite a few times over the years, and it's almost always down to a handful of common pitfalls. You're getting consistent, unchanging predictions, which points to the model essentially ignoring the input features. It’s not learning, which means the output is always defaulting to some bias. Let's break down what's probably happening, and I’ll share some code examples from things I've actually had to debug.

First off, we can’t assume the model is inherently faulty. PyTorch’s core functionality for logistic regression is robust, so we should focus our investigation elsewhere. The root cause usually lies within one of three broad categories: data issues, poor initialization or optimization parameters, or a severely flawed model structure. Let's go through each of them in detail, because one of these is definitely the culprit for this consistent output.

**Data Issues:**

The first place I’d look is at the data itself. Specifically, are the input features scaled correctly? Logistic regression is incredibly sensitive to the scale of its inputs. If features vary drastically in their numerical ranges – say, some are between 0 and 1, while others are in the millions – the gradients calculated during backpropagation will be unbalanced. Those features with very high values can dominate the training process, effectively suppressing the influence of smaller ones. This leads the model to learn patterns from the dominant feature and, at the extreme, predict mostly on the basis of this and the bias. Often, I've seen that if one of the features is orders of magnitude greater than the rest, it pushes the weights associated with other features to virtually zero.

Secondly, consider whether you have insufficient data diversity. If you are working with binary classification, and all your training examples have highly similar or identical input features, then your model will have no variation to pick up on during training. Think of trying to identify different types of birds but only being shown different photographs of the same species of bird – you’d likely default to that species, or in the case of logistic regression, to the biased output. The model needs contrast to determine what leads to one label over the other. This lack of diverse data means there's nothing for it to learn from.

Lastly, check your labels. Are they balanced? Extreme class imbalance, where one label dominates the training set, can result in the model consistently predicting the majority class. It becomes the easiest path for the model, rather than learning actual feature relationships.

**Poor Initialization and Optimization Parameters:**

The second major category involves how your model is set up for training. Initialization matters a lot. If, for example, the weights are initialized to very small random values or even zeros, the model might get stuck in a local minimum of the loss function. This essentially freezes the gradient descent and the model becomes unable to learn. Furthermore, your learning rate could be too high. A learning rate set too high can cause gradients to oscillate wildly around the actual minimum. Alternatively, a learning rate set too low might also cause learning to be very slow or even not make substantial progress in reaching a suitable solution. Too high and it shoots over, too low and it doesn't move. Finding the balance is critical. Similarly, if you have a small batch size or not enough training epochs, you won't be giving the model the chance to converge on a useful decision boundary.

**Flawed Model Structure:**

Finally, it's worth considering whether the structure of the model is actually appropriate for the task. Logistic regression, while a powerful tool, is a linear classifier. It’s inherently suited for linearly separable data. If your data features have complex relationships with the target variable that cannot be represented by a straight line (or a hyperplane in multiple dimensions), it is highly likely that the model will fail to pick up on the underlying trends. In these scenarios, logistic regression will learn nothing other than the bias associated with your labels.

Now, let’s look at some code examples that should cover most of these issues, I’ve deliberately created problems to illustrate the point.

**Example 1: Data Scaling and Diversity**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Generate dummy data with some badly scaled features
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.concatenate([np.random.rand(100, 5), np.random.rand(100, 1)*10000], axis=1)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)


# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


# No Scaling
X_train_tensor_no_scale = torch.tensor(X_train, dtype=torch.float32)
X_test_tensor_no_scale = torch.tensor(X_test, dtype=torch.float32)
y_train_tensor = torch.tensor(y_train, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)
y_test_tensor = torch.tensor(y_test, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)


model_no_scale = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(6, 1), nn.Sigmoid())
optimizer_no_scale = optim.SGD(model_no_scale.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.BCELoss()

for epoch in range(1000):
  optimizer_no_scale.zero_grad()
  outputs = model_no_scale(X_train_tensor_no_scale)
  loss = criterion(outputs, y_train_tensor)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer_no_scale.step()


with torch.no_grad():
  test_preds = model_no_scale(X_test_tensor_no_scale)
  predictions = (test_preds > 0.5).float()
  acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
  print(f"Test accuracy with bad data {acc}")

# Now scale the data

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

X_train_tensor_scale = torch.tensor(X_train_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)
X_test_tensor_scale = torch.tensor(X_test_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)

model_scale = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(6, 1), nn.Sigmoid())
optimizer_scale = optim.SGD(model_scale.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(1000):
  optimizer_scale.zero_grad()
  outputs = model_scale(X_train_tensor_scale)
  loss = criterion(outputs, y_train_tensor)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer_scale.step()

with torch.no_grad():
  test_preds = model_scale(X_test_tensor_scale)
  predictions = (test_preds > 0.5).float()
  acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
  print(f"Test accuracy with scaled data: {acc}")
```
This example highlights what can happen with badly scaled data. As you will notice the model with non-scaled data will barely move and the predictions will be practically uniform. The model with scaled data will converge to something useful.

**Example 2: Learning Rate Issues**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)


X_train_tensor = torch.tensor(X_train_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)
X_test_tensor = torch.tensor(X_test_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)
y_train_tensor = torch.tensor(y_train, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)
y_test_tensor = torch.tensor(y_test, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)

# Model 1: High Learning Rate

model_high_lr = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(5, 1), nn.Sigmoid())
optimizer_high_lr = optim.SGD(model_high_lr.parameters(), lr=1.0)
criterion = nn.BCELoss()

for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer_high_lr.zero_grad()
    outputs = model_high_lr(X_train_tensor)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_train_tensor)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer_high_lr.step()


with torch.no_grad():
  test_preds = model_high_lr(X_test_tensor)
  predictions = (test_preds > 0.5).float()
  acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
  print(f"Test accuracy with high lr {acc}")


# Model 2: Low Learning Rate
model_low_lr = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(5, 1), nn.Sigmoid())
optimizer_low_lr = optim.SGD(model_low_lr.parameters(), lr=0.0001)
for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer_low_lr.zero_grad()
    outputs = model_low_lr(X_train_tensor)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_train_tensor)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer_low_lr.step()


with torch.no_grad():
  test_preds = model_low_lr(X_test_tensor)
  predictions = (test_preds > 0.5).float()
  acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
  print(f"Test accuracy with low lr: {acc}")


# Model 3: Correct Learning Rate

model_mid_lr = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(5, 1), nn.Sigmoid())
optimizer_mid_lr = optim.SGD(model_mid_lr.parameters(), lr=0.01)
for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer_mid_lr.zero_grad()
    outputs = model_mid_lr(X_train_tensor)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_train_tensor)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer_mid_lr.step()

with torch.no_grad():
    test_preds = model_mid_lr(X_test_tensor)
    predictions = (test_preds > 0.5).float()
    acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"Test accuracy with mid lr: {acc}")
```
This second example illustrates the impact of learning rates and how it can make the model unable to learn or learn incredibly slowly.

**Example 3: Insufficient Training Data**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(20, 5)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 20)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

X_train_tensor = torch.tensor(X_train_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)
X_test_tensor = torch.tensor(X_test_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)
y_train_tensor = torch.tensor(y_train, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)
y_test_tensor = torch.tensor(y_test, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)

model_insuf = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(5, 1), nn.Sigmoid())
optimizer_insuf = optim.SGD(model_insuf.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.BCELoss()

for epoch in range(1000):
  optimizer_insuf.zero_grad()
  outputs = model_insuf(X_train_tensor)
  loss = criterion(outputs, y_train_tensor)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer_insuf.step()


with torch.no_grad():
  test_preds = model_insuf(X_test_tensor)
  predictions = (test_preds > 0.5).float()
  acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
  print(f"Test accuracy with insufficient data: {acc}")
```

Finally, this third example shows how using too little data can stop a model from learning as there is insufficient variance in the data for the model to determine the correct features.

**Moving Forward**

For further understanding, I'd recommend studying the classic work on statistical learning, "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. They provide a detailed explanation of logistic regression and related concepts. Also, "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville offers a comprehensive exploration of gradient descent optimization and how it relates to training neural networks, which can be very helpful for even simple networks such as the one you are using. Understanding the mathematics of logistic regression, specifically the role of the sigmoid function and its relationship to probabilities, will also help in troubleshooting similar issues going forward.

In summary, when a logistic regression model predicts the same label, there's likely an issue with your data or how the model is trained. Check your feature scaling, ensure a diverse, balanced data set, tweak learning rates, increase epochs, and finally consider whether logistic regression is even appropriate for the data. I hope this clarifies the causes and provides some actionable steps for you to debug your problem!
