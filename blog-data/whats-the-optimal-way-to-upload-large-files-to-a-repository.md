Alright, let's tackle this. The "optimal" way, as with most things in engineering, isn't a single, universally applicable solution. It’s a balancing act of several factors: reliability, speed, resource consumption, and, crucially, the constraints of the system you're working with. I've personally been through the wringer with large file uploads on more than one occasion, especially back when I was developing a system for handling medical imaging data – believe me, those files can be *massive*. We quickly realized that the naive approaches simply wouldn't cut it.

The most rudimentary method is often a single, direct upload. While simple to implement, it's incredibly fragile for large files. A network hiccup, a brief server outage, or even a browser crash mid-upload can mean starting the whole process again from scratch. That's unacceptable when we're talking about gigabytes of data. So, the first vital step towards optimality involves breaking the large file into smaller, manageable chunks. This concept is known as chunking or multi-part upload.

The beauty of this technique lies in its fault tolerance and efficiency. If one chunk fails to upload, we only need to re-transmit that specific portion, not the entire file. This drastically reduces bandwidth usage and time spent uploading. This approach also has the advantage of facilitating parallel uploads, where multiple chunks are sent concurrently, leveraging modern network capabilities and increasing the overall throughput.

Here's a basic example using python and the `requests` library that illustrates the concept. This is a simplified version to convey the core idea:

```python
import requests
import os

def upload_chunk(url, file_path, chunk_size, chunk_number, offset):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        file.seek(offset)
        chunk = file.read(chunk_size)
        headers = {'Content-Range': f'bytes {offset}-{offset + len(chunk) - 1}/*'}
        response = requests.put(url, data=chunk, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise exception for non-200 status codes
        return response.status_code

def multipart_upload(url, file_path, chunk_size=1024 * 1024): # 1MB chunks
    file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
    offset = 0
    chunk_number = 0
    while offset < file_size:
       try:
           upload_chunk(url, file_path, chunk_size, chunk_number, offset)
           offset += chunk_size
           chunk_number += 1
       except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error uploading chunk {chunk_number}: {e}")
            # Implement retry logic here

    print("Multipart upload complete.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    #Replace with your actual upload url
    upload_url = 'https://your-upload-endpoint'
    #Replace with your actual file path
    file_to_upload = 'path/to/your/largefile.dat'
    multipart_upload(upload_url, file_to_upload)

```

Note that the `Content-Range` header is crucial, as it lets the server know which part of the file the chunk represents. The `requests.put` method is used, as PUT is ideal for replacing resources, which is essentially what we're doing with each chunk. Also important is the `response.raise_for_status()` call, which ensures we halt the process and handle errors if an upload fails. A real world system would have more sophisticated error handling and retry logic built in.

This brings me to another aspect of optimizing large file uploads - server-side considerations. The server needs to support the multi-part upload mechanism. This typically means implementing logic to collect all the file chunks in their correct order, reassemble them, and verify the integrity of the complete file. Many cloud storage providers offer APIs that handle this for you, like Amazon S3's multi-part upload feature. If you are handling the server side yourself, it will involve some form of buffer management or temporary storage.

Now, let's say we're dealing with a situation where server-side processing is also a bottleneck. Perhaps the server needs to do some computationally expensive operation on the uploaded file, such as image processing or media transcoding. In such a scenario, queuing mechanisms become invaluable. The server can receive the file and place it in a queue that allows asynchronous processing. This decouples the upload process from the processing logic, preventing the upload process from being held up. Message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka are well suited for this.

Here is a simple example showing how one could utilize rabbitmq for processing after the file upload. This is a very basic demonstration and does not include error handling.

```python
import pika, json

def publish_to_queue(queue_name, message):
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
    channel = connection.channel()
    channel.queue_declare(queue=queue_name, durable=True)
    channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key=queue_name, body=json.dumps(message), properties=pika.BasicProperties(delivery_mode=2))
    print(" [x] Sent %r" % message)
    connection.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
   file_info = {
       'file_path': '/path/to/uploaded/file.dat',
       'upload_time': '2024-02-29 12:00:00',
       'file_size': 1234567890
   }
   publish_to_queue('file_processing_queue', file_info)
```
Here, a message is published to 'file_processing_queue' which a worker process can later consume and begin processing. This allows the upload operation to complete quickly, decoupling it from the heavier operations. Note the `delivery_mode=2`, this ensures the message is persisted in the queue so it is not lost if the queue is restarted or the connection fails.

Finally, another important component often overlooked, is transfer protocol selection. Using http/https, while very common, is not always the most performant for large data transfers. Transfer protocols like WebDAV can offer benefits in terms of partial uploads and efficient handling of large data, as well as built-in support for file locking. In specific scenarios where webdav is appropriate, it can significantly improve large file transfers.

Here is an example of how you can use the library `webdav3` to upload files in chunks to a webdav server. Again, this is a simplified version to give you a basic example.

```python
from webdav3.client import Client
import os

def webdav_chunk_upload(server_url, username, password, local_file_path, remote_file_path, chunk_size=1024 * 1024):
    client_options = {
        'webdav_hostname': server_url,
        'webdav_login': username,
        'webdav_password': password
    }

    client = Client(client_options)
    file_size = os.path.getsize(local_file_path)
    offset = 0
    with open(local_file_path, 'rb') as file:
        while offset < file_size:
            file.seek(offset)
            chunk = file.read(chunk_size)
            client.upload_chunked(remote_file_path, chunk, offset=offset)
            offset += len(chunk)
    print(f"File uploaded to {remote_file_path} successfully")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    webdav_url = "https://your-webdav-server.com"
    webdav_user = 'your_username'
    webdav_pass = 'your_password'
    local_file = 'path/to/your/largefile.dat'
    remote_file = '/remote/path/largefile.dat'
    webdav_chunk_upload(webdav_url, webdav_user, webdav_pass, local_file, remote_file)

```
The `upload_chunked` method, within the webdav3 library allows you to control the upload process in a way that is not always possible with other protocols.

To summarize, achieving optimal large file uploads is not a single trick, but a combination of techniques. Chunking is indispensable, as it introduces fault tolerance and enables parallel uploads. Server-side considerations, like queuing mechanisms, are vital to preventing bottlenecks. Selecting appropriate protocols beyond http/https can also increase efficiency. And, of course, adequate error handling and retries are critical to ensuring a robust and reliable system. In terms of further learning, I'd recommend exploring the documentation for these technologies and reading academic papers on large data transfers, particularly those focused on distributed systems and network performance, as well as documentation for `requests`, `webdav3`, `rabbitmq`, and whatever libraries you are considering to use for your solution.
