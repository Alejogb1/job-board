,  It's a question I've encountered a few times, often in less-than-ideal initial setups. The short answer is: technically, no, Laravel Sail cannot function *without* php and composer. Let's unpack what's happening under the hood and why that restriction exists, based on some experiences I've had in project onboarding.

Sail isn't a standalone entity in that sense; it's essentially a pre-configured Docker environment specifically designed to simplify Laravel development. It relies on Docker to containerize your application and its dependencies, and that includes php and composer. Think of Sail as a facilitator, providing a standardized and repeatable environment. These elements are the core of a laravel application setup so it needs to be available as a baseline. It is important to first understand that Sail itself does not require php or composer to exist on *your host machine*. This is often confused, and this distinction is key.

My experience involved a project where we were trying to move to Docker completely. The team had a history of inconsistent local development environments, leading to those classic "it works on my machine" scenarios. The idea was to use Sail to enforce uniformity, but initially, there was some confusion about what needed to exist outside of the container. A few team members tried to skip installing php and composer on their local systems. This approach caused issues, and it was a great learning moment.

The problem arises because Sail uses `docker-compose` to manage the various containerized services. The `docker-compose.yml` file, created when you install sail, defines the services, including a container for your application which inherently includes php, and another for composer dependencies to build the project. The initial setup *does* involve creating the docker image based on your configuration and running `composer install` in that container during the project initialization to pull all needed dependencies. You'll notice this when running `sail up` the first time, or when adding new composer dependencies.

While php and composer aren't necessary to be on the host machine, they must be present in the *container* for Sail to function as designed. To put it another way, while you don’t necessarily install composer and php *locally*, sail takes care of this for you. These are used for project building on the docker container. Sail’s primary objective is to provide an abstraction layer over the complexities of configuring a Docker environment for Laravel. The underlying need for PHP and Composer remains, and Sail just abstracts away the configuration of that.

To further illustrate, let's consider three working examples:

**Example 1: The Initial Setup (No php/composer on host):**

Assume a scenario where a developer has a clean machine without php or composer. This is actually a typical use case for sail:

```bash
# Create a new laravel application named "my-app"
curl -s "https://laravel.build/my-app" | bash

# Navigate into the new app's directory
cd my-app

# Install Sail.
php artisan sail:install

# Bring the docker containers up.
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

In this scenario, no composer or php was used on the local machine after the initial curl. The `curl` command downloads the Laravel setup bash script that does not require existing php. This script creates a new Laravel project and then does the magic of installing sail. After sail is installed and run, docker is utilized to create the needed environment in the containers, including php and composer there.

During the `sail up -d` process, docker will download and build an image based on the Dockerfile defined in the sail configuration. This docker image includes php and composer and then `composer install` runs inside of this environment. The dependencies of your project get installed into the container, rather than on your local machine. It's not that they are not needed, but they are not needed *locally*. This effectively isolates the needed dependencies into the container, which is a core component of sail's design.

**Example 2: Adding a New Composer Package:**

Let's say you want to add a package to your Laravel application:

```bash
# Within the container, install a new composer package.
./vendor/bin/sail composer require laravel/passport

# Or you can use the sail command
./vendor/bin/sail composer require laravel/passport
```
Here, the `sail composer require` command forwards the composer instruction to the docker container, where composer and php exist. This shows how it abstracts these requirements from the host machine. Sail handles this by running the command in the docker container, which will run the composer require command in the container, updating composer.lock and the vendor directory. In this case, you are using the composer within the container without needed it on your local machine.

**Example 3: Running Artisan Commands:**

Many Laravel commands need php. These also are run inside the container.

```bash
# Inside the container, run an artisan command
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller Api/UserController
```

This also operates within the container, showing how php, artisan and composer are available through the abstracted sail setup. The command will get routed to the correct php binary within the container to execute the given command. This also illustrates the advantage of using sail. The required dependencies and programs are made available in the environment so that the application can operate as intended.

To understand this more deeply, I’d recommend diving into Docker and Docker Compose documentation, as well as the official Laravel Sail documentation. A book like "Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton is also useful for understanding the technical architecture and how Docker works under the hood. In addition, papers such as “Operating System Support for Docker Containers” by Felter et al. can offer very precise technical details on containerization and how it's related to this kind of architecture. Finally, “Modern PHP” by Josh Lockhart offers great insights on the modern ecosystem, and how composer fits into the mix.

So, while it might seem like Sail eliminates the need for php and composer altogether, it actually abstracts their usage into the containerized environment, keeping your local system clean. The primary goal is to standardize development environments across your team and reduce dependencies that are specific to a user's machine, allowing the application to be run in an environment that is the same for everyone. The core of sail is still based on the idea of using php and composer in the containers, therefore it is not possible to use without the availability of them in the container environment, and the application to function properly. It provides consistency, but it's important to grasp that the underlying dependencies are not removed, just moved to the containerized runtime.
