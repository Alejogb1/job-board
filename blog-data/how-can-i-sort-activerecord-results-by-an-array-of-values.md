Alright, let's delve into sorting ActiveRecord results by an array of values. It's a common challenge I've encountered numerous times, particularly when dealing with user-defined order preferences or specific data presentation sequences. Instead of relying on basic SQL `ORDER BY` clauses, which typically work with column values, we need a strategy to enforce a custom order derived from an array of IDs or other identifying attributes. The direct approach, looping and fetching individually, is generally inefficient and not scalable. We need to leverage the database's capabilities more effectively.

Now, the crux of the problem lies in transforming this desired order, expressed as an array in the application layer, into a SQL query that preserves that order within the database results. The key technique involves incorporating a `CASE` statement within our `ORDER BY` clause. Let's break down how this works and then I’ll show you some code examples. The `CASE` statement allows us to assign a weight or ranking to each of our desired order values, and we can then order by this weight.

First, consider the simple scenario where you have an array of integer ids and want to sort a table of models by this particular array sequence. The standard `order` method, without customization, won’t achieve this goal directly. The problem with merely passing an `order` clause like `order(id: my_array)` is that it treats the array as a simple value, usually leading to unpredictable results and rarely achieving the goal. We're not ordering by a 'value'; we’re ordering by a *specific sequence.* Therefore, we leverage a `CASE` statement as follows:

```ruby
def sort_by_array_of_ids(model_class, ids)
  case_statement = "CASE "
  ids.each_with_index do |id, index|
    case_statement += "WHEN id = #{id.to_i} THEN #{index} "
  end
  case_statement += "END"

  model_class.order(Arel.sql(case_statement))
end

# Example Usage
# suppose we have a model called "Product" and an array `[3,1,2,4]`
ordered_products = sort_by_array_of_ids(Product, [3, 1, 2, 4])

ordered_products.each do |product|
  puts "ID: #{product.id}"
end
```

Here, we dynamically construct a `CASE` statement. For each ID in the provided array, we assign a weight (the index of the element in the array). We then use this generated SQL statement with `Arel.sql` to ensure proper interpolation into our query. The database will evaluate the `CASE` statement and, by ordering according to the assigned weights, effectively sort results according to our array. In this first example, the resulting SQL is something like this: "ORDER BY CASE WHEN id = 3 THEN 0 WHEN id = 1 THEN 1 WHEN id = 2 THEN 2 WHEN id = 4 THEN 3 END". This translates to a sorting that corresponds to our initial ordering array.

Now, the above solution works but has a limitation – it assumes the `id` column is what you're sorting by. Let's examine a more flexible variant which is usable on other fields too and works with different data types, handling strings, for instance:

```ruby
def sort_by_array_of_values(model_class, attribute, values)
  case_statement = "CASE "
  values.each_with_index do |value, index|
    if value.is_a?(String)
      case_statement += "WHEN #{attribute} = '#{value}' THEN #{index} "
    else
        case_statement += "WHEN #{attribute} = #{value.to_s} THEN #{index} "
    end
  end
    case_statement += "END"

    model_class.order(Arel.sql(case_statement))

end

# Example Usage with string attribute "name"
ordered_categories = sort_by_array_of_values(Category, 'name', ['Electronics', 'Books', 'Clothing'])

ordered_categories.each do |category|
    puts "Category: #{category.name}"
end
```

In this function `sort_by_array_of_values`, I've introduced attribute as an argument, and string handling. We're no longer constrained to just using `id` for sorting. It checks if the value is a string or a number, formatting the `WHEN` clause accordingly to avoid SQL syntax errors. It might be that instead of sorting by IDs you want to sort by name or any other column. Also, handling of string data correctly to avoid possible errors is necessary when dealing with user-generated or varying data. In the second example, the SQL would look something like: "ORDER BY CASE WHEN name = 'Electronics' THEN 0 WHEN name = 'Books' THEN 1 WHEN name = 'Clothing' THEN 2 END".

Now, a concern you might have is that `CASE` statements can become quite large with many values, which might be less than ideal when performance is critical and for massive datasets. In such scenarios, depending on your database, there might be specific optimization options. For instance, with Postgresql, a temporary table containing our preferred order, and then joining and ordering based on that temporary table may prove to be faster than a giant `CASE` statement under certain conditions. This approach is database-specific, but worth investigating for very large or high-throughput systems. Here’s a quick example:

```ruby
def sort_by_array_of_values_with_temp_table(model_class, attribute, values)
  table_name = "temp_order_table"
  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #{table_name};")

  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(
      "CREATE TEMP TABLE #{table_name} (value TEXT, ordering INTEGER);"
  )

  values.each_with_index do |value, index|
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(
      "INSERT INTO #{table_name} (value, ordering) VALUES ('#{value}', #{index});"
    )
  end

  model_class.joins("INNER JOIN #{table_name} ON #{model_class.table_name}.#{attribute} = #{table_name}.value")
           .order("#{table_name}.ordering")
end


#Example Usage
ordered_items = sort_by_array_of_values_with_temp_table(Item, 'name', ['Chair', 'Table', 'Lamp'])
ordered_items.each{|item|
    puts "Item: #{item.name}"
}
```

In this last example, the code creates a temporary table named `temp_order_table`, populates it with the `values` and corresponding index, joins it with model table by attribute, and orders by ordering column. This approach is more database specific but can be more efficient under high-load or large-data scenarios. The trade-off is increased complexity. This method is generally less maintainable, and I would recommend using it only if profiling reveals that `CASE` statements are creating a significant bottleneck.

To enhance your understanding, I'd recommend delving into "SQL and Relational Theory: How to Write Accurate SQL Code" by C.J. Date, which provides in-depth knowledge on SQL principles. Also, for database-specific optimizations, reading through your database documentation (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) regarding ordering and temporary tables is invaluable. These resources will provide you with a more robust foundation for tackling more complex queries and performance issues.

Ultimately, choosing the correct sorting strategy involves considering the size of the dataset, the complexity of the desired ordering, and the performance needs of your application. The `CASE` statement is a great starting point, as it’s generally straightforward to implement and effective for most use cases. However, the temporary table approach or any other technique that is more specific to your database might give the extra edge you need, depending on your particular scenario.
