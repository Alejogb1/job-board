Alright, let's tackle this one. I remember a particular project, back when I was first getting deep into GUI development with Python and Tkinter. We were building a simple data visualization tool, and I had some post-processing code that stubbornly refused to execute after the main window was closed. It was frustrating, but it forced me to really understand the nuances of `mainloop()`. So, let's break down why this happens and how to manage it effectively.

The core issue stems from how Tkinter’s `mainloop()` function operates. It’s not just a call to display a window; it’s essentially a blocking loop that manages the entire lifecycle of the application's graphical user interface. Think of it as the central nervous system of your Tkinter app. When you call `root.mainloop()` (assuming `root` is your main Tkinter window), the program enters an event loop, constantly listening for and processing user interactions such as clicks, key presses, and window resizing events.

This loop is crucial because it's what allows your GUI to be interactive. While this loop is running, your main thread is essentially “stuck” inside this process, actively handling these UI events. Any code written after the `mainloop()` call will not be executed until this loop terminates. And that's the crux of the problem: when the Tkinter window is closed (typically by the user clicking the ‘X’ button), the `mainloop()` function exits. It's only *then* that the program's execution will continue sequentially from the line immediately after the call to `mainloop()`.

So, if you're hoping that some cleanup or post-processing code will execute *during* the time that the window is displayed, you're likely going to be disappointed. Tkinter’s event-driven nature dictates that code must be integrated within this event loop, typically through callback functions bound to specific events, or scheduled for later execution within the mainloop’s context. Direct sequential execution after `mainloop()` only happens *after* the UI window has ceased to exist.

Let's examine this with some illustrative code snippets. First, a basic example that demonstrates the problem:

```python
import tkinter as tk

def on_window_close():
    print("Window closed, this should appear after the GUI closes.")

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Simple Tkinter App")
label = tk.Label(root, text="This window will close eventually.")
label.pack(padx=20, pady=20)

root.protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", on_window_close)
root.mainloop()

print("This line appears after the window closes.")
```

In this snippet, the function `on_window_close` is called right *before* the `mainloop` terminates because it is bound to the `WM_DELETE_WINDOW` protocol, which is the event that happens when the window is being closed. Importantly, though, the line `print("This line appears after the window closes.")` only executes *after* `mainloop()` has exited, meaning the window is already closed.

Now, let’s imagine you want something to execute when a button is pressed, perhaps to save data before closing, here’s an example of that which uses a callback inside the main loop context:

```python
import tkinter as tk

def save_and_close():
    print("Saving data...")
    root.destroy()  # this is the preferred way to close in a callback
    print("Data saved and window closed.")

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Tkinter with Button")
button = tk.Button(root, text="Save and Close", command=save_and_close)
button.pack(padx=20, pady=20)

root.mainloop()
print("This line is never hit.")
```

Here, the `save_and_close()` function is bound as a callback to the button’s `command` attribute. Thus, when the button is pressed the code inside is executed within the mainloop before `root.destroy()` closes the window, causing the `mainloop` to exit. Any line following the `root.mainloop()` will not be executed because the application has effectively terminated after the window is closed, and there’s nothing to execute it. This is intentional and typical.

Lastly, let’s look at a case where you might want something to happen after the window closes, while still getting that callback functionality inside the main loop:

```python
import tkinter as tk
import time

def on_close():
    print("Window closing... Preparing for post-processing.")
    root.after(1000, run_post_processing)

def run_post_processing():
    print("Running post-processing after close.")
    time.sleep(2) # Example post process work
    print("Post-processing complete.")
    root.destroy() # Destroy the root

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Window with Post Processing")
label = tk.Label(root, text="Close to execute post-processing.")
label.pack(padx=20, pady=20)

root.protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", on_close)
root.mainloop()

print("This line is unreachable.")
```

Here, `on_close()` is called when the window’s close button is pressed, but *inside* the tkinter mainloop. Within `on_close()`, we are using `root.after()` to schedule the `run_post_processing()` method to run *later* after a 1000ms delay, this is a method for allowing some of the GUI to stay responsive while work is being completed. `run_post_processing()` is responsible for completing the “post-processing” work before ultimately calling `root.destroy()` which closes the application and the `mainloop` context. Again, this is all executed before `root.mainloop()` will terminate and the subsequent line of code is completely unreachable.

As you can see, the key takeaway is that to affect the behavior of your Tkinter application, you almost always need to operate within the mainloop's event handling system. Direct code execution after the `mainloop()` is for the clean-up of the application after termination, and is unlikely to be used in most typical UI application setups.

For a more in-depth understanding of Tkinter's event loop and its event processing model, I strongly recommend consulting "Programming Python" by Mark Lutz, which provides a very thorough explanation of Tkinter. Another very useful source is the official Tkinter documentation, which is quite comprehensive and can be accessed directly through Python’s built-in `help()` command. Also, the source code for Tk itself can be examined if one wishes to go down that particular rabbit hole to see the C implementations of what's going on here. Exploring the event binding mechanisms within the Tkinter library will also be extremely useful, particularly looking at `bind()` and `protocol()` and understanding the different event types that are available, and how those callbacks are managed.

In summary, the 'problem' isn't that Tkinter is failing; it's behaving exactly as it’s designed. Understanding this behavior will enable you to architect your applications to handle both user interactions and post-processing activities correctly, and is a foundational component of mastering GUI programming with Tkinter.
