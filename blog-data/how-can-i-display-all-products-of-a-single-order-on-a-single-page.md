Alright, let's tackle this. It's a common requirement, and the devil, as they say, is often in the details. From my experience, displaying order-specific product details on a single page usually involves carefully managing database relationships, crafting efficient queries, and structuring your frontend to present the data cleanly. In past projects, I’ve encountered similar needs, ranging from simple e-commerce platforms to more complex supply chain management systems. This experience has solidified the best practices I’ll share here.

The core challenge is usually threefold: retrieving the correct data, structuring it in a way that is consumable by the frontend, and presenting it in a user-friendly format. Let's delve deeper into each aspect.

First, database structure is key. Assuming a relational database model, you likely have at least three tables: `orders`, `order_items`, and `products`. The `orders` table stores overall order information (order ID, date, customer info, etc.). The `order_items` table acts as a junction table linking `orders` to `products`, and typically stores the quantity of each product in a specific order and its associated foreign keys (`order_id` and `product_id`). Lastly, the `products` table stores details about each product (name, description, price, etc.).

Retrieval hinges on a correctly crafted database query. You'll usually perform a join operation across these three tables, using `order_id` to filter by the requested order, and then collecting the necessary product information. Let's look at how that might appear in sql (postgres dialect, though it’s largely similar across databases):

```sql
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.name AS product_name,
    p.description AS product_description,
    p.price AS product_price,
    oi.quantity AS order_quantity
FROM
    orders o
JOIN
    order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN
    products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE
    o.order_id = :target_order_id;
```

Here, the `:target_order_id` placeholder will be replaced by the actual order ID you are targeting. This query will return a result set containing all the products linked to the specified order, along with their quantities. This result set can then be formatted for your application's use, typically as an array of objects.

Now, let’s illustrate this data retrieval with some code snippets in Python. I’ll use the `psycopg2` library to interact with a postgres database, but other database connectors would follow similar principles.

```python
import psycopg2

def get_products_for_order(order_id, db_connection_params):
    try:
        conn = psycopg2.connect(**db_connection_params)
        cur = conn.cursor()

        query = """
            SELECT
                p.product_id,
                p.name AS product_name,
                p.description AS product_description,
                p.price AS product_price,
                oi.quantity AS order_quantity
            FROM
                orders o
            JOIN
                order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
            JOIN
                products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
            WHERE
                o.order_id = %s;
        """
        cur.execute(query, (order_id,))
        results = cur.fetchall()
        column_names = [desc[0] for desc in cur.description]
        products = [dict(zip(column_names, row)) for row in results]
        return products

    except psycopg2.Error as e:
       print(f"Database error: {e}")
       return None

    finally:
        if conn:
            cur.close()
            conn.close()

# Example usage
db_params = {
    'dbname': 'your_database',
    'user': 'your_user',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'host': 'your_host',
    'port': 'your_port'
}

order_products = get_products_for_order(123, db_params)
if order_products:
  for product in order_products:
    print(product)

```

This Python snippet, `get_products_for_order`, takes the order id and database connection parameters as input. It executes the SQL query, fetches results and maps them to a list of dictionaries for ease of access, and then returns it. I've included an error handling block for robustness.

Another approach might involve an object-relational mapper (ORM), which would abstract away much of the raw SQL. Using SQLAlchemy with Python, for instance, simplifies database interactions:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey, Float
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base, relationship, sessionmaker

# Define the database connection string
engine_str = 'postgresql://your_user:your_password@your_host:your_port/your_database'
engine = create_engine(engine_str)

Base = declarative_base()

class Order(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'orders'

    order_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    # other order columns...
    items = relationship("OrderItem", back_populates="order")

class Product(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'products'
    product_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    description = Column(String)
    price = Column(Float)
    items = relationship("OrderItem", back_populates="product")

class OrderItem(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'order_items'
    order_item_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    order_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('orders.order_id'))
    product_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('products.product_id'))
    quantity = Column(Integer)
    order = relationship("Order", back_populates="items")
    product = relationship("Product", back_populates="items")

# Create the tables
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

def get_products_for_order_orm(order_id):
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()

    order = session.query(Order).filter_by(order_id=order_id).first()
    if order:
        products = []
        for item in order.items:
            products.append({
                'product_id': item.product.product_id,
                'product_name': item.product.name,
                'product_description': item.product.description,
                'product_price': item.product.price,
                'order_quantity': item.quantity
            })
        return products
    else:
        return None

    session.close()


order_products = get_products_for_order_orm(123)
if order_products:
    for product in order_products:
        print(product)
```

This second Python example, using SQLAlchemy, creates ORM models representing the database tables. The function `get_products_for_order_orm` fetches an order by its id, iterates over its associated order items, extracts product information, and returns a formatted list of dictionaries. This approach can be more manageable as your schema expands, allowing object-oriented access to database records.

Finally, regarding frontend presentation, the structured data (whether coming from the raw query or the ORM) can be rendered using the tools you're familiar with. In javascript (using a basic framework-agnostic example), it could be something like this:

```javascript
function displayOrderProducts(products, containerId) {
    const container = document.getElementById(containerId);
    if (!container) return;

    container.innerHTML = ''; // Clear previous content

    products.forEach(product => {
        const productDiv = document.createElement('div');
        productDiv.innerHTML = `
            <h3>${product.product_name}</h3>
            <p>Description: ${product.product_description}</p>
            <p>Price: $${product.product_price}</p>
            <p>Quantity: ${product.order_quantity}</p>
        `;
        container.appendChild(productDiv);
    });
}

// Assuming 'orderProducts' contains the results from one of the back-end methods:
// displayOrderProducts(orderProducts, 'products-container');

// Where HTML contains an element: <div id="products-container"></div>
```

This JavaScript snippet, `displayOrderProducts`, takes the product list and the target container ID. It iterates over products, dynamically creates HTML elements for each and appends them to the provided container, demonstrating a basic implementation.

To reinforce your understanding, I’d suggest delving into the following resources. For SQL fundamentals and advanced querying, "SQL for Smarties" by Joe Celko remains a classic. Regarding database modeling and design, "Database System Concepts" by Silberschatz, Korth, and Sudarshan provides an exhaustive treatment of relational and non-relational database systems. For Python web frameworks and ORMs, the official documentation of Django or Flask (with SQLAlchemy or Django ORM) provides in-depth information and practical guidance.

In summary, displaying order-specific product details involves a well-structured database, a precise query (or ORM interaction), and a well-designed front-end rendering logic. By mastering each of these aspects, you can handle this task effectively in most situations. Remember, it is less about finding an 'obscure' trick and more about proper application of the fundamentals.
