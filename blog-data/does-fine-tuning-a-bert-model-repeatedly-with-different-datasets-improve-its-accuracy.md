Okay, let's tackle this. From my experience, repeatedly fine-tuning a BERT model on different datasets doesn’t *automatically* guarantee improved accuracy. It's more nuanced than that, and I've learned this the hard way, through a few projects where I hoped for a linear improvement but encountered more of a rollercoaster. The key factors involve understanding the nature of your datasets, the kind of transfer learning you're implementing, and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Firstly, let’s consider what we mean by ‘accuracy’. Is it a global measure over some massive, all-encompassing dataset, or are we targeting specific tasks defined by our different training sets? BERT, pre-trained on huge quantities of text, has a general linguistic understanding. Fine-tuning then specializes that understanding for a downstream task. Imagine it as training a highly skilled carpenter, and then giving them specialized training in making kitchen cabinets. If you then try to further fine-tune them on building bridges, their kitchen cabinet skill might suffer, and they might not excel at bridge building either, if not done with careful consideration.

Now, if your various datasets are closely related, like sentiment analysis of product reviews across different product categories, then successive fine-tuning *could* be beneficial. In this scenario, each new dataset might add a marginal improvement in generalization, enhancing the model’s ability to understand nuanced sentiment across variations. However, there's no guarantee and it requires careful monitoring, as there’s always the risk of over-fitting.

Conversely, if your datasets are drastically different, like fine-tuning on movie reviews followed by medical journal articles, then the benefits become less predictable and more susceptible to performance regressions. In fact, a process like that often causes the model to overwrite prior learned representations, a phenomenon called "catastrophic forgetting" or "negative transfer." The model might become better at understanding medical text while losing some of its capability with general sentiment analysis.

Here's a practical scenario: Several years ago, I worked on a system designed to analyze customer support tickets. Initially, we had access to data from a single department. After fine-tuning BERT on it, the model was performing well for that domain. Subsequently, we integrated data from other departments, which used different technical terms and phrasing. Initially, it seemed adding more data would help. Instead, our model performance wavered quite dramatically. This isn’t uncommon. It highlighted the need to carefully evaluate the impact of each fine-tuning stage and ensure the model maintains the ability to perform well on previously seen data types.

Now, let’s look at some code snippets to illustrate different scenarios. The code examples will be using the pytorch-transformers library (now called transformers), which has become the standard for working with BERT and other transformers models. Keep in mind that it needs to be properly configured in your python environment.

```python
# Example 1: Sequential Fine-tuning on related datasets (potentially beneficial)
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
import torch

# Assume we have three datasets, dataset_a, dataset_b, dataset_c, each consisting of text and labels.
# These represent related domains such as different product categories for review sentiment.
# for demonstration purposes, dataset_a, b, c are dummy objects. In reality, these will need to loaded with your specific data.
class DummyDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts, labels, tokenizer, max_length=128):
      self.encodings = tokenizer(texts, truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=max_length)
      self.labels = labels

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
      item = {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()}
      item['labels'] = torch.tensor(self.labels[idx])
      return item

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.labels)


dataset_a_texts = ["This product is great.", "I did not like the item.", "Perfect for my needs."]
dataset_a_labels = [1, 0, 1] # 1 for positive, 0 for negative
dataset_b_texts = ["The service was horrible.", "I'm very happy.", "It works fine."]
dataset_b_labels = [0, 1, 1]
dataset_c_texts = ["I'm neutral on this item.", "Excellent value for money.", "Disappointing experience."]
dataset_c_labels = [2, 1, 0] # 2 for neutral

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=3) # Adjust num_labels for your dataset

dataset_a = DummyDataset(dataset_a_texts, dataset_a_labels, tokenizer)
dataset_b = DummyDataset(dataset_b_texts, dataset_b_labels, tokenizer)
dataset_c = DummyDataset(dataset_c_texts, dataset_c_labels, tokenizer)



training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=2,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset_a,
)

trainer.train()

trainer.train_dataset = dataset_b
trainer.train()

trainer.train_dataset = dataset_c
trainer.train()

# After each fine-tuning stage, evaluate performance and potentially adjust parameters
```

In the above example, we fine-tune the same model sequentially on dataset_a, then dataset_b, and finally on dataset_c. The hope here is that each dataset adds something useful for this specific task. Although the datasets are designed to demonstrate different categories within the sentiment domain, the actual impact would depend on dataset size and complexity.

Next up, let's see an example where the data isn't that related:

```python
# Example 2: Sequential Fine-tuning on unrelated datasets (potential catastrophic forgetting)
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
import torch

# Assume dataset_d is a dataset for movie review sentiment (same as above, in format)
dataset_d_texts = ["This movie is amazing!", "The plot is terrible.", "I enjoyed it a lot."]
dataset_d_labels = [1, 0, 1]

# Assume dataset_e is a dataset for classifying medical abstracts
dataset_e_texts = ["The patient presented with symptoms...", "The study concluded...", "Further research is needed."]
dataset_e_labels = [0, 1, 2]

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=3) # Adjust num_labels

dataset_d = DummyDataset(dataset_d_texts, dataset_d_labels, tokenizer)
dataset_e = DummyDataset(dataset_e_texts, dataset_e_labels, tokenizer)

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=2,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset_d,
)

trainer.train()


trainer.train_dataset = dataset_e
trainer.train()

# Evaluate performance on both sentiment classification AND medical abstract classification
```
Here, we fine-tune the model first on movie reviews, and then medical abstracts. It is likely the model, after being trained on medical abstracts, might perform poorly on movie reviews. This shows an example of catastrophic forgetting.

To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, one approach involves using techniques like *multitask learning* or *continual learning* strategies. These techniques aim to leverage all data at once or carefully introduce new data without forgetting previous tasks. We won't dive into implementations here for brevity. However, I can present a simple way to use an 'adapter' layer which provides a way to preserve prior learned representations, while adapting to a new dataset with much fewer learnable parameters.

```python
# Example 3: Fine-tuning with Adapter layers
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from transformers.adapters import PfeifferConfig, AdapterTrainer, AdapterConfig
import torch

# Use same datasets as example 2
dataset_d_texts = ["This movie is amazing!", "The plot is terrible.", "I enjoyed it a lot."]
dataset_d_labels = [1, 0, 1]

dataset_e_texts = ["The patient presented with symptoms...", "The study concluded...", "Further research is needed."]
dataset_e_labels = [0, 1, 2]

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=3)

dataset_d = DummyDataset(dataset_d_texts, dataset_d_labels, tokenizer)
dataset_e = DummyDataset(dataset_e_texts, dataset_e_labels, tokenizer)


adapter_config = PfeifferConfig()

# Adapter training for dataset d
model.add_adapter("d_task", config = adapter_config)
model.train_adapter("d_task")

training_args_d = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results_adapter_d',
    num_train_epochs=2,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
)

trainer = AdapterTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args_d,
    train_dataset=dataset_d,
)

trainer.train()

# Adapter training for dataset e
model.add_adapter("e_task", config = adapter_config)
model.train_adapter("e_task")

training_args_e = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results_adapter_e',
    num_train_epochs=2,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
)


trainer = AdapterTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args_e,
    train_dataset=dataset_e,
)
trainer.train()

# Evaluate performance of d and e
model.set_active_adapters("d_task") # to activate the d_task adapter
#Evaluate on set d, then set to e for evaluating on set e
```
In this last example, instead of directly fine-tuning BERT weights, we introduce *adapter* layers, which are lightweight modules added to the original model. We train separate adapters for dataset d and e respectively. This reduces the risk of the model forgetting how to perform well on dataset d, when training on dataset e.

In summary, repeated fine-tuning is not a guaranteed path to better accuracy. Carefully consider the relationship between datasets, be aware of catastrophic forgetting, and explore techniques like adapters, multi-task learning, or careful curriculum learning to achieve the desired improvement. For further study, I highly recommend delving into research papers on *continual learning* and *transfer learning with transformers* as a starting point. Also, the book *Natural Language Processing with Transformers* by Tunstall et al. (O'Reilly, 2022) is an excellent resource. Additionally, the original *BERT* paper by Devlin et al. (2018) is crucial for understanding the underlying architecture. Understanding the principles and limitations helps ensure more robust and reliable applications of these powerful models.
