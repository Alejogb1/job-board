Okay, let's unpack this. The question of why gcp's container scanning isn't *always* triggered immediately by artifact pushes is nuanced, and it's something I've dealt with firsthand in a few different projects. Back in my days at 'Cyberdyne Solutions' (fictional, of course), we ran into this exact issue when transitioning to a fully automated ci/cd pipeline. We'd push container images, expecting immediate security scan results, only to find they were delayed, sometimes significantly, and on occasion, not happening at all.

The first thing to understand is that gcp's artifact registry (formerly container registry) and container analysis are separate, asynchronous services. Container registry is primarily a storage solution, optimized for fast and reliable image storage and retrieval. Container analysis, on the other hand, is a security service focused on analyzing the contents of those images for vulnerabilities. These two services communicate via a pub/sub mechanism, which forms the core of the non-immediate trigger we're seeing. Think of it as an event-driven system, not a real-time, synchronous call.

When you push an image to the artifact registry, the registry doesn’t immediately initiate a scan. Instead, it emits a 'push' event to pub/sub. Container analysis subscribes to these events. When the container analysis service receives this event, *then* it schedules a scan. The delay you sometimes see comes from a combination of factors: the load on the container analysis service itself, the size and complexity of the image being scanned, and the processing queue within the service. If the service is under heavy load, your scan may end up sitting in a queue. The key point is that it's not a direct trigger, rather a queued message passing through asynchronous channels.

One crucial detail is that container analysis scanning is not triggered on every *tag* push. If you overwrite an existing tag with a new image, a scan won't be triggered because it’s the content of the manifest (identified by the image digest, not the tag) that initiates a scan. You can push different images, all pointed to the same tag over time, and only the first push of an image with a unique content would initiate scanning.

Here's a practical scenario: imagine you're pushing a base image `my-base-image:latest`, and then you build and push a modified image with some different application code to `my-app:latest`, which uses `my-base-image` as its base. It’s `my-app` that will be scanned at first push. If you subsequently rebuild and re-tag `my-app:latest` with *no* changes to its content, a new scan isn't triggered. Similarly, if you update `my-base-image:latest`, the change only affects images that subsequently use it in their builds. If `my-app:latest` has already been built, it will *not* be rescanned until it is rebuilt using the updated `my-base-image`. This design is for efficiency and avoiding unnecessary scans, but it can be confusing if not fully understood.

Another common misconception is that container analysis scans *only* when the image is used in a deployment. This is incorrect; scanning occurs based on artifact push events and the associated digests, regardless of subsequent deployment or lack thereof. The scans, however, are used by other services like the GKE security posture dashboards.

Let's dive into some code examples to illustrate this behavior and how to verify it.

**Example 1: Understanding Asynchronous Scanning**

This python script uses the google cloud sdk libraries to simulate pushing an image, and then demonstrates how you might verify if a scan has been triggered. Note that this is illustrative, and actual interactions with container analysis would require proper authentication and access setup.

```python
from google.cloud import containeranalysis_v1 as containeranalysis
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

# Assume image_name and project_id are defined elsewhere
project_id = 'my-gcp-project'
image_name = 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-gcp-project/my-repo/my-image:latest'

# Setup container analysis client
client = containeranalysis.ContainerAnalysisClient()
note_name = "projects/my-gcp-project/notes/image-scan-note"

def check_vulnerability_scan(image_digest, project_id):
  """Checks if vulnerability scan exists for the given digest."""
  resource_uri = f'https://{image_name}@{image_digest}' #Note image digest is part of this string.
  request = containeranalysis.ListOccurrencesRequest(
        parent = f'projects/{project_id}',
        filter=f'kind="VULNERABILITY" AND resourceUrl="{resource_uri}"')
  response = client.list_occurrences(request=request)
  if response.occurrences:
     print("Vulnerability Scan Found!")
     for occurrence in response.occurrences:
       print(occurrence)
  else:
     print("No Vulnerability Scan found.")

def get_image_digest():
   #This is placeholder. In real production environment, retrieve digest after image push
  return "sha256:6738e671eb554d1446206b257078a7d60d8ff488e13f1b6a931d8b5b1d7c560a" # Example Digest

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(f"Pushing image: {image_name}")
    # Simulate a push. This would involve actual docker push commands.
    # For our example, we'll just print and get digest.
    print(f"Image pushed successfully. Gathering image digest")
    image_digest = get_image_digest()
    print(f"Image digest: {image_digest}")
    #Now check for scan event
    check_vulnerability_scan(image_digest,project_id)
    print("Note: It may take a few minutes for scan to complete.")
```

**Example 2: Triggering Scan After Image Updates**
This python snippet demonstrates how a change of the content triggers the analysis again.
```python
from google.cloud import containeranalysis_v1 as containeranalysis

# Assume image_name and project_id are defined elsewhere
project_id = 'my-gcp-project'
image_name = 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-gcp-project/my-repo/my-image:latest'


# Setup container analysis client
client = containeranalysis.ContainerAnalysisClient()
note_name = "projects/my-gcp-project/notes/image-scan-note"

def check_vulnerability_scan(image_digest, project_id):
  """Checks if vulnerability scan exists for the given digest."""
  resource_uri = f'https://{image_name}@{image_digest}' #Note image digest is part of this string.
  request = containeranalysis.ListOccurrencesRequest(
        parent = f'projects/{project_id}',
        filter=f'kind="VULNERABILITY" AND resourceUrl="{resource_uri}"')
  response = client.list_occurrences(request=request)
  if response.occurrences:
     print("Vulnerability Scan Found!")
     for occurrence in response.occurrences:
       print(occurrence)
  else:
     print("No Vulnerability Scan found.")

def get_new_image_digest():
   #This is placeholder. In real production environment, retrieve digest after image push
  return "sha256:7893e671eb554d1446206b257078a7d60d8ff488e13f1b6a931d8b5b1d7c5678" # Example Digest

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(f"Pushing a new version of image: {image_name}")
    # Simulate a push, but with a new digest, representing content change
    print(f"New image pushed successfully. Gathering image digest")
    new_image_digest = get_new_image_digest()
    print(f"New image digest: {new_image_digest}")
    #Now check for scan event. We expect the scan to exist because this new digest is new.
    check_vulnerability_scan(new_image_digest,project_id)
    print("Note: It may take a few minutes for scan to complete.")
```

**Example 3: Using the Cloud Console to Monitor Scans**

While not code, the gcp console provides a way to monitor scans. Navigate to the "Container Analysis" section, and you'll see a list of vulnerabilities and related findings. You can filter this list by image name to check if scans have been performed and completed. This is valuable for troubleshooting. Alternatively, the gcloud cli commands for container analysis can also be used, which is covered in the official google documentation.

As you can see from the above, the core of this problem is rooted in the asynchronous nature of gcp's services and their event-driven architecture, along with the digest-based scanning. There isn't a 'missing' trigger, but rather an understanding required of how the process flows.

For further reading, I highly recommend reviewing the official gcp documentation on container analysis and artifact registry. Additionally, the 'google cloud platform for architects' book by michael r. collins provides excellent insights into the general architecture of these services. Papers on event-driven systems, particularly those focusing on distributed microservice architectures, would also provide a more fundamental understanding of the design patterns at play here.

In summary, the lack of immediate triggering isn't a bug, it's a feature of the asynchronous design of the underlying system, which, once understood, can be worked with predictably to achieve your security scanning goals.
