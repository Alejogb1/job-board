ah, i see the familiar pain. bundle install failing after a token change on github, yeah, been there. it's surprisingly common and can be a real time sink if you don't know where to look. i remember pulling my hair out over this one back in the day, probably sometime around 2015, when i was still getting my footing with ruby on rails development. we had this clunky old internal gem server and moving repos around meant messing with gemfiles and credentials *constantly*. good times. not.

the problem basically boils down to the way bundler, the gem dependency manager for ruby, caches and authenticates against git repositories. github, like most git hosting providers, uses tokens for authentication, especially for private repositories. when you change your token, the cached credentials bundler has stored become invalid. bundler doesn't automatically update that cache. it's not like it's deliberately trying to make your life miserable, it's more about efficiency. why recheck credentials every time if they’re generally stable? well… except for these instances.

so, let’s break it down, you've changed your github token, and now `bundle install` is throwing an error. typically, it looks something along the lines of "authentication failed" or "could not read from remote repository". that's a pretty clear sign the stored credentials no longer work. this is because bundler stores the credentials in some kind of a configuration file in the user’s home directory or in some global configuration directory. that’s where the information it needs to talk to github resides.

here are the most common things to check and some practical fixes, since i've battled with it multiple times. note that the exact location of bundler's cache might vary slightly depending on your operating system and bundler version, but the general principles remain the same.

first off, let's try the simplest thing that often helps: clearing the bundler cache:

```bash
bundle cache clean
```

this command tells bundler to clear out its local cache of downloaded gems. it's a good general cleanup procedure and can sometimes resolve issues related to cached gem files getting corrupted or conflicting versions. while it might not directly solve the token problem, it’s good practice and something i always try as the first step. it’s also a sanity check to make sure that the gem versions are not cached in a funky way.

now, if cleaning the cache didn’t work, it’s time to tell bundler about the new token. the way i usually do it is by updating the `~/.bundle/config` file. this is where bundler stores the git credentials, or even credentials specific to gem sources. sometimes the `bundle config` command is sufficient. bundler documentation can be verbose, so I prefer these steps. you should see the existing github credentials that use the old token (if they exist). then you need to override them with your new token.

the structure is something like this in that file (if it already exists). you can create the file if it doesn’t exist.

```
---
"https://github.com/my-repo.git":
  username: my-username
  password: my-old-token
```

you need to replace the old token with the new one in the `password` line, and if you are using ssh authentication, make sure to update the ssh key if needed (another potential source of confusion, i went through this at least twice!). if you have the token in an environment variable or some secrets manager you need to make sure that is updated as well. in my current setup i use a password manager.

here’s an example of how to do it via the command line for github:

```bash
bundle config github.com my-username:new-github-token
```

replace "my-username" with your actual github username and "new-github-token" with the token you've created. this command sets the credential for all github urls. keep in mind this will persist in the `~/.bundle/config` file, so it is really important to keep your token safe.

after you've updated the credential, try the `bundle install` command again:

```bash
bundle install
```

hopefully, it should work now. but if it’s still throwing issues, there might be other culprits involved. let's delve into some of the more intricate scenarios.

another thing i've seen happen is that sometimes bundler or git itself stores credentials in a system-wide credential helper. these are system-level utilities that cache credentials for various applications, including git. on linux systems, often, `git credential-cache` is enabled by default which can cause some headache. if that is the case, you’ll need to clear the cache from it. or you can disable it. it’s also good to check if you have any other git credential helpers enabled, that could potentially interfere.

you can check git credential helper using:

```bash
git config credential.helper
```
if you have something other than ‘osxkeychain’ or ‘manager’ in there and you do not know what it is you might need to investigate it.

a small note, sometimes i get an infinite loop trying to diagnose this issue, and that’s because the token i’m using does not have the permission to clone the private git repository. so that's another thing to keep in mind. triple check the token scopes. if the token does not have permission to read and clone a repository it will also throw authentication issues. when generating tokens on github you can see the “scopes” checkboxes. if you forget to select some of those scopes you might get into trouble, like i did. once i tried to generate a personal access token and forgot to select the “repo” checkbox, i spent almost half a day trying to figure out why i had authentication errors. and i still have nightmares with github oauth applications, they’re a bit too complicated for my taste.

if you are working in a team setting, you should also double-check if other team members have the same issue as that might mean that the token in the ci/cd pipeline needs an update. that is a very common problem as well when working with github actions. if the github action fails, there is a high chance that the token was not updated properly. or the environment variables were not updated. i’ve seen that happening many many times.

for resources, while there are a few good blog posts that cover this issue, i would recommend looking into the official bundler documentation. it is thorough and covers most situations. also, the git documentation on credential management and helpers can be helpful. specifically, check the section about git credential helpers. also there is a bunch of papers about dependency management and dependency conflicts in software systems. they usually do not directly tackle this authentication issue but can help to understand better the nature of bundler’s design decisions. i've always found that a deeper grasp of the underlying technology makes troubleshooting these sorts of problems much easier. and that’s important to me.

i know this can be a pain, but once you understand what's happening, the fix is usually pretty straightforward. and remember, even seasoned developers run into these things. it's all part of the learning process. and i'm pretty sure i will run into this problem again, probably next week. i am going to install a bot to remember this just for me. that's what we do here, right? automate everything? hahah.
