alright, let's talk about weighted loss and its impact across different neural network architectures. this is a question i've definitely tripped over a few times, and i've learned a thing or two through some good old trial and error.

the short answer is: no, the same weight class within the same weighted loss function doesn’t necessarily have the exact same effect across different neural networks. there are nuances and it's not a universal knob that behaves identically regardless of where you place it. the behavior of these weights is deeply coupled to the architecture itself, the data you feed into them, and of course the optimization process.

let's break it down a bit. when you're using a weighted loss, basically what you are doing is telling the network to prioritize some errors more than others. you're saying, "hey, this misclassification over here is a bigger deal than this one over there”. for example you might want to give more importance to a rare class in an imbalanced dataset. this is super common in scenarios where you might have some kind of classification task and one of the labels is much less represented in your training data.

i remember the first time i ran into this really was a bloodbath i was working on this image recognition project where i was trying to detect some specific objects in a medical image. the problem was that some of these objects were super rare so the network was mostly ignoring them because the loss for correctly predicting the super common ones was dominating. this was back when i was using tensorflow 1.x, i’m dating myself here i know, anyway i decided to use a weighted cross-entropy and even when i tried different values i could not get the network to focus on the rare cases, in the end i had to use a focal loss which i had heard about in some paper.

the thing is, the impact of these weights is fundamentally tied to how the gradients flow back during backpropagation. different network architectures have different structures and therefore different gradient flow patterns. this can drastically change how those loss weights affect the final outcome of training.

for instance, a fully connected network will have completely different gradients to a convolutional neural network or an rnn type network. the way that the convolutional layers work with their kernels which are used to scan the entire input and then doing max pooling will affect the error propagation and when using weights those will also affect the update in the filters at different layers. if you have a fully connected network these weights will directly influence the connections between neurons, but that means the whole set of parameters are very different and this will interact with the loss in a different way.

here is a super simple example of how a weighted loss would be implemented with pytorch, it is for a very simple classification use case:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

#dummy input
input_size = 10
num_classes = 2
batch_size = 32

# Create a simple fully connected network
class SimpleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, num_classes):
        super(SimpleClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(input_size, num_classes)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

# example with a basic binary classification
model = SimpleClassifier(input_size, num_classes)
# Define a sample loss weights which is the important part
weights = torch.tensor([0.2, 0.8])
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=weights)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Generate random input and labels
inputs = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size)
labels = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (batch_size,))

# training loop
num_epochs = 100

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

now if you take that same loss and weights and use it in a more complex network you will see that the convergence is different. consider a cnn based classification network for example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# input image
input_channels = 3
image_size = 32
batch_size = 32
num_classes = 2

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, num_classes):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(input_channels, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * (image_size // 4) * (image_size // 4), num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool1(self.relu1(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool2(self.relu2(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

model = SimpleCNN(input_channels, num_classes)
# Define the same loss weights
weights = torch.tensor([0.2, 0.8])
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=weights)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Generate random image input and labels
inputs = torch.randn(batch_size, input_channels, image_size, image_size)
labels = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (batch_size,))

# Training loop
num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

the impact of that 0.8 weight will not be the same as in the fully connected network.

consider another scenario, imagine using recurrent neural networks, rnns like lstms or grus for sequence data. in that case the backpropagation is very different. the gradients go back in time through the network itself. i mean you have a temporal component and the way you weigh the errors at each time step will have a big effect. if you are weighting a particular sequence it is different than what happens in the image or tabular case. this means the same weights in the loss function are affecting the network in a very different manner.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# input sequence
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_layers = 1
batch_size = 32
seq_len = 20
num_classes = 2

class SimpleRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_classes):
        super(SimpleRNN, self).__init__()
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out

model = SimpleRNN(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_classes)

weights = torch.tensor([0.2, 0.8])
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=weights)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Generate random sequence input and labels
inputs = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
labels = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (batch_size,))

num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

notice the similarities in the structure of the training loop, but the crucial differences in the network structure, the tensors and data flows, and how they affect the impact of the loss weighting.

another key consideration is the optimizer that you are using. different optimizers (adam, sgd, rmsprop, etc.) will use those gradients to update the parameters in distinct ways, that means that the same weighting is behaving differently due to the update rules implemented by the algorithm itself. for example, something like adam which uses adaptive learning rates might not have the same effect with the weights as sgd which uses a fixed learning rate.

it's definitely not a case where you can just plug in the same weights and expect the same results across all your models. the best approach, i’ve found, is to treat the weighting as a hyperparameter of your training process that is specific to the dataset and the model that you are using. this means you have to fine tune this hyperparameter.

to go deeper on this i would recommend reading up on the backpropagation algorithm itself, the nuances of gradient flow, and some of the papers on specific weighted loss function variants like the focal loss paper. i’d suggest the book “deep learning” by goodfellow, bengio and courville. it’s a great reference and i always have it close by. also, try to understand the different optimization algorithms by their mathematical formulation and the update equations and how those update rules interact with the loss and the gradient of the loss with respect to parameters.

finally, remember that at the end of the day we are trying to teach machines to generalize and the goal is to do that efficiently. we want a model that performs well on unseen data. so don't be afraid to experiment with different weight values and architectures to see what performs best for your particular problem. it's an empirical question at heart. and it's also not an exact science.

and if things are not working i usually just use a more powerful computer, that always works just kidding.

hope this was helpful, good luck!
