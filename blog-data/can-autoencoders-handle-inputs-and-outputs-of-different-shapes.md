Alright,  I've definitely been down this road a few times, particularly in some of my past projects dealing with multimodal data fusion where shape mismatches were practically a daily occurrence. The short answer is: it's complicated, but yes, with careful design, autoencoders can indeed handle inputs and outputs of different shapes. It’s not a straightforward plug-and-play scenario, and we need to discuss the 'how' quite thoroughly.

The core challenge lies in the fundamental concept of an autoencoder: it aims to reconstruct its input. If the input and output have different shapes, then the traditional idea of pixel-by-pixel or feature-by-feature reconstruction doesn't directly apply. It's no longer a pure 'copy' task, but more of a transformation or translation task where the structure changes. Consequently, we need to reframe the autoencoder's role to manage this structural discrepancy.

Let's consider the encoder part first. It takes the input, whatever its shape, and projects it into a lower-dimensional latent space representation. This latent representation is crucial, as it ideally should capture the essential features of the input irrespective of its shape. The encoder architecture, typically built using convolutional layers or dense layers (or both), is where we handle the specifics of the input shape. So, if we have a 2D image as input, we utilize convolutional layers. If it's a time-series, then perhaps recurrent layers. The output of the encoder, the latent vector, has its own fixed shape, something I learned when dealing with varying time sequences.

Now, the decoder, responsible for creating the output, gets a bit more interesting. It needs to transform the latent space representation into something that conforms to the desired output shape, which is different from the input shape. This transformation requires careful consideration, especially when it concerns a change in dimensionality. This is where the choice of decoder architecture becomes incredibly important. For instance, if the output is of a larger size than the encoder output, we require upsampling or deconvolutional layers, something I needed to do extensively when generating high-resolution images from low-resolution feature vectors. Likewise, if the output is smaller, then convolutional layers with stride, or pooling layers can work.

Crucially, we are moving away from 'copy' reconstruction and moving towards feature transformation or generation where the output is not simply a reshaped input. The autoencoder learns the underlying relationships between the input and the *features* of the output which are in some way represented in the latent space. The latent space should learn a manifold representation where similar inputs result in similar latent representations, allowing the decoder to learn a continuous mapping to various shapes. This means training needs to be carefully planned.

To make things clearer, let's look at some code examples. We’ll use Python with TensorFlow/Keras, which has become my go-to for these types of tasks.

**Example 1: Sequence to Vector Autoencoder**

Let’s say you want to encode a variable-length sequence of numbers (e.g., sensor readings) into a fixed-length feature vector, and then generate a fixed length output that could be used for classification downstream, or some other processing. This isn’t reconstructing the *same* sequence but converting an input sequence into another output sequence, via a latent representation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define encoder (processes variable length sequences)
def build_encoder(latent_dim):
    encoder_input = layers.Input(shape=(None, 1))  # Variable sequence length, 1 feature
    encoded = layers.LSTM(128)(encoder_input)
    latent_output = layers.Dense(latent_dim)(encoded)
    return tf.keras.Model(encoder_input, latent_output)

# Define decoder (generates fixed length sequence or some other fixed shape output)
def build_decoder(latent_dim, output_length):
    decoder_input = layers.Input(shape=(latent_dim,))
    decoded = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(decoder_input)
    decoded = layers.Dense(output_length)(decoded)  #Output of a fixed length
    return tf.keras.Model(decoder_input, decoded)

latent_dimension = 32
output_sequence_length = 20

encoder = build_encoder(latent_dimension)
decoder = build_decoder(latent_dimension, output_sequence_length)

# Autoencoder
autoencoder_input = layers.Input(shape=(None,1))
encoded = encoder(autoencoder_input)
decoded = decoder(encoded)
autoencoder = tf.keras.Model(autoencoder_input, decoded)

# Compile
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
autoencoder.summary()
```

Here, the encoder takes a variable length sequence (None, 1), using a lstm layer, encoding it to latent_dim. The decoder takes this, and after some dense processing, outputs a fixed length sequence. Notice that the shape of the input and output to the autoencoder itself are different, and we're using the 'autoencoder' model as training data input for these different shapes.

**Example 2: Image to Feature Vector Autoencoder**

Now consider encoding an image to a feature vector and then generating another fixed-size vector, perhaps for some downstream analysis.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Encoder (processes image to latent vector)
def build_encoder_image(latent_dim):
    encoder_input = layers.Input(shape=(64, 64, 3))  # Example image shape
    encoded = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(encoder_input)
    encoded = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(encoded)
    encoded = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(encoded)
    encoded = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(encoded)
    encoded = layers.Flatten()(encoded)
    latent_output = layers.Dense(latent_dim)(encoded)
    return tf.keras.Model(encoder_input, latent_output)

# Decoder (outputs fixed vector)
def build_decoder_vector(latent_dim, output_vector_size):
  decoder_input = layers.Input(shape=(latent_dim,))
  decoded = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(decoder_input)
  decoded = layers.Dense(output_vector_size)(decoded)
  return tf.keras.Model(decoder_input, decoded)


latent_dimension = 64
output_vector_size = 10

encoder_image = build_encoder_image(latent_dimension)
decoder_vector = build_decoder_vector(latent_dimension, output_vector_size)

# Autoencoder setup
autoencoder_input = layers.Input(shape=(64,64,3))
encoded = encoder_image(autoencoder_input)
decoded = decoder_vector(encoded)
autoencoder = tf.keras.Model(autoencoder_input, decoded)


# Compile
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

autoencoder.summary()
```

In this second example, the encoder processes an image (64x64x3) using conv layers, outputs a latent vector of size 'latent_dimension'. The decoder receives this and generates an output of a different shape than input, the fixed sized 'output_vector_size'. Again, the input to the autoencoder is different in shape than output.

**Example 3: Image to Smaller Image Autoencoder (Using convolutions and stride)**

Consider downsampling images to a lower resolution by passing the initial image through the encoder, decoding the latent, and then creating a smaller output image.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Encoder (downsamples image to latent)
def build_encoder_downsample(latent_dim):
    encoder_input = layers.Input(shape=(64, 64, 3))
    encoded = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), strides=(2, 2), activation='relu', padding='same')(encoder_input)
    encoded = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), strides=(2, 2), activation='relu', padding='same')(encoded)
    encoded = layers.Flatten()(encoded)
    latent_output = layers.Dense(latent_dim)(encoded)
    return tf.keras.Model(encoder_input, latent_output)


# Decoder (upsamples from latent and outputs smaller image)
def build_decoder_upsample(latent_dim, output_shape):
    decoder_input = layers.Input(shape=(latent_dim,))
    decoded = layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')(decoder_input)
    decoded = layers.Reshape((4, 4, 64))(decoded)
    decoded = layers.Conv2DTranspose(64, (3,3), strides=(1,1), padding="same", activation="relu")(decoded)
    decoded = layers.Conv2DTranspose(32, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding="same", activation="relu")(decoded)
    decoded = layers.Conv2DTranspose(3, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding="same", activation="relu")(decoded)
    return tf.keras.Model(decoder_input, decoded)


latent_dimension = 64
output_image_shape = (16,16,3)

encoder_down = build_encoder_downsample(latent_dimension)
decoder_up = build_decoder_upsample(latent_dimension, output_image_shape)

autoencoder_input = layers.Input(shape=(64, 64, 3))
encoded = encoder_down(autoencoder_input)
decoded = decoder_up(encoded)
autoencoder = tf.keras.Model(autoencoder_input, decoded)


autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
autoencoder.summary()
```

In this final example, we perform a compression and dimensionality change between input and output.

These examples illustrate that the critical part lies in designing the encoder and decoder architectures to manage the shape differences gracefully. The selection of layers in each part determines how the shape differences are processed, making autoencoders more versatile than initially meets the eye.

To further your understanding, I strongly recommend exploring the works of Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, specifically their deep learning textbook, "Deep Learning," as it dives deeper into the mathematical foundations and architectural possibilities. Furthermore, for more practical insights into the design of convolutional and recurrent architectures, I advise looking at the various tutorial papers and official documentation available on the TensorFlow website and PyTorch documentation. The key takeaway is not just how to use these models, but *why* they behave the way they do. Specifically focusing on autoencoders for sequence data (using lstms) and images (using conv nets) will get you a lot more familiar.
