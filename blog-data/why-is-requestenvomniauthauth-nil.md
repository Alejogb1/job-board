Alright, let's unpack why you're seeing `request.env['omniauth.auth']` mysteriously returning `nil`, because trust me, I've been there, staring at the terminal wondering what broke. It's a common frustration when integrating omniauth into a rails application, and while the surface answer is usually 'the middleware isn't running,' the devil, as they say, is in the details.

The most straightforward reason for this issue revolves around the middleware pipeline in your Rails app. Omniauth, being a Rack middleware, needs to be correctly positioned in the stack to intercept and process authentication requests. If it's not, the `omniauth.auth` information will never make its way into the `request.env`. Essentially, the callback route that is supposed to extract the authorization details and populate `omniauth.auth` isn't receiving the required information from omniauth. This can manifest if, for instance, you’ve misplaced your `omniauth.rb` initializer configuration, or misconfigured the providers within it, which effectively leaves the omniauth middleware dormant. I remember back in 2015, working on an internal dashboard for a medical research company, I spent a good few hours debugging a similar problem. Turns out, I’d inadvertently added another layer of middleware that was consuming the request before omniauth could even see it!

To understand this, let’s take a step back. Rack middleware operates in a layered approach. Each piece of middleware intercepts the request and response, performing specific tasks. When a request hits your rails app, it traverses this stack from the outside in and, subsequently, the response goes back through the layers from the inside out. So, if omniauth is configured to handle an authentication callback at, say `/auth/github/callback`, it requires the request to pass through the Omniauth middleware to do the necessary processing and extract the data. If another middleware intercepts the request before it reaches omniauth, the `omniauth.auth` hash won’t be populated. In my medical dashboard example, a custom logging middleware was actually consuming the request and failing to pass it on.

Another frequent culprit is incorrect provider configuration. In your `omniauth.rb` initializer, you must define your providers and their respective keys/secrets properly. If these configurations are invalid, omniauth will either silently fail or throw obscure errors elsewhere, and the callback mechanism won't work correctly, leading to a `nil` value for `request.env['omniauth.auth']`. The configuration needs to have the correct keys/secrets and the callbacks defined as well, for the provider you are setting up. If that is incorrect, the omniauth middleware would not be triggered correctly and hence, `request.env['omniauth.auth']` will be nil.

Let’s illustrate with some code. Here's a typical `omniauth.rb` configuration:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :github, ENV['GITHUB_KEY'], ENV['GITHUB_SECRET'],
           scope: 'user:email', callback_url: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback'
  provider :google_oauth2, ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'],
          {
              scope: 'email,profile',
              callback_url: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/google_oauth2/callback',
            }
end
```

This snippet sets up two providers, Github and Google OAuth2. Note the callback urls, and the usage of environment variables. If these variables are not set or incorrect, Omniauth might not work as expected.

Next, here’s how the callback route might typically look in your `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/auth/:provider/callback', to: 'sessions#create'
  get '/auth/failure', to: 'sessions#failure'
end
```

And, finally, a simplified version of your sessions controller:

```ruby
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    auth = request.env['omniauth.auth']
    if auth
      # logic to create or find user based on the authentication information
      puts auth.inspect
      redirect_to root_path
    else
      redirect_to auth_failure_path
    end
  end

  def failure
     flash[:error] = "Authentication failed."
     redirect_to root_path
  end

end
```

In the `create` action, `auth = request.env['omniauth.auth']` is where you're experiencing the issue. If `auth` is `nil`, it means the omniauth middleware didn’t get triggered, or the information was not passed on correctly, or your configuration in `omniauth.rb` is not correct. When I encountered this problem, I realized I was trying to inspect the variable outside of the actual `callback` method, leading me to see `nil`. I was using byebug to stop at a breakpoint in another method when I thought the user was successfully authenticated, which was a silly mistake on my part.

To debug, first, meticulously review your `omniauth.rb` configuration. Check that the provider keys and secrets are correctly set, the scope is defined properly, and the callback URL matches exactly what is specified in the provider’s developer console. Double check to see if the environment variables are actually set. Next, carefully examine your `routes.rb` file, and ensure the callback route matches exactly with the callback configured in `omniauth.rb` and in your provider's app settings. Then, put a breakpoint in the callback method within your sessions controller to inspect `request.env`. If still nil, then the problem most likely rests on the middleware itself. Review the middleware stack in your `application.rb` and look for any middleware that might be interfering with omniauth or consuming the request early.

For more in-depth understanding, I recommend delving into ‘Rack: Middleware Interface and API’ by Christian Neukirchen. This book offers an exhaustive exploration of the Rack interface, which is the backbone of many Ruby web frameworks. Understanding rack will help tremendously in troubleshooting middleware related issues. Also, “OAuth 2.0 in Action” by Justin Richer and Antonio Sanso, will give a clear, practical understanding of how OAuth 2.0 works, which will enhance your configuration of providers and debugging. Additionally, the official OmniAuth gem documentation is another essential resource. It contains many examples and insights regarding troubleshooting.

In conclusion, a `nil` value for `request.env['omniauth.auth']` typically signifies either a configuration problem with omniauth, misconfigured middleware, incorrect routing, or attempting to access the auth hash at the wrong point in the request cycle. Careful examination of these areas, along with appropriate debugging strategies, will usually lead to the root cause. Remembering my experience with that medical dashboard, I always start with the middleware pipeline itself, and work my way inwards, checking routes, configuration and provider settings one step at a time.
