Alright, let's tackle this. It’s a head-scratcher I’ve definitely encountered before, particularly back in my early days optimizing a photo-heavy social platform. The issue of missing webp thumbnails when sharing content isn't some random glitch; it's usually a confluence of specific technical factors. Fundamentally, it boils down to how different platforms interpret and handle image formats, specifically webp, when generating previews or metadata for shared links.

The first, and perhaps most common, culprit is the lack of proper metadata. When you share a link, social media platforms, messaging apps, and even some browsers don't just display the link. They actively fetch the page’s content and try to extract relevant information for a preview. This usually includes a thumbnail image. The primary mechanism for this is via open graph protocol (og:) tags within the html `head` section, notably the `og:image` property. If this tag either doesn't exist, doesn't point to a valid image, or points to a webp image, and that platform lacks webp support, you get… nothing. A blank square, a broken image icon, or just plain text.

Historically, webp adoption hasn't been universal. While modern browsers and operating systems now support it quite well, older devices or software may not. Further complicating matters, some platform’s crawlers may not prioritize parsing the entire page’s css to determine available image formats and opt for a quicker, lower overhead parsing method focusing only on metadata tags. In such a scenario, the fallback, such as the more traditional png or jpeg images, isn't specified, and the webp is ignored.

To demonstrate this, imagine a basic html snippet:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Awesome Page</title>
    <meta property="og:title" content="Check out this page!">
    <meta property="og:description" content="A brief description of the page.">
    <meta property="og:image" content="thumbnail.webp">
</head>
<body>
   <h1>Content goes here</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `og:image` points directly to a webp image. If a sharing platform encounters this and doesn't understand webp, or a fallback image type isn't included through a `picture` tag or similar mechanism, the thumbnail will likely be missing.

Another area where this frequently occurs is when you’re serving your webp images via the `<picture>` tag for responsive image handling. While this is best practice for actual page display and browser rendering, the og:image metadata often isn't intelligent enough to select the `source` based on specific criteria when a crawler visits.

Here’s an illustrative example of that:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Awesome Page</title>
    <meta property="og:title" content="Check out this page!">
    <meta property="og:description" content="A brief description of the page.">
    <meta property="og:image" content="thumbnail.jpg"> <!-- fall back image -->
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Content goes here</h1>
    <picture>
        <source srcset="thumbnail.webp" type="image/webp">
        <img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="Thumbnail">
    </picture>
</body>
</html>
```

While this renders the webp image for browsers that support it, the `og:image` tag still points to a ‘thumbnail.jpg’. If you omitted the fall-back image and only defined the source for webp within the picture element, many sharing services would not display anything. This emphasizes the importance of providing a readily-parseable and compatible fallback within the `og:image` tag.

Finally, content delivery networks (cdns) and proxy servers can also contribute to this. If you're leveraging a cdn and have incorrect or incomplete cache headers configured, especially for Vary headers, the cdn might not send the correct content-type or content encoding when the sharing platform fetches the resource. This can lead to the platform either misinterpreting the image or refusing to load it if the header doesn't align with what it expects. The cdn might also cache an old version of the resource where only webp images where provided and the fallback strategy wasn't implemented yet, or, for example, the `og:image` was initially not set to a supported format.

The solution, in my experience, is multifaceted and requires a comprehensive approach:

1. **Always Provide a Fallback in og:image**: Ensure the `og:image` tag points to a generally supported format, like `.jpg` or `.png` in addition to your webp image.

2. **Use the picture element correctly**: Utilize the `<picture>` element to serve webp images to browsers capable of displaying them, and provide a `.jpg` or `.png` image within the `<img>` element as a default option. This is what I found worked most reliably and universally. You should ensure that fallback is used inside the og:image tag.

3. **Correct Cache Headers**: Verify your cdn configuration to make sure proper `content-type` and potentially `vary` headers are set correctly. Incorrect headers can lead to cached webp images being served when an initial fallback (like a jpeg) is required by crawlers and other platforms.

To illustrate a more robust approach, let’s consider this third example demonstrating a complete solution:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Awesome Page</title>
    <meta property="og:title" content="Check out this page!">
    <meta property="og:description" content="A brief description of the page.">
    <meta property="og:image" content="/images/thumbnail.jpg"> <!-- fallback image for crawlers-->
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Content goes here</h1>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="/images/thumbnail.webp" type="image/webp">
      <img src="/images/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Thumbnail">
    </picture>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `og:image` tag points to a jpeg for sharing crawlers. The `picture` element provides a webp version for supporting browsers but also maintains the jpeg fallback ensuring wide browser support and preventing missing thumbnail previews. This approach, while a little more verbose, is highly effective.

Further learning around this topic should include diving into resources like the W3C's documentation on the `<picture>` element, open graph protocol specifications from ogp.me, and the detailed descriptions of content negotiation within the http/1.1 RFCs, especially RFC 7231, as well as related documentation for any specific CDN being used. This will help ensure a comprehensive understanding of all the moving parts involved in image rendering and sharing on the web.

In summary, missing webp thumbnails during sharing are seldom caused by a single point of failure, but more often by overlooking multiple aspects of web technology, including metadata handling, fallback strategies, and cdn configurations. A careful consideration of these elements will go a long way in ensuring that sharing content displays correctly and consistently across the web.
