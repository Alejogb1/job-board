Right then, let’s tackle this. I recall a rather intricate project a few years back, involving drone imagery analysis for agricultural assessments. We needed to identify specific types of crop damage, and pre-trained models just weren't cutting it. Creating a custom object detection model trained with tfrecord files was absolutely crucial for that project’s success. So, let me walk you through the process, based on what I’ve learned along the way.

The core idea is that you're not just tossing image files at your model. Tfrecord files provide a structured, efficient way to store and access your training data – think of them as highly optimized containers for your images and their corresponding bounding box annotations. This process involves a few distinct steps, and I’ll outline each with a bit of explanation and a code snippet to make it more tangible.

First, the creation of these tfrecord files is paramount. You'll need to format your object bounding box annotations into a structured format that can be serialized into tfrecord files. Typically, this means converting your data into a format like the example proto used by TensorFlow Object Detection API, which is essentially a message containing fields for your image, bounding boxes, labels, and potentially more metadata.

Let’s assume you have your image data and annotation data (likely in json, csv or xml format). Converting this into the example proto, which is a protocol buffer message, often involves a custom python script and the use of the TensorFlow library. The following snippet shows how you can create a tfrecord file writer, and populate it with examples.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import io
import hashlib

def create_tf_example(image_path, annotations, label_map):
    """
    Generates a tf.train.Example proto from an image and annotations.
    Args:
        image_path: Path to the image file.
        annotations: A list of dictionaries, each containing 'x_min', 'y_min',
                     'x_max', 'y_max', and 'label' keys for a bounding box.
        label_map: A dictionary mapping string labels to integer IDs.
    Returns:
        A tf.train.Example proto.
    """
    with tf.io.gfile.GFile(image_path, 'rb') as fid:
        encoded_image = fid.read()
    encoded_image_io = io.BytesIO(encoded_image)
    image = tf.io.decode_image(encoded_image, channels=3)
    height = tf.shape(image)[0]
    width = tf.shape(image)[1]
    image_format = b'jpeg' if image_path.lower().endswith('jpg') or image_path.lower().endswith('jpeg') else b'png'

    xmins = []
    xmaxs = []
    ymins = []
    ymaxs = []
    classes = []
    classes_text = []

    for annotation in annotations:
      xmins.append(annotation['x_min'] / width)
      xmaxs.append(annotation['x_max'] / width)
      ymins.append(annotation['y_min'] / height)
      ymaxs.append(annotation['y_max'] / height)
      classes_text.append(annotation['label'].encode('utf8'))
      classes.append(label_map[annotation['label']])

    image_hash = hashlib.sha256(encoded_image).hexdigest()

    tf_example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
        'image/height': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[height.numpy()])),
        'image/width': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[width.numpy()])),
        'image/filename': tf.train.Feature(bytes_list=tf.train.BytesList(value=[image_path.encode('utf8')])),
        'image/source_id': tf.train.Feature(bytes_list=tf.train.BytesList(value=[image_path.encode('utf8')])),
        'image/key/sha256': tf.train.Feature(bytes_list=tf.train.BytesList(value=[image_hash.encode('utf8')])),
        'image/encoded': tf.train.Feature(bytes_list=tf.train.BytesList(value=[encoded_image])),
        'image/format': tf.train.Feature(bytes_list=tf.train.BytesList(value=[image_format])),
        'image/object/bbox/xmin': tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=xmins)),
        'image/object/bbox/xmax': tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=xmaxs)),
        'image/object/bbox/ymin': tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=ymins)),
        'image/object/bbox/ymax': tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=ymaxs)),
        'image/object/class/text': tf.train.Feature(bytes_list=tf.train.BytesList(value=classes_text)),
        'image/object/class/label': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=classes)),
    }))
    return tf_example
```

The `create_tf_example` function here takes an image path, associated annotations, and a label map as input. It reads the image, extracts the bounding box coordinates, and then carefully crafts an example proto for each image. Notice how we are also storing the encoded image, and the corresponding metadata such as filename and image format. This structured data makes it easier for Tensorflow to understand and process the data during the training process.

Next up is the actual writing of these `tf.train.Example` protos into your tfrecord file.  You'll use a `tf.io.TFRecordWriter` object to write your generated protos. Here is an example:

```python
def create_tfrecord_from_data(image_annotation_pairs, label_map, output_path):
    """
    Creates a tfrecord file from a list of image paths and annotations.
    Args:
        image_annotation_pairs: A list of tuples, each containing (image_path, annotations).
        label_map: A dictionary mapping string labels to integer IDs.
        output_path: The path to where the tfrecord file should be written
    """
    with tf.io.TFRecordWriter(output_path) as writer:
      for image_path, annotations in image_annotation_pairs:
            tf_example = create_tf_example(image_path, annotations, label_map)
            writer.write(tf_example.SerializeToString())
```

The `create_tfrecord_from_data` function iterates over your dataset, calling `create_tf_example` for each pair, and then serializes each example and writes it into your .tfrecord file. It's crucial to perform this step correctly, as the integrity and correctness of the training data depend on it.

Now, with your data tucked safely away in these tfrecord files, the real fun begins - the training of your object detection model. When setting up your training pipeline, you'll utilize `tf.data` API to load and process data directly from these tfrecord files. This involves defining how to parse the serialized examples back into a usable format.

Here's an outline showing how to decode examples within your training pipeline:

```python
def parse_tfrecord_fn(example):
    """
    Parses a tf.train.Example proto into tensors suitable for training.
    Args:
      example: A serialized tf.train.Example proto.
    Returns:
      A tuple of tensors: image (3D tensor), bounding boxes (2D tensor),
      classes (1D tensor), image_id (scalar)
    """

    feature_description = {
        'image/height': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64),
        'image/width': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64),
        'image/filename': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),
        'image/source_id': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),
        'image/key/sha256': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),
        'image/encoded': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),
        'image/format': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),
        'image/object/bbox/xmin': tf.io.FloatFeature(list_shape=[None]),
        'image/object/bbox/xmax': tf.io.FloatFeature(list_shape=[None]),
        'image/object/bbox/ymin': tf.io.FloatFeature(list_shape=[None]),
        'image/object/bbox/ymax': tf.io.FloatFeature(list_shape=[None]),
        'image/object/class/text': tf.io.FixedLenFeature(list_shape=[None], dtype=tf.string),
        'image/object/class/label': tf.io.FixedLenFeature(list_shape=[None], dtype=tf.int64),
    }
    example = tf.io.parse_single_example(example, feature_description)
    image = tf.io.decode_image(example['image/encoded'], channels=3)
    image_id = example['image/filename']

    xmin = example['image/object/bbox/xmin']
    xmax = example['image/object/bbox/xmax']
    ymin = example['image/object/bbox/ymin']
    ymax = example['image/object/bbox/ymax']
    classes = example['image/object/class/label']
    bbox = tf.stack([ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax], axis=-1)

    return image, bbox, classes, image_id
```

The `parse_tfrecord_fn` function defines the feature description for the tfrecord file, and it then parses the example into tensors. This function will be used in combination with `tf.data.TFRecordDataset` to create the data pipeline, and will give the training procedure access to all of the important data stored in the tfrecord file.

Remember, this isn't just about raw data. You will also want to include data augmentation techniques such as random image cropping, flips, or color jitters as part of your training pipeline using `tf.data.Dataset`. Doing this helps your model generalize better and reduces the risk of overfitting. The training procedure would usually then make use of the tensorflow object detection api, which provides an easy way to define the training pipeline.

For further in-depth understanding, I would highly recommend you delve into: the official TensorFlow documentation on the `tf.data` API, the TensorFlow Object Detection API repository on GitHub, and particularly the research papers related to object detection models and data augmentation methods. Specific recommendations include reading “Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks,” by Shaoqing Ren et al, for insights into a fundamental detection model architecture and "Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks" by Tong He et al., for various data augmentation strategies and tricks to train models faster and more efficiently.

Working with tfrecord files can seem challenging at first, but it significantly enhances the training process when dealing with larger datasets. It helped our project significantly, and hopefully, you’ll find it just as beneficial.
