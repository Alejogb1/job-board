,  I’ve seen variations of this problem countless times, especially when dealing with interactive forms that need to process financial data or inventories dynamically. It’s crucial to ensure the user interface remains responsive, and that calculations are accurate, without succumbing to the common pitfalls of double-counting or unexpected states. The heart of your challenge, as I understand it, lies in a React component communicating with a Rails backend, handling item selection via a dropdown, preventing duplicates, and computing an average cost in real-time. Here’s my approach, drawing from a particularly memorable project back when I was implementing a resource management platform.

To start, let's outline the core components. We’ll need a React component to manage the dropdown and selected items, a method to prevent duplicate selections, and finally, a calculation to dynamically update the average cost. We'll also briefly touch on how data might be structured on the Rails side.

First, consider how data is structured. Typically, your Rails backend would expose an endpoint to fetch the items, which would likely contain at least an id, a name, and a cost. This would be served as a JSON array:

```json
[
    { "id": 1, "name": "Widget A", "cost": 10.50 },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Widget B", "cost": 15.00 },
    { "id": 3, "name": "Widget C", "cost": 8.25 }
]
```

Now, let’s jump into the React component. I’ll focus on the key parts pertinent to your question.

**Component Structure**

Here's a skeletal component structure that includes the key functionalities:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ItemSelector({ items }) {
    const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState([]);
    const [averageCost, setAverageCost] = useState(0);

    // Effect to compute average when selectedItems change.
    useEffect(() => {
        computeAverage();
    }, [selectedItems]);

     const handleItemSelection = (event) => {
       const selectedItemId = parseInt(event.target.value);
       if(selectedItemId === -1) return;

       if (!selectedItems.some(item => item.id === selectedItemId)) {
           const selectedItem = items.find(item => item.id === selectedItemId);
           setSelectedItems([...selectedItems, selectedItem]);
       }

    };

    const removeItem = (itemId) => {
        const updatedItems = selectedItems.filter(item => item.id !== itemId);
        setSelectedItems(updatedItems);
    };


   const computeAverage = () => {
        if (selectedItems.length === 0) {
            setAverageCost(0);
            return;
         }

        const totalCost = selectedItems.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.cost, 0);
        setAverageCost(totalCost / selectedItems.length);
     };

    return (
    //JSX Render Code here
    );

}

export default ItemSelector;

```

Here's the breakdown:

*   `selectedItems`: Stores the array of currently selected items.
*   `averageCost`: Stores the dynamically calculated average cost.
*   `useEffect` hook is crucial for reactively updating the `averageCost` each time `selectedItems` changes.
*   `handleItemSelection`: This is the crucial piece for managing unique selections. It checks if the item exists in `selectedItems` before adding it.
*   `removeItem`: Provides a straightforward mechanism for users to remove items from the selection.
*   `computeAverage`: Handles the actual calculation, gracefully handling edge cases such as no items selected.

**Handling Duplicates**

The key line here is this part within the `handleItemSelection` function:

```javascript
if (!selectedItems.some(item => item.id === selectedItemId)) {
   const selectedItem = items.find(item => item.id === selectedItemId);
    setSelectedItems([...selectedItems, selectedItem]);
}
```

`some()` checks if any of the `selectedItems` have the same id, and only if it is a new id the item is added. This ensures that an item can be selected only once.

**Calculating Average**

The calculation logic resides within the `computeAverage` function and in the `useEffect` which triggers it. It first checks if there are items selected to prevent division by zero. Then, it uses `reduce` to sum all the costs of the selected items before dividing by the number of items selected.

**Working Example**

To make this concrete, let's add a basic UI to the `ItemSelector` and hook everything up.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ItemSelector({ items }) {
    const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState([]);
    const [averageCost, setAverageCost] = useState(0);

    // Effect to compute average when selectedItems change.
    useEffect(() => {
        computeAverage();
    }, [selectedItems]);

     const handleItemSelection = (event) => {
       const selectedItemId = parseInt(event.target.value);
       if(selectedItemId === -1) return;

       if (!selectedItems.some(item => item.id === selectedItemId)) {
           const selectedItem = items.find(item => item.id === selectedItemId);
           setSelectedItems([...selectedItems, selectedItem]);
       }

    };

    const removeItem = (itemId) => {
        const updatedItems = selectedItems.filter(item => item.id !== itemId);
        setSelectedItems(updatedItems);
    };


   const computeAverage = () => {
        if (selectedItems.length === 0) {
            setAverageCost(0);
            return;
         }

        const totalCost = selectedItems.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.cost, 0);
        setAverageCost(totalCost / selectedItems.length);
     };

    return (
        <div>
            <select onChange={handleItemSelection} defaultValue="-1">
                <option value="-1" disabled>Select an Item</option>
                {items.map((item) => (
                    <option key={item.id} value={item.id}>
                        {item.name}
                    </option>
                ))}
            </select>

            <div>
                <strong>Selected Items:</strong>
                 <ul>
                    {selectedItems.map(item => (
                        <li key={item.id}>
                         {item.name} - ${item.cost}
                          <button onClick={() => removeItem(item.id)}>Remove</button>
                        </li>
                    ))}
                </ul>
             </div>
            <div>
                <strong>Average Cost:</strong> ${averageCost.toFixed(2)}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}

export default ItemSelector;
```
This adds a dropdown selector, a display for selected items, and the average cost.

**Rails Data Structure**
On the Rails side, you would use a controller action to return the item JSON like the example given. There's nothing particularly tricky here, standard RESTful API principles apply.

**Key Considerations**

*   **Error Handling**: You’d want to add error handling around API calls to your Rails backend to handle network errors and unexpected data.
*   **Performance**: For a small number of items, the simple array manipulation is fine. But with a large number of items, consider optimizing data structures or implementing pagination in the backend.
*   **Asynchronous Behavior**: Ensure your React app can gracefully handle the asynchronous nature of API calls using the `fetch` or axios library.

**Recommended Reading**
For a deeper dive into these concepts, I strongly recommend exploring:

*   **"Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke**: For a rock-solid understanding of javascript.
*   **The official React documentation**: Always an invaluable resource.
*   **"Agile Web Development with Rails" by Sam Ruby, et al**: A great reference for Rails best practices, especially when working with APIs.
*   **"Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann**: If you find yourself needing to tackle scaling issues.

In my experience, breaking down the problem into smaller parts like this, focusing on data structures and interactions, makes the whole task much more manageable and results in a more maintainable solution. Remember, good code is less about clever tricks and more about clarity and reliability.
