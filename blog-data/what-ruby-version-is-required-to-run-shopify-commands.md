Okay, let's tackle this. It's a question that's tripped up more than a few folks working with Shopify’s command-line interface (CLI), and I've personally debugged similar issues countless times in past projects. The straightforward answer—and the one you’ll typically see in the official documentation—is that Shopify’s CLI requires a supported version of Ruby. However, that “supported” part is where things get a bit nuanced, and that’s what we need to break down.

The quick answer is: *currently*, as of my writing this, Shopify CLI officially supports Ruby versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. It’s critical, and I’ll emphasize this, to consistently check the *official* Shopify documentation for the most up-to-date compatibility list. These things can shift with releases, and relying on anecdotal information will lead to headaches. In my earlier experiences managing e-commerce deployments, I had to learn this lesson the hard way when a seemingly innocuous update to Ruby broke all my development tooling.

So, what does this really *mean*? It's not just a matter of having *a* Ruby installation; it needs to be one that matches what Shopify CLI is designed to interface with. You'll encounter errors, strange behavior, or outright command failures if the version mismatches. Furthermore, Shopify’s CLI leverages RubyGems, Ruby’s package manager, so you also need a properly configured gem environment to handle gem dependencies within your project context. This isn’t unique to Shopify, by any means, but it’s worth reiterating. It's a common source of issues for developers new to the Ruby and gem ecosystem, and I've spent more time than I care to remember resolving gem version conflicts over the years.

Let’s look at some practical aspects with some code snippets.

**Scenario 1: Checking Your Ruby Version**

First and foremost, you need to confirm what version of Ruby is actively being used in your environment. You can usually do this directly in your terminal:

```ruby
ruby -v
```

This command, executed in the command line, will return something like `ruby 3.2.2p31 (2023-03-30 revision e51014f9c0) [x86_64-linux]`. This clearly states the Ruby version (3.2.2 in this instance), the patch level, the build date, and the platform. If this version is *not* a supported one by the Shopify CLI, that’s your first problem. If you are using `rbenv`, `rvm`, or a similar tool for managing Ruby versions, you might need to specifically select a valid version for the CLI.

**Scenario 2: Managing Multiple Ruby Versions with `rbenv`**

Suppose, as I have often had in past projects, that you manage multiple Ruby versions using `rbenv`. Here is how you would see and switch between them:

First, list all installed Ruby versions:

```bash
rbenv versions
```

This might output something like:
```
  system
  2.7.5
  3.1.4
* 3.3.0 (set by /home/user/.rbenv/version)
```

The asterisk indicates the currently active version. Then, to set the version globally for Shopify development, you might use:

```bash
rbenv global 3.2.2
```
or
```bash
rbenv local 3.2.2
```

The 'global' scope will affect new terminal sessions, while the 'local' setting is project-specific. Make sure that your selected version is among those supported by the Shopify CLI.

**Scenario 3: Troubleshooting Gem Dependency Issues**

Even with a compatible Ruby version, you might hit issues with gem dependencies, particularly if the gems required by Shopify CLI are out of date or not installed correctly. If you have `bundler` installed (which you should for any serious Ruby development), you would navigate to your project directory where the `Gemfile` exists and run:

```bash
bundle install
```

This command will read the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`, install the exact required gem versions, and ensure that you have a consistent environment. When you have issues with outdated dependencies, you may have to occasionally run:

```bash
bundle update
```
This can resolve dependency conflicts but might also introduce breaking changes if not careful so treat it with consideration. Sometimes, a specific gem might conflict with others. `Bundler` can help with that as well:

```bash
bundle info <gem_name>
```

This will give details about the gem, so you can identify the potential problem. This process has saved me from countless hours of debugging mysterious errors by ensuring we always have consistent dependency versions in all parts of our team's environment.

Now, where should you go for in-depth knowledge? There are a few excellent resources.

For a solid grounding in Ruby, I recommend “Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide” by Dave Thomas, Chad Fowler, and Andy Hunt. Even though it doesn't cover the very latest versions, it provides a strong foundation in the core concepts. Understanding Ruby at this level will greatly benefit your understanding of the CLI. For a more current look at Ruby, be sure to consult the official documentation at ruby-lang.org, which is frequently updated.

For a comprehensive explanation on `bundler`, consult the official documentation at bundler.io. This is where you will find the authoritative information on managing ruby gem dependencies, a critical aspect of maintaining a stable and functioning development environment when working with Shopify.

Finally, as I mentioned earlier, always refer to the *official* Shopify documentation for the most current information on Ruby versions. Specifically, check the "Shopify CLI" sections for details on supported platforms and required dependencies. This is often where changes are announced and should always be your first reference for up-to-date requirements.

To summarize: While the currently supported versions are 3.0 through 3.3, confirm the compatibility with Shopify CLI documentation. Use tools like `rbenv` or `rvm` to manage your ruby versions if you work with multiple projects. Pay close attention to gem dependencies, and make sure you use `bundler` to keep things consistent. Avoid relying on outdated information and keep your Ruby setup aligned with official recommendations to ensure a smoother workflow. Following these practices will save you considerable time and frustration when working with the Shopify CLI.
