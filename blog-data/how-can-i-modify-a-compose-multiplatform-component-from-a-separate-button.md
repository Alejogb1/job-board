Okay, let's tackle this. It’s a common scenario, and I’ve certainly been down this road more than a few times across various projects. Coordinating state changes between a composable and an external button in a Compose Multiplatform application isn't inherently straightforward, but it’s definitely achievable with a bit of structured approach. I recall a particularly challenging project involving a real-time data visualization dashboard; we had a central graph composable that had to dynamically update based on user selections in a separate control panel, which, in essence, is the same challenge you're facing.

The key is to establish a mechanism for the button to communicate its intent to the composable, avoiding direct manipulation of the composable’s internal state from the outside. This directly leads us to state management, a fundamental aspect of declarative UI. You shouldn’t try to reach into the composable's internals and directly set its state – that breaks the reactive flow and can make things unpredictable.

Here's what I mean, structured into a few actionable strategies:

**1. State Hoisting & Shared ViewModels:**

My first approach when dealing with this scenario is almost always to centralize the state that influences the composable within a shared *ViewModel* (or equivalent, such as a *Presenter* in an MVI architecture). This means lifting the state up and out of the composable, which makes it shareable and modifiable by the external button.

*   **The Composable:** Your composable becomes a *stateless* representation of the state. It *observes* a mutable state held by the ViewModel and renders its UI based on it.

*   **The Button:** The external button interacts with the ViewModel to *modify* the shared state. The ViewModel, in turn, emits the updated state and triggers recomposition of the composable.

Here’s a practical example using Kotlin, assuming you have a simple toggle button that modifies the visibility of a text element:

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.runtime.*
import androidx.compose.material.*
import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier
import androidx.compose.ui.unit.dp
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.*
import androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel
import androidx.lifecycle.viewModelScope
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.MutableStateFlow
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlow
import kotlinx.coroutines.launch

// ViewModel holding the shared state
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    private val _isVisible = MutableStateFlow(false)
    val isVisible: StateFlow<Boolean> = _isVisible

    fun toggleVisibility() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            _isVisible.emit(!_isVisible.value)
        }
    }
}

// Stateless composable
@Composable
fun MyTextDisplay(isVisible: Boolean) {
    if (isVisible) {
        Text("Hello, World!", modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp))
    }
}

// External button composable
@Composable
fun MyToggleButton(viewModel: MyViewModel) {
    Button(onClick = { viewModel.toggleVisibility() }) {
        Text("Toggle Text")
    }
}

// Usage in a composable
@Composable
fun MainScreen() {
    val viewModel = remember { MyViewModel() }
    val isVisibleState by viewModel.isVisible.collectAsState()

    Column {
      MyTextDisplay(isVisible = isVisibleState)
      MyToggleButton(viewModel = viewModel)
   }
}
```
In this example, `MyTextDisplay` doesn't hold or manage the `isVisible` state; it simply displays text depending on its value. The `MyToggleButton` interacts with `MyViewModel` via `toggleVisibility` to modify the `_isVisible` state, triggering a recomposition of the `MyTextDisplay`.

**2. Callbacks with Lambdas:**

An alternative, though often less scalable for complex state management, is to use callbacks via lambdas. You can pass a function to the composable that can be invoked by the external button. This works well for specific actions, but if you're dealing with multiple related state changes, hoisting via a ViewModel is usually cleaner.

Here’s how it would look:

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.runtime.*
import androidx.compose.material.*
import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier
import androidx.compose.ui.unit.dp
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.*

// Composable accepting a lambda
@Composable
fun MyTextDisplayWithCallback(isVisible: Boolean, onToggle: () -> Unit) {
    Column {
       if (isVisible) {
         Text("Hello, Callback!", modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp))
       }
      Button(onClick = onToggle) {
        Text("Toggle Callback Text")
      }
    }
}

@Composable
fun MainScreenCallback() {
  var isVisible by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

    MyTextDisplayWithCallback(
        isVisible = isVisible,
        onToggle = { isVisible = !isVisible }
    )
}
```

Here, the `MyTextDisplayWithCallback` composable receives a function `onToggle` that the contained button can call. The external controlling composition decides what the `onToggle` function will do with the `isVisible` variable, in this case toggling its value. Note, that this is not strictly a separation of the state, since state manipulation is tied to the composable, but it serves well for some use-cases.

**3. Custom State Holders:**

In cases where you don't need the full complexity of a ViewModel, or are working within a more constrained architecture (like pure Compose without architecture components), custom *StateHolder* objects can provide an alternative. These objects maintain the mutable state and provide methods for interacting with it. You still create a similar separation from the UI, but you're avoiding view model specific code.

Here’s an example of how to achieve that:

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.runtime.*
import androidx.compose.material.*
import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier
import androidx.compose.ui.unit.dp
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.*
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.MutableStateFlow
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlow
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.asStateFlow
import kotlinx.coroutines.launch

// Custom state holder class
class MyStateHolder{
    private val _isBold = MutableStateFlow(false)
    val isBold: StateFlow<Boolean> = _isBold.asStateFlow()

    fun toggleBold() {
        _isBold.value = !_isBold.value
    }
}

// Stateless composable
@Composable
fun MyBoldTextDisplay(isBold: Boolean) {
    val style = if (isBold) { androidx.compose.ui.text.TextStyle(fontWeight = androidx.compose.ui.text.font.FontWeight.Bold) } else { androidx.compose.ui.text.TextStyle() }
    Text("Hello, Custom State", modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp), style=style)
}

// External button composable
@Composable
fun MyBoldToggleButton(stateHolder: MyStateHolder) {
    Button(onClick = { stateHolder.toggleBold() }) {
        Text("Toggle Bold")
    }
}

// Usage in a composable
@Composable
fun MainScreenCustomState() {
    val stateHolder = remember { MyStateHolder() }
    val isBoldState by stateHolder.isBold.collectAsState()

   Column {
        MyBoldTextDisplay(isBold = isBoldState)
        MyBoldToggleButton(stateHolder = stateHolder)
   }
}
```

Here, `MyStateHolder` manages the state with the `_isBold` variable and `toggleBold` function. The UI recomposes when this state change is registered using the flow, allowing a state modification from an external source to update the UI.

**Essential Resources:**

*   **“Jetpack Compose Internals” by Leland Richardson:** This book provides deep dive into how Compose works under the hood, and why these design patterns are beneficial. It helps to understand how state changes trigger recomposition.
*  **"Effective Kotlin" by Marcin Moskała:** This is useful in many aspects, but particularly with an understanding of coroutines and state management.
*   **Google's official Jetpack Compose documentation:** The official documentation is very detailed on state management with examples, and should be the starting point for every compose developer.

In practice, I often find myself gravitating towards using a `ViewModel` for anything beyond simple callbacks due to the inherent scalability benefits in larger projects. My past experiences have hammered home the value of state management and keeping your components as stateless as possible. That’s the key to building maintainable, testable, and scalable Compose applications. So, that's my take on it, informed by years of debugging and refactoring. I hope it helps you navigate your own project effectively.
