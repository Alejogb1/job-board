Okay, let's unpack this. I've seen my fair share of protractor tests throw fits, and the situation you're describing—failure despite seemingly correct conditions—is a classic. It often boils down to a few common culprits. It's rarely the protractor itself being 'wrong,' but rather inconsistencies in timing, element location, or how we're interfacing with asynchronous behavior. Let's break down what can go awry, drawing on some personal experiences from past projects.

First, let's consider the often-underestimated challenge of asynchronous operations in JavaScript and, subsequently, in a test framework like Protractor, which sits on top of WebDriver. Remember the time I was automating a complex, single-page application that aggressively relied on AJAX calls for practically everything? My tests initially looked rock solid, but then started exhibiting intermittent failures that defied logical explanation. I had scenarios where I was testing for a button to be enabled only *after* a data retrieval operation; I had the `expect(button.isEnabled()).toBe(true)` assertion in place, and logically the button should have been enabled before that assertion was evaluated, but it consistently failed despite the correct data eventually loading. The problem wasn't the condition itself; the problem was that Protractor, running at its own pace, would sometimes try to find and check the button *before* the AJAX call completed and the button was actually in an enabled state.

This highlights a crucial point: Protractor doesn't inherently know the *when* of these asynchronous events. This is why relying solely on implicit waits, while somewhat helpful, is often not enough, especially with complex interfaces. Protractor's `browser.waitForAngular()` attempts to address this by pausing execution until Angular's pending HTTP requests are resolved; however, for non-angular or highly customized applications, this can be ineffective. Explicit waits provide us with a better way of managing these situations. We need to explicitly tell protractor to wait for specific conditions to be met.

Here’s a code snippet illustrating that difference:

```javascript
// Example 1: Using implicit waits, which can cause intermittent failures.
it('Should fail intermittently with implicit wait', async () => {
  const myButton = element(by.id('myButton'));
  // Assuming the button is enabled after some AJAX operations
  expect(myButton.isEnabled()).toBe(true); // This may fail if the AJAX call is not finished.
});

// Example 2: Using an explicit wait for an element to be clickable.
it('Should pass reliably with explicit wait', async () => {
    const myButton = element(by.id('myButton'));
    const EC = protractor.ExpectedConditions;
    await browser.wait(EC.elementToBeClickable(myButton), 5000, 'Button failed to become clickable within 5 seconds');
    expect(myButton.isEnabled()).toBe(true);
});
```

In example 1, the test simply attempts to assert the button's enabled state without waiting for any specific event. This approach will be flaky at best. In example 2, we use `browser.wait` along with `protractor.ExpectedConditions` to explicitly wait for the button to become clickable. This is crucial. The `elementToBeClickable` condition automatically implies that the button is both present on the page *and* enabled. I found this technique incredibly effective during that problematic project.

Another critical area that often contributes to failed protractor tests is element location ambiguity. Let’s say, I was working on a project with a complex and dynamic table, and had a test designed to verify if a certain cell, based on its text content, is present. The challenge here was the table frequently updated, rearranging rows and columns. My initial strategy of directly selecting elements via css or xpath failed frequently as the table contents shifted.

This is where a deep understanding of element locators comes into play. Relying heavily on brittle css selectors or absolute XPaths can lead to frequent maintenance and test failures. Instead, utilizing element attributes like `data-testid` or `data-cy` for elements specifically intended for testing is a more robust solution. Let's revisit the table issue to make this more concrete. Instead of relying on fragile selectors like `element(by.css('table tr:nth-child(3) td:nth-child(2)'))`, a more suitable approach would involve using custom attributes that remain consistent despite DOM restructuring. Also, avoiding `element.all` when a specific element is needed; `element` already resolves to the first element found, so when multiple elements might match your locator, using `element` can lead to unexpected behaviors.

Here is an example of more robust element finding strategy:

```javascript
// Example 3: Element finding based on text and custom attributes

it('Should reliably find and interact with elements based on text and custom attributes', async () => {
  const myCell = element(by.xpath(`//td[@data-testid="table-cell" and contains(text(), "Desired Text")]`));
    const EC = protractor.ExpectedConditions;

    await browser.wait(EC.presenceOf(myCell), 5000, 'Table cell failed to become present within 5 seconds');

  expect(myCell.isDisplayed()).toBe(true);
  });
```

In the example above, instead of css selectors relying on positional information, we are using a combination of an attribute identifier `data-testid` and the `contains` function within an xpath to robustly pinpoint a cell even when its position in the DOM changes. We use an explicit wait with `presenceOf` to make sure the element exists before trying to do assertions on it.

Beyond these code-level considerations, environment discrepancies can also cause protractor failures that appear to contradict expectations. One example was when we had a test that worked flawlessly in the development environment but failed on our staging server. The reason turned out to be subtle variations in browser settings or even differences in the browser versions between environments. These disparities, though seemingly minor, can have a noticeable impact on how elements are rendered and how the browser behaves. The lesson here is to ensure that testing environments closely resemble the production configuration. Always check for console errors in your target browser to identify potential issues with the test environment itself, before looking into the code.

To further deepen your understanding, I would recommend exploring the 'WebDriver' spec (W3C Recommendation) to have a better idea of how browser automation really works under the hood. For specific protractor practices, the official Protractor documentation is always a valuable source, but for a more general grounding on testing, consider reading 'Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams' by Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory.

In conclusion, when protractor tests are failing despite what you believe to be valid conditions, focus on these areas: asynchronous behavior management, element location strategy, and discrepancies across testing environments. Explicit waits, along with using consistent custom element attributes and careful selection of element locators is often key to more robust and reliable tests. By methodically addressing these potential pitfalls, you can create a test suite that is not only more reliable but also easier to maintain. It's about more than just writing code; it's about understanding the intricacies of the technology and the environment.
