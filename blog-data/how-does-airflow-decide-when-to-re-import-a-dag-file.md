Alright, let's tackle this one. It's a core aspect of Airflow that I've debugged more times than I care to remember, especially back in the early days of our data platform build. Understanding *how* Airflow decides to re-import a DAG file, and consequently refresh its definition, is key to avoiding a lot of head-scratching. Let me break it down, focusing on the practical bits and explaining how it works, instead of just regurgitating the documentation.

Fundamentally, Airflow's DAG parsing process is a bit more nuanced than simply "every time something changes." It's designed to balance responsiveness to modifications with the need to avoid overwhelming the scheduler and webserver. It’s not like a live-reload tool that monitors file changes constantly. Instead, it employs a system that primarily relies on timestamps, specifically the file modification time.

The core loop involves the `DagFileProcessorManager` and the individual `DagFileProcessor` instances. Each `DagFileProcessor` essentially watches a specific DAG file. The manager periodically checks if the modification time of the file is different from the time it last processed the file. If it is, then the DAG file is parsed again. This check interval isn’t continuous, it's governed by a configuration setting, usually referred to as `dag_dir_list_interval` in `airflow.cfg`, which defaults to 30 seconds.

Therefore, if you modify your dag file, that modification time needs to be newer than the last time it was parsed, and the scheduler must be at or after the `dag_dir_list_interval` before it will register that it needs re-parsing. What happens next? It actually loads the dag into a parsing process and the information, if valid, gets stored in the database as a dag record.

Now, things get interesting because, while the file’s modification time is the primary trigger, there are other factors at play. Airflow utilizes a cache, to some extent, for DAG definitions. But, the cache is invalidated during the described check. This is primarily to reduce disk reads and parsing, which can be resource-intensive, especially in environments with many complex DAGs.

The actual re-parsing involves the Python interpreter executing the DAG file. If the DAG has a dependency, this too can slow down the refresh process. If, for some reason, your dag file is syntactically incorrect after an edit, you'll notice an error in the Airflow logs but, crucially, the previous good record will still remain, until the errors are fixed. This can sometimes be confusing and can be difficult to track down if you don’t know to check the logs.

The process itself can also be influenced by configuration parameters like the number of DAG processors (`dag_processor_manager_process_count`), which control how many parallel processes are dedicated to parsing DAG files. Increasing this can help, especially when you have a lot of DAGs or complex ones that take longer to parse, but it does use more resources. So it's a balancing act.

Let's look at some code examples to illustrate. The following are not complete implementations (as Airflow’s codebase is significantly large), but they do provide a conceptual understanding of the mechanics involved.

**Example 1: Simplified file check logic**

This example showcases the high-level logic for a file check using Python's `os` and `datetime` modules. It simulates the process within the DagFileProcessor.

```python
import os
import time
from datetime import datetime

def needs_reparse(file_path, last_modified_time):
    """
    Checks if a file needs re-parsing based on its modification time.
    """
    current_mod_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(file_path))
    if current_mod_time > last_modified_time:
       return True, current_mod_time
    return False, last_modified_time

# Simulate file modification
file_path = "my_dag.py"
with open(file_path, "w") as f:
    f.write("print('Initial DAG')")
    initial_mod_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(file_path))

time.sleep(2)  # Simulate time passing
with open(file_path, "a") as f:
    f.write("\nprint('Updated DAG')")

needs_reparse_flag, last_checked = needs_reparse(file_path, initial_mod_time)
print(f"Needs reparsing? {needs_reparse_flag}. Last checked: {last_checked}")

```

In this simplified version, the `needs_reparse` function checks if the last modified time is indeed older than what we have. This mimics, at a very basic level, what the `DagFileProcessor` does. This will return true when the file is updated, which would trigger re-parsing.

**Example 2: Conceptual DAG Processor Manager**

This is more conceptual, showing how the manager would interact with the individual processors. Again, this is not a 1-to-1 with the real Airflow implementation.

```python
import time
import os
from datetime import datetime
import threading

class DagFileProcessor:
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.last_modified_time = datetime.min
        self.is_processing = False

    def needs_reparse(self):
        current_mod_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(self.file_path))
        if current_mod_time > self.last_modified_time:
           return True, current_mod_time
        return False, self.last_modified_time

    def process_dag(self):
        self.is_processing = True
        print(f"Processing DAG {self.file_path}...")
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate parsing
        self.is_processing = False

class DagFileProcessorManager:
    def __init__(self, dag_files):
        self.processors = [DagFileProcessor(file) for file in dag_files]
        self.interval = 2 # Interval in seconds
        self.running = True

    def run(self):
        while self.running:
            for processor in self.processors:
              if not processor.is_processing:
                needs_reparse_flag, modified_time = processor.needs_reparse()
                if needs_reparse_flag:
                   processor.last_modified_time = modified_time
                   processor_thread = threading.Thread(target=processor.process_dag)
                   processor_thread.start()
            time.sleep(self.interval)

    def stop(self):
        self.running = False

# Example Usage
dag_files = ["dag1.py", "dag2.py"]
for dag_file in dag_files:
    with open(dag_file, "w") as f:
        f.write("# initial dag file")

manager = DagFileProcessorManager(dag_files)
manager_thread = threading.Thread(target=manager.run)
manager_thread.start()

time.sleep(5)  # Give time for the manager to execute and the thread to start

with open(dag_files[0], "a") as f:
    f.write("# dag file updated")

time.sleep(5)  # Allow time for new parse

manager.stop()
manager_thread.join()
print("Manager stopped.")
```

This example shows how a manager might check each file and trigger a reparse if needed. Note the use of threading to simulate concurrent parsing.

**Example 3: Simplified cache invalidation**

This is another conceptual one, that represents a simple cached view of parsing. The actual cache is a much more complicated mechanism, but this hopefully gives the idea.

```python
import time
import os
from datetime import datetime

class DagCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}

    def get_dag(self, file_path):
        if file_path in self.cache:
           return self.cache[file_path]
        return None

    def update_dag(self, file_path, dag_info):
        self.cache[file_path] = dag_info

    def invalidate_dag(self, file_path):
       if file_path in self.cache:
          del self.cache[file_path]

# Simulated processing that gets put in the cache
def _parse_dag(file_path):
    print(f"Parsing DAG {file_path}")
    time.sleep(1)
    return {"name": file_path, "version": 1}


# Basic simulation of the processor interacting with the cache
def process_dag_with_cache(file_path, cache):
   dag_from_cache = cache.get_dag(file_path)
   if dag_from_cache:
       print(f"DAG from cache: {dag_from_cache}")
   else:
       print(f"Parsing DAG and updating cache: {file_path}")
       dag_info = _parse_dag(file_path)
       cache.update_dag(file_path, dag_info)
       print(f"DAG cached: {dag_info}")


# setup a basic cache with a mock dag
dag_file = "test_dag.py"
with open(dag_file, "w") as f:
    f.write("# Initial DAG")

dag_cache = DagCache()
process_dag_with_cache(dag_file, dag_cache)
process_dag_with_cache(dag_file, dag_cache)

# Update the file, and invalidate the cache.
time.sleep(2)
with open(dag_file, "a") as f:
    f.write("# Updated DAG")

dag_cache.invalidate_dag(dag_file)
process_dag_with_cache(dag_file, dag_cache) # This will force a re-parse

```

This illustrates that the cached dag will be used until the file is updated, and the cached dag is then invalidated.

For further reading, I highly recommend exploring the official Airflow documentation, specifically the sections on DAG loading and the scheduler. You should also look into the source code of the `DagFileProcessor` class, the `DagFileProcessorManager` in the Airflow repository directly (it’s in Python, which makes it quite accessible). Also, a good resource to consult would be “Python Cookbook” by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones to understand the more complicated python concepts and threading I've discussed. Understanding the underlying mechanisms will drastically improve your Airflow debugging skills.
