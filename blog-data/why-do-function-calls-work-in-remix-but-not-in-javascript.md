Okay, let's tackle this one. It's a question that brings up some crucial differences in how environments handle code execution, something I've definitely had to navigate a few times over the years, particularly when initially moving from purely front-end JavaScript to incorporating more specialized environments like those found in smart contract development.

Essentially, the core of the issue isn't about function calls *not* working in JavaScript. They certainly do. It's more about the context and execution environment specific to Remix, a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) primarily used for developing smart contracts written in Solidity (and sometimes Vyper). When you see a function 'call' working in Remix that doesn't seemingly translate directly to JavaScript, it's often because Remix is leveraging its internal tooling to interact with the compiled contract on an emulated or actual blockchain, not directly executing JavaScript within a browser context.

Think of it this way: JavaScript (as run in a browser or node.js environment) operates on a fairly standard model of in-memory execution and variable manipulation. We invoke functions, they execute, and they return values, all happening within the confines of that runtime. Remix, on the other hand, when interacting with smart contracts, isn’t just running JavaScript code; it’s building transactions that get sent to a blockchain and interacting with the data stored on that chain based on the state of the contract.

This difference becomes obvious when we consider what happens when you 'call' a smart contract function. In solidity, functions are declared as either `view` (or `pure`) functions – these typically only read data from the contract and don’t change the state of the blockchain, or as modifying functions, which can alter contract state. When you call a 'view' function, Remix can often simulate the call locally. But when you call a function that modifies the blockchain state, Remix is not just executing it; it’s creating a transaction that needs to be mined and validated on the blockchain. This is where the disconnection between what you might expect from a traditional JavaScript environment and what you see in Remix becomes apparent.

Let me illustrate this with some practical examples and code snippets, based on situations I’ve encountered.

**Example 1: A simple 'view' function**

Let's say you have a solidity smart contract with the following function:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint public storedData;

    function getStoredData() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

In Remix, when you deploy this contract, you'll see a button associated with the `getStoredData` function. Clicking that button will execute that function call in a simulated manner. Remix interacts with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), reading the `storedData` value. This is not the same thing as executing JavaScript code. It's a special kind of 'call' to the blockchain itself.

You cannot write a JavaScript equivalent function that can directly interact with this `getStoredData`. To access this data from a traditional web application (using, say, web3.js), you have to do something like this (note this is only conceptual, and assumes `web3` is appropriately configured):

```javascript
// Assume web3 and contract instance are already set up

async function fetchStoredData() {
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractAbi, contractAddress); // assuming contractAbi and contractAddress exist
    const data = await contract.methods.getStoredData().call();
    console.log("Stored Data:", data);
}

fetchStoredData();
```

The `.call()` in this JavaScript snippet is not the same as the button click in remix. It's using the web3.js library to communicate with the blockchain via JSON-RPC request. It's a more verbose process because, to interact with the contract, we need to send a request to the blockchain node using JSON-RPC, which gets handled by web3. This, again, highlights the contrast. JavaScript is issuing instructions to *a library* that speaks to the blockchain, not directly executing the function locally.

**Example 2: A state-modifying function**

Now let’s consider a function that changes the blockchain state:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint public storedData;

    function setStoredData(uint _newData) public {
        storedData = _newData;
    }
}
```

In Remix, calling the `setStoredData` function will not simply return the new state. Instead, it submits a transaction to the blockchain, and the new value of `storedData` is only valid after the transaction has been mined and confirmed by the network. It’s a completely different process compared to simply assigning a variable in a traditional JavaScript context.

The JavaScript equivalent would be more involved:

```javascript
async function updateStoredData(newData) {
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractAbi, contractAddress);
    const tx = await contract.methods.setStoredData(newData).send({from: accountAddress}); // assuming accountAddress exists

    console.log("Transaction Hash: ", tx.transactionHash); //transaction hash
    //the state will change only after the transaction has been mined
}

updateStoredData(42);
```

In this case, the `send()` method in web3.js broadcasts a transaction, which modifies state on the blockchain. You cannot write equivalent javascript that changes state like this. The JavaScript code interacts with the blockchain network.

**Example 3: Complex Data Types**

Let's say our smart contract has a function returning a more complex type, like an array.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ComplexData {
  uint[] public numbers = [1,2,3];

    function getNumbers() public view returns (uint[] memory){
        return numbers;
    }
}
```

Remix allows for easy interaction with this return data by displaying it directly after the function execution. JavaScript interaction, using web3, however needs to parse the returned value from the JSON-RPC response to properly access the data, much like the examples we have covered previously.

```javascript
async function fetchNumbers() {
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractAbi, contractAddress);
    const returnedNumbers = await contract.methods.getNumbers().call();

    console.log("Numbers:", returnedNumbers); //will log an array [ '1', '2', '3' ]
}
fetchNumbers()

```

The `web3.js` library handles the process of converting blockchain specific data formats to corresponding javascript data types, as the values returned from an ethereum node are not natively javascript objects. This highlights, again, how the Remix interaction is a higher level abstraction than raw javascript with library usage.

In summary, the perceived difference in function calls isn’t about JavaScript ‘failing’ to execute functions. It's a matter of fundamentally different operating environments. Remix isn't running JavaScript in a traditional manner; it is using an abstraction layer over blockchain interaction. JavaScript by itself does not inherently understand how to communicate with the blockchain like Remix does. For that it requires a library like `web3.js` or `ethers.js`, and its behavior is quite different when interacting with the blockchain compared to standard variable assignment and function calls in-memory.

If you want to delve further into this, I would recommend diving deeper into the Ethereum Yellow Paper for a formal specification of the EVM, as well as the documentation for web3.js (or ethers.js). "Mastering Ethereum" by Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood is also a great resource for understanding the more nuanced details of how smart contracts work. These will give a far more thorough and deep understanding of how these different environments interact and contrast.
