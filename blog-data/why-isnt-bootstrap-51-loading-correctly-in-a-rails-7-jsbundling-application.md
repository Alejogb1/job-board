Okay, let's unpack this. I've spent my fair share of time debugging front-end asset pipelines, especially when integrating frameworks like Bootstrap into Rails. The issue you're seeing with Bootstrap 5.1 not loading correctly in a Rails 7 JSBundling application often boils down to a few common culprits. It's rarely a single, glaring error, but rather a combination of setup nuances that can throw things off. Based on my experience, here’s what we should consider, moving step-by-step:

First, let's clarify what we mean by “not loading correctly.” Are we seeing no styling at all, partially applied styles, or perhaps console errors related to missing components? These details are critical to diagnosing the issue. Let's assume, for now, you're seeing minimal styling and that JavaScript-based Bootstrap components aren't working.

The introduction of JSBundling in Rails 7 was a significant shift. We've moved away from the traditional Sprockets asset pipeline for javascript to using tools like `esbuild`, `webpack`, or `rollup`. This means that the way we include and reference our assets, especially external libraries like Bootstrap, has also changed. A common mistake here is misunderstanding how these bundlers handle dependencies and how those are pulled into the application.

One of the primary reasons for Bootstrap failure with JSBundling stems from improper import statements and dependency management. Bootstrap 5 relies on Popper.js for tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns. If Popper.js isn't correctly included in the bundle, those components will fail silently, leading to some frustrating debugging. Let's examine that.

The first step is ensuring Bootstrap and its dependencies are correctly installed. Using npm or yarn, you'd typically execute:

```bash
npm install bootstrap @popperjs/core
```
or
```bash
yarn add bootstrap @popperjs/core
```

Now the critical part: importing the CSS and Javascript into your project. If you've simply included a `<link>` tag in your layout referencing a locally served file, but haven't actually *bundled* the CSS and JS using the JSBundler, it's not going to work as expected.

Here’s how we need to adjust. A typical import strategy inside your `app/javascript/application.js` (or similar file) would look something like this:

```javascript
// app/javascript/application.js

import * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap';
import "@popperjs/core"; // Explicitly import popper

// Optional, to load CSS, if not using external stylesheet
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'

// Optional: Example of initialising a tooltip
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const tooltipTriggerList = document.querySelectorAll('[data-bs-toggle="tooltip"]')
    const tooltipList = [...tooltipTriggerList].map(tooltipTriggerEl => new bootstrap.Tooltip(tooltipTriggerEl))
});
```
Let me clarify a few points. This code explicitly imports everything in bootstrap (it's an object containing all Bootstrap’s modules) and also specifically imports "@popperjs/core" for necessary components. The `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'` is only necessary if you want to import Bootstrap CSS via your javascript bundler; you can also directly link to the compiled css in your `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` via a stylesheet link. The "DOMContentLoaded" block ensures the tooltip code doesn't execute until the full page has loaded, a common mistake that can lead to errors.

However, importing all of Bootstrap may lead to a bloated bundle if you're not using all of the components. This is where more refined importing comes in. Here is another variation of the `application.js` file.

```javascript
// app/javascript/application.js

import { Tooltip, Popover, Collapse } from 'bootstrap';
import "@popperjs/core";

// CSS import can be here or elsewhere, not in a javascript file.
// import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const tooltipTriggerList = document.querySelectorAll('[data-bs-toggle="tooltip"]')
    const tooltipList = [...tooltipTriggerList].map(tooltipTriggerEl => new Tooltip(tooltipTriggerEl))

    const popoverTriggerList = document.querySelectorAll('[data-bs-toggle="popover"]')
    const popoverList = [...popoverTriggerList].map(popoverTriggerEl => new Popover(popoverTriggerEl))
});

```
Here, we are selectively importing only the specific components (Tooltip, Popover, and Collapse) we need, potentially reducing bundle size. I've also shown another way of initializing the tooltips and popovers, this time instantiating their respective classes from the import statements rather than from a main `bootstrap` object. The specific method used here depends entirely on your needs.

Finally, let’s address a common issue concerning version conflicts or misaligned dependency versions. If the version of Bootstrap you are referencing doesn't exactly match the version of Popper you've installed (or are configured with) in your project, it might cause conflicts that manifest as unresponsive components or layout issues. Check your `package.json` file and ensure you've specified compatible versions. It's also worth checking your `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` files to ensure you've actually installed the exact dependency versions expected. These locks files can sometimes cause confusion. I once spent a few hours troubleshooting a similar issue that stemmed from an unexpected version conflict that was locked via yarn, so it’s always worth verifying.

Also, avoid mixing approaches, such as including bootstrap via CDN links and also through the JSbundler. This can create conflicts with CSS and javascript objects. It is advisable to choose one, and stick with that method.

Here's a simplified version of the layout file to make sure you are loading bootstrap correctly, remember to remove `<%= javascript_include_tag "application", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>` from the layout if you are using the new javascript bundler:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Your Application Title</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%= csp_meta_tag %>

    <%# If you don't want to import via the javascript bundle %>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag "application", defer: true %>
  </head>

  <body>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you want to dive deeper into Javascript bundling with Rails, I recommend reading the official Rails documentation thoroughly, particularly the section on javascript bundling with `esbuild`, `webpack`, or `rollup`. They provide excellent guides and examples. You may find the book "Agile Web Development with Rails 7" by David Heinemeier Hansson to be very helpful. Also, the official Bootstrap documentation will clearly explain the dependencies and components needed for its proper functioning. Look at the version-specific documentation.

To summarize, most problems stem from incorrect imports, missing dependencies (Popper.js), version mismatches, or confusion regarding the way Rails 7 uses JSBundling as a whole. The three code snippets provided illustrate common implementations, and each one handles specific needs, therefore you might need a combination of them. Start with the most basic setup and progressively introduce more complex features as needed. Start by verifying your imports, ensure popper is included, and verify the versions and you should be in good shape.
