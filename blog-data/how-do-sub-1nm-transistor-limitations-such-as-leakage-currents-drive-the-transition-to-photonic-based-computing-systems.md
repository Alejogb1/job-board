 so you wanna know about sub-1nm transistors and why we're looking at light for computing right  It's kinda crazy how small things are getting  Like seriously imagine a transistor smaller than a single atom that's the kind of scale we're talking about  And that's where things get weird  because at that size the laws of physics start to change a bit  

The biggest problem with these tiny transistors is leakage current  Think of it like this  you've got a tiny pipe trying to control water flow  but the pipe is so small that water leaks out everywhere  its not very efficient right  In transistors its electrons leaking between the parts they are not supposed to be in That leakage wastes energy heats things up and makes the transistors unreliable its a big problem

Now with electrons getting super duper close to each other in these tiny transistors another issue appears quantum tunneling This is essentially the electrons teleporting through barriers they're not supposed to get through its like magic but also a pain in the neck for building reliable computers  These problems get worse and worse as we shrink them  

So what's the solution well many people think the answer lies in photons  particles of light  They don't suffer from the same problems as electrons at these scales  Photons don't really interact with each other much unless you force them to using specific materials or structures  they travel fast and don't leak as much so you can have much more precise control  and this is way better for computing

But switching to photonics isn't as simple as just replacing electrons with photons  we need to completely rethink how computers are built We need new components new ways to store and process information  Its a huge undertaking  think of it as rebuilding the entire computer from the ground up  

One of the key challenges is building efficient light sources and detectors that work at the scale we need  we're talking about sources that are super tiny and consume very little power  researchers are exploring various options including nanophotonic structures and quantum dots which are tiny crystals that emit light when excited by electricity.

Another big hurdle is developing effective ways to route and manipulate light on a chip  electrons can be easily controlled using electric fields but light needs something else   we use waveguides tiny channels that guide light to where it needs to go  these waveguides need to be extremely precise to minimize light loss  and we also need switches to control the light flow  think of optical transistors that can turn the light on and off quickly and efficiently  this is a hugely active area of research  lots of different materials and designs are being investigated  

And finally  there's the issue of interfacing between the electronic and photonic parts of a computer  we need ways to efficiently convert signals between electrons and photons  This involves things like modulators which convert electronic signals into light and detectors which do the reverse  Again this is a huge challenge involving various material science and device engineering techniques


Lets look at some code examples  these are simplified of course  but they illustrate the kind of challenges we face

First  modeling leakage current in a transistor  this would involve solving some pretty nasty differential equations usually using numerical methods like finite element analysis  but here is a basic python idea  remember its just an illustrative example

```python
import numpy as np

# Simplified model of leakage current
def leakage_current(voltage, temperature):
  # This is a very simplified model â€“ in reality, it's far more complex.
  # k_b is Boltzmann's constant.
  k_b = 1.38e-23
  return 1e-9 * np.exp(-voltage / (k_b * temperature))

# Example usage:
voltage = 0.1  # Volts
temperature = 300  # Kelvin
current = leakage_current(voltage, temperature)
print(f"Leakage current: {current:.2e} A")
```


Next  simulating light propagation in a waveguide this usually involves solving Maxwell's equations using techniques like finite difference time domain or beam propagation methods  Again this is a simplified representation


```python
import numpy as np

# Simplified simulation of light propagation in a waveguide.
def propagate_light(light_intensity, waveguide_loss):
  # This is a highly simplified model.  Real-world simulations
  # are far more computationally intensive.
  return light_intensity * np.exp(-waveguide_loss)

# Example usage
light_intensity = 1.0  # Arbitrary units
waveguide_loss = 0.1  # Arbitrary units
final_intensity = propagate_light(light_intensity, waveguide_loss)
print(f"Final light intensity: {final_intensity:.2f}")
```


And finally a tiny piece of code illustrating the electronic to optical conversion  This would involve detailed modeling of a specific modulator device which is very complex   but you get the idea


```python
#Simplified electro-optic modulation
def modulate_light(voltage, light_intensity):
  #simple linear modulation
  modulation_index = 0.5 #arb unit
  return light_intensity*(1+modulation_index*voltage)
#example
voltage = 0.2
light =1
modulated_light = modulate_light(voltage,light)
print(f"Modulated light {modulated_light}")
```

These examples show how much more complex it is to work with light compared to electrons you would need much more sophisticated tools and knowledge of electromagnetism and optics


To dive deeper I suggest looking at  "Fundamentals of Photonics" by Saleh and Teich  This book provides a comprehensive overview of the principles of optics and photonics  It's a classic and pretty thorough  For more computational aspects you could check out numerical methods books  and papers from conferences like CLEO and OFC  They are great for current research  Also exploring books on nanoscale physics and quantum mechanics would give you a much better grasp of the underlying physical limitations  Its a vast and intricate field and tons of research is constantly being carried out  but hopefully this gives you a decent start  Good luck  This is a fascinating area of research  Lots of fun problems to work on.
