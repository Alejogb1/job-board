, let's unpack why your Express controller code might not be behaving asynchronously as you expect. This is a pattern I've seen crop up quite a bit, and usually, it boils down to a few core issues. From the outset, let's understand that Node.js, and by extension Express, operates on a single-threaded event loop. This design leverages non-blocking I/O to achieve concurrency; however, it doesn't magically make all operations asynchronous. It's all in how you structure your code, particularly within your controller actions. I've personally spent more than a few late nights debugging similar scenarios during a project involving a high-volume API for a legacy e-commerce platform. We thought we had asynchronous handling locked down, but performance bottlenecks revealed a few crucial gaps, which I'll detail below.

The first, and perhaps most common, culprit is the accidental use of synchronous operations within an asynchronous context. When I say "synchronous operation," I'm referring to actions that block the event loop until they complete. Imagine an express controller doing a heavy computation within a for loop directly, or accessing a database with a synchronous library. These actions prevent the event loop from moving onto other tasks, effectively forcing your server to process each request sequentially, which completely negates the benefits of asynchronous behavior. This often happens subtly; for instance, using synchronous file system operations (`fs.readFileSync`) when you should be using the asynchronous counterparts (`fs.readFile`).

To illustrate, consider a flawed controller action:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function getUserDataSync(req, res) {
    const filePath = `/path/to/data/${req.params.userId}.json`;
    try {
      const rawData = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8'); // synchronous!
      const userData = JSON.parse(rawData);
      res.json(userData);
    } catch(error){
      res.status(500).json({message: "Failed to load user data"});
    }
}

app.get('/users/:userId', getUserDataSync);
```

In this snippet, `fs.readFileSync` will stop execution until the file is read, holding up the event loop during that process. It might not be immediately apparent, especially if the file is small and reads quickly. But increase the number of concurrent requests and this synchronous call becomes a significant bottleneck. During my time maintaining that e-commerce platform I saw that impact first hand: slow database queries done synchronously that could stall whole systems.

The second major area that can lead to perceived asynchronous issues is incorrect use of promises or async/await. While these tools help make asynchronous code more manageable, they aren't a silver bullet. I've noticed folks sometimes forget to properly await promises, or they mistakenly use `.then()` without returning the subsequent promise when using chains, or when using async functions without actually having asynchronous operations inside. This results in execution proceeding synchronously, even though the function is technically labeled as async.

Here is an example of an async function called in express, but where an awaited promise is being handled improperly:

```javascript
const someAsyncFunction = () => {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve({status: "success"}), 500);
  });
};

async function processAsyncData(req, res) {
    someAsyncFunction().then((data) => {
        res.json(data) // Wrong usage, the async function is now synchronous
    });
}

app.get('/async-endpoint', processAsyncData);
```

In this case, the express endpoint does not wait for the someAsyncFunction to complete because the `then` clause does not return a promise and the parent `processAsyncData` function does not await any promises. It makes the call asynchronous within the function itself, but not to the caller. The result is that the event loop is not being leveraged effectively.

Lastly, and this is more nuanced, issues may arise from improper handling of asynchronous errors. If an async operation within your controller action fails and you don't handle it properly (using a `try...catch` block with `await` or the `.catch()` method with promises), your server might hang without providing useful feedback, creating the impression of non-asynchronous behavior. Errors can sometimes get swallowed silently, making the root cause difficult to pinpoint. The problem here isn't necessarily that the code isn't running asynchronously; it's that a silent failure leads to unexpected behavior.

Here's an example demonstrating incorrect error handling:

```javascript
const databaseQuery = (query) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (query === "faulty") {
        reject("database error!");
      } else {
        resolve({ data: "query results"});
      }
    }, 200);
  });
};

async function fetchData(req, res) {
    const result = await databaseQuery(req.query.type);
    res.json(result); // If databaseQuery rejects, this code is skipped and no error is sent
}

app.get('/data', fetchData);
```
Here if `req.query.type` is faulty, the `databaseQuery` will reject and an uncaught promise will not allow the `res.json` to be executed and neither will an error message be sent to the client, because of the lack of a proper `try...catch` block.

To rectify these issues, it's essential to embrace non-blocking I/O fully and use asynchronous techniques correctly. Replace synchronous file operations with their asynchronous counterparts (`fs.promises.readFile`), properly await your promises, and handle asynchronous errors gracefully using try/catch blocks. Avoid computations that are CPU intensive within controllers, and try to move this sort of processing to workers.

For deeper understanding, I would recommend looking into "Understanding the Node.js Event Loop" by Bert Belder; this can be a very helpful resource, and for a more complete look, the "Node.js Design Patterns" book by Mario Casciaro, and Luciano Mammino provides excellent practical guidance. These are resources I personally found highly influential as I improved my asynchronous programming in node.js.

In summary, the key to ensuring your Express controllers execute asynchronously lies in avoiding synchronous operations, correctly handling promises with `async/await` or proper `.then()` chains, and diligently managing potential errors. Once those concepts are in place, youâ€™ll find the Node.js event loop is quite effective at its intended purpose.
