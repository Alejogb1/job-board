Alright,  I’ve seen this particular issue crop up more times than I care to remember, especially in Rails projects with complex forms. It’s a situation where you expect nested attributes to come through clean during form submission, but instead, they're just… absent, leaving you scratching your head. The culprit is usually a combination of how Rails handles strong parameters and how the form is constructed. It's not necessarily a 'bug' per se, but more a case of misconfiguration or a misunderstanding of the framework's expectations.

From my experience, these situations commonly arise when dealing with associations – think something like a `User` model having many `Posts`, and you’re trying to create or update both simultaneously through a single form. The nested `posts_attributes` would be the place where those new or updated post records would get their data from. Now, when things go sideways, it often boils down to two primary reasons: improperly configured strong parameters or, occasionally, incorrect field naming conventions within the form itself.

The first, and most frequent, issue is incorrect strong parameter configuration. Rails' strong parameters are designed to prevent mass-assignment vulnerabilities, and they’re quite strict about what data they permit through the controller. Let's say you have a `User` model with a has_many association to `Post`. If you have a form trying to submit both user and nested post data, you need to explicitly permit the `posts_attributes` as well as the attributes *within* those nested posts. Failing to do so, Rails will silently discard those nested parameters. It won't throw an error, which makes it even more frustrating to debug.

Here’s what I've seen go wrong a lot. Someone might have:

```ruby
# user_controller.rb (incorrect)
def user_params
  params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email) # Missing posts_attributes
end
```

In this code snippet, we are explicitly only permitting the `name` and `email` attributes on the user model. Any parameters within the form using `posts_attributes` will be ignored.

To fix this, you need to permit the nested attributes along with the specific attributes that are allowed inside `posts_attributes`. That’s usually accomplished using nested `permit` calls. It's important to understand that Rails expects a specific structure for nested attributes: an array of hashes, usually keyed by the record's numerical ID or a newly generated temporary ID if it is a new nested record.

Here's an example of how to properly configure strong parameters to allow nested attributes using numerical ids, which is commonly used for updating existing records.

```ruby
# user_controller.rb (correct, numerical ids)
def user_params
  params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, posts_attributes: [:id, :title, :content, :_destroy])
end
```

In this revised code, `posts_attributes` is explicitly permitted. Within `posts_attributes`, the `id`, `title`, `content` and `_destroy` attributes are allowed. The `_destroy` parameter is crucial if you want to enable deletion of nested associated records using checkboxes with a specific `_destroy` name. If you are allowing a user to create *new* posts, but not update existing ones from the same form, then you will not include `id` in your permitted attributes since a new record will not yet have an id. In such a case, the nested parameters will also be submitted as an array of hashes, with new record hashes not including an `id`. I find this is a very common mistake made, especially when starting out.

Now, the second issue, albeit less frequent, relates to the naming conventions used in the form. Rails expects specific names for input fields corresponding to associations when they're nested. For instance, for `posts_attributes`, the form fields must conform to a predictable pattern, typically based on the association name. Rails uses a specific convention for nested form fields so that it understands what is being passed to it. For nested *new* records, the form fields will often be an array of hashes where there are not existing records, so they will have randomly assigned numerical keys, similar to what would be seen with something like javascript generating the HTML for you. It’s essential to have the correct name, and that name must match what you are referencing in your strong parameters. It is critical to make sure they align, or rails will simply ignore your parameters as something it doesn't understand.

Here is an example of how your form might look when attempting to *create* new posts:

```html
<!-- _form.html.erb -->
<%= form_with(model: @user, local: true) do |form| %>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :name %>
    <%= form.text_field :name %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :email %>
    <%= form.email_field :email %>
  </div>

    <h3>Posts</h3>
    <div id="posts-fields">
      <%= form.fields_for :posts_attributes, @user.posts.build do |post_form| %>
        <div class="nested-post">
          <%= post_form.label :title, "Post Title" %>
          <%= post_form.text_field :title %>
          <%= post_form.label :content, "Post Content" %>
          <%= post_form.text_area :content %>
          <div class="remove-post">
            <%= post_form.check_box :_destroy %>
            <%= post_form.label :_destroy, "Remove Post" %>
          </div>
        </div>
      <% end %>
    </div>
  <div>
    <%= form.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

In this form, it’s crucial that `posts_attributes` is passed to `form.fields_for`. The naming within this method then constructs the proper parameters for Rails. Notice that for new records being created, they do not have an associated `id`. If you are updating existing records, the HTML name attributes will have a number preceding the attribute. For instance, instead of `user[posts_attributes][][title]`, you might see `user[posts_attributes][0][title]` if the post had an id of '0', or similar. For new records, the array key will be empty instead of an integer. So the nested parameters will arrive as an array of hashes, where each hash is a post and its key/value pairs representing attributes. The `form.fields_for` method takes care of creating these appropriate form fields.

While the example above illustrates an approach for single new post, I often use a Javascript solution for adding additional posts using the same approach, where you use an HTML template for the nested post that gets added when the user clicks a button. This then allows the user to dynamically add any number of nested posts.

To further solidify your understanding, I'd suggest delving into some authoritative resources. David Heinemeier Hansson’s *Agile Web Development with Rails* remains a cornerstone. Pay close attention to the chapters detailing forms, strong parameters, and nested resources. Additionally, for a deeper dive into the finer details, you could explore the official Rails documentation on active record and action controller, which always includes the most up-to-date and accurate information. Finally, Michael Hartl's *Rails Tutorial* is also a great resource for understanding the various common conventions and practices used when building forms and handling parameters.

In practice, when I encounter missing nested attributes, my troubleshooting process usually involves inspecting the request parameters using Rails' built-in server log output. I’d recommend that you familiarize yourself with reading and understanding these, as it’s invaluable for debugging these kinds of situations. Checking the actual parameters received by the controller versus what I expected to see can quickly pinpoint whether the issue is with the form naming or the strong parameters. If the parameters are arriving as expected but not getting processed properly, then there may be an error within your controller. Most of the time, however, it is the strong parameter section in your controller which is causing the issue. This debugging is also aided by Rails' ability to allow you to print out the `params` within your controller and inspect them during development.

In short, missing `_attributes` in nested parameters isn’t a mysterious occurrence, but rather a result of incorrect configuration, typically in strong parameters or the form field naming. By understanding these mechanisms, you can ensure data flows as expected and avoid those infuriating debugging sessions.
