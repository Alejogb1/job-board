Alright, let's talk about loading page-specific javascript in a Rails 7 application. This is a topic I’ve tackled more times than I care to count, and it’s something that, if handled poorly, can lead to a real mess of spaghetti code. Instead of loading one giant, monolithic javascript file on every page, we need a way to selectively load scripts based on the specific needs of the view. I've seen first-hand what happens when you *don't* do this—performance suffers, debugging becomes a nightmare, and your javascript code becomes extremely hard to maintain. So, let’s break it down, focusing on techniques that I’ve found to be reliable and scalable over the years.

My approach typically revolves around using a combination of data attributes on the `<body>` tag and a bit of clever javascript. It's important to make sure your setup allows for a smooth developer experience as well. In one previous project—a complex e-commerce platform—we had hundreds of distinct views, each requiring varying javascript functionality. Loading everything everywhere was not an option. We opted for this structured approach and found that it significantly improved page load times and code maintainability.

The core idea is this: each view essentially communicates to the javascript which functions or modules are needed. We do this by attaching a `data-controller` attribute to the `<body>` tag in our view layout, and then writing a simple javascript dispatcher that can look for these controller names and conditionally load associated functions.

Let’s start with the Ruby on Rails side of things. In your `application.html.erb` layout, you'll want to modify the `<body>` tag to include a data attribute reflecting the current controller name, for example:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My App</title>
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%= csp_meta_tag %>

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag "application", "data-turbo-track": "reload", defer: true %>
  </head>

  <body data-controller="<%= controller_name.dasherize %>" >
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here, the ruby code `<%= controller_name.dasherize %>` will dynamically insert the name of the current controller, transforming it into a dasherized format. For instance, the `ProductsController` becomes `products-controller`. This data attribute allows our javascript to know exactly what kind of functions to load.

Moving to javascript, we’ll implement a dispatcher that reads this `data-controller` attribute, and then acts on it. I generally create a specific entry file for these controller actions. Let’s assume our entry file is called `controllers.js`. Here is the initial setup:

```javascript
// controllers.js

import * as Turbo from "@hotwired/turbo"

document.addEventListener("turbo:load", () => {
    const body = document.body;
    if (!body) return; // Guard against no body element

    const controllerName = body.dataset.controller;

    if (controllerName) {
      const controllerAction = controllerName.replace('-controller', '')
      import(`./controllers/${controllerAction}`).then(controllerModule => {
        if (controllerModule && controllerModule.init) {
          controllerModule.init(); // Execute the init function
        }
      }).catch(error => {
        console.error(`Failed to load controller: ${controllerAction}`, error);
      });
    }
});


```

This code sets up an event listener that waits for the `turbo:load` event, ensuring our dispatcher runs when Turbo is done rendering the page. It grabs the `data-controller` from the `<body>` tag, and dynamically imports a javascript file located in a `controllers` folder (assuming you organize your scripts this way). The important part here is the dynamic import, `import(\`./controllers/${controllerAction}\`)`. This allows you to load files on demand, not on every page load. It then calls an `init()` function, assuming each controller module has an init function that actually sets things up. This assumes a file structure like so: `assets/javascripts/controllers/products.js`.

Here's an example of what a controller-specific javascript file might look like, in `assets/javascripts/controllers/products.js`:

```javascript
// assets/javascripts/controllers/products.js

function initializeProductSlider() {
    console.log('Product Slider Initializing...');
    const sliderContainer = document.querySelector('.product-slider');
    if (sliderContainer){
        // Imagine actual slider initialization logic here. For instance:
        console.log('... Product slider is now active!');
        // You might use a library like swiper.js, or your own implementation
        // In a real application, this would contain the code to actually initialize
        // the slider
        const images = sliderContainer.querySelectorAll('img');
        images.forEach(image => image.classList.add('slider-item'));
    } else {
        console.warn('Could not find a product slider on this page.');
    }
}

export function init() {
  initializeProductSlider();
}

```

In this example, `initializeProductSlider` is the function containing the javascript that needs to run on the product pages to initialize the slider functionality. Notice the `export function init()`. This is vital because it provides the entry point that the `controllers.js` file expects when using the dynamic import.

Let’s consider another slightly more complex example, a form that needs client-side validation within the `users/edit` page. You'd need a `users.js` controller file as well:

```javascript
// assets/javascripts/controllers/users.js

function setupUserFormValidation() {
    console.log('Setting up user form validation...');
    const userForm = document.getElementById('edit_user');

    if (!userForm) {
      console.warn('Edit user form not found on this page.');
      return;
    }


    userForm.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
        const nameField = userForm.querySelector('#user_name');
        if (!nameField || !nameField.value) {
            alert('Name field is required.');
            event.preventDefault();
        } else {
           console.log('Form is valid and can be submitted.')
        }
    });
  }


export function init() {
  setupUserFormValidation();
}

```
Here the `setupUserFormValidation()` function finds the form by its id and sets up a submit listener to prevent submission if the name is not present. Then we've still got our export `init()` for our dispatcher.

This approach, in my experience, scales incredibly well. Every controller gets its own isolated javascript, and you have clear boundaries between javascript concerns. If a javascript function only relates to a `users` controller, it lives inside of `users.js`, making it far easier to debug and to maintain in the long run. This method avoids loading tons of unused code, and each view essentially only loads exactly what it needs, which really can improve performance in larger applications.

For further reading, I highly recommend checking out "Refactoring to Patterns" by Joshua Kerievsky, for its general software organization principles, and "JavaScript Patterns" by Stoyan Stefanov for best practices in structuring your client-side code. In terms of frameworks for modern JavaScript, the core concepts are consistent, but knowing the libraries you're working with will help. In the Rails ecosystem, exploring Hotwire’s concepts via the official guides and the 'Turbo Handbook' are also recommended reading for understanding how javascript can interact with Turbo.

This detailed explanation should provide a solid foundation for loading page-specific javascript in Rails 7. The key is to keep it organized and load just what is needed for optimal performance and easier maintainability.
