Let's tackle this. I’ve seen this pattern countless times, and “performance hangs under load” in ASP.NET is rarely a single, straightforward issue. It's usually a confluence of factors, and isolating the root cause often requires a methodical approach. Based on my past projects, where we had everything from microservices handling thousands of requests per second to legacy monoliths chugging along, I've pinpointed some common culprits. Essentially, when your methods seem to be hanging under pressure, it's often a problem of resource starvation or bottlenecks in your processing pipeline.

First, let's talk about thread pool exhaustion. ASP.NET utilizes a thread pool to handle incoming requests. If your methods are performing long-running synchronous operations – things like blocking I/O (database calls, external API requests without proper asynchrony, file system access) – you can quickly saturate that pool. When the pool is full, new requests queue, and your application appears to hang because no threads are available to service them. The operating system will eventually start queuing requests, but this adds latency which, under heavy load, is crippling. The symptom is long response times and, eventually, failed requests. I recall one instance where a seemingly simple data import routine, performing file reads sequentially, crippled our entire system during a scheduled task, due to exactly this thread starvation scenario.

Then there's the issue of inefficient database queries. If your methods are hitting the database with poorly optimized queries or are fetching huge datasets that they don’t actually need, the database can become a bottleneck. This, in turn, makes your methods seem slow or unresponsive, as the threads wait indefinitely for database responses. We had a case where a seemingly innocuous call to retrieve user details was executing a full table scan due to a missing index. Under normal load, it was acceptable; under peak, the entire system slowed to a crawl.

Another frequent offender is improper caching. If the same data is constantly being fetched from a database or an external API, instead of utilizing an in-memory cache or distributed cache, your performance suffers significantly. The increased load simply amplifies this inefficiency. A project I worked on initially fetched product details for every request, and once we implemented a simple in-memory caching strategy, we saw a drastic performance improvement.

Furthermore, contention for shared resources (like locks, mutexes, and semaphores) can dramatically impact performance. If a method is waiting to acquire a lock before proceeding, multiple threads can get blocked, and this delay escalates with increased load. A subtle race condition involving writing to shared memory across multiple threads led to an intermittent hang in one particular system that took far too long to debug.

Here are a few code examples to illustrate these points:

**Example 1: Synchronous blocking operation leading to thread pool starvation**

```csharp
public class BadController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet("sync-operation")]
    public IActionResult SyncOperation()
    {
        // Simulate a long-running synchronous operation
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5000); // 5 seconds
        return Ok("Operation completed");
    }
}
```

In this extremely simplified example, `Thread.Sleep` simulates a blocking I/O operation. Under low traffic, it might seem okay, but if you bombard this endpoint with numerous requests, you'll quickly exhaust the thread pool and requests will begin to queue up. The key here is that `Thread.Sleep` is a synchronous blocking operation. The thread processing the request is completely blocked for 5 seconds. In real-world scenarios, this often manifests as blocking calls to filesystems, network resources, or databases.

**Example 2: Database query with poor performance**

```csharp
public class ProductController : Controller
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

    public ProductController(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    [HttpGet("products/{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
    {
         // Inefficient query (imagine no index on ProductId or a full table scan)
         var product = _context.Products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.ProductId == id); // This is simplified
         if (product == null) {
            return NotFound();
         }
         return Ok(product);
    }
}
```

This example illustrates a common issue – a poorly performing database query. Even if the database server is healthy, the query itself is the bottleneck. In real-world applications, joins across multiple tables or complex filter criteria can make this situation far worse. This code would be especially problematic if `ProductId` were not indexed. It's essential to use the database's profiling tools to examine actual execution plans and adjust indexes.

**Example 3: Lack of caching for repetitive data fetching:**

```csharp
public class UserProfileController : Controller
{
    private readonly IUserDataService _userDataService;

    public UserProfileController(IUserDataService userDataService)
    {
         _userDataService = userDataService;
    }

    [HttpGet("profile/{userId}")]
    public IActionResult GetProfile(int userId)
    {
         // The user profile data is fetched every request
         var userProfile = _userDataService.GetUserProfile(userId); // Assume expensive operation
         if (userProfile == null) {
             return NotFound();
         }
         return Ok(userProfile);
    }
}
```

Here, the user profile is fetched from a service layer (`_userDataService`) each time the endpoint is called. In a scenario where the user profile does not change frequently, the lack of caching results in unnecessary calls, leading to substantial overhead. Implementing a simple caching layer (like `MemoryCache` or distributed cache using Redis/Memcached) could improve response times dramatically.

To address the problems illustrated above, it’s imperative to utilize asynchronous programming patterns (the `async`/`await` keywords) to avoid blocking threads. Optimize your database queries using indexes, consider caching where it makes sense to reduce repeated data fetches. And always, always profile your application using tools like dotTrace, the built-in .NET profiler, or others to identify the exact bottlenecks. Furthermore, examine your application for contention on resources.

For deep dives, I strongly suggest reading “CLR via C#” by Jeffrey Richter. It provides an extensive background on thread pools and concurrency. For practical database optimization techniques, "SQL Performance Explained" by Markus Winand is essential. Regarding asynchronous programming in .NET, "Programming .NET Asynchronously" by Stephen Cleary is your best resource. These texts offer a complete, in-depth explanation of the fundamentals and can help avoid most common performance pitfalls.

Remember, performance tuning is a continuous process. Tools and techniques are vital, but understanding the core concepts—threading, asynchronous patterns, database efficiency, and caching—is the foundation of creating performant ASP.NET applications. It's a multi-faceted problem, but methodical analysis is the key to resolution. Don't simply guess; measure, profile, and optimize.
