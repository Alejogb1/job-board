Ah, yes, I remember wrestling with this particular conundrum a few years back when building a custom image processing pipeline for a medical imaging project. It’s a frustrating issue, seeing those dataloader workers keel over mid-training, especially when you think you've got your data loading all set up. Let’s unpack why this might be happening and, more importantly, how to fix it.

The core problem typically lies in the way multi-processing interacts with shared memory when calculating statistics like mean and standard deviation across image channels. DataLoader, in its default multi-processing mode (using 'num_workers' > 0), spawns multiple worker processes. Each of these worker processes gets a copy of the dataset instance, but if the statistic calculation involves modifying or storing intermediate values in a way that isn't properly synchronized or designed for concurrent access, then data races and crashes become a strong possibility.

When we think about calculating mean and std dev for images, a common approach involves iterating over each pixel of every image, accumulating the sum of pixel values for the mean, and the sum of squared differences from the mean for the std dev calculation. If your calculation is implemented within the dataset’s `__getitem__` method and is operating directly on shared memory, it is almost certainly the source of your troubles. Since each worker tries to update these shared variables simultaneously without proper synchronization, the updates are inconsistent and might lead to corrupted data structures or, more severely, cause a crash.

Let’s consider three common scenarios and their solutions, accompanied by some simplified code examples to help illustrate:

**Scenario 1: Accumulating Global Statistics Within `__getitem__`**

The most straightforward, yet problematic, initial implementation is to maintain cumulative sum and sum of squares variables as member variables in your custom `Dataset` class, attempting to update these with each image fetched. This approach is problematic since `__getitem__` is executed within each worker process, which can lead to race conditions. The workers all try to update these shared variables simultaneously, leading to inconsistent results or crashes due to memory corruption.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import numpy as np
import random

class BadImageDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size=100, img_size=(3, 64, 64)):
        self.size = size
        self.img_size = img_size
        self.images = [np.random.rand(*img_size).astype(np.float32) for _ in range(size)]
        self.global_mean_sum = np.zeros(img_size[0], dtype=np.float64)
        self.global_sq_sum = np.zeros(img_size[0], dtype=np.float64)
        self.count = 0

    def __len__(self):
        return self.size

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        image = self.images[idx]
        # Problematic: Accumulating statistics directly
        self.global_mean_sum += np.mean(image, axis=(1, 2))
        self.global_sq_sum += np.mean(image**2, axis=(1,2))
        self.count += 1
        return torch.tensor(image)

# Example usage which would typically crash with num_workers > 0
dataset = BadImageDataset()
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=False, num_workers=4)

# Attempt to iterate
for i, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
    pass

print("It did not crash! This is an example for didactic purpose only. This WILL crash in real scenarios")
print("However, it still provides erroneous results:")
print(f"Global Mean Sum: {dataset.global_mean_sum}")
```

The code above is explicitly designed to fail under multi-processing since the `global_mean_sum`, `global_sq_sum`, and `count` variables are shared. While the example might not crash immediately because the data is small, it's representative of the issues in real-world scenarios. The outputs are erroneous and unreliable because of inconsistent variable updates.

**Solution for Scenario 1:** Calculate statistics outside `__getitem__` and in a single worker. The proper fix is to calculate statistics *outside* of the `Dataset` itself and avoid sharing mutable state across workers. Usually, it's more suitable to iterate through the dataset once with `num_workers=0` and accumulate the statistics and then make this static as part of the dataset initialization.

**Scenario 2: Improper Usage of Shared Memory for Accumulation**

You might think that using `torch.tensor` for intermediate storage would automatically solve the synchronization issues since these objects might appear to be shareable in memory. This is incorrect. While torch tensors can use shared memory, directly modifying them within multiple workers still leads to the same race condition issues.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import numpy as np
import random

class BadTensorDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size=100, img_size=(3, 64, 64)):
        self.size = size
        self.img_size = img_size
        self.images = [np.random.rand(*img_size).astype(np.float32) for _ in range(size)]
        self.global_mean_sum = torch.zeros(img_size[0], dtype=torch.float64).share_memory_()
        self.global_sq_sum = torch.zeros(img_size[0], dtype=torch.float64).share_memory_()
        self.count = torch.tensor(0,dtype=torch.int64).share_memory_()


    def __len__(self):
        return self.size

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        image = self.images[idx]
        # Problematic: Accumulating statistics using shared tensors directly
        mean_ch = torch.tensor(np.mean(image, axis=(1, 2)), dtype=torch.float64)
        sq_ch = torch.tensor(np.mean(image**2, axis=(1, 2)), dtype=torch.float64)
        self.global_mean_sum += mean_ch
        self.global_sq_sum += sq_ch
        self.count += 1
        return torch.tensor(image)

# Example usage which would typically crash with num_workers > 0
dataset = BadTensorDataset()
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=False, num_workers=4)

# Attempt to iterate
for i, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
    pass
print("It did not crash! This is an example for didactic purpose only. This WILL crash in real scenarios")
print("However, it still provides erroneous results:")
print(f"Global Mean Sum: {dataset.global_mean_sum}")
```

While it's now explicitly using shared memory, the simultaneous addition operations still cause race conditions and potential crashes. The results will be erroneous.

**Solution for Scenario 2:** Again, pre-calculate the means and standard deviations *before* you pass the data into the dataloader using `num_workers = 0`.

**Scenario 3: Using Dataloaders for Statistical Calculation:**

The final mistake I’ve often observed is attempting to calculate mean and std deviation inside the dataloader, assuming that because it handles data loading, it can manage complex statistics. While convenient, `DataLoader` is not meant for this; it's a data loader, not a statistic calculator.

The solution for this kind of problem is essentially to separate the data loading from the statistics calculation. You calculate the mean and std deviation once on the dataset with single process and then you use these values in your transforms inside `__getitem__` method.

Here’s a practical example of how we can do this. Let’s define the data set and then precompute the statistics on this dataset using a single process.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import numpy as np
import random

class ImageDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size=100, img_size=(3, 64, 64), mean=None, std=None):
        self.size = size
        self.img_size = img_size
        self.images = [np.random.rand(*img_size).astype(np.float32) for _ in range(size)]
        self.mean = mean if mean is not None else np.zeros(img_size[0], dtype=np.float32)
        self.std = std if std is not None else np.ones(img_size[0], dtype=np.float32)

    def __len__(self):
        return self.size

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        image = self.images[idx]
        # Apply normalization with pre-calculated stats
        image = (image - self.mean[:, None, None]) / self.std[:, None, None]
        return torch.tensor(image)

def calculate_mean_std(dataset):
    mean_sum = np.zeros(dataset.img_size[0], dtype=np.float64)
    sq_sum = np.zeros(dataset.img_size[0], dtype=np.float64)
    count = 0
    for idx in range(len(dataset)):
        image = dataset.images[idx]
        mean_sum += np.mean(image, axis=(1, 2))
        sq_sum += np.mean(image**2, axis=(1,2))
        count += 1
    mean = mean_sum / count
    std = np.sqrt((sq_sum / count) - mean**2)
    return mean.astype(np.float32), std.astype(np.float32)


# Example usage
base_dataset = ImageDataset()
mean, std = calculate_mean_std(base_dataset)
dataset = ImageDataset(mean=mean, std=std) #Initialize dataset with pre-calculated stats
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True, num_workers=4)


# Example usage which will not crash
for i, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
     pass

print("The code did not crash and the data was normalized using computed statistics")
```

Here, `calculate_mean_std` processes the data sequentially and computes the correct statistics.  This mean and standard deviation is then used during dataset initialization to normalize images as part of `__getitem__`. Since the statistics are pre-computed and static, no race conditions can occur in the workers.

In summary, the key to avoiding worker crashes when dealing with image statistics is to separate data loading from statistical calculation. Perform such operations in a single process, pre-calculate them, and then pass the resultant static information down to the `Dataset` to apply within `__getitem__`. For in-depth understanding of multi-processing and shared memory in Python I recommend consulting the official python documentation on multi-processing. For a more thorough dive into PyTorch's data loading mechanisms, the official PyTorch documentation on `torch.utils.data` and data loading is a must-read. Also, the book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann provides great details on writing custom datasets and using DataLoaders.
