,  It's a scenario I've encountered more than a few times in my years working with machine learning models, and while the immediate reaction might be frustration, understanding why a neural network's predictions are exceeding expected values often boils down to several key factors. It's rarely a case of the model simply "being wrong," but rather an indication of a mismatch between the model's internal assumptions and the nature of the data. Let's break down the common culprits and then dive into some concrete examples.

Firstly, one of the most frequent reasons for inflated predictions is **data leakage**. This isn't necessarily about malicious intent; it often stems from unintentional oversight in how data is prepared. Imagine you’re building a model to predict stock prices. If, by mistake, you include future information—perhaps some derived metric that uses tomorrow's close—in your training set, the model learns to exploit this information. It's essentially cheating, and it will result in optimistically inflated results during testing, because that information isn't available when you're actually doing the prediction in a live setting, so it won't generalize well. In essence, your model learns patterns that won't exist in the real world. To address this, rigorous data separation practices are vital; ensure that features are calculated based solely on past information relative to the target variable. Think about time series data—a common source of this particular issue—and always split temporally, instead of randomly.

Another significant factor is **insufficient regularization**. Neural networks, especially deep ones, have the capacity to memorize training data rather than learning generalizable patterns. When regularization is inadequate, the model becomes overly sensitive to minor fluctuations and outliers in the training data, resulting in larger outputs. This overfitting leads to extreme predictions. Techniques such as l1 and l2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping help prevent this. I’ve had a project where the model was predicting user engagement metrics, and it took fine-tuning the dropout rate to effectively prevent the network from fitting to the minor variances in the train data. It was outputting values far higher than the typical observed engagement, and that's what tipped me off.

Furthermore, **improper loss function selection** can lead to issues. If your dataset includes heavy-tailed distributions, using mean squared error (mse) could lead to models that overemphasize the outliers and thus give very large predictions to compensate. Consider a scenario where your target variable represents income data, which is often heavily skewed to the right. With mse, the model is penalized more for large errors in predicting high incomes than errors in predicting lower incomes, resulting in the neural network over-predicting the higher end. Often, metrics such as mean absolute error or even custom loss functions can better reflect the specific characteristics of the prediction task and can mitigate the problem. In such cases, something like the huber loss might help as it is more robust to outliers.

Finally, there is the issue of **unrepresentative training data**. If the distribution of your training data is significantly different from that of your test or real-world data, the model will struggle to generalize and can yield predictions outside the expected range. Imagine training a model on a dataset that predominantly represents customers with mid-range purchasing power, but then deploying it on an audience with diverse economic backgrounds. The model will struggle and produce either under- or over-estimates for customers who don't fit that mould, depending on how the train set is biased. A strategy here might involve stratified sampling during training or using techniques to mitigate the data skewness. We once had a system for predicting server load, and initially, it was dramatically over-predicting high load during quiet hours because the dataset mostly consisted of high load times. Stratified sampling to balance the dataset significantly improved the situation.

Now, let’s look at some code examples to illustrate some of these points. Keep in mind that these are simplified and are meant to be illustrative; production code would include a lot more error checking, logging, parameter tuning, and testing.

**Example 1: Data Leakage**

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# create a sample dataframe
data = {'day': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        'sales': [100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# create a 'future' feature; this is incorrect, as it leaks future info
df['next_day_sales'] = df['sales'].shift(-1)
df = df.dropna()

# Splitting into training and testing sets
X = df[['sales']]
y = df['next_day_sales']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Training a simple linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions (This would show that test data is being predicted with good precision, but would do terribly in real life)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

print("Predictions:", predictions)

#correct way (No data leakage)
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
X = df[['day']] # use the day instead of a future value
y = df['sales']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model2 = LinearRegression()
model2.fit(X_train,y_train)
predictions2 = model2.predict(X_test)
print("Correct predictions", predictions2)
```

In the first block of code, the 'next_day_sales' introduces data leakage. The second part shows how to prevent it by using a value that doesn't directly depend on future information.

**Example 2: Insufficient Regularization**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Create dummy data with some noise
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = 2 * X[:, 0] + 3 * X[:, 1] - 1.5 * X[:, 2] + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, size=1000)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model without regularization
model_no_reg = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model_no_reg.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model_no_reg.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Model with l2 regularization
model_l2 = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l2(0.01), input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l2(0.01)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model_l2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model_l2.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)


# Predict and compare (predictions for model_no_reg will be more aggressive).
print("Predictions without Regularization: ", model_no_reg.predict(X_test[:5]))
print("Predictions with L2 Regularization: ", model_l2.predict(X_test[:5]))
```

Here, the first model lacks regularization and will likely overfit, leading to more extreme predictions. The second model implements l2 regularization, which helps mitigate overfitting, resulting in more conservative estimates.

**Example 3: Loss function choice**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Simulate a dataset with outliers
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 1)
y = 2 * X[:, 0] + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, size=1000)
y[np.random.choice(1000, size=50, replace=False)] = y[np.random.choice(1000, size=50, replace=False)] + np.random.normal(5, 5, size = 50) # Introduce outliers

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model with mean squared error
model_mse = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))])
model_mse.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model_mse.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)


# Model with mean absolute error
model_mae = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))])
model_mae.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mae')
model_mae.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

print("Predictions with MSE: ", model_mse.predict(X_test[:5]))
print("Predictions with MAE: ", model_mae.predict(X_test[:5]))
```

This snippet showcases how models trained on data with outliers will produce different results based on the loss function selected. The mse loss makes the network over-react to these outliers, leading to larger values, whereas the mae loss is more robust.

For further reading on these topics, I’d highly recommend checking out “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. It's an excellent, comprehensive resource covering the theoretical and practical aspects of neural networks. Specifically, sections on regularization and loss functions are pertinent to your query. Also, “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron is another fantastic book that provides practical coding examples, that can solidify your understanding. Lastly, for more information on data leakage, research the different methods for data splitting, with an emphasis on temporal splitting, specifically when handling time series data. Search academic literature on the topic.

In conclusion, predictions from neural networks exceeding expected values aren’t simply random; they’re often traceable to specific issues in data handling, model architecture or loss function selection. By systematically addressing these points, you can improve the stability and reliability of your models.
