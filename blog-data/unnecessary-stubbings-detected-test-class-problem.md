Okay so unnecessary stubbings detected in your test class yeah I've been there man trust me This is a common issue especially when you start getting a bit more complex with your tests and you use mocking frameworks it’s like a right of passage.

Let's break it down from my experience I remember this one project a few years back some big monolithic Java application a real beast you know We had tons of integration tests and unit tests for every single micro-service and the test suites started to get really really slow like you could brew a pot of coffee before they even finished that bad so we started looking at ways to speed things up that's when we really started to deep dive into mocking and well unnecessary stubbing hell started

So basically what's happening is you're setting up mocks that your test actually never uses the mocking framework detects this and says hey dude you're doing extra work for nothing The test probably runs fine it passes sure but its cluttered it's slow it's not great for maintainability or future code change. Imagine you have a class A that depends on class B and class C. You’re trying to unit test class A. You mock both class B and C and then your test only calls methods in class B. The C mock is unnecessary. This sounds simple enough but when your test classes start getting into 100 or 200 or even 500 lines it becomes incredibly hard to spot those redundant stubs. I mean it becomes a nightmare really especially the ones with a single method in a stubbed class that's not being used.

The problem is the mocking frameworks are designed to catch this so you don’t waste time and resources on unnecessary steps in the test setup because that adds overhead both for you and the system. They try to tell you what's up. Sometimes it's because you've copied and pasted code from another test and forgotten to clean it up sometimes it’s because your test is doing too much and not well defined sometimes it's just a simple oversight because it was a late night coding session you know how it goes. You add a mock "just in case" thinking no harm done. Well harm is done.

Now for the solution you need to really analyze your tests understand exactly what methods are being called on each mock in each test. If a mock method is not called in the test then that whole mock probably has to go or at least that stub if other methods from the same mock are used. Keep your tests lean and focused so that makes it easier for you and for others to read understand and maintain.

Here’s a practical example using a Python and a popular mocking library ( `unittest.mock`). Let’s say you have a service class like this:

```python
class ExternalService:
    def get_data(self, key):
        # Pretend this gets data from a database or an external API
        return f"data for {key}"

class MyService:
    def __init__(self, external_service):
        self.external_service = external_service

    def process_data(self, key):
        data = self.external_service.get_data(key)
        return f"processed {data}"

    def another_process_data(self, key, flag):
        if flag:
            data = self.external_service.get_data(key)
            return f"second process {data}"
        return "no process"
```

And here's a bad test with unnecessary stubbing:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from your_module import MyService, ExternalService # replace with your module name

class TestMyService(unittest.TestCase):
   
    @patch("your_module.ExternalService") # replace with your module name
    def test_process_data_with_unnecessary_stub(self, mock_external_service):
        # Unnecessary stub
        mock_external_service.return_value.get_data.return_value = "mocked data"
        # Needed stub
        mock_external_service.return_value.get_data.return_value = "real mocked data"

        service = MyService(mock_external_service)
        result = service.process_data("testkey")
        self.assertEqual(result, "processed real mocked data")
    

    @patch("your_module.ExternalService")  # replace with your module name
    def test_another_process_data_with_unnecessary_stub(self, mock_external_service):
          
        mock_external_service.return_value.get_data.return_value = "mocked data"
        service = MyService(mock_external_service)
        result = service.another_process_data("testkey", False)
        self.assertEqual(result, "no process")
```

The first test has an unnecessary stub because it stubs a return value but overwrites it right afterwards. The second one doesn't even need the mock to execute at all. The mocking framework or the linter might complain about the first one. Now a fixed test:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from your_module import MyService, ExternalService # replace with your module name

class TestMyService(unittest.TestCase):
   
    @patch("your_module.ExternalService") # replace with your module name
    def test_process_data(self, mock_external_service):
        
        mock_external_service.return_value.get_data.return_value = "real mocked data"

        service = MyService(mock_external_service)
        result = service.process_data("testkey")
        self.assertEqual(result, "processed real mocked data")

    @patch("your_module.ExternalService") # replace with your module name
    def test_another_process_data_with_no_mocking_needed(self, mock_external_service):
        service = MyService(mock_external_service)
        result = service.another_process_data("testkey", False)
        self.assertEqual(result, "no process")

    @patch("your_module.ExternalService") # replace with your module name
    def test_another_process_data(self, mock_external_service):
        mock_external_service.return_value.get_data.return_value = "mocked data"
        service = MyService(mock_external_service)
        result = service.another_process_data("testkey", True)
        self.assertEqual(result, "second process mocked data")
```

In this version the first test has only one stub and in the second one we do not do any mocking since it wasn’t needed. The third test shows that sometimes we actually need the stub.

In Java if you are using Mockito it would look like something like this for example:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension;

import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;


class ExternalService {
    public String getData(String key) {
        // Simulate external service call
        return "data for " + key;
    }
}

class MyService {

    private ExternalService externalService;

    public MyService(ExternalService externalService) {
        this.externalService = externalService;
    }


    public String processData(String key) {
        String data = externalService.getData(key);
        return "processed " + data;
    }
    public String anotherProcessData(String key, boolean flag) {
        if (flag) {
            String data = externalService.getData(key);
            return "second process " + data;
        }
        return "no process";
    }
}
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
public class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private ExternalService externalService;

    @InjectMocks
    private MyService myService;


    @Test
    public void testProcessDataWithUnnecessaryStub() {
        // Unnecessary stub
        when(externalService.getData("testkey")).thenReturn("mocked data");
        // Needed stub
        when(externalService.getData("testkey")).thenReturn("real mocked data");
        
        String result = myService.processData("testkey");
        assertEquals("processed real mocked data", result);
    }

      @Test
    public void testAnotherProcessDataWithUnnecessaryStub() {
         when(externalService.getData("testkey")).thenReturn("mocked data");
        String result = myService.anotherProcessData("testkey", false);
        assertEquals("no process", result);
    }

}
```

And the corrected version would be:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension;

import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class ExternalService {
    public String getData(String key) {
        return "data for " + key;
    }
}

class MyService {

    private ExternalService externalService;

    public MyService(ExternalService externalService) {
        this.externalService = externalService;
    }


    public String processData(String key) {
        String data = externalService.getData(key);
        return "processed " + data;
    }

      public String anotherProcessData(String key, boolean flag) {
        if (flag) {
            String data = externalService.getData(key);
            return "second process " + data;
        }
        return "no process";
    }
}
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
public class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private ExternalService externalService;

    @InjectMocks
    private MyService myService;


    @Test
    public void testProcessData() {
         when(externalService.getData("testkey")).thenReturn("real mocked data");
        String result = myService.processData("testkey");
        assertEquals("processed real mocked data", result);
    }
      @Test
    public void testAnotherProcessDataWithNoMocking() {
        String result = myService.anotherProcessData("testkey", false);
         assertEquals("no process", result);
    }
    @Test
    public void testAnotherProcessData() {
        when(externalService.getData("testkey")).thenReturn("mocked data");
        String result = myService.anotherProcessData("testkey", true);
         assertEquals("second process mocked data", result);
    }
}
```
Again the first test has unnecessary stubbings and so does the second one. The fixed test cases have only stubs when needed. Notice that in the second test the mock is not even called so you can simply remove it or if you inject the mock via constructor then you just let the mock not have any behaviour and since the method is never called all good.

As for resources I'd recommend looking into Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring" it has a chapter on test code smells which is very helpful for keeping your test clean and the xUnit Patterns book by Gerard Meszaros is amazing to get some perspective on how to structure your tests. Also check the documentation of your mocking framework the Mockito documentation is very well explained and you’ll find it useful in terms of getting better with mocking strategies and testing patterns. And remember to always check your logs the mocking frameworks usually tell you about unnecessary stubbings so pay attention. I wish they could simply remove the mocks by themselves that would be lovely but I guess we're not there yet. Sometimes I feel like my mocks are talking to me “hey I am here for no reason give me purpose” that would be really funny.

So the best way to fix it is to understand the goal of your test remove the mocks you don’t need keep things simple and be aware of that extra stub when writing code. Keep on testing!
