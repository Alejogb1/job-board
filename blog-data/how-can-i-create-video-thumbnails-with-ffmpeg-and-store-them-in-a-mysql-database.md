Alright, let's tackle this. Creating video thumbnails and managing them within a database is a fairly common requirement, and ffmpeg is definitely the right tool for the job. I’ve spent more than a few late nights wrestling (okay, *working*) with similar pipelines, so I can offer some practical guidance. The key here is to think of this as a two-step process: generating the thumbnail with ffmpeg and then storing it in the MySQL database.

Let's start with ffmpeg. It's incredibly flexible, but for thumbnails, we're typically focusing on a few core functionalities. Specifically, we want to extract a single frame from a video, resize it if necessary, and encode it into a standard image format like jpeg or png. My go-to approach usually involves using a combination of `-ss`, `-vframes`, `-vf`, and of course `-y` to overwrite existing files. The `-ss` flag allows you to specify the point in time you want to grab the frame. The `-vframes` flag lets you indicate the number of frames you wish to extract (in our case just one), and the `-vf` allows for frame filtering, such as scaling.

Here's a snippet of an ffmpeg command I’ve commonly used, and it's a good starting point. Let's say you want a thumbnail from the 10th second of a video, reduced to a width of 320 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio:

```bash
ffmpeg -ss 10 -i input_video.mp4 -vframes 1 -vf "scale=320:-1" -y output_thumbnail.jpg
```

Here, `-ss 10` extracts from the 10th second. `-i input_video.mp4` specifies the input file. `-vframes 1` instructs ffmpeg to output one frame, and the `-vf "scale=320:-1"` resizes the frame to 320 pixels wide, maintaining aspect ratio. `-y` will overwrite if the output file `output_thumbnail.jpg` already exists.

Now, regarding variations, maybe you need to extract from the middle, or maybe you want to force a different aspect ratio. Let’s adjust this a bit for that purpose. You might need to dynamically figure out the video's duration first. Ffmpeg makes this easy too. You could query it with `ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 input_video.mp4`. Let’s assume that returns `120` seconds. To grab a frame from halfway through and force it to 200x200 pixels, ignoring aspect ratio, we could do this:

```bash
ffmpeg -ss 60 -i input_video.mp4 -vframes 1 -vf "scale=200:200" -y output_thumbnail2.jpg
```

The key difference in the command above is that `-ss` now points to the midpoint (60 seconds), and the `scale` filter forces a 200x200 dimension irrespective of aspect ratio. This might cause some distortion, but it’s useful for scenarios where specific sizes are mandatory.

Next, consider the case where you might want to also store it in a specific format, like a png file.

```bash
ffmpeg -ss 30 -i input_video.mp4 -vframes 1 -vf "scale=iw*0.5:ih*0.5" -y output_thumbnail3.png
```
Here we are using `iw*0.5:ih*0.5` to scale the image to half the width and half the height, and save it as a png.

Okay, so now we have a thumbnail image. The next challenge is how to store this in a MySQL database. We're going to be working with a `blob` type for storing the image data itself. There are a few approaches here: either saving the path of the image in the database and storing the image on the file system, or storing the actual binary content of the image in the database itself, inside a `blob` column. I tend to favor storing the blob in database to avoid potential issues regarding file-system synchronization and permissions, assuming that the size of the thumbnail image is not excessively huge (which it really shouldn't be).

For this, you'll need a database structure like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE video_thumbnails (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    video_id INT NOT NULL,
    thumbnail_data LONGBLOB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
```

The `video_id` field would reference the associated video in another table. The `thumbnail_data` uses `LONGBLOB`, a large binary type which can store the image binary data. Now, to insert this data, you'll usually use a programming language, such as python. So let's assume we are using python.

Here’s how you could achieve this using a Python script with `mysql.connector`:

```python
import mysql.connector
import os

def insert_thumbnail(video_id, image_path, db_config):
    try:
        with open(image_path, 'rb') as image_file:
            image_data = image_file.read()

        mydb = mysql.connector.connect(**db_config)
        mycursor = mydb.cursor()

        sql = "INSERT INTO video_thumbnails (video_id, thumbnail_data) VALUES (%s, %s)"
        val = (video_id, image_data)
        mycursor.execute(sql, val)

        mydb.commit()
        print(mycursor.rowcount, "record inserted.")

    except mysql.connector.Error as err:
        print(f"Error: {err}")
    finally:
      if 'mydb' in locals() and mydb.is_connected():
        mycursor.close()
        mydb.close()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Database configuration
    db_config = {
        "host": "your_host",
        "user": "your_user",
        "password": "your_password",
        "database": "your_database"
    }

    video_id_example = 1
    # Make sure the thumbnail exists before calling. This could be done after executing the ffmpeg command in bash using subprocess.call()
    image_path_example = "output_thumbnail.jpg"
    if os.path.exists(image_path_example):
      insert_thumbnail(video_id_example, image_path_example, db_config)
    else:
      print(f"Error: File {image_path_example} not found")

```
This python code first reads the image in binary format, connects to MySQL using the specified configuration, executes the insert statement, then closes the connection. It handles potential mysql errors. The main block shows an example of using the `insert_thumbnail` function, including an `os.path.exists` check before inserting the thumbnail, and also it contains a commented out line that shows where to implement a subprocess call in bash.

In a production environment, you'd typically wrap these operations into a more robust service, including error handling, logging, and possibly asynchronous processing for thumbnail generation to avoid blocking the main application. Also, remember to handle the case where the same video id may have multiple thumbnails based on some criteria. You may want a separate column for a specific label such as `preview` or `cover`.

For further reading on video processing, I highly recommend “Multimedia Systems” by Ralf Steinmetz and Klara Nahrstedt. For deeper understanding of ffmpeg, the official ffmpeg documentation is your best bet, though it can be daunting, so I also would recommend the book "FFmpeg Cookbook" by Packt publishing. For a deeper dive into MySQL, "Understanding MySQL Internals" by Sasha Pachev and the official mysql documentation are always indispensable.

I hope this practical breakdown helps. There are always many nuances involved in working with media processing but these steps and considerations should put you on the right path.
