Okay, let's tackle this. I've seen this particular issue pop up more times than I care to count, and it's usually a head-scratcher until you get into the details. The error you're likely seeing when trying to call a method inside your Action Mailer, especially if it's a custom method you've defined, stems from how Action Mailer instances are instantiated and the lifecycle of their methods in the context of email processing within a rails application. It's rarely a problem with the method itself, but with the way you're trying to invoke it within that specific environment. I remember back in my early days working on a large-scale e-commerce platform, we had a very specific notification system that relied heavily on custom logic within mailers and I distinctly remember banging my head against this issue for quite a few hours.

The core issue boils down to the fact that Action Mailer methods are not directly accessible in the same way you might access methods in a regular class. Action Mailer instances are instantiated via `ActionMailer::Base.deliver`, which sets up a very specific context for email generation. They are not just regular Ruby objects where you can readily call public methods from anywhere. The "mail" method defined in your mailer class is the specific context within which to define mail configurations and call those helper methods. You’re probably trying to call your custom method directly, outside of that context, or within the `ActionMailer::Base` class itself, which is not how the class is designed to be used.

To elaborate, `ActionMailer::Base` creates an instance of your custom mailer class, and within that context, the `mail` block establishes the environment for email composition. If your custom method isn't called as part of the `mail` configuration it is never accessed or even initiated for the process of preparing an email. Typically, custom methods serve as *helpers* to build the `mail` block – setting subject lines, formatting data, generating text, etc. They aren't independently executed outside of that specific email-building flow.

Let's get into some practical examples, illustrating scenarios and common pitfalls:

**Example 1: The Incorrect Approach**

Let's assume you have a mailer called `UserMailer` and a custom method `format_greeting`. You are likely attempting something along these lines and getting an error:

```ruby
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  default from: 'notifications@example.com'

  def format_greeting(name)
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end

  def welcome_email(user)
    @user = user
    # Attempting to call outside of `mail` block
    greeting = format_greeting(@user.name) # Incorrect way!
    mail(to: @user.email, subject: "Welcome!") do |format|
        format.text { render plain: "#{greeting} Welcome to our site!"}
    end
  end
end
```

Here, the intention was correct, but the implementation is flawed. The `format_greeting` method is called *before* the `mail` block is initiated. The mail method is the only method in `ActionMailer` which returns a `Mail` object that eventually gets delivered. You're attempting to call the method outside of the context of the mailer's execution. The error here, though it might be ambiguous, will likely point to this kind of mismatch. It also can indicate a misunderstanding of the mailer’s lifecycle, even if the error itself won't say that directly. The mail configuration should only happen within the `mail` block.

**Example 2: Correct Usage Inside the `mail` Block**

The corrected version should call your helper within the `mail` block, leveraging the instance context of the mailer:

```ruby
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  default from: 'notifications@example.com'

  def format_greeting(name)
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end

  def welcome_email(user)
    @user = user
    mail(to: @user.email, subject: "Welcome!") do |format|
        greeting = format_greeting(@user.name) # Correct Usage
        format.text { render plain: "#{greeting} Welcome to our site!"}
    end
  end
end
```

In this scenario, `format_greeting` is called within the `mail` block. This puts the call within the scope of email generation. Thus, the `mail` block and `format` block are the ones that will be evaluated when an email is prepared, and the context of `@user` within the action mailer is maintained. This demonstrates the proper way to use the method in the context of the Action Mailer's lifecycle. We are not doing any mail configuration outside of the block.

**Example 3: Custom Method with Instance Variables**

Another common stumbling block involves the proper usage of instance variables in custom methods. Consider a scenario where you want to use template data in your helper:

```ruby
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
    default from: 'notifications@example.com'

    def product_details
        "The product name is #{@product.name} and costs #{@product.price}"
    end
    
    def product_email(user, product)
        @user = user
        @product = product
        mail(to: @user.email, subject: "New Product") do |format|
            product_details = product_details
            format.text { render plain: "#{product_details}"}
        end
    end
end
```

In the above snippet, the `@product` instance variable is defined in `product_email` and it is directly used in the helper method `product_details`. The helper method is then invoked within the mail block with `product_details = product_details` and the result is used in the rendered template. This is correct, and it properly utilizes the instance variables defined within the mailer method when preparing the email.

**Troubleshooting and Further Reading**

To effectively troubleshoot these issues, begin by carefully inspecting the backtrace generated by your error. The specific error messages usually provide pointers to the location where the invalid method call is occurring. Verify the scope of the method call. Is it inside the mail block? Make sure that your custom methods are being used within the context of the `mail` configuration and that you're using the mailer object’s own properties rather than calling them on the `ActionMailer::Base` class itself.

For deeper insights, I highly recommend diving into the "Rails Action Mailer" section in the official Ruby on Rails Guides. Understanding the lifecycle of mailers and how email delivery is handled under the hood is crucial. While I can't provide specific web links, you can easily find the relevant documentation through a web search. The official Rails documentation is your best friend here. Additionally, the book "Agile Web Development with Rails" by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas and David Heinemeier Hansson is a classic resource that provides a strong understanding of Rails components. This book's sections on Action Mailer would be particularly helpful. Finally, the source code of `ActionMailer::Base` on Github, although a deep dive, is insightful. It's open-source, so reviewing the code there will provide you the low-level information on how methods are accessed and invoked within the mailer framework.

In short, if you are getting an error trying to call a method inside your mailer, it's probably because you're calling it outside of the intended scope, outside of the mail block. This subtle but important distinction is at the heart of using Action Mailer correctly. Focus on how the methods are invoked within the mail building process and not on the method itself. This understanding, coupled with the examples above and the recommended resources, should get you on the path to successfully crafting your mailers. I'm hopeful that these points will help you to overcome your issue.
