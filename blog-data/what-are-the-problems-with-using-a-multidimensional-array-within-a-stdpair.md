Alright, let’s unpack this. I've actually run into this specific scenario more often than I’d care to recall, mostly during early days of optimization efforts on some simulation engines back in '08 – '12. The temptation to use a `std::pair` to couple something, say a position and a matrix transformation, can be strong, especially when rapid prototyping is the name of the game. However, when you start shoving multidimensional arrays inside, you're stepping onto thin ice, both conceptually and practically.

The core issue isn't that it's syntactically *impossible* to have a `std::pair<Type1, Type2>` where one or both types are multidimensional arrays; it's more that it's a generally bad idea for a variety of reasons, ranging from memory management complexities to maintainability nightmares. Let’s break that down.

First, **memory allocation and deallocation become incredibly brittle.** When you declare a multi-dimensional array directly, as in `int matrix[3][3]`, the memory is usually managed statically on the stack or within a containing object’s memory block. But, when this array is part of a `std::pair` (especially if the array’s size isn't known at compile time and you need a dynamically allocated array), you start dealing with raw pointers and manual memory management. Now, `std::pair` is just a plain old data structure; it doesn't implicitly handle allocation or deallocation for anything more complex than built-in types or trivial objects. You end up having to manage this memory *explicitly*, which introduces risks like memory leaks and dangling pointers.

For example, consider a scenario where you’re trying to pair a position (let's keep it 2d for simplicity) with a transform matrix.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

int main() {
  int** transformMatrix = new int*[2];
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    transformMatrix[i] = new int[2];
    for(int j = 0; j < 2; ++j) {
        transformMatrix[i][j] = i * 2 + j;
    }
  }


  std::pair<int[2], int**> transformedData = {{1, 2}, transformMatrix };

  // Accessing works...for now
    std::cout << transformedData.first[0] << ", " << transformedData.first[1] << std::endl;
    std::cout << transformedData.second[0][0] << std::endl;


  //Problem: we need to cleanup the transformMatrix memory manually:
    for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    {
      delete[] transformMatrix[i];
    }
    delete[] transformMatrix;


  return 0;
}
```

Here, the `transformMatrix` is allocated on the heap. If you don’t remember or forget to delete the allocated memory for `transformMatrix` later, you have a memory leak. In large applications, these add up quickly. The `std::pair` itself will be fine since it didn’t allocate the heap memory, but it holds a pointer to that memory that will become invalid once the allocation is not there anymore. This is not a problem with std::pair itself, but a consequence of what is stored in the pair.

Second, there's the issue of **copy semantics**. `std::pair`, when copied, performs a member-wise copy. If one of the members is a raw pointer to a dynamically allocated array, you only copy the pointer, leading to a shallow copy. This means both the original and copied pairs point to the same memory block. Modifying the array through one pair will affect the other – often an undesired, and potentially difficult to debug, situation. Furthermore, when the pairs holding those shallow copies go out of scope, multiple calls to `delete[]` would occur, which is undefined behaviour. You generally want deep copies if data is shared like this.

To illustrate this, consider this modified snippet:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

int main() {
  int** transformMatrix = new int*[2];
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    transformMatrix[i] = new int[2];
    for(int j = 0; j < 2; ++j) {
        transformMatrix[i][j] = i * 2 + j;
    }
  }

  std::pair<int[2], int**> transformedData = {{1, 2}, transformMatrix };
  std::pair<int[2], int**> transformedDataCopy = transformedData; // Shallow copy

    //Modify through the copy, original affected
    transformedDataCopy.second[0][0] = 99;
    std::cout << "Original: " << transformedData.second[0][0] << std::endl;


  //Problem: we need to cleanup the transformMatrix memory manually, 
  //but trying to do so for the copy as well is a double free error.
    for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    {
      delete[] transformMatrix[i];
    }
    delete[] transformMatrix;


  return 0;
}
```
Here, modifying `transformedDataCopy.second` changes the data accessed through `transformedData.second`, due to the shallow copy. It is not intuitive and leads to difficult debugging, and if we were to try and delete the data associated to the second pointer of both pair objects, we’d encounter a double free error since they both point to the same memory.

Thirdly, there's a **readability and maintenance** problem. When you have a complex nested structure involving raw arrays managed manually inside a `std::pair`, the code becomes harder to understand and debug. Encapsulation is broken; it’s unclear who is responsible for memory allocation. This makes code reuse difficult. It also obscures intent as you would expect the pair to manage itself. When you see a `std::pair`, you shouldn’t have to be immediately concerned about memory management. This decreases code maintainability since it forces readers to understand the inner workings of the pair and not assume it to be a simple tuple.

Finally, if we were to consider a situation that needs dynamic sized arrays, things will get even messier. Consider a situation where you are storing a sequence of matrices of varying sizes, we'd be tempted to try something like this.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<std::pair<int, int**>> sequenceOfMatrices;
    for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    {
        int** transformMatrix = new int*[i+1];
      for (int j = 0; j < i+1; ++j) {
        transformMatrix[j] = new int[i+1];
        for(int k = 0; k < i+1; ++k) {
            transformMatrix[j][k] = i * 2 + j + k;
        }
      }
       sequenceOfMatrices.push_back({i, transformMatrix});
    }
  
    //Lots of manual memory management to handle
  for(const auto& matrixData: sequenceOfMatrices)
  {
     int matrixSize = matrixData.first + 1;
      for(int i = 0; i < matrixSize; i++)
      {
         delete[] matrixData.second[i];
      }
     delete[] matrixData.second;
  }


  return 0;
}

```

As you can see, not only is the initial allocation error prone, but now there's also the cleanup. All of this is mixed within a simple vector. The memory management is leaking into the main program, instead of being handled by data structure themselves.

**Better Alternatives**

The solution isn't to avoid using `std::pair` entirely; it's to use it *correctly*. Instead of trying to stuff raw arrays into it, consider using classes, or standard containers like `std::vector` or `std::array`, and encapsulate the raw arrays there. These tools offer memory management capabilities and copy semantics that prevent many of the aforementioned problems.

For instance, you could create a dedicated `Matrix` class or use a suitable matrix library that handles all the memory management and arithmetic operations, and then create a `std::pair<int[2], Matrix>`. The `Matrix` class will ensure proper deep copying and memory deallocation. Similarly, if the dimensionality is dynamic, you can encapsulate a dynamically sized matrix in a class and use that class.

**Recommended Resources**

To really solidify your understanding of memory management and container usage in C++, I strongly recommend these texts:

1.  **"Effective Modern C++" by Scott Meyers**: This book is a cornerstone for understanding modern C++ practices, particularly how to deal with resource management using RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), which is paramount when dealing with dynamic memory.

2.  **"C++ Primer" by Stanley B. Lippman, Josée Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo**: This provides a thorough introduction to the C++ language, covering standard containers in detail and their appropriate usage.

3.  **"More Effective C++" by Scott Meyers**: Another excellent book focusing on advanced usage and common gotchas with C++. This text elaborates on the correct usage of copy constructors and assignment operators in C++, which becomes crucial when using classes as pair members.

In summary, while stuffing multidimensional arrays into a `std::pair` isn't prohibited by the language, it's a recipe for trouble. It's best to utilize proper data structures and encapsulate raw pointers to ensure memory safety and maintainability. It took me a few hard lessons in large simulation projects to fully appreciate this principle. Hope this was helpful.
