Alright, let's talk about accessing debugger information from an aws sagemaker estimator, because frankly, it's not always as straightforward as the documentation might initially suggest. I've spent more than a few late nights trying to dissect what's happening inside those black-box training jobs, so I've got a few battle scars and solutions to share. The short answer is, yes, you absolutely *can* load that debugger information, but it requires a bit more than just a simple function call.

Here's the deal: sagemaker's debugger isn't just dumping its data into a convenient csv. It operates at a lower level, capturing tensor data and potentially other metadata during the training process. This data is then stored in s3, and accessing it requires parsing the protobuf files that debugger generates. The estimator itself doesn't directly provide an easy "get_debugger_info()" function, sadly. Instead, we interact with the underlying s3 location where those files are stashed.

When you configure a debugger hook within your sagemaker estimator, you specify an `output_path`. This s3 path is where all the juicy details end up. Let's assume you’ve already set up your estimator with something resembling this:

```python
from sagemaker.estimator import Estimator
from sagemaker.debugger import DebuggerHookConfig, CollectionConfig

debugger_hook_config = DebuggerHookConfig(
    hook_parameters={"save_interval": "100"},
    collection_configs=[
        CollectionConfig(
            name="weights",
            parameters={"include_regex": ".*weight.*"}
        ),
        CollectionConfig(
            name="gradients",
            parameters={"include_regex": ".*grad.*"}
        ),
    ]
)

estimator = Estimator(
    image_uri="<your_image_uri>",
    role="<your_role>",
    instance_count=1,
    instance_type="ml.m5.xlarge",
    output_path="s3://<your_bucket>/training-output",
    sagemaker_session=<your_sagemaker_session>,
    debugger_hook_config=debugger_hook_config,
    entry_point="train.py"
)

estimator.fit()
```

After the `estimator.fit()` call completes, the tensors captured during training are sitting in s3 within your specified `output_path` along with debug-specific metadata. Now, accessing these files programmatically requires the use of the sagemaker debugger client along with some familiarity with the protobuf format.

Here's where it gets interesting, and where I’ve seen newcomers stumble. The debugging data is not presented in some readily consumable text or tabular format initially. This is intentional because of the performance needs and the nature of tensor data. Instead, you have to work with the raw files and interpret them. For that, the `smdebug` library is crucial. You install it with `pip install smdebug`. Let's dive into a concrete example of how to load this data:

```python
import boto3
from smdebug.trials import create_trial
from smdebug.exceptions import NoMoreData

def load_debugger_data(training_job_name, s3_output_path):
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    trial = create_trial(s3_output_path) # Uses smdebug under the hood to parse the data.

    for node_name in trial.nodes(): # Each node represents a worker in a distributed training job.
        print(f"Processing node: {node_name}")
        for t in trial.tensor_names(node=node_name):
          try:
              print(f"Tensor: {t}")
              for step_idx in trial.steps(t, node=node_name):
                try:
                   tensor_data = trial.tensor(t, step=step_idx, node=node_name)
                   print(f"Step: {step_idx}, Shape: {tensor_data.shape}, Data type: {tensor_data.dtype}")

                except NoMoreData:
                   pass  # No more data for that specific step.
          except NoMoreData:
              pass

    print("Finished loading debugger data")


training_job_name = estimator.latest_training_job.job_name # Example use after training
load_debugger_data(training_job_name, f"s3://{sagemaker_session.default_bucket()}/{training_job_name}/output")
```

This script uses the `smdebug` library to create a `trial` object, which essentially acts as an interface to the debug data. The `create_trial` method takes the s3 path where the debugger information was written and then parses the underlying protobuf files. From there, we can then iterate through the tensors and specific steps within them. Note the careful use of exception handling because there might not be data for every step for every tensor.

The beauty of this approach is that `smdebug` handles all the low-level parsing for us. We're shielded from the complexities of the protobuf structure. Furthermore, we’re not pulling down the entire dataset; instead, we can query data for individual tensors at individual steps within individual nodes in the training job. This is essential when dealing with potentially massive debug datasets.

Now, let's take a slightly different approach. Say we’re interested in only specific tensors, perhaps because we're debugging a particular issue or comparing specific parameter updates. We can use filters within the `smdebug` library:

```python
import boto3
from smdebug.trials import create_trial
from smdebug.exceptions import NoMoreData

def load_filtered_debugger_data(training_job_name, s3_output_path, tensor_regex):

    trial = create_trial(s3_output_path)
    filtered_tensors = trial.tensor_names(tensors_regex=tensor_regex)
    print(f"Found tensors matching '{tensor_regex}': {filtered_tensors}")

    for tensor_name in filtered_tensors:
       for node_name in trial.nodes():
           for step_idx in trial.steps(tensor_name, node=node_name):
             try:
                tensor_data = trial.tensor(tensor_name, step=step_idx, node=node_name)
                print(f"Tensor: {tensor_name}, Step: {step_idx}, Shape: {tensor_data.shape}, Data type: {tensor_data.dtype}")
             except NoMoreData:
               pass

    print("Finished loading filtered debugger data")

training_job_name = estimator.latest_training_job.job_name # Example use after training
load_filtered_debugger_data(training_job_name, f"s3://{sagemaker_session.default_bucket()}/{training_job_name}/output", ".*weight.*") # Loads only tensors containing 'weight'
```

Here, we’re using the `tensors_regex` parameter within `trial.tensor_names()` to filter the tensors based on a regular expression. In this case, it only loads tensors with "weight" in their names, matching what was specified in our debugger hook configuration in the original training example. This is far more efficient than loading everything and then filtering in python.

Finally, I'd like to point out that analyzing debugging data typically requires a more interactive approach. While loading the data programmatically is crucial, you would normally combine this with data visualization tools or specific libraries. For instance, tools like the sagemaker debugger analysis module (which builds on top of `smdebug`) provide more user-friendly interfaces for analyzing the training process.

For further study, I recommend these resources. Start with the official documentation for the sagemaker debugger within the AWS documentation (search “aws sagemaker debugger documentation”). Then, delve into the `smdebug` library’s documentation directly, as it is the actual workhorse behind the data extraction. Also, look for papers and articles focusing on distributed debugging in deep learning environments; a deep understanding of the underlying concepts can be invaluable. The book "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville can be helpful to understand the math behind the concepts you would debug.

In summary, the core challenge isn't in loading the debugger information; it's in understanding how that information is structured and how best to extract the relevant insights. By leveraging `smdebug`, we gain a powerful tool for interrogating our training jobs, but also understand the protobuf format used for storing this data. I hope that clears things up a bit.
