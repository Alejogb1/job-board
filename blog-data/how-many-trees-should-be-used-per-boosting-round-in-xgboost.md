Alright, let’s tackle this. The question of how many trees to use in each boosting round within XGBoost is definitely a nuanced one, and it's something I've spent a fair bit of time optimizing in various projects. It's less about a single magic number and much more about understanding the trade-offs and dynamics at play. I'll break down my thought process and provide some tangible examples from my past work, rather than just giving a textbook answer.

First, let's clarify what we mean by "trees per boosting round." In XGBoost, the term 'boosting round' is essentially synonymous with a single iteration of the boosting process. In each round, a new tree is built, aiming to correct the errors made by the ensemble of trees built in prior rounds. This new tree isn't just *added* to the existing ensemble; rather, the predictions from all previous trees, including the new one, are aggregated to make the new prediction of the model. The total number of trees a model uses is therefore the number of boosting rounds that have taken place, which in turn dictates the complexity of the model.

Now, traditionally, many resources would lean heavily on something like an "optimal n_estimators" setting. Yes, the `n_estimators` parameter determines the total number of boosting rounds and therefore the number of trees. And, yes, there's a tendency to see folks aiming for a specific number in each round. But thinking about it that way is quite limiting because it ignores the interplay with other hyperparameters and the nature of your data. The problem is, there’s no free lunch—more trees usually mean higher training time and a greater chance of overfitting, especially if not balanced correctly.

My experience has taught me that blindly setting the same number of trees each round isn’t efficient. During my work on a large-scale click-through rate prediction system, for instance, I found that adding hundreds of trees during each round on very high dimensional data wasn't beneficial. I was getting diminishing returns and an unmanageable training time. In such situations, the more effective approach is to use smaller trees and more rounds. By using smaller learning rates, we allow each added tree to focus on subtle errors and incrementally improve the model. The key here is to allow the early boosting rounds to create a 'rough draft' of the model, with the successive rounds 'fine-tuning' and adding minor corrections, instead of trying to do everything at once with complex trees in fewer rounds.

The `n_estimators` parameter, therefore, should be considered in tandem with parameters like `learning_rate`, `max_depth` (which governs the complexity of individual trees), and `subsample`/`colsample_bytree` (which introduce randomness into the boosting process to prevent overfitting).

Let's illustrate with a couple of examples. Suppose you are tackling a relatively simpler classification problem with a dataset of a few thousand records and perhaps a moderate number of features. In this scenario, you might be tempted to go with fewer rounds but larger trees, which means a higher value for `max_depth` and a smaller value for `n_estimators`. The general logic here is that a single, comprehensive tree (or a small number of them) may be sufficient to capture the relationships in the data.

Here is a Python snippet illustrating this approach, assuming your target variable is binary:

```python
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Sample Data (replace with your data)
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# XGBoost Classifier
xgb_classifier = xgb.XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,        # Fewer boosting rounds
    max_depth=7,             # Deeper individual trees
    learning_rate=0.1,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
    objective='binary:logistic',
    random_state=42,
    use_label_encoder=False
)

# Fit model
xgb_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make Predictions
y_pred = xgb_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

On the other hand, imagine dealing with a large-scale regression task with millions of records and hundreds or thousands of features. In my experience working on time-series forecasting, this required a much more cautious approach. I found that the models were prone to overfitting if we used few deep trees. The optimal solution, in that case, was to use a large number of shallow trees in each round, which means a larger value for `n_estimators` and a smaller value for `max_depth`, paired with a low learning rate to gradually move towards the optimal solution.

Here’s how this might look in practice:

```python
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Sample data for regression (replace with your dataset)
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 50)
y = np.random.rand(1000)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# XGBoost Regressor
xgb_regressor = xgb.XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=500,       # A higher number of boosting rounds
    max_depth=3,             # Shallower trees
    learning_rate=0.01,      # A lower learning rate
    subsample=0.7,
    colsample_bytree=0.7,
    objective='reg:squarederror',
    random_state=42
)

# Fit model
xgb_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = xgb_regressor.predict(X_test)

# Calculate Mean Squared Error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.4f}")
```

Finally, for a scenario with a highly complex non-linear dataset, consider using early stopping. This is a technique where we monitor the performance of the model on a validation set, and stop adding boosting rounds if we no longer observe improvements in its performance. In this context, we might start with a relatively high number of `n_estimators` and let early stopping determine the optimal number. This means the *effective* number of boosting rounds could be quite variable depending on the data and can result in optimal performance.

Here’s an example:

```python
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss
import numpy as np

# Sample data for classification with early stopping
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 20)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


# XGBoost Classifier
xgb_classifier_early = xgb.XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=1000,      # High starting number of boosting rounds
    max_depth=5,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
    objective='binary:logistic',
    random_state=42,
    use_label_encoder=False
)

# Fit with early stopping
eval_set = [(X_val, y_val)]
xgb_classifier_early.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_metric="logloss", early_stopping_rounds=10, eval_set=eval_set, verbose=False)


#Make prediction
y_pred_early = xgb_classifier_early.predict_proba(X_val)[:, 1]

#Calculate log loss
logloss = log_loss(y_val, y_pred_early)
print(f"Log Loss: {logloss:.4f}")
```

In conclusion, when considering how many trees to use in each XGBoost boosting round, remember that it’s not about a fixed number, but rather about a balancing act. You must understand the interplay with `learning_rate`, tree `max_depth`, and your dataset characteristics. It would benefit you to look at resources such as ‘The Elements of Statistical Learning’ by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman to get a deeper understanding of boosting algorithms. Furthermore, the original XGBoost paper by Chen and Guestrin (2016) provides valuable insight into the algorithmic and implementation details. Always evaluate multiple configurations based on validation performance to find the optimal setting for your specific problem. You'll see far greater returns by taking this more nuanced approach than simply trying to optimize one single hyperparameter in isolation.
