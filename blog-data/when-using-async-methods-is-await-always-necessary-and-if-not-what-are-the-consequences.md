Okay, let's talk about `await` and asynchronous operations. It's a topic that often trips folks up, even those with some experience under their belts. I remember, back in my days working on a distributed ledger system, we had a situation where we intermittently saw unexpected hangs. It took some detailed profiling and, frankly, a lot of head-scratching to pinpoint the issue, which was largely tied to a misunderstanding of `await` usage (or, rather, lack thereof). It wasn’t that things were necessarily breaking spectacularly; they were just not completing when they should, leaving processes in a state of limbo. So, to directly address the core of your question: no, `await` is *not* always strictly necessary when calling an async method, but omitting it introduces very specific consequences you need to be acutely aware of.

Think of async functions as contracts, promising that they might pause their execution and do something non-blocking, allowing other tasks to proceed. The `await` keyword is what turns that promise into an actual behavior; it's the mechanism that explicitly halts further execution of the enclosing async function, handing control back to the event loop, until the awaited task completes. When you don't use `await`, you're essentially firing the asynchronous operation and then continuing your code's execution immediately – you're not waiting for the result.

The most obvious consequence of skipping `await` is that your code won't receive the return value from the asynchronous operation. If the async method was designed to return a value, you won't have that value available for further processing. This is often not the biggest problem; many async methods are triggered for their side effects (like updating a database or sending a notification). What *is* a big deal, however, is error handling. When you use `await`, the async function's promise is resolved and, if the asynchronous operation fails and throws an exception, that exception will be propagated up the call stack as you would expect in synchronous code. Without `await`, exceptions occurring within the async function's execution will typically be unhandled and could result in unexpected program behavior or even silent failures, making debugging far more complex.

Let's look at a few code snippets to clarify:

**Example 1: Basic `await` and Result Usage**

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url: str) -> str:
    print(f"Fetching data from {url}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate network delay
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def process_data():
    data = await fetch_data("https://example.com/api/data")
    print(f"Received data: {data}")

async def main():
    await process_data()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this case, `process_data` uses `await` to obtain the result from `fetch_data`. The script will print `Fetching data from https://example.com/api/data` followed by a one second pause, then `Received data: Data from https://example.com/api/data`. The `await` ensures the data is ready before attempting to print it.

**Example 2: Missing `await` and Error Handling**

```python
import asyncio

async def risky_operation():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate some work
    raise ValueError("Something went wrong!")

async def run_operation_without_await():
    risky_operation() # Note: No await here.
    print("Operation initiated (but error might have occurred)")


async def main():
    await run_operation_without_await()
    await asyncio.sleep(1) # Allow time for the other coroutine to run
    print("Main function finishing...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Here, `run_operation_without_await` calls `risky_operation` without using `await`. The `ValueError` raised within `risky_operation` is not caught by the main program, and the program continues executing, printing "Operation initiated (but error might have occurred)" and “Main function finishing...”. While this example uses a `ValueError`, such errors can be subtle and can lead to unpredictable program states without proper handling. The async method gets scheduled, it runs to completion (or in this case, until the error) but the calling method has no knowledge of its state.

**Example 3: `asyncio.create_task` for Fire-and-Forget Operations**

```python
import asyncio

async def log_event(message: str):
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)  # Simulate I/O
    print(f"Logged: {message}")

async def process_transaction(transaction_id: int):
    print(f"Processing transaction {transaction_id}")
    asyncio.create_task(log_event(f"Transaction {transaction_id} processed")) # No await here
    print(f"Transaction {transaction_id} processing initiated in the background...")

async def main():
    await process_transaction(123)
    await process_transaction(456)
    await asyncio.sleep(1) # Allow time for the logs to be printed
    print("Main done")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this snippet, `log_event` is a function we want to fire off without waiting for it to complete. We can use `asyncio.create_task` to create an independent task. Notice how `process_transaction` initiates `log_event` in the background using `asyncio.create_task` and continues with the next log. The main program will print the transaction started messages then the log messages some time later because the tasks run concurrently. The important distinction here is that we *intentionally* don't want to wait. It is not a mistake. We are delegating it to the event loop.

So, summarizing, omitting `await` can be permissible but only when you know the implications. Primarily, it's used when you have 'fire-and-forget' scenarios where you do not need the result from the async method or need to explicitly handle errors in the calling function. However, this should be done judiciously, and you have to take on the responsibility for potential exceptions and ensuring background tasks complete before your program terminates. You will either lose the result, or you will need to handle exceptions in other ways by using other async mechanisms.

For a deeper understanding of asynchronous programming concepts in Python, I'd highly recommend checking out the official Python documentation on `asyncio`. Additionally, for a comprehensive dive into concurrent programming principles, specifically how they apply to asynchronous operations, *Concurrency in Python* by Katharine Jarmul and Trever Gunn provides an excellent practical guide. Also, "Effective Python" by Brett Slatkin has a lot of good guidance on utilizing asynchronous features effectively. These resources are solid and should enhance your understanding, helping you navigate these nuances more effectively, and avoid the headaches that I’ve previously experienced.
