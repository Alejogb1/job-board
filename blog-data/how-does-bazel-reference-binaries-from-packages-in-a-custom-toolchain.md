, let's talk about how Bazel handles binary references within custom toolchains—it's a topic that, while seemingly straightforward, can quickly become complex, especially when scaling projects. I've spent a fair amount of time navigating these nuances, and I've learned firsthand how crucial understanding this mechanism is for reproducible builds. The core idea, as I see it, is about separation of concerns: the toolchain describes *how* to build, and the package dependencies within the workspace provide *what* to build. Bazel's referencing mechanism effectively bridges this gap.

Essentially, a custom toolchain defines the tools and settings necessary for compiling and linking code for a specific target architecture or platform. Think of it as a configuration blueprint. Within this blueprint, you'll often specify executables – compilers, linkers, assemblers, etc. – that the build process needs. The trick is, these executables aren't directly embedded into the toolchain definition. Instead, Bazel uses labels (e.g., `//some/package:my_tool`) to *reference* these binaries from within your project's workspace.

This indirection offers several advantages. Most importantly, it allows you to version these tool binaries separately from the toolchain definition. You can update your compiler or linker by modifying the package where it's defined, without having to change the entire toolchain definition—assuming the interface contract remains consistent. Furthermore, it promotes reusability. Multiple toolchains can reference the same binary (perhaps differing by flags or arguments), which drastically reduces redundancy in large projects. It also facilitates swapping implementations more easily, crucial in continuously evolving development environments.

Let's dive into an example using a fictional custom toolchain. Imagine we have a toolchain designed for a hypothetical embedded processor named "mips_small." We need to specify the compiler and linker in our toolchain definition, which I'll demonstrate through a snippet of a Starlark rule that defines this custom toolchain:

```python
def _mips_small_toolchain_impl(ctx):
    compiler_info = platform_common.ToolInfo(
        tool_path = ctx.executable.compiler,
        tool_flags = ctx.attr.compiler_flags,
    )

    linker_info = platform_common.ToolInfo(
        tool_path = ctx.executable.linker,
        tool_flags = ctx.attr.linker_flags,
    )


    toolchain = platform_common.ToolchainInfo(
         compilation_tools = [compiler_info],
         linking_tools = [linker_info],
     )


    return [toolchain]


mips_small_toolchain = rule(
    implementation = _mips_small_toolchain_impl,
    attrs = {
        "compiler": attr.label(mandatory=True, executable=True, allow_files=False),
        "linker": attr.label(mandatory=True, executable=True, allow_files=False),
         "compiler_flags": attr.string_list(default=[]),
         "linker_flags": attr.string_list(default=[])
    },
)
```

Here's what's happening: This Starlark code defines a custom rule `mips_small_toolchain` that creates a `ToolchainInfo` provider. Notice the `ctx.executable.compiler` and `ctx.executable.linker`. These are not paths, rather they're resolved based on the `compiler` and `linker` attributes, which are defined as `attr.label(mandatory=True, executable=True, allow_files=False)`. This constraint means that these attributes *must* point to an executable label in the workspace. This ensures that Bazel uses the executable defined at the location provided. The `ToolInfo` stores the tool's path and relevant flags.

Now, let's see how we might define the actual tool binaries in our workspace. For demonstration's sake, we'll pretend these are very simple scripts for illustration:

```python
# //tools/mips_small/compiler/BUILD

load("@bazel_skylib//rules:executable_script.bzl", "executable_script")

executable_script(
    name = "mips_small_compiler",
    srcs = ["mips_small_compiler.sh"],
    out_bin = "mips_small_compiler",
    executable = True
)


# //tools/mips_small/linker/BUILD

load("@bazel_skylib//rules:executable_script.bzl", "executable_script")

executable_script(
    name = "mips_small_linker",
    srcs = ["mips_small_linker.sh"],
     out_bin = "mips_small_linker",
    executable = True
)
```

These `BUILD` files use `executable_script` (provided by `bazel_skylib`) to create executables. These scripts would, in practice, invoke the real compiler and linker executables, but here they represent placeholders for those. The critical part is the `name` of the rule—`mips_small_compiler` and `mips_small_linker`, respectively. These names become the *labels* that we reference in our custom toolchain definition. Here's a minimal example of what the toolchain declaration might look like:

```python
# //toolchains/mips_small/BUILD

load("//toolchains/mips_small:toolchain.bzl", "mips_small_toolchain")


mips_small_toolchain(
    name = "mips_small_default",
    compiler = "//tools/mips_small/compiler:mips_small_compiler",
    linker = "//tools/mips_small/linker:mips_small_linker",
    compiler_flags = ["-O2", "-target=mips-small"],
    linker_flags = ["-lmips", "-nostdlib"],
)
```

In this `BUILD` file, we create an instance of the `mips_small_toolchain` rule, which was defined above. The `compiler` and `linker` attributes are where the *references* to the binaries are made. Notice we're using the exact labels that we defined in the `tools/mips_small` packages. This way, Bazel will take that `mips_small_compiler` executable and use it based on how our `mips_small_toolchain_impl` defines the `compiler_info`. When Bazel executes actions that use this toolchain, it retrieves the executables that match these labels.

This is how Bazel references binaries: indirectly, through labels, which allows for versioning, reusability, and flexible substitution. It's important to ensure that the targets you use as tool references are declared as *executables* within the Bazel build system (often by using `executable=True`, as we did above), otherwise, the process will fail. These targets must also be platform compatible with where Bazel will be running the tool, typically the execution platform.

For further exploration on this subject, I recommend consulting the official Bazel documentation, specifically the section detailing toolchains and platform constraints. In addition, I found chapter 9 of "Software Engineering at Google" (by Titus Winters, Tom Manshreck, and Hyrum Wright) to be invaluable in understanding the practical concerns related to toolchain management and abstraction in large-scale projects. Another resource worth investigating is the paper "Build Systems at Scale" by Eric Brewer (though originally focusing on Google's build system, much of its content translates well to understanding the challenges Bazel addresses). These resources should provide the comprehensive technical context needed to develop a robust grasp of Bazel toolchains and how they handle binary dependencies.
