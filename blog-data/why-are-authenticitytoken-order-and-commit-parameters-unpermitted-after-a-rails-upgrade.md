Alright, let's talk about those pesky unpermitted parameters after a rails upgrade. I've seen this dance more times than i care to count, and it's almost always due to subtle shifts in how rails handles strong parameters across versions. It's definitely something you can tackle, and it usually boils down to a better understanding of the permitted parameters and how form submissions work under the hood. This is less about some hidden bug and more about rails safeguarding your application, which, ultimately, is a good thing.

Let's dive into why those specific parameters -- `:authenticity_token`, `:order`, and `:commit` -- tend to be the casualties of such upgrades. Think of `:authenticity_token` first. It's a security cornerstone, a CSRF (cross-site request forgery) protection mechanism. Essentially, it's a unique token generated by the server and embedded in your forms. When the form is submitted, rails checks if the received token matches the one associated with your user's session. A mismatch? The request is rejected. The problem isn’t that rails stops accepting these; it's that you aren't supposed to be explicitly permitting it in your controller’s parameters. Rails automatically handles checking this. When you upgrade, if you had, perhaps, added it in an attempt to explicitly allow *all* params or debug something, that implicit mechanism can clash with the explicit one, leading to the "unpermitted" message.

Now `:order` and `:commit` are different. `:order` often gets caught if you're implementing any kind of dynamic sorting within forms, and rails defaults to only permitting attributes directly associated with your model. The `:commit` parameter is typically created when using the `submit` button in a form. It’s used to track which submit button was pressed when you have multiple within the same form. Similarly, this isn't something you'd normally explicitly permit. Rails implicitly handles the processing, but you might need to think about form behavior if relying on specific `:commit` values that were never truly meant to be used as model attributes.

The core issue is that rails actively enforces strong parameters to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities. It’s a security feature, plain and simple. When you upgrade, rails often tightens the default parameter behavior, requiring you to be more explicit about what's actually allowed into your database. When you see those "unpermitted parameters", it's not rails being difficult; it's rails saying, "Hey, I don't know what you want to do with this data, so I'm going to block it for your safety. Specify what you need.”

Here’s an example of how you might have inadvertently caused a problem. Let's say pre-upgrade your controller might have looked something like this:

```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def update
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    @article.update(params.permit!) # A dangerous approach
    redirect_to @article
  end
end
```

The `params.permit!` was a bad habit many formed when starting out. It bypasses all the intended security protections and could be a risk if not used with great caution. Upgrading to a newer rails version, you’ll likely see a warning, or your update might just fail due to those unpermitted attributes.

Here's how you should be handling params properly. Let's say your `Article` model has `title`, `content`, and a hypothetical `category_id`.

```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def update
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    if @article.update(article_params)
      redirect_to @article, notice: 'Article updated successfully'
    else
      render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def article_params
    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :content, :category_id)
  end
end
```

In this revised example, we're employing the `params.require(:article).permit(...)` approach. We're specifying that we expect an `article` object nested in our parameters, and we are explicit about which attributes to permit (`:title`, `:content`, `:category_id` ). Note that things like `:authenticity_token`, `:order`, or `:commit` are completely absent from this permit list, which is by design. The `:authenticity_token` gets automatically processed behind the scenes and the `:order` and `:commit` are irrelevant to what the model itself should receive.

Now for `:order` parameter. Let’s take the scenario where you had a form that allowed users to change the order of list items. You might have had code that attempted to retrieve this from the params:

```ruby
class ItemsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @items = Item.all.order(params[:order] || :created_at) # A naive attempt
  end
end
```

This may work for sorting on the client-side for display purposes, but again, using `params[:order]` directly is risky. It's better to construct the order logic based on the attributes your model actually has, and ensure that you are only using an *approved* sort order based on a drop-down selection. So, instead you would have something like this:

```ruby
class ItemsController < ApplicationController
  VALID_SORT_OPTIONS = { 'created_at' => 'created_at', 'name' => 'name', 'price' => 'price'}.freeze

  def index
    sort_param = params[:order]
    sort_order = VALID_SORT_OPTIONS[sort_param] || 'created_at' # Default to created_at if not valid.
    @items = Item.order(sort_order)
  end
end
```
In this example we've implemented a very basic whitelist for the `order` parameter using the `VALID_SORT_OPTIONS` constant. We are no longer blindly trusting whatever comes in with `params[:order]`. If the parameter is valid, we use it, else we use a default order value (`created_at` here).

Here are a few points to consider further:

*   **Read the release notes:** Whenever you upgrade rails, read the release notes carefully, with particular attention to changes regarding parameters or security configurations. These will often call out specific changes that might affect your application.

*   **Test thoroughly:** After any upgrade, your tests are your best friend. Write comprehensive test suites that cover the full range of form submissions and parameter handling scenarios. This is where you’ll catch issues early.

*   **Audit your code:** Look for any instances where you’re using `.permit!` or relying directly on `params` without specifically allowing the expected keys. This is a great opportunity to refactor and improve security.

* **Strong parameter documentation:** Dive into the *Action Controller Overview* section in the Rails Guides. It provides a very detailed explanation on how to leverage strong parameters to safeguard your app.

*   **"Secure by default" mindset:** always approach parameter handling with a "secure by default" philosophy. This requires you to be intentional about what data you permit into your application's models.

In summary, those "unpermitted parameters" like `:authenticity_token`, `:order` and `:commit` are not random errors that appear out of nowhere; they indicate changes in rails parameter handling, which, ultimately, benefit the security of your application. By refactoring your controller to use strong parameters correctly, being careful about using unwhitelisted sort orders, and being mindful of the security measures rails implements, you can smoothly navigate these upgrades without any stress. Always be explicit, secure by default, and test, test, test.
