Let’s tackle this. Having spent my fair share of time wrangling visualization libraries, particularly Altair, the nuanced control over aesthetics, like changing a single color, is something I've definitely encountered. It might seem like a trivial task on the surface, but the complexity lies in understanding how Altair's declarative syntax interacts with its underlying vega-lite specifications. The direct answer isn't always immediately obvious, especially when dealing with layered plots or complex encodings. So, let’s break this down methodically.

The fundamental challenge stems from the fact that Altair doesn't directly manipulate individual pixel colors like a paint program would. Instead, it generates a vega-lite specification which then interprets the data and produces the visualization. Therefore, you’re not modifying a pixel, but rather influencing how data is mapped to visual channels, including colors. The crucial insight is understanding these mappings – specifically, how the 'color' encoding works and how you can selectively target and modify data points within that mapping.

There are typically three strategies I employ to achieve this: using conditional encodings, using a filter transform, or specifying a color scheme and then modifying it after it’s generated. Let’s delve into each of these with examples.

First, **conditional encodings.** This is my go-to method for most situations because of its clarity. The key here is to use an 'if' statement in the color encoding to check the value of a particular field in your data. If the field matches the condition, then the target color will be applied; otherwise, a different color, usually the default or remaining color scheme, is used. Here’s a code snippet illustrating this:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
        'value': [10, 15, 7, 12, 9]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q',
    color=alt.condition(
        alt.datum.category == 'C',
        alt.value('red'), #Target Color
        alt.value('steelblue') #Default Color
    )
).properties(
    title='Bar Chart with Conditional Color'
)
chart.display()
```

In this code, I’ve created a simple bar chart. The color encoding uses `alt.condition`. It checks whether the category is equal to 'C'. If it is, then the bar is colored 'red'; otherwise it is 'steelblue'. Note the use of `alt.value` to specify static colors – this is important for a non-data mapped color. The `alt.datum` refers to the data at the level of the mark, in this case, each row in your dataframe. It's this use of `datum` that allows conditional styling based on the data itself.

Second, the **filter transform**. This technique is useful when you're targeting a color based on calculations or multiple criteria, or when dealing with large datasets where explicitly enumerating each case becomes cumbersome in the conditional encode. A filter transform creates a new view of your data, and you can then apply a color encode to that specific view. This is particularly helpful in layered charts when the color encode must be associated with the data from only one layer:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
        'value': [10, 15, 7, 12, 9]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q',
    color=alt.Color(
        'category:N',
        scale=alt.Scale(domain=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
                    range=['steelblue', 'steelblue', 'steelblue', 'steelblue', 'steelblue'])
    )
).transform_filter(
    alt.datum.category == 'C'
).encode(
    color = alt.value('red')
).properties(
    title='Bar Chart with Filter Transform'
)
chart.display()

```

In this example, we first assign a default color scale to all bars. We then apply a `transform_filter` targeting specifically the data corresponding to 'C'. Following the transform, the last encode function changes the color of bars selected via filter to 'red'. This approach decouples the color logic from the main color encoding, which can enhance the readability of more complex scenarios.

Lastly, when all else fails, sometimes, I will **modify the generated vega-lite JSON** to change the colors. While not the most elegant, it’s useful for very particular modifications that aren't directly accessible via altair's API, especially when dealing with existing specifications.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import json

data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
        'value': [10, 15, 7, 12, 9]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='category:N',
    y='value:Q',
    color='category:N'
)

spec = chart.to_json()
spec_dict = json.loads(spec)


# Modification section - Be careful!
for mark in spec_dict['spec']['marks']:
    if 'type' in mark and mark['type'] == 'rect' and 'encode' in mark and 'update' in mark['encode'] and 'fill' in mark['encode']['update']:
         if 'scale' in mark['encode']['update']['fill'] and 'range' in mark['encode']['update']['fill']['scale']:
              mark['encode']['update']['fill']['scale']['range'] = ['#0000FF', '#0000FF', '#FF0000', '#0000FF', '#0000FF']

modified_chart = alt.Chart.from_json(json.dumps(spec_dict))
modified_chart.properties(
    title='Bar Chart modified via JSON'
)
modified_chart.display()

```

Here I convert the Altair chart to a JSON specification, and then, **very carefully**, I traversed the JSON structure to find the relevant color scale. Within the color scale's range, I explicitly changed the color value corresponding to 'C' to red, while keeping the others blue. Modifying the vega-lite JSON directly can be a bit brittle because the underlying structure is an implementation detail, it is therefore best used only as a last resort. I’d recommend getting comfortable with the first two approaches before attempting this. You can inspect the full generated JSON using `chart.to_json()` and `json.loads()` to understand the structure.

In essence, the core lesson here is that Altair operates on data mappings rather than pixel manipulation. Mastering the use of conditional encodings, filter transforms, and as a last resort, JSON specification modification, allows for highly granular control over visual elements, including those all-important color choices.

For anyone looking to deepen their understanding of Altair and its connection to Vega-Lite, I recommend delving into the official Altair documentation. Furthermore, "Interactive Data Visualization for the Web" by Scott Murray is a valuable resource for the underlying principles of data visualization and SVG, which are key components in Vega-Lite. Lastly, the original Vega-Lite papers, particularly the one by Satyanarayan, Moritz, Wongsuphasawat, and Heer, are seminal for understanding its core concepts and design decisions. Exploring these resources will provide a comprehensive perspective on both the library itself and the best practices for effective and nuanced data visualization, particularly around these challenges with color.
