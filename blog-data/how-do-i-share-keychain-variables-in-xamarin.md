Let's delve into the specifics, shall we? Sharing keychain variables across different applications or even within different parts of the same app in Xamarin can indeed present some unique challenges, but it’s a scenario I've encountered countless times during my years of mobile development. It's not as straightforward as accessing shared preferences, and there are nuances related to security that must be handled with careful consideration.

The fundamental hurdle lies in the way keychains are designed. They're primarily intended to store credentials and other sensitive data associated with a specific application. This is a security feature, ensuring one app can't casually pry into another’s secrets. However, situations arise when you need to legitimately share this data. For instance, you might have a suite of apps that need access to the same user login token, or you might want to enable seamless authentication across your entire ecosystem.

My experience stems from a rather complex project involving an enterprise suite of mobile applications – think logistics, inventory, and customer management all tied into a single back end. It was crucial for users to transition between these applications seamlessly without repeated logins, which immediately threw the spotlight on secure keychain sharing. We quickly realized we couldn’t just use default keychain behaviour.

The approach largely hinges on understanding platform-specific keychain services and how they handle shared access. On ios, this revolves around the concept of 'access groups'. Android, conversely, relies primarily on the 'keystore' and typically defaults to application-specific isolation. Let's break down the implementation specifics, including code samples.

First, we’ll consider iOS. The magic ingredient is the `SecAccessControl` class in conjunction with an appropriately configured 'entitlements' file. Without the correct entitlements, even apps signed by the same developer will be unable to see each other’s keychain entries. The access group becomes the mechanism for this sharing. Think of it like a shared folder on a server, but specifically for keychain data.

Here's a snippet that demonstrates saving a string into a shared keychain on iOS:

```csharp
using System;
using Security;
using Foundation;
using System.Text;

public static class KeychainService
{
    public static bool SaveString(string key, string value, string service, string accessGroup)
    {
        var encodedValue = NSData.FromString(value, NSStringEncoding.UTF8);
        var query = new SecRecord(SecKind.GenericPassword)
        {
            Service = service,
            Account = key,
            ValueData = encodedValue,
            AccessGroup = accessGroup
        };

        try
        {
            SecStatusCode statusCode = SecKeyChain.Add(query);

            if (statusCode == SecStatusCode.Success)
            {
                return true;
            }
            else if (statusCode == SecStatusCode.DuplicateItem)
            {
                var updateQuery = new SecRecord(SecKind.GenericPassword)
                {
                    Service = service,
                    Account = key
                };
               
                var updateAttributes = new SecRecord(SecKind.GenericPassword)
                {
                    ValueData = encodedValue,

                };
                SecStatusCode updateStatusCode = SecKeyChain.Update(updateQuery, updateAttributes);
                return updateStatusCode == SecStatusCode.Success;
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error saving keychain entry: {ex}");
        }

         return false;
    }


    public static string LoadString(string key, string service, string accessGroup)
    {
        var query = new SecRecord(SecKind.GenericPassword)
        {
            Service = service,
            Account = key,
            AccessGroup = accessGroup,
            ReturnAttributes = true,
            ReturnData = true
        };

        SecStatusCode statusCode;
        var match = SecKeyChain.QueryAsRecord(query, out statusCode);

        if (statusCode == SecStatusCode.Success && match != null && match.ValueData != null)
        {
            return NSString.FromData(match.ValueData, NSStringEncoding.UTF8);
        }
        else
        {
             Console.WriteLine($"Error loading keychain entry: {statusCode}");
           return null;
        }

    }

}
```

This code defines a static class with methods to save and load strings. The vital part is that both `SaveString` and `LoadString` accept an `accessGroup` parameter. To make this work, you *must* modify the entitlements file of both applications to include the same `access-groups` entry, like so:

```xml
<key>keychain-access-groups</key>
 <array>
  <string>your_shared_access_group</string>
 </array>
```

Replace `your_shared_access_group` with your actual group id. This part is frequently overlooked and a common source of frustration.

Moving on to Android, the process is somewhat less nuanced in terms of 'access groups,' but still requires careful consideration of how data is stored and retrieved, typically utilizing the Android keystore system. Since the Android keystore is primarily app-specific, sharing between apps requires a mechanism of storing and retrieving data using a shared identifier. Here, I will demonstrate a simplified approach using a service name as a key, though more complex scenarios might require more elaborate key management. It's crucial to note that data saved to the Android keystore is usually tied to the device and the application’s signing key, which adds a layer of security but introduces complexities for sharing across different apps that are not using the same signing configuration. For simplicity, let's focus on sharing within an app suite by using a common service name.

```csharp
using Android.Content;
using Android.Preferences;

public class KeychainService
{
    private const string ServiceName = "MySharedService";

    public static void SaveString(Context context, string key, string value)
    {
         var preferences = PreferenceManager.GetDefaultSharedPreferences(context);
         var editor = preferences.Edit();
          editor.PutString(key, value);
         editor.Apply();
    }

    public static string LoadString(Context context, string key)
    {
        var preferences = PreferenceManager.GetDefaultSharedPreferences(context);
        return preferences.GetString(key, null);
    }

}
```

This simplified example uses android's `SharedPreferences` system, but remember that for sensitive data, consider utilizing the 'Android Keystore System' or the 'Jetpack Security' library, which offer much better protection than `SharedPreferences`. However, these more secure approaches may not be practical for sharing between applications with different signing keys without considerable complexity. This simplified example is ideal for demonstration purposes only within a suite of applications using the same signing configuration.

Lastly, let's address the problem of sharing data that may need to be encrypted and secured with a user-based password. It is important to use a secure storage mechanism provided by the underlying platform. For example, on iOS it is better to leverage `SecKeyChain` and on Android, the `Android KeyStore` together with a high-quality encryption library like 'Libsodium'. Here's an example with iOS for illustrative purposes:

```csharp
using System;
using Security;
using Foundation;
using System.Text;
using Sodium;
public static class SecureKeychainService
{
    public static bool SaveEncryptedString(string key, string value, string service, string accessGroup, byte[] encryptionKey)
    {
        try
        {
            byte[] encryptedValue = Sodium.SecretBox.Create(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(value), new byte[Sodium.SecretBox.NonceBytes], encryptionKey);
            var encodedEncryptedValue = NSData.FromArray(encryptedValue);

            var query = new SecRecord(SecKind.GenericPassword)
            {
                Service = service,
                Account = key,
                ValueData = encodedEncryptedValue,
                AccessGroup = accessGroup
            };

            SecStatusCode statusCode = SecKeyChain.Add(query);

            if (statusCode == SecStatusCode.Success)
            {
               return true;
            }
            else if (statusCode == SecStatusCode.DuplicateItem)
            {
                var updateQuery = new SecRecord(SecKind.GenericPassword)
                {
                    Service = service,
                    Account = key
                };
                var updateAttributes = new SecRecord(SecKind.GenericPassword)
                {
                    ValueData = encodedEncryptedValue,

                };
                 SecStatusCode updateStatusCode = SecKeyChain.Update(updateQuery, updateAttributes);
               return updateStatusCode == SecStatusCode.Success;
            }
           
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
              Console.WriteLine($"Error saving keychain entry: {ex}");
        }
      return false;
    }


    public static string LoadEncryptedString(string key, string service, string accessGroup, byte[] encryptionKey)
    {
          var query = new SecRecord(SecKind.GenericPassword)
            {
                Service = service,
                Account = key,
                AccessGroup = accessGroup,
                ReturnAttributes = true,
                ReturnData = true
            };

           SecStatusCode statusCode;
            var match = SecKeyChain.QueryAsRecord(query, out statusCode);

            if (statusCode == SecStatusCode.Success && match != null && match.ValueData != null)
            {
                try
                {
                    var encryptedValue = match.ValueData.ToArray();
                   
                    var decryptedValue = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(SecretBox.Open(encryptedValue, new byte[SecretBox.NonceBytes], encryptionKey));
                    return decryptedValue;

                }
                catch(Exception ex)
                {
                      Console.WriteLine($"Error decrypting: {ex}");
                }
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error loading keychain entry: {statusCode}");
             }
          return null;
    }
}
```

This example illustrates a highly secure approach using libsodium for encryption, requiring a shared encryption key between apps. The key management becomes the critical component and usually requires a dedicated backend service or careful consideration of using a user-derived key for encryption.

For further reading on this topic, I'd recommend consulting Apple's official documentation on 'Keychain Services' for iOS, specifically the sections on 'Access Control' and 'Sharing Keychain Items Among Applications'. On Android, delve into the documentation regarding the 'Android Keystore System' and explore the 'Jetpack Security' library for more robust solutions, and review the documentation on best practices for secure storage. Also the book "Serious Cryptography" by Jean-Philippe Aumasson provides a comprehensive overview of modern cryptography, and a good source of information on safe encryption practices. Finally, consider reviewing the latest OWASP Mobile Top Ten which gives real-world security issues when designing mobile applications. Remember, security is a multi-faceted challenge and requires careful planning and implementation.
