Okay, let's tackle this. I remember a particular project, back in the rails 3.2 days, where we had a convoluted user onboarding process that involved not only email verification but also a profile completeness check before full access was granted. We ran into the exact issue you're describing: devise would happily log a user in, even if our custom validation logic indicated they weren't *quite* ready. This led to a confusing user experience, and we needed to fix it pronto. The core problem, as you've probably surmised, is that devise, by default, focuses on authentication, not authorization or detailed validation status.

The solution lies in intercepting the authentication process and adding our own checks before a user session is fully created. Devise provides several hooks and callbacks that we can leverage. The most crucial one is `after_database_authentication`, which is called *after* the user has been authenticated by devise but *before* the user is signed in.

Let’s break down how I'd approach this, starting with a common scenario: requiring a user to verify their email address before fully logging in.

**Example 1: Email Verification Requirement**

First, you'd need to have an attribute on your user model to track email verification, something like `email_verified`. You'd likely have a mechanism (outside the scope of this discussion) to handle the email sending and verification process. Now, within your `User` model, you can extend the devise's callback:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable

  after_database_authentication :check_email_verification

  def check_email_verification
    throw(:warden, :message => :unverified_email) unless email_verified?
  end
end
```

In this snippet, `after_database_authentication` is where we insert our custom logic. The `check_email_verification` method is executed after the devise engine has authenticated the user via the database. If `email_verified?` returns `false`, we `throw(:warden, :message => :unverified_email)`. This `throw` halts the devise sign-in process. Importantly, devise catches this specific `warden` exception and doesn't fully sign the user in.

Next, you will need to configure the error message for your controller, most commonly `sessions_controller.rb`.

```ruby
# app/controllers/users/sessions_controller.rb

class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
  def create
    super
  rescue Warden::NotAuthenticated => e
    if e.message == :unverified_email
      flash[:alert] = "Please verify your email address before logging in."
      redirect_to new_user_session_path
    else
      raise e
    end
  end
end
```

This ensures that a user receives specific feedback regarding their email verification status during the sign-in flow.

**Example 2: Profile Completeness Validation**

Let's say you also want to block sign-in if essential profile information is missing, for instance, if the user has not filled in their first name or location. Extending the user model, it would look something like this:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable

  after_database_authentication :check_email_verification
  after_database_authentication :check_profile_completeness

  def check_email_verification
    throw(:warden, :message => :unverified_email) unless email_verified?
  end

  def check_profile_completeness
    throw(:warden, :message => :incomplete_profile) if first_name.blank? || location.blank?
  end
end
```

Here, we've added another `after_database_authentication` call, `check_profile_completeness`. If either `first_name` or `location` is missing, the sign-in process will be halted by throwing `:incomplete_profile`.

Similar to Example 1, you’ll need to handle this within `sessions_controller.rb`:

```ruby
# app/controllers/users/sessions_controller.rb

class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
  def create
    super
  rescue Warden::NotAuthenticated => e
    if e.message == :unverified_email
      flash[:alert] = "Please verify your email address before logging in."
      redirect_to new_user_session_path
    elsif e.message == :incomplete_profile
      flash[:alert] = "Please complete your profile before logging in."
      redirect_to edit_user_registration_path
    else
      raise e
    end
  end
end
```

Now, users will be redirected and informed about their incomplete profiles, encouraging them to take the necessary action.

**Example 3: Multi-factor Authentication Status**

Let’s consider a more complex scenario involving multi-factor authentication (mfa). Let’s assume you have an attribute on the `User` model such as `mfa_enabled`. You might want to block login if it’s enabled but not yet fully configured.

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable

  after_database_authentication :check_email_verification
  after_database_authentication :check_profile_completeness
  after_database_authentication :check_mfa_status

  def check_email_verification
    throw(:warden, :message => :unverified_email) unless email_verified?
  end

  def check_profile_completeness
    throw(:warden, :message => :incomplete_profile) if first_name.blank? || location.blank?
  end

  def check_mfa_status
     throw(:warden, :message => :mfa_not_configured) if mfa_enabled? && !mfa_configured?
  end

  def mfa_configured?
    # Custom logic to check if MFA is set up for the user (e.g., has a valid backup code or authenticator app configured)
    # ... your custom implementation goes here
    true # Example implementation
  end

end
```

In this expanded example, we added `check_mfa_status` and a helper method `mfa_configured?` (implementation is highly dependent on how you manage mfa). The login will be blocked if mfa is enabled but not configured properly.

```ruby
# app/controllers/users/sessions_controller.rb
class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
  def create
    super
  rescue Warden::NotAuthenticated => e
    if e.message == :unverified_email
      flash[:alert] = "Please verify your email address before logging in."
      redirect_to new_user_session_path
    elsif e.message == :incomplete_profile
      flash[:alert] = "Please complete your profile before logging in."
      redirect_to edit_user_registration_path
   elsif e.message == :mfa_not_configured
      flash[:alert] = "Please configure your multi-factor authentication settings."
      redirect_to user_mfa_settings_path # Or whatever your MFA configuration page is
    else
      raise e
    end
  end
end

```
And as above, the `SessionsController` handles the exception and redirects the user to the appropriate mfa config page.

**Important Considerations**

*   **Error Handling:** Always provide clear and specific error messages to the user. Blanket "login failed" messages are incredibly frustrating. As demonstrated above, use the `rescue` block in the sessions controller to catch these exceptions.
*   **Custom Redirects:** The redirect paths will vary based on your application's routes. Ensure these paths are correct.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test these scenarios with both unit and integration tests to guarantee that your validation logic and sign-in blocking are working as expected.

**Further Reading:**

For a deeper understanding of devise's internals and its hooks, the official Devise documentation is an excellent resource. I’d also suggest examining the source code of devise itself; it's remarkably well structured and serves as an exemplar of how to create extensible gems in ruby. Another recommended book is “Effective Rails: 72 Specific Ways to Improve Every Rails Application” by Peter J. Jang, which includes best practices for handling authentication.

By implementing these `after_database_authentication` checks, you're not fighting devise but rather extending its functionality in a way that maintains its core purpose—handling authentication—while you handle the necessary authorization logic to ensure a secure and user-friendly experience. This is, after all, often the core of dealing with authentication challenges: making sure a user can log in only when the preconditions are met.
