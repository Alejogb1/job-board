ah, the classic iframe cache conundrum. i’ve been down this rabbit hole more times than i care to remember, and it's usually a mix of browser quirks and security measures, not some grand conspiracy. let’s break this down.

first, the core of the problem, you're dealing with cross-site iframes. the browser's security sandbox is very strict here, and for good reason. when an iframe loads content from a different domain than the parent page, the browser clamps down on how it handles resources, especially cached ones. it's all about preventing malicious code from sneaking in, tracking, or doing bad things to the users.

now, regarding manually saved opaque caches, this usually implies you're using something like service workers or the cache api, both of which are powerful tools for controlling how resources are loaded but also very specific in how they operate. when a service worker intercepts a request from an iframe, it has a lot of say in what happens. but here's the kicker, if the response is opaque, meaning there are no cors headers and the content comes from a cross-origin site, the browser treats this data very cautiously.

the issue comes when the iframe is cross-origin and its requests try to access those opaque caches. the cache api is designed to keep things separate for a reason. a service worker on your parent page cannot simply access the cache used by the iframe and vice-versa because they're seen as different origins by the browser. think of it as separate, highly secure containers, and there's no shared access without very explicit configuration.

so, what happens is that your iframe ends up making a fresh request to the remote server even though you think the resource is already cached. the browser effectively ignores the cache it sees since it can't fully trust or inspect an opaque response from a cross-origin context. there's a very strict line of what can be accessed cross origin and what cannot and the browser enforces it without hesitation.

i remember this one time, i spent a whole weekend troubleshooting this for an image carousel, the images were loaded in iframes because that was the design choice i was forced to deal with. i had meticulously set up the cache api, meticulously tested with my own site and everything was perfectly working with my local mock server but when i deployed it to the real website, the images in the iframes were not loading from the cache. the first time it happened i was totally clueless and thought it was the service worker, but it was indeed the cross-site nature of my iframes combined with opaque responses. the solution involved a lot of trial and error and i've decided never again to use iframes this way again but its a good lesson learned.

ok, let's get a little bit more specific and go into how to tackle this with some practical examples.

first off, if you are in a situation you do have control over the server serving the content, then the first solution is the one i would recommend and it is to add cors headers on the server side. this allows the browser to trust the content and the caching mechanism will work across origins. you need to set appropriate `access-control-allow-origin` headers. for example, in node.js:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('access-control-allow-origin', '*'); // or specific origin
  res.setHeader('content-type', 'image/jpeg');
  // ... serve your image here ...
  res.end(yourImageData);
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('server on');
});
```

if you have a specific origin in mind, use that instead of `*`.  `*` is the wildcard, meaning any site can access the content, usually this is not very safe, but for educational purposes and for the sake of simplifying this, i used it, but usually, you should be more specific with what domains you are going to allow.

if you are in a situation you cannot change the server configuration, or you want to use service workers for better caching control, then you can use a service worker as a proxy. this way, the browser will always be accessing the resource from the same origin, hence bypassing the cross-origin restrictions. the service worker can intercept requests and return cached responses if available, effectively acting as a man-in-the-middle. here is a simple example:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
    const url = new URL(event.request.url);

    if (url.origin !== self.location.origin){
        event.respondWith(
            caches.match(event.request).then(cachedResponse => {
                if(cachedResponse){
                    return cachedResponse;
                }

                return fetch(event.request).then(networkResponse => {
                    if(networkResponse.status === 200){
                        const networkResponseClone = networkResponse.clone();
                        caches.open('my-cache').then(cache => {
                            cache.put(event.request, networkResponseClone);
                        })
                    }
                    return networkResponse;
                })
            })
        );
    }
});
```

this snippet checks if the request is cross-origin, and if it is, intercepts the request, looks into the cache for the resource, if it is not there, it fetches it, stores a copy in the cache and returns the resource, this way the cross-origin issue is basically circumvented. note that in this example i store and retrieve the resource from a cache called `my-cache`, you can change that name of course.

another option i've used, especially when dealing with images or static content, is to use data urls. this might sound crazy but, it's actually pretty effective. the service worker fetches the image or content from the cross-origin server and converts it into a base64 encoded data url which it then stores in the cache and serves directly within the iframe as a data url. this eliminates the need for the iframe to make the cross-origin request in the first place.  this works well with small images but for larger assets, base64 data urls can get quite huge and may not be the most performant.

```javascript
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
    const url = new URL(event.request.url);

    if (url.origin !== self.location.origin) {
        event.respondWith(
            caches.match(event.request).then(cachedResponse => {
                if(cachedResponse){
                    return cachedResponse;
                }
                return fetch(event.request)
                        .then(response => response.blob())
                        .then(blob => new Promise(resolve => {
                            const reader = new FileReader();
                            reader.onloadend = () => resolve(reader.result);
                            reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
                            })
                        )
                        .then(dataUrl => {
                            const cacheResponse = new Response(dataUrl, {
                                headers: {'content-type':'text/plain'}
                            });
                            caches.open('my-cache')
                                .then(cache => cache.put(event.request, cacheResponse))
                            return new Response(dataUrl, {
                                headers: {'content-type':'text/plain'}
                            });
                    })
            })
        );
    }
});
```

in this code, i am fetching the cross-origin resource, converting it to a blob, then using a file reader to create a base64 url from the blob, the service worker then stores this url as a plain text response, and returns it to the iframe, again circumventing the cross-origin restrictions. notice, that i am returning a new `response` object with the `content-type` set to `text/plain`, this is very important because you can only store `response` objects in the cache and `dataurls` are not `response` objects.

now, these are just examples and of course, there's a lot more to consider but i think i covered the main ways to handle this problem of opaque cross origin cached responses with iframes. it is a frustrating problem to deal with, i know, i've been there, but once you understand what is happening under the hood, it becomes a bit easier. also remember, not all browsers implement everything exactly the same way so it's always a good idea to do thorough testing in different environments.

as for good references, i always found the mdn web docs on service workers and the cache api invaluable.  the "high performance browser networking" book by ilya grigorik is also fantastic and can give you in depth knowledge of caching and network protocols. also, do not sleep on the w3c spec documents, they are incredibly detailed and a good read when you have the time, they provide all the low-level details you might need. they are also quite dry, so brew a good cup of coffee before starting to read those. and as an old colleague of mine used to say, "the best way to understand cache is to build one yourself" – he was not wrong. also, always make sure your headers are correct. the amount of times i've spent scratching my head because of a simple header typo it's incredible, you would think i would have learned the lesson by now... i think i need a coffee.
