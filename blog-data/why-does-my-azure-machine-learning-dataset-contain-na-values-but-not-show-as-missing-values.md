Let's unpack this. I've seen this exact scenario a few times in my career, and it’s always a bit of a head-scratcher initially. The frustration is real: you’re staring at a dataset littered with 'NA's, yet your typical pandas `isnull()` or similar checks report nothing missing. It’s not that the data is corrupt, necessarily; it’s about how those 'NA' strings are being treated within your data processing pipelines, and most likely, about the data's initial representation.

The root cause here generally lies in the subtle but critical difference between how string representations of “NA” are handled versus actual null, nan, or none-type data structures. In many data sources, especially CSV exports or data ingested from external systems, the term 'NA' is represented as a literal string "NA". This means that while *you* see it as an indication of a missing value, your data processing tools (like pandas, spark, or the Azure ML environment's data transformers) treat it as just another string character sequence.

This is a common issue, especially during data ingestion phases. Think of a scenario where a system outputs an 'NA' string when a measurement is not available or valid. These 'NA's, when not processed correctly, propagate through your pipeline, resulting in models trained on data that technically doesn't have 'missing values', but suffers from an equivalent problem.

The core issue, therefore, is a data *type* mismatch, not a data *absence*. We aren’t missing values; we have string representations that *mean* missing values. To remedy this, we need to explicitly convert these string values into actual, machine-understandable representations of missing data, usually using numpy's `np.nan` or similar methods suitable for your environment and data representation.

Let’s dive into specifics, starting with common data manipulation techniques. I'll use pandas within python for the examples, as this is a widely used data analysis tool:

**Example 1: Identifying and Replacing "NA" Strings in Pandas**

Here's a concise snippet I’ve used countless times. Suppose your dataframe `df` has a column named ‘feature_x’ that contains those pesky "NA" strings:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Example dataframe with "NA" strings
data = {'feature_x': ['10', 'NA', '20', 'NA', '30'], 'feature_y': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print("Original dataframe:")
print(df)
print("\n'feature_x' column is null?", df['feature_x'].isnull().any()) # checking for 'actual' nulls
print("\n'feature_x' column with 'NA' values:", df['feature_x'].value_counts())

# Convert "NA" strings to np.nan
df['feature_x'] = df['feature_x'].replace('NA', np.nan)

print("\nModified dataframe:")
print(df)
print("\n'feature_x' column is null?", df['feature_x'].isnull().any()) # checking again for actual nulls
print("\n'feature_x' column null value counts:", df['feature_x'].isnull().sum())
```

In this code block, the first two print statements clearly show that `isnull()` doesn't detect missing values initially, and that those "NA" values are considered as just another string type entry in that specific column. After the replace operation, however, the `isnull()` check successfully detects them and the null value count now accurately reflects the true number of missing entries. This replacement using `np.nan` makes the missing data visible to pandas functions.

**Example 2: More Flexible Missing Value Handling**

It’s also a good idea to anticipate that your dataset might use other representations for missing values such as empty strings or other unique identifiers. Here's a more flexible approach that allows for handling multiple 'missing' values:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Example dataframe with varied missing value representations
data = {'feature_x': ['10', 'NA', '', '20', 'none'], 'feature_y': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print("Original dataframe:")
print(df)
print("\n'feature_x' column is null?", df['feature_x'].isnull().any())

missing_values = ['NA', '', 'none'] # list containing all string representations of missing values to be handled
df['feature_x'] = df['feature_x'].replace(missing_values, np.nan)

print("\nModified dataframe:")
print(df)
print("\n'feature_x' column is null?", df['feature_x'].isnull().any())
print("\n'feature_x' column null value counts:", df['feature_x'].isnull().sum())
```

This approach uses a list to define a set of strings that should be interpreted as missing values and converts all of those to actual missing values all in one go. The `isnull()` function can now accurately count the number of missing values in that column. This provides for a very flexible way of processing data that comes from sources that may not represent missing values in a uniform way.

**Example 3: Handling missing values during data loading**

Pandas also allows us to handle such missing values during the csv loading stage itself. When loading data with the `read_csv()` method, one can directly specify the strings that one wants to consider as missing values. Consider that you have a csv file called 'my_data.csv' with a similar structure as in example 2. You can use the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

missing_values = ['NA', '', 'none'] # list containing all string representations of missing values to be handled

df = pd.read_csv('my_data.csv', na_values=missing_values)

print("\nModified dataframe:")
print(df)
print("\n'feature_x' column is null?", df['feature_x'].isnull().any())
print("\n'feature_x' column null value counts:", df['feature_x'].isnull().sum())
```

In this third example, `pandas` directly treats entries defined within the 'na_values' list as proper missing values while loading the data, thus cutting the conversion phase. This is a particularly efficient approach as it ensures data cleanliness from the start and may be a preferred method in production systems.

**Key Takeaways and Recommendations:**

*   **Data Ingestion Practices:** Always scrutinize your data upon ingestion and apply transformations at the very beginning to convert string representations of missing data to `np.nan` or your framework’s equivalent representation of a null value. This will avoid many future frustrations down the line.
*   **Understand your Data Sources:** Thoroughly understand the conventions used by your data sources when representing missing values. Some may use `null` as a literal string, some may use `-999`, some might be empty string. All of these must be considered.
*   **Data Quality Checks:** Implement checks that look for both actual and "string-represented" missing data to ensure data cleanliness.
*   **Consistency is Key**: Avoid processing data in a way that handles missing values differently depending on their representation. Having to deal with a mixture of "NA" and np.nan in the same column in your pipeline is a recipe for disaster.
*   **Documentation:** Make sure that the handling of missing values within your pipelines is well documented so that other team members can quickly understand and debug when issues arise.

For a deeper dive into data cleaning and preprocessing, I’d recommend “Data Wrangling with Python” by Jacqueline Kazil and Katharine Jarmul; they do a particularly good job of covering issues of this kind. Also, "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney (the creator of pandas) is another essential read. For more theoretical foundations of data preprocessing, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron provides excellent contextual information.

In essence, the “NA but not missing” issue boils down to properly interpreting your data’s semantic content, and knowing how to translate that into usable data representations for downstream tasks. It's not a problem of bad data; it's an issue of appropriate data handling.
