Alright, let's tackle this `RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied`. I've seen this particular error more times than I care to recall, and usually, it boils down to a mismatch in the dimensions of your matrices when you’re attempting matrix multiplication. It's a common hiccup, especially when working with libraries like numpy in python or similar matrix algebra operations in other languages. Don't worry, it's something we can definitely sort out.

The core issue, as the error message succinctly states, is a shape incompatibility during multiplication. When performing matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix (mat1) *must* equal the number of rows in the second matrix (mat2). If this condition isn’t met, the operation simply isn’t defined mathematically, and your runtime environment quite rightly throws an exception. Think of it like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole; it just won't work.

In my early days, I spent a good chunk of time debugging a recommender system I was building. We were using collaborative filtering, and I constantly stumbled upon this error. It turned out a data pre-processing step had inadvertently transposed some of our user-item interaction matrices, causing this exact mismatch when feeding the matrices into our model’s multiplication operations. It taught me a valuable lesson: always double-check your matrix dimensions, especially after transformations.

Let's dive into some more concrete examples with Python and the numpy library.

**Example 1: Simple shape mismatch.**

Let's say we define two matrices:

```python
import numpy as np

mat1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) # shape (2, 3)
mat2 = np.array([[7, 8], [9, 10]])     # shape (2, 2)

try:
    result = np.dot(mat1, mat2) # numpy's matrix multiplication
    print(result)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Caught a RuntimeError: {e}")
```

Running this code will produce the `RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied` because the number of columns in `mat1` (3) is not equal to the number of rows in `mat2` (2). `np.dot`, in this case, is the core of the issue, attempting an invalid multiplication and throwing the error. The dimensions don't align; it’s like trying to multiply a (2x3) with a (2x2).

The fix is usually to modify the shape of one or both of the matrices to meet the multiplication criteria. To achieve valid multiplication we need mat2 to have 3 rows. Here is the corrected version:

```python
import numpy as np

mat1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) # shape (2, 3)
mat2 = np.array([[7, 8], [9, 10], [11,12]])     # shape (3, 2)

try:
    result = np.dot(mat1, mat2) # numpy's matrix multiplication
    print(result)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Caught a RuntimeError: {e}")
```

This snippet will successfully perform the matrix multiplication operation, yielding a result because the number of columns in `mat1` (3) is now equal to the number of rows in `mat2` (3). The resulting matrix has the dimensions of 2x2.

**Example 2: Transposition for Correct Multiplication**

Sometimes the matrices are inherently compatible but in the wrong orientation. In this scenario, transposition comes to our rescue. Transposing a matrix flips its rows and columns, effectively switching its dimensions. Let's see this in action.

```python
import numpy as np

mat1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  # shape (2, 3)
mat2 = np.array([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])  # shape (2, 3)

try:
    result = np.dot(mat1, mat2)
    print(result)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Caught a RuntimeError: {e}")
```

This will still throw the error because the matrices are both 2x3. However, if our intended matrix multiplication was to multiply by the transpose of `mat2`, then the number of columns in `mat1` (3) will match the number of rows in the transpose of `mat2`, as the transpose would have the dimensions 3x2. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

mat1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  # shape (2, 3)
mat2 = np.array([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])  # shape (2, 3)

try:
    result = np.dot(mat1, mat2.T) # numpy's matrix multiplication with transpose
    print(result)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Caught a RuntimeError: {e}")
```

Now this executes perfectly because the transpose operation, `mat2.T`, changes `mat2` from (2,3) to (3,2) and satisfies the multiplication rule; this is quite common to encounter in practical scenarios when matrices are provided in specific orientations for other data processing purposes before matrix multiplication.

**Example 3: Diagnosing Shape Issues in Larger Operations**

In more complex scenarios involving multiple matrix operations, debugging the shape issue becomes more intricate. Suppose you are performing a series of chained multiplications within a larger function. This can make it hard to identify where the shape error is occurring. Consider the following:

```python
import numpy as np

def process_matrices(A, B, C):
    temp1 = np.dot(A, B)
    temp2 = np.dot(temp1, C)
    return temp2

A = np.random.rand(3, 4) # shape (3, 4)
B = np.random.rand(4, 5) # shape (4, 5)
C = np.random.rand(6, 2) # shape (6, 2)


try:
   result = process_matrices(A, B, C)
   print(result)
except RuntimeError as e:
   print(f"Caught a RuntimeError: {e}")
```

This code will raise an error because `temp1` would have a shape of (3,5) which isn’t compatible with matrix C which has dimensions (6,2) during the second dot product operation.

To debug this, you would typically inspect the shapes of each intermediate matrix, `temp1`, and compare it to `C` to pinpoint the exact location of the shape problem. One effective strategy is to add print statements to output the shapes. Here is an updated version:

```python
import numpy as np

def process_matrices(A, B, C):
    temp1 = np.dot(A, B)
    print(f"Shape of temp1: {temp1.shape}") # added this for debugging
    temp2 = np.dot(temp1, C)
    return temp2

A = np.random.rand(3, 4) # shape (3, 4)
B = np.random.rand(4, 5) # shape (4, 5)
C = np.random.rand(6, 2) # shape (6, 2)


try:
   result = process_matrices(A, B, C)
   print(result)
except RuntimeError as e:
   print(f"Caught a RuntimeError: {e}")

```
This diagnostic step will reveal the shape incompatibility in the second matrix multiplication. To resolve this, you would either modify the definition of C or the earlier transformations in the chain, until the dimensions are correct for matrix multiplication. In this instance, I would need to modify C such that its number of rows match the number of columns in temp1 i.e., 5, for the final multiplication to be valid.

**Recommendations for Further Study:**

For a deeper understanding of linear algebra principles, which are fundamental to understanding matrix operations, I would recommend "Linear Algebra and Its Applications" by Gilbert Strang. It's a classic text that offers a strong theoretical foundation while remaining accessible. Also, for a more practical guide on numerical computing with numpy in python, look into "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney, the original creator of pandas. Finally, for more specific theoretical background on tensor operations in machine learning contexts I would recommend studying material based on the course on the math of deep learning from MIT OCW. These resources, combined with practice, will enhance your intuition around matrix shapes and make errors like this much easier to diagnose and resolve.

In conclusion, remember that this `RuntimeError` signals that you have a shape mismatch during matrix multiplication. It's crucial to meticulously verify the dimensions of your matrices before performing any multiplication operations. By thoroughly understanding the mathematics of matrix multiplication and employing debugging techniques, this error will become far less daunting. I hope these examples and explanations help resolve your current issue!
