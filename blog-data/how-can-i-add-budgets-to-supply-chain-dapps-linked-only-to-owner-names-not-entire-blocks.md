Alright,  Thinking back to my time working on a distributed ledger system for a pharmaceutical supply chain, we wrestled with a very similar problem—allocating spending based on entity identity rather than arbitrary block boundaries. The fundamental challenge is avoiding the pitfalls of associating financial data with the global state of the blockchain. Doing so would expose sensitive budget information to anyone with access to the ledger. We need something more granular, tying spending directly to the identities involved. Here's how we approached it, and how you can too.

The core concept is to implement a permissioned access control layer *on top of* your existing distributed application (DApp) architecture, coupled with a carefully designed state management system. Forget about directly embedding budgets into the blocks themselves; that's a recipe for disaster. Instead, we'll leverage smart contracts to enforce spending limits based on the owners you're interested in.

My experience with this showed that there are three essential aspects: user identification, secure storage, and enforcement logic.

First, **user identification**. You mentioned 'owner names.' In blockchain systems, these are typically represented by cryptographic identities, either public keys or wallet addresses. We need to make a distinction here between a human-readable name and the underlying cryptographic identity that actually controls the budget. You'll need some form of mapping, maybe within your smart contract or a supplementary service, to associate human-readable names with the corresponding address. Never use names directly for on-chain logic due to security and mutability. Treat the address as the primary identifier.

Second, we need **secure storage**. Your budget data isn't directly stored on the blockchain in a visible manner. We're not writing the budget amount next to a transaction like, “Owner X spent $50”. Doing so would be a huge privacy violation. Instead, we maintain an off-chain state (or potentially an encrypted on-chain representation) that the smart contract can access via external data sources, or via specific, secure channels, to make decisions. It's crucial to understand that “on-chain” doesn’t mean that everything needs to be visible to everyone. Rather, a contract has visibility into specific data within its scope. The budget balance for a specific address can be held in contract storage, but access should be restricted.

Third, we need clear **enforcement logic**. We'll be implementing this logic within our smart contracts to ensure that a transaction is only allowed if the owner (represented by their cryptographic identity) has sufficient funds available. This is where the budget data from the secure storage is accessed and checked during transaction processing.

Now, let’s illustrate this with code snippets. I’ll use solidity for these examples, as it’s quite common for DApps. Keep in mind that for production you would want rigorous security audits and testing.

**Example 1: Basic Budget Mapping in Smart Contract**

This example shows a contract where budget amounts are held directly in the contract's storage. This demonstrates basic allocation and validation but has limited scalability and transparency control as all amounts are visible within the contract. It is critical to note that in the examples, owner address is used, rather than owner name.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BudgetController {
    mapping(address => uint256) public budgetBalances;

    function setInitialBudget(address _owner, uint256 _amount) public {
        budgetBalances[_owner] = _amount;
    }

    function spend(address _owner, uint256 _amount) public returns (bool) {
        if (budgetBalances[_owner] >= _amount) {
            budgetBalances[_owner] -= _amount;
            // Perform transaction logic here.
            return true;
        }
        return false; // Insufficient funds.
    }

    function getBalance(address _owner) public view returns (uint256){
      return budgetBalances[_owner];
    }
}
```

Here we have a simple contract that maintains a mapping of `address` to `uint256` that represents budget balances. The `setInitialBudget` function allows setting a budget for a specific address. The `spend` function checks if the address has sufficient funds and executes the transaction if it does. Finally, `getBalance` provides the current balance. This is a simplified illustration to show how individual budgets per address could work.

**Example 2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

This example uses access control to enhance the contract by introducing administrative functions to manage budgets and to manage who can modify the budgets.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BudgetControllerRBAC {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => uint256) public budgetBalances;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyAdmin() {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Caller is not admin.");
        _;
    }


    function setInitialBudget(address _owner, uint256 _amount) public onlyAdmin {
        budgetBalances[_owner] = _amount;
    }

    function adjustBudget(address _owner, int256 _adjustment) public onlyAdmin {
        // Handle case where adjustment is negative, ensuring it won't lead to a negative balance.
        require(int256(budgetBalances[_owner]) + _adjustment >= 0, "Negative balance");
        budgetBalances[_owner] = uint256(int256(budgetBalances[_owner]) + _adjustment);

    }

    function spend(address _owner, uint256 _amount) public returns (bool) {
        if (budgetBalances[_owner] >= _amount) {
            budgetBalances[_owner] -= _amount;
           // Perform transaction logic here.
            return true;
        }
        return false; // Insufficient funds.
    }

    function getBalance(address _owner) public view returns (uint256){
      return budgetBalances[_owner];
    }

}
```

In this example we’ve added an `admin` which can be used to set and adjust budgets, demonstrating more complex contract management. The `onlyAdmin` modifier restricts specific functions from non-admins. This is closer to what you would see in an actual application.

**Example 3: Using Off-Chain Data with an Oracle**

This example illustrates how a contract can retrieve balance data from an off-chain source (or “oracle”). This is important as direct on-chain storage can become expensive and can reveal sensitive information. The example is simplified, as integrating an oracle is a complex topic itself.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface OracleInterface {
  function getBalance(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract BudgetControllerOracle {

    OracleInterface public oracle;

    constructor(address _oracleAddress){
      oracle = OracleInterface(_oracleAddress);
    }

    function spend(address _owner, uint256 _amount) public returns (bool) {
       uint256 balance = oracle.getBalance(_owner);
      if (balance >= _amount) {
         // Perform transaction logic here.
            return true;
        }
        return false; // Insufficient funds.
    }

}
```

In this example, the `BudgetControllerOracle` relies on an `OracleInterface` to obtain a balance. This balance is retrieved off-chain by the oracle, reducing storage overhead and increasing flexibility. Note that you must use a properly secured oracle solution to prevent attacks or compromised data.

For a deeper understanding, I recommend several resources. First, delve into "Mastering Ethereum" by Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood; it’s a good all-round guide. Then, examine the "Solidity Documentation" for a detailed insight into smart contract development itself. Finally, I would suggest a paper, or articles about Chainlink (or other oracle solutions) for reliable off-chain data integration, if going with the oracle approach; the Chainlink whitepaper serves as a good starting point.

Implementing budget control with owner names (mapped to addresses) on a supply chain DApp requires thoughtful design centered around access control and state management. The approaches I have detailed avoid the pitfalls of direct on-chain budget visibility. We need to handle identities through cryptography, secure budget storage, and contract enforcement logic. By implementing a smart contract that can control access and perform transactions, you will be able to control spending based on owners, without revealing sensitive information on the blockchain.
