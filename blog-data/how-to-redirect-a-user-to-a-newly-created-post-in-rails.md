Let's get straight to it; redirecting a user after creating a new record in Rails is a bread-and-butter operation, but there's a spectrum of correctness in how one can approach it. I've spent countless hours debugging applications where even this seemingly simple task was implemented poorly, leading to usability headaches and unnecessary server load. My focus will be on providing not just *how* to do it, but *why* certain methods are preferable.

The most fundamental aspect to understand is the HTTP redirect itself—specifically, a `303 See Other` redirect after a successful `POST` request that creates new data. This ensures that users won't accidentally re-submit a form if they refresh their browser. We’re moving away from the initial form submission to a distinct `GET` request for displaying the newly created resource. Let’s think of a blog post creation as an example here.

In the controller, after a successful save, we don’t simply render a view. Instead, we trigger a `redirect_to` which issues the required `303` response along with a `Location` header indicating where the browser should navigate. We can achieve this redirection in several ways, but they come with varying degrees of elegance and maintainability.

First, and often seen in older or less mature codebases, is the manual construction of a redirect path using string interpolation or `url_for` with explicit parameters.

```ruby
# In a 'PostsController'
def create
  @post = Post.new(post_params)
  if @post.save
    # This approach is workable, but cumbersome
    redirect_to "/posts/#{@post.id}"
  else
    render :new
  end
end
```

While this works, it's brittle. If your routing configuration changes, this code breaks. You’ll need to manually update every instance where such hardcoded paths exist. Not an ideal situation in a large codebase.

A superior method is to leverage Rails's route helpers. Rails generates convenient methods based on the defined routes, allowing you to refer to routes by name rather than explicitly constructing paths. In our case, we will be relying on what we might call the 'show' route for the newly created resource. This assumes you have a route like:

```ruby
# in config/routes.rb
resources :posts
```
Which generates routes including `post_path(:id)`, `edit_post_path(:id)`, etc. The beauty here is that when your routing configuration changes, the `post_path` helper is updated accordingly.

Here's the updated example demonstrating how it’s done:

```ruby
# In a 'PostsController'
def create
  @post = Post.new(post_params)
  if @post.save
    # Using the 'post_path' helper
    redirect_to post_path(@post)
  else
    render :new
  end
end
```

Much cleaner, isn't it? This version is shorter, more expressive, and inherently more robust. It expresses intent more clearly and makes refactoring easier if your app grows.

Now let’s delve into a more advanced use case—redirecting with flash messages. Flash messages are temporary notices displayed to the user, like success messages or error alerts. It would be helpful to display a message after the post was created so that the user has feedback to know that their submission was processed.

```ruby
# In a 'PostsController'
def create
    @post = Post.new(post_params)
    if @post.save
        flash[:notice] = "Post created successfully!"
        redirect_to post_path(@post)
    else
        flash.now[:alert] = "There was an error creating your post."
        render :new
    end
end
```

In this scenario, if the post creation fails, I’ve used `flash.now` for displaying error messages within the same request-response cycle so that it will render the `new` view, which will then display the message to the user. The crucial distinction here is between `flash[:alert]` and `flash.now[:alert]`. The former persists across redirects, while the latter appears on the current page only. The `now` method prevents the message from leaking into the redirect flow should an error occur during form submission.

A few practical tips gleaned from years of experience might be helpful at this juncture. Ensure that all your controllers have error-handling for invalid parameters, or cases where saving an object may fail. In many older applications, I’ve witnessed fatal errors when a record fails to save due to improper input, leading to a failed save that does not direct the user back to the form. Instead, the user may just experience an error page. It is helpful to have explicit checks and to redirect them to a safe space (i.e. the form with error messages) in the case of a failed save.

Also, be mindful of edge cases in nested resource routes. For instance, a comment nested under a post should redirect using `post_comment_path(@post, @comment)` rather than simply `comment_path(@comment)`. Incorrect route helpers create a debugging nightmare and are a common mistake that can cause confusion.

Finally, while `redirect_to` is perfect for most cases, understand when `render` is necessary. If validation fails, redirecting the user back to the form doesn’t repopulate the form with the values they just entered. By using `render :new` we keep the errors and the form data on the page and this offers a much better user experience. It is important to not redirect users back to a form if the goal is to display errors. You should only redirect when the goal is to change the page the user is on.

For those keen to delve deeper, I highly recommend reading *Agile Web Development with Rails*, by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas and David Heinemeier Hansson. It gives a comprehensive look at the entire process, including route structuring and redirection strategies. Another valuable reference is Martin Fowler’s *Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture* which dives into the importance of separating concerns and establishing best practices at the architectural level. It is useful to be familiar with these fundamental principles to avoid making common mistakes in the future.

In closing, properly redirecting after resource creation isn’t just about making code work; it’s about designing user-friendly applications that are easy to maintain and evolve. Using route helpers, flash messages, and thoughtful error handling dramatically improves your codebase and the end-user experience. As with most things in web development, the devil is truly in the details.
