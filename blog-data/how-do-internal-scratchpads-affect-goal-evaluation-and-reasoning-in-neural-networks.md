Okay so you wanna know about internal scratchpads in neural nets and how they mess with goal evaluation and reasoning right  Pretty cool question actually  It's like asking how a brain uses its internal mental whiteboard to figure stuff out  Except instead of a brain we've got a bunch of interconnected nodes firing away

The thing is  these nets don't *think* like we do  They don't have intentions or beliefs or anything  They just crunch numbers based on the weights and connections they've learned  But these scratchpads  they're a way to give the network a kind of working memory a place to store and manipulate information during the process

Imagine a network trying to solve a maze  Without a scratchpad it has to rely entirely on its current input  It sees a wall it turns  It sees an opening it goes  No memory of where it's been  no strategy  just reacting

Now give it a scratchpad  Suddenly it can remember which paths it's already tried  It can keep track of its progress  maybe even develop a little strategy like "always turn left unless you hit a wall"  The scratchpad lets it hold onto information that's relevant to the overall goal of finding the exit

This affects goal evaluation in a big way  Without a scratchpad the network judges its progress solely based on its immediate surroundings  With one it can take a longer view  It can compare its current state to its remembered starting state and get a better sense of how close it is to the solution

Reasoning is also completely changed  A network without a scratchpad is basically doing a giant pattern match  It sees input spits out output  No real "thinking" involved  But with a scratchpad  it can manipulate that information  It can combine things  It can reason by analogy  It's a far cry from human reasoning of course  but it's a step up

So how does it actually work  Well there are different ways to implement these scratchpads  One popular method is using recurrent neural networks RNNs  These networks have loops in their connections  meaning information can circle back and affect future processing  This loop acts as a kind of short-term memory  the scratchpad

Here's a simple code example using PyTorch showing a basic RNN  this isnt a super sophisticated scratchpad just a simple example to show the idea

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleRNN, self).__init__()
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)
        out = self.fc(out[-1]) #Only taking the last hidden state as output
        return out

# Example usage
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
output_size = 5
rnn = SimpleRNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
input_seq = torch.randn(10, input_size) # Sequence length 10
output = rnn(input_seq)
print(output)
```

That hidden state in the RNN  that's your scratchpad  it's updated at each time step  holding onto information from the past

Another approach uses external memory  Think of this like a separate memory unit that the network can read and write to  This is more flexible than the RNN approach because the memory can be much larger and more structured

This is where things like Neural Turing Machines and Differentiable Neural Computers come into play  They're designed to interact with an external memory addressing it reading from it and writing to it all in a differentiable way which is crucial for training

Here's a simplified conceptual illustration not actual code  imagine a network interacting with an external memory like a simple key value store

```python
# Conceptual illustration - not runnable code

memory = {}  # Our external key-value store

# Network processes input and decides to store something
key = "path_taken"
value = [1, 2, 3]  # Represents the path the network has taken
memory[key] = value

# Later the network retrieves the stored information
retrieved_value = memory.get(key)
# Network uses this information for reasoning

```

The key here is that the network learns to use the memory effectively  It learns which information to store  how to address that information and how to use it to guide its decisions

Finally  some networks use attention mechanisms as a kind of dynamic scratchpad  Attention allows the network to focus on different parts of its input at different times  effectively giving it a way to prioritize information and to selectively remember things

Here's another simplified code example demonstrating a conceptual attention mechanism  again not a full runnable program


```python
# Conceptual illustration - not runnable code

input_data = [feature1, feature2, feature3] # some input features
attention_weights = [0.2, 0.7, 0.1] # network calculated weights

weighted_sum = 0
for i in range(len(input_data)):
  weighted_sum += input_data[i] * attention_weights[i]

#Weighted_sum acts as a focused representation.


```


The weights represent the network's focus  it gives more weight to the important features effectively selectively remembering them


So you see  internal scratchpads are a really interesting development  They allow networks to exhibit more complex behavior  closer to actual reasoning  than you'd see in simpler architectures  To dive deeper  I recommend checking out  "Neural Turing Machines" by Graves et al  "Differentiable Neural Computers" by Weston et al and some papers on attention mechanisms  There are also some excellent textbooks on deep learning that discuss these topics in detail  look for ones that cover recurrent networks  memory-augmented neural networks and attention mechanisms  Good luck  Let me know if you want to explore any of this further
