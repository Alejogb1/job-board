Alright,  I've seen this exact situation unfold more times than I care to recall, usually in the wee hours after someone's rushed deployment. The short answer, and I want to stress this, is no. Manually triggering a dag in a workflow orchestration tool, like airflow for instance, does *not* force it to execute based on its defined utc schedule. It’s a common misunderstanding, and it stems from the way these tools decouple scheduling logic from execution.

To break this down further, think of a dag as a blueprint. That blueprint contains the logic of your workflow, detailing what tasks need to be executed and in what order. It also includes, crucially, a schedule. This schedule, often expressed as a cron expression or predefined interval, tells the scheduler *when* to create a dag run – an instance of that blueprint being executed. When you manually trigger a dag, you're essentially saying "execute this *now*", bypassing the scheduler's logic entirely.

The scheduled execution relies on the scheduler constantly evaluating the dag's definition and its schedule. Every few seconds (the scheduler's heartbeat, often configurable), it checks to see if a new dag run should be created based on the specified schedule. If the time falls within a scheduled window, a new run is instantiated and added to a queue for the worker processes to pick up and execute.

Manual triggering, on the other hand, is an explicit command to the scheduler to instantiate a run immediately, regardless of what the schedule dictates. It’s like pushing the ‘go’ button directly. The execution will respect all the dependencies specified in the dag but it completely ignores the predefined schedule logic. This distinction is crucial to grasp, especially when dealing with time-sensitive operations or downstream dependencies relying on specific execution windows.

Now, let's solidify this with some practical examples. I’ll keep it concise and focus on illustrating the core point. Assume we're using something airflow-like, although the underlying principle remains the same for most workflow engines.

**Example 1: Scheduled Daily DAG vs. Manual Trigger**

Let’s say we have a simple dag scheduled to run at 3:00 am utc daily.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='daily_data_ingestion',
    schedule_interval='0 3 * * *', # Run daily at 3:00 AM UTC
    start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26),
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    ingest_data = BashOperator(
        task_id='ingest_data_task',
        bash_command='echo "Ingesting data..."',
    )
```

If I let this dag run according to the schedule, it will trigger at 3:00 am utc. But if I go to the user interface or use the cli and manually trigger a run at 10:00 am utc, that manual run will execute *immediately* at 10:00 am utc, not when the scheduler would normally schedule it (which would be 3:00 am utc the next day), and it will not interfere with the scheduled execution at 3:00 am the next day.

**Example 2: Understanding `execution_date`**

The *execution date* is a critical component to understand. This date represents the logical time this dag run is associated with, usually the *start* of the scheduling interval, not the actual moment it's executed. If our example dag is scheduled at 3:00 am utc daily, and we manually trigger it at 10:00 am utc, the `execution_date` associated with the manual run will be the previous scheduled time, so if I trigger on October 27th at 10am, the `execution_date` will still be October 27th 3:00 am utc. However, for that manually run, the actual time it runs is October 27th 10:00 am utc, not October 27th 3:00 am utc. If you have tasks that look at this variable, this difference can cause problems if you don’t account for it. Let’s see an example where a task uses `execution_date`:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
from airflow.utils.timezone import datetime

def print_execution_date(**context):
    print(f"Execution date: {context['execution_date']}")
    print(f"Run id: {context['run_id']}")

with DAG(
    dag_id='execution_date_dag',
    schedule_interval='0 3 * * *',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26),
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    print_date = PythonOperator(
        task_id='print_date_task',
        python_callable=print_execution_date
    )
```
When triggered manually, the `execution_date` context variable will contain the previously scheduled run time, not the time of the manual execution. This often causes confusion and can impact pipelines expecting the run to occur in a very specific window if they're using the `execution_date` inappropriately.

**Example 3: Using external sensors**

Let’s imagine we have a dag that depends on data being present in s3 at specific time before kicking off. The sensor runs as part of the schedule and will only run at the scheduled time and will stop if the data is not available. When manually triggering the dag, the sensor still triggers, but because it can’t see that the data was created at the right time, the sensor may timeout and fail. Let’s look at a simple example:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.sensors.time_delta import TimeDeltaSensor
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

with DAG(
    dag_id='sensor_example',
    schedule_interval='0 3 * * *',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26),
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    wait_for_data = TimeDeltaSensor(
        task_id='wait_for_data',
        delta=timedelta(hours=2), # wait for two hours
    )

    process_data = BashOperator(
        task_id='process_data',
        bash_command='echo "Processing data..."',
    )
    wait_for_data >> process_data
```

The time sensor checks if it is at least two hours after the last scheduled execution time. If we manually trigger this at, say, 10:00 am UTC, the sensor will only wait for two hours from the scheduled run time at 3:00 am UTC.

To avoid such confusion and errors, I would strongly advise reading the airflow documentation regarding scheduling and execution dates. The "Running DAGs" and "Time & Datetime in Airflow" sections are essential. As well, “Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow” by Bas Pijls and Maxime Beauchemin provides a great foundation for understanding scheduling and DAG execution flow in a more conceptual way. Additionally, a deep dive into the “cron” specification as described in the posix standard will help. For a more theoretical understanding of workflow systems, the paper “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hyperparameter Tuning System” by Google Research delves into the complexities of distributed scheduling, offering invaluable insight. Finally, I’d recommend investigating the behavior of the specific scheduling engine you’re working with; even within the Apache ecosystem, spark’s scheduling is different from airflow’s.

In summary, while manually triggering a DAG offers a way to execute it immediately, it absolutely does *not* adhere to the schedule specified in the DAG definition. It's crucial to understand this distinction to avoid unexpected behavior and maintain the integrity of your workflows. Proper understanding of execution date and the subtle nuances of your chosen workflow engine will prevent these types of headaches, trust me; I've lived this scenario more times than I care to remember.
