Alright so you're wrestling with `statsmodels` confidence intervals in Python 2.7 eh Been there done that let me tell you that's a trip down memory lane

First off yeah Python 2.7 its a bit of a legacy situation nowadays most folks have moved on to Python 3x but hey sometimes you're stuck with what you got Believe me I've been there had to maintain a legacy system running 2.7 for a company once ugh it was a whole project in itself

So `statsmodels` its a great package I used it extensively back then for various statistical modeling tasks regression analysis time series forecasting that kind of thing And yeah those confidence intervals they are a crucial part of interpreting your model results They tell you the range within which your estimated parameters are likely to fall giving you an idea of the precision of your estimates

Now you're asking about `conf_int()` specifically I think you're missing the big picture slightly which is that `conf_int()` is a method *after* a regression model is fit you do a model fit first then do a conf int so I'll lay this down:

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import numpy as np

# Create some sample data for a simple regression
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100)
X = sm.add_constant(X) # Add a constant term for the intercept
y = 2 + 3 * X[:, 1] + np.random.randn(100) # y = 2 + 3x + some noise

# Fit the linear regression model
model = sm.OLS(y, X)
results = model.fit()

# Get the confidence intervals
conf_intervals = results.conf_int()
print("Confidence Intervals:\n", conf_intervals)
```

See that's the typical way you'd use it you have your model `sm.OLS` in this case you fit the model using `.fit()` and then you can call `results.conf_int()` that is the correct method and it is as simple as that this would show the range of the regression coefficients (intercept and slope in this case) within a certain probability (usually 95%) you can also specify it so we'll show an example of that

Now I think what you might be running into are a few common pitfalls with this:

First make sure you are fitting your model correctly and you're pulling up the results correctly not just doing the conf_int without a proper fit if you get a null result its probably that

Second the usual gotcha with `statsmodels` is that it needs the data set properly set up that's why i added the `sm.add_constant` in the example above so that you don't forget I made that mistake quite a few times where I had some weird results because I forgot the constant in my data structure you always got to remember that

Another thing that might be biting you is if you are doing multiple comparisons correction your p values will change so the confidence intervals will change too. You won't see that directly in the results of the `conf_int` but your `pvalues` may have changed. I had this once where the confidence intervals weren't matching what I was expecting I had to go back to the drawing board to understand what I had done wrong

Here's an example of using the `alpha` parameter to modify the confidence interval width:

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import numpy as np

# Sample data (same as before)
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100)
X = sm.add_constant(X)
y = 2 + 3 * X[:, 1] + np.random.randn(100)

# Fit the model (same as before)
model = sm.OLS(y, X)
results = model.fit()

# 99% confidence interval
conf_intervals_99 = results.conf_int(alpha=0.01)
print("99% Confidence Intervals:\n", conf_intervals_99)

# 90% confidence interval
conf_intervals_90 = results.conf_int(alpha=0.1)
print("90% Confidence Intervals:\n", conf_intervals_90)
```

See now you see that `alpha=0.01` shows a bigger width because the probability is 99% whereas `alpha=0.1` shows a smaller width because the probability is 90% this helps you change the confidence intervals to whatever probability you want but usually you want it 95% which is `alpha=0.05` if you don't specify it will just assume 95% which is good for us

Another thing to consider are the different types of models you use within statsmodels I used OLS here which is the typical case but it might not be what you are using. There are also things like Generalized linear models or robust linear models and even those will have methods to show confidence intervals but they are not always the same as `conf_int` you might be looking for a method inside the `results` class that will be the most specific method that will serve your purpose. You gotta dive deeper into the docs to see what else you can get done

Now I know you are in a bit of a bind with the question so I am gonna throw another example in here with a slightly more complicated model. Let's throw a GLM in the mix to be a bit more diverse:

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import numpy as np

# Sample data for a binomial model (e.g., logistic regression)
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100)
X = sm.add_constant(X)
y = np.random.binomial(1, 1 / (1 + np.exp(-2 - 3 * X[:, 1]))) # Simulate probabilities for binary outcomes

# Fit the logistic regression model
model = sm.GLM(y, X, family=sm.families.Binomial())
results = model.fit()

# Get confidence intervals for the parameters
conf_intervals = results.conf_int()
print("Confidence Intervals (Binomial GLM):\n", conf_intervals)

```

And there you go see that the overall principle is the same no matter the model fit the model get the `results` and then use the `conf_int()` method. Its a standard practice it is what you'll do 9 out of 10 times with statsmodels so it is good to know

Now I know that you're asking about Python 2.7 and all but the principles are the same here. However some of the more modern features within `statsmodels` might not have as extensive functionality as they would have in Python 3.x For example in Python 3 `statsmodels` works very well with pandas dataframes but in 2.7 you would have to handle that carefully because you are not guaranteed that the data structures will play nice so always be aware of those little gotchas that you will run into if you deal with older code

One thing I always struggled with back in the day when I was using these packages for my data analysis was the interpretation of these results Sometimes you'd get a very large confidence interval because your data is very noisy or a very small one if the model is very sure about the parameter value But the actual meaning of that interval it might be a little more nuanced so it's always worth doing a deep dive into the theory

Now for some resources outside the docs check out these books:

*   "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James Daniela Witten Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani - That book it's gold its a great way to get your statistical thinking up to par and get the big picture about what you are doing when you are doing a regression and getting the confidence intervals of your parameters that's a good place to start
*   "Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized Linear Models" by John Fox - this one will get your hands dirty with some GLMs that book is awesome it has a lot of technical detail about linear models and you need that if you want to get a real sense of the confidence intervals
*   "Time Series Analysis" by James D Hamilton - I think you'll need that too if you are doing time series analysis with statsmodels if you are not doing it then it is not as essential but its still cool

And now that I’m thinking about it I've got one joke for you Why don’t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! Sorry I had to drop a little humor there because that's what the `p_values` would want us to do

Anyways back to the statsmodels stuff don't overthink it confidence intervals is just a tool if you understand the underlying concepts and the code behind it it will serve you well always make sure you are doing it correctly and remember that the output of the regression model is what you actually care about the confidence interval is just the cherry on top so keep it up and remember to always fit your models and that there is always a confidence interval around that result!
