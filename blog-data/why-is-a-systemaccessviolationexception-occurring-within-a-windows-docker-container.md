Okay, let's tackle this. From my experience, a `System.AccessViolationException` within a Windows Docker container, while seemingly straightforward in its description, can stem from a rather intricate web of underlying issues. It's not a common "user error" kind of problem; it usually points to something more fundamental in how resources are being accessed. I recall vividly a project a few years back where we were containerizing a legacy .net application. We encountered this precise exception repeatedly, and it took some detailed investigation to pin down the root causes.

First, it's crucial to understand that `System.AccessViolationException`, at its core, signifies that your application attempted to read from or write to memory that it didn’t have the right permissions to access. This often points toward native code interactions within the container where things can go sideways fairly easily. Unlike a pure managed .net exception, this one is generally triggered at the operating system level, after a request from our code, and the runtime doesn't always give us a detailed stack trace, so debugging becomes a bit of an exercise in deduction.

One very prevalent scenario I've observed is related to interactions with native libraries. For instance, let's say our application relies on a specific version of a C++ library via P/Invoke (Platform Invoke). We compile our .net code targeting a particular version, but then, inside the container, we might end up with a different version of this library – possibly due to differences in the base image, or because the container was built on a different machine or with different local configurations. In this case, the memory layout expected by our .net code may not align with the reality provided by the actual native library loaded into the container’s address space. It's like trying to use a key that is a slightly different shape than the lock. The application tries to perform a write at address x, but due to the mismatch in structures, it writes at address y, which it does not own. Thus the access violation.

Here's a simplified, illustrative code snippet that could lead to this kind of problem. It simulates a simplified interaction via P/Invoke.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class NativeWrapper
{
    [DllImport("MyNativeLibrary.dll", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    public static extern int NativeFunction(IntPtr buffer, int size);

    public static void PerformNativeOperation()
    {
        int dataSize = 10;
        IntPtr unmanagedBuffer = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(dataSize);
        try
        {
           int result = NativeFunction(unmanagedBuffer, dataSize); // This is the potential problem zone
           Console.WriteLine($"Native Function result: {result}");
        }
        finally
        {
            Marshal.FreeHGlobal(unmanagedBuffer);
        }
    }
}


public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      try
       {
        NativeWrapper.PerformNativeOperation();
        }
       catch (AccessViolationException ex)
       {
        Console.WriteLine($"Caught an AccessViolationException: {ex.Message}");
       }
    }

}
```
If `MyNativeLibrary.dll` in the container is not the one expected, an access violation will most likely occur when the `NativeFunction` attempts to manipulate the buffer, especially if the layout of the arguments or return values are different.

Another, less obvious, scenario involves shared memory. Windows containers support shared memory regions for inter-process communication (ipc). However, If multiple processes within your container (or worse, if there are external processes also interacting with the same shared memory location), there can be a corruption issue, especially if proper locking mechanisms are not in place. Let's imagine a scenario where different parts of your application are attempting to update shared memory concurrently. Here's a conceptual representation of the issue:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
public class SharedMemoryManager
{
    private static IntPtr _sharedMemory;
    private static int _dataSize = 1024;

    public static void InitializeSharedMemory()
    {
       _sharedMemory = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(_dataSize);
    }

     public static void WriteToMemory(int value)
    {
        // Simulate a race condition where multiple threads try to write without proper locking
        unsafe{
          int* ptr = (int*)_sharedMemory;
            *ptr=value;
        }

       }
    public static void ReadFromMemory()
    {
      unsafe{
         int* ptr = (int*)_sharedMemory;
           Console.WriteLine($"Read: {*ptr}");
        }
    }

    public static void ReleaseSharedMemory()
    {
        Marshal.FreeHGlobal(_sharedMemory);
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        SharedMemoryManager.InitializeSharedMemory();

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(()=> {
          try{
             SharedMemoryManager.WriteToMemory(1);
          }
          catch(AccessViolationException ex)
          {
              Console.WriteLine($"Thread 1 Caught an AccessViolationException {ex.Message}");
           }

         });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(()=> {
            try{
                SharedMemoryManager.WriteToMemory(2);

            }
            catch(AccessViolationException ex)
            {
               Console.WriteLine($"Thread 2 Caught an AccessViolationException {ex.Message}");

            }
         });

        thread1.Start();
        thread2.Start();
        thread1.Join();
        thread2.Join();


        try {
            SharedMemoryManager.ReadFromMemory();
        }
        catch(AccessViolationException ex) {
            Console.WriteLine($"Read: Caught an AccessViolationException: {ex.Message}");
        }

        SharedMemoryManager.ReleaseSharedMemory();

    }
}
```

If the shared memory region is being updated concurrently without proper synchronization, then this might result in memory corruption, and could manifest as `AccessViolationException` upon reading or further write attempts. Windows has mechanisms for shared memory, but you still need to manage synchronization yourself.

Finally, memory leaks or other forms of memory corruption that accumulate over time may, in some cases, manifest as an access violation when memory eventually gets so messed up that operations go beyond the allocated memory. For example, if a native library or your managed code keeps leaking memory, then you will eventually experience an access violation when a pointer or buffer attempts to write to a memory area that is now "off-limits", or does not belong to your process. Here is one such example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
public class MemoryLeakSimulator
{
    public static void LeakMemory()
    {
          for(int i =0; i < 1000; i++){
              IntPtr ptr = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(1000);
             // Not calling Marshal.FreeHGlobal here
          }
    }
}


public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            MemoryLeakSimulator.LeakMemory();
            // Simulate attempting to use memory after leaking it
            IntPtr somePtr = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(100);
            unsafe{
                 int* intPtr = (int*) somePtr;
                 *intPtr = 100; // May crash if memory is too compromised
                }
             Marshal.FreeHGlobal(somePtr);

        }
        catch(AccessViolationException ex) {
            Console.WriteLine($"Caught an AccessViolationException: {ex.Message}");
        }

    }
}
```

In this case, a rapid sequence of `AllocHGlobal` operations without corresponding `FreeHGlobal` operations can rapidly consume memory, possibly leading to crashes that could involve AccessViolations, especially when subsequent memory operations attempt to read or write into regions no longer available.

To effectively debug such scenarios, I suggest digging deeper into native debugging tools (e.g., WinDbg), and familiarizing yourself with tools like `Process Monitor` and `Sysmon` to track system calls. Look into the resources like "Windows Internals" by Mark Russinovich, David Solomon, and Alex Ionescu for understanding how Windows handles memory management and native interactions, or for a good overview of debugging, I always return to "Debugging Microsoft .Net 2.0 Applications" by John Robbins. Also, studying the documentation related to P/Invoke can provide insight about proper usage and memory management.

Ultimately, `System.AccessViolationException` inside a Docker container, though unsettling, is not impossible to resolve. It requires a methodical approach, focusing on the layers where native code and the underlying os intersect with your application, and a clear understanding of the container environment. These examples provide a solid starting point to begin your investigation. Remember, it is about tracking down the exact place where memory is being accessed incorrectly and understanding *why* it has occurred.
