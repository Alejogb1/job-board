Let's dissect the often-confusing output shapes when working with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and custom layers. It’s a topic I've certainly had my share of debugging sessions with, particularly back when I was optimizing a sequence-to-sequence model for time-series forecasting a few years ago. The intricacies of temporal data were not always forgiving, and getting these shapes correct is absolutely fundamental for building a functional, performant network.

Essentially, the output shape of a custom layer *following* an RNN layer depends significantly on the RNN's configuration and the design of your custom layer. It's not a single answer; it's a combination of understanding how RNNs process sequences and how your custom layer then transforms that output.

First, let’s clarify what RNNs typically produce. A standard RNN layer (like a `SimpleRNN`, `LSTM`, or `GRU` in Keras or TensorFlow) outputs a tensor that, at a minimum, has two dimensions: batch size and sequence length. The third dimension, often called the hidden size or the number of units, represents the features extracted at each timestep. However, this isn't the entire story. You can configure the RNN layer to return the *entire sequence* of hidden states or only the *last hidden state* for each sequence in the batch.

The key difference revolves around two parameters frequently found in RNN implementations: `return_sequences` and `return_state`. If `return_sequences=True`, the RNN will output the hidden state at *every* time step. This leads to an output tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`. If `return_sequences=False` (which is the default in many implementations), the RNN will output only the final hidden state of the sequence, which has a shape of `(batch_size, hidden_size)`. The `return_state` parameter, on the other hand, is more relevant when you require the internal states of the RNN (e.g., the cell state in an LSTM). This doesn't directly impact the *output shape* but can influence how you construct your custom layer if you need access to these states.

Now, let's consider your custom layer. Its input shape is directly determined by the RNN's output. Thus, if the RNN outputs `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, your custom layer must accept tensors of this shape as input. Conversely, if the RNN outputs `(batch_size, hidden_size)`, your custom layer input shape must reflect that. The output shape of the custom layer is entirely up to its design. You could construct a simple linear transformation that preserves the shape, reduce dimensions through pooling, expand the dimensions using an embedding, or even introduce reshaping operations.

To solidify this with examples, let's examine a few common custom layer scenarios after an RNN. These snippets use Keras with TensorFlow backend, a common environment for such work.

**Example 1: Preserving sequence length with a dense layer**

In this first example, imagine a situation where we need to apply a fully connected layer at *each* time step of the RNN's output. We keep `return_sequences=True` so the output is the sequence itself, and then we wrap the dense layer with `TimeDistributed`. The goal is to transform the features at each time step while retaining the sequence length.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, SimpleRNN, TimeDistributed, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

input_shape = (10, 20) # Sequence length of 10, 20 input features
hidden_size = 32
output_dim = 16

inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
rnn_out = SimpleRNN(hidden_size, return_sequences=True)(inputs)
dense_out = TimeDistributed(Dense(output_dim))(rnn_out) #Applying Dense per sequence timestep.

model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=dense_out)

model.summary()

#Testing the output shape with dummy data
import numpy as np
dummy_data = np.random.rand(2,10,20) # Batch size 2
output = model(dummy_data)
print(f"The output shape after the TimeDistributed Dense layer is: {output.shape}")
```

In this case, the output shape will be `(batch_size, sequence_length, output_dim)`. Critically, observe the application of `TimeDistributed(Dense(...))`. `TimeDistributed` ensures that the same `Dense` layer is applied to *each* time step of the sequence separately. The model's summary output confirms that `(None, 10, 16)` is its output. The first element, `None`, refers to the batch size, which is not fixed. It should be clear that the RNN outputs `(None, 10, 32)`, and the `TimeDistributed` layer takes the shape `(None, 10, 32)` and produces `(None, 10, 16)`, therefore keeping the sequence length intact.

**Example 2: Using a custom layer for reduction**

Let’s suppose instead of preserving sequence length, we want a custom layer that averages over the time dimension. It will receive the sequence from `return_sequences=True` but output a single vector per sequence instead of a sequence of vectors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, SimpleRNN
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class TimeAverageLayer(layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.reduce_mean(inputs, axis=1) #Reduce by averaging over the second axis

input_shape = (10, 20)
hidden_size = 32

inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
rnn_out = SimpleRNN(hidden_size, return_sequences=True)(inputs)
average_out = TimeAverageLayer()(rnn_out)

model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=average_out)

model.summary()

#Testing the output shape with dummy data
import numpy as np
dummy_data = np.random.rand(2,10,20) # Batch size 2
output = model(dummy_data)
print(f"The output shape after the TimeAverageLayer is: {output.shape}")
```

Here, we've created a custom layer `TimeAverageLayer`. This layer takes the full sequence of hidden states, calculates the mean along the sequence (axis 1), and effectively reduces the sequence to a single vector. The output shape is therefore `(batch_size, hidden_size)` because the time dimension has been averaged out. This is also confirmed in the model summary. The output after averaging is `(None, 32)`.

**Example 3: Using only the last state with a custom layer**

In this final example, the RNN layer uses `return_sequences=False` so it provides the last hidden state. Here, we don't need `TimeDistributed` or a custom averaging layer because the output is the final hidden state only. Let’s then add a simple `Dense` layer.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, SimpleRNN, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model


input_shape = (10, 20)
hidden_size = 32
output_dim = 16

inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
rnn_out = SimpleRNN(hidden_size, return_sequences=False)(inputs)
dense_out = Dense(output_dim)(rnn_out)

model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=dense_out)

model.summary()

#Testing the output shape with dummy data
import numpy as np
dummy_data = np.random.rand(2,10,20) # Batch size 2
output = model(dummy_data)
print(f"The output shape after the Dense layer is: {output.shape}")
```

Here, the RNN outputs `(batch_size, hidden_size)`, and the dense layer operates on this shape. The dense layer transforms the feature vector from `hidden_size` to `output_dim`, resulting in the output shape `(batch_size, output_dim)`, confirmed in the model summary and by printing the shape during inference, as well. We get `(None, 16)`.

In each of these examples, the key is to understand the output shape from the RNN layer and then to make the custom layer's input compatible with this shape and output a shape as desired. This also shows that the custom layer's role is to transform the RNN's output to whatever form is necessary for a specific task.

For more in-depth understanding of RNNs, I’d strongly recommend reading *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Their treatment of recurrent networks is both comprehensive and mathematically rigorous. Similarly, for those working with TensorFlow/Keras, the official TensorFlow documentation is invaluable, particularly the section on the Keras API and custom layer development. Furthermore, research papers on specific RNN variants (LSTMs and GRUs, specifically) provide further detail and insight, including the original papers by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber on LSTMs, and by Cho et al. on GRUs. Finally, for those wanting to delve into the mathematical aspect of sequence models, I encourage review of the theoretical literature on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) which provides a more probabilistic framework of sequence processing.

This, I hope, provides a clearer picture of output shapes from RNNs and their interaction with custom layers. It all boils down to meticulously tracking dimensions, understanding the role of `return_sequences`, and tailoring your custom layer accordingly. It's a process honed over many similar problems.
