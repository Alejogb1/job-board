ah, the ol' "postCreateCommand noise" issue in vscode dev containers, i've been there, seen that, got the t-shirt and probably a few broken keyboards along the way. it's one of those things that can be mildly annoying at first, and then escalate into a major distraction as you try to get your development environment up and running smoothly.

so, the core problem, as i understand it, is that your `postCreateCommand` in your `devcontainer.json` is spitting out notices or messages you'd rather not see. these aren't errors, mind you, just informational outputs or warnings that are filling up the terminal and making it difficult to see what's actually happening during container creation. these notices might be from a specific tool you are using or they are more general.

i remember once, way back when i was setting up a complex python environment, the postCreateCommand decided that it needed to inform me about each and every pip package it was installing. i'm talking hundreds of lines of "installing package_x", "fetching metadata of package_y", "building wheel of package_z", the whole nine yards. by the time it was done, i had to scroll for what felt like an eternity just to see if the container had actually started up correctly. after that, I told myself: "no more!".

the standard, out-of-the-box vscode dev containers don't offer a direct, simple, "suppress all notices" button. it's more of a crafting solution using the tools at hand. what I've found works best is to redirect the output of the commands you're running within `postCreateCommand`. think of it like putting a muzzle on the stdout and stderr streams.

we can achieve this in a few ways, depending on what you are trying to achieve and what is generating the output. a basic approach is to redirect both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to `/dev/null`. this will effectively silence the command completely, useful if you don’t care about any of the output.

here's how that looks:

```json
{
    "postCreateCommand": "your_command > /dev/null 2>&1"
}
```

in this snippet, `your_command` is the command you're currently running in your `postCreateCommand`. the `> /dev/null` part redirects stdout to the "null device," basically the void. the `2>&1` redirects stderr to the same place. therefore, no output will make it to the terminal, which is the easiest way to mute your process, good to keep it in mind.

but, what if you only want to silence *some* of the output, perhaps just the informational stuff and keep the actual errors? that requires a bit more finesse. we can leverage command-line tools to filter the output before sending it to the void. `grep` is your friend here.

let's imagine your post create command involves a process that produces output like this:

`info: downloading file A`
`warning: file B is deprecated`
`error: connection refused to server C`
`info: installing extension D`

if you only want the errors, you could do something like this:

```json
{
    "postCreateCommand": "your_command 2>&1 | grep -i error"
}
```

in this modified example, we're first redirecting stderr to stdout with `2>&1`. then we use a pipe `|` to send that combined output to `grep -i error`, where we search the combined stream for lines containing the word “error” (case-insensitive, thanks to `-i`). only matching lines will be outputted. anything else will be discarded.

now, for a more advanced approach, consider the use case where your postCreateCommand might need to have a sequence of commands. if so, piping and redirection can become difficult to handle and error-prone. if you want to filter some commands and suppress others, the best approach is to turn your sequence into a bash script and leverage control over each specific command.

here's an example:

let's say you have this in your `postCreateCommand` and want to silence only the first command:

```json
{
  "postCreateCommand": "command_one; command_two; command_three"
}
```

you can create a bash file called something like `setup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
command_one > /dev/null 2>&1
command_two
command_three
```

then your `devcontainer.json` would look like:

```json
{
    "postCreateCommand": "/path/to/your/setup.sh"
}
```

where `/path/to/your/setup.sh` is the location inside the container of your setup script. in this script, `command_one` is silenced completely while `command_two` and `command_three` execute as normal. you can further filter or suppress each one individually as needed in your script file, which gives you the maximum control.

remember to ensure your script has execute permissions inside the container. that could be yet another source of mysterious issues later. it should have if your os follows conventional defaults.

a personal anecdote: during one particularly frustrating project, i was setting up a clojure environment, and leiningen (clojure's build tool) was extremely verbose during its initial setup. the amount of output was ridiculous, a constant barrage of messages about downloading dependencies and configuring the project. at first i just thought it was normal, but it just didn't felt right. this was before i really understood the redirection mechanism on bash, and i remember manually sifting through the logs each time the container would rebuild. let’s just say i wasted more time than i’m proud of. when i finally figured this out and silenced the noise, i felt like i had finally conquered the beast. at some point I even thought of turning the container creation into a full-fledged rpg. i never did that, though.

for further reading on these techniques, i recommend checking out "advanced bash scripting guide" by micheal stutz, this is a comprehensive resource for mastering the shell. it goes deep into input/output redirection and all sorts of scripting techniques. it's a bit more than you probably need for this specific problem, but the knowledge is valuable for all sorts of other related tasks. also "the linux command line" by william shotts is a classic and excellent resource for anyone wanting to have more deep grasp of command line tools.

the key is to understand how to direct the standard output and standard error streams of your command. remember that redirecting everything to `/dev/null` will, well, make it completely silent. you could filter the output with tools like `grep`, or do something more sophisticated like using an intermediate bash script. in general, remember that less noise often equals more productivity, so don’t hesitate to silence the messages that don't matter to you.
