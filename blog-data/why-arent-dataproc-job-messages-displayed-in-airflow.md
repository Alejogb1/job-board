Alright, let's tackle this one. I've definitely been in the trenches with Dataproc and Airflow integration before, and the job message display issue is a common stumbling block. It’s frustrating, especially when you're relying on those messages for debugging and monitoring. Let me break down why this occurs and how to address it, drawing from past projects where I've encountered this exact scenario.

The fundamental issue lies in how Dataproc job execution and Airflow's operator interactions are structured. Dataproc jobs, fundamentally, are managed externally to Airflow. When you submit a job using Airflow's `DataprocSubmitJobOperator`, Airflow triggers the job creation process on the Google Cloud side, then essentially goes into a monitoring loop. It’s not actively capturing the streaming output of the job *during* its execution. Instead, Airflow polls the Dataproc api for the job's status and final logs after the job completes or fails. Job messages, which we typically see in the Dataproc web console or using the gcloud sdk, are often part of the job's *runtime* output. This isn't directly piped back to Airflow by default. Airflow primarily cares about the final state: success or failure and logs.

There are a few contributing factors to consider. First, Dataproc uses a different logging mechanism than many of the standard operators that you might be familiar with in Airflow. It uses the google cloud logging service, which is accessible through the web console, or using the client libraries. When the Dataproc cluster executes jobs, it does not pipe them back into the Airflow worker stdout. Secondly, Airflow’s Dataproc operator doesn’t have the mechanism to actively capture output while a job is running. It's designed for batch processing, not for actively monitoring streaming outputs of tasks during execution. Finally, the job submission and monitoring API used by Airflow primarily focuses on the final state and aggregated logs.

So how do you tackle this? Here are three methods I’ve used, each with its advantages and trade-offs:

**1. Leveraging Google Cloud Logging and Custom Logging Handlers**

The most direct way to access job messages is through Google Cloud Logging. Your Dataproc jobs typically log information to a specific logging stream, and we can tap into this. We can create a custom logging handler in your airflow DAG to extract and display those logs. This usually is a good solution for a wide range of scenarios, however there is additional code required to be written. This method involves using the google cloud client libraries to query the logging api, and then formatting and displaying that within your airflow DAG.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from google.cloud import logging
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def fetch_dataproc_logs(execution_date, dataproc_job_id):
    client = logging.Client()
    logger = client.logger("dataproc.googleapis.com/job_messages")
    
    # Adjust the filter based on your requirements, likely including the job id
    filter_str = f'resource.labels.job_id="{dataproc_job_id}" AND timestamp >= "{execution_date.isoformat()}Z"'

    entries = logger.list_entries(filter_=filter_str, order_by="timestamp asc")

    for entry in entries:
        print(f"[{entry.timestamp}] {entry.log_name}: {entry.payload}")


with DAG(
    dag_id="dataproc_log_extraction",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
    default_args={'retries': 1, 'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5)},
) as dag:
    extract_logs = PythonOperator(
        task_id="extract_dataproc_logs",
        python_callable=fetch_dataproc_logs,
        op_kwargs={'execution_date': '{{ execution_date }}', 'dataproc_job_id': '{{ ti.xcom_pull(task_ids="submit_job", key="job_id") }}'}

    )


```

Here, we’re using the `google-cloud-logging` library to pull log entries associated with the Dataproc job. The `filter_str` is crucial; it should be adapted based on how your job messages are being logged. The job id is pulled from the xcom of the DataprocSubmitJobOperator task. This code assumes you have configured google cloud authentication, either with application default credentials or by other methods. The log entries from cloud logging are parsed and then printed out for the task. It can then be viewed in the logs of the Airflow task.

**2. Utilizing Custom Spark/Hadoop Logging and Cloud Storage**

If the job messages aren't naturally logging to Cloud Logging, or you want greater control, you can configure your Spark or Hadoop jobs to write messages to a file in cloud storage (GCS). After job completion, you can pull that file from cloud storage using the airflow operators.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gcs_to_gcs import GCSToGCSOperator
from google.cloud import storage
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import os

def fetch_gcs_file_content(bucket_name, file_name, task_instance):
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
    blob = bucket.blob(file_name)

    if blob.exists():
        log_data = blob.download_as_text()
        print(log_data) # Print the data within the Airflow task logs
    else:
       print(f"Blob {file_name} does not exist in bucket {bucket_name}")

with DAG(
    dag_id="dataproc_gcs_log_extraction",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
    default_args={'retries': 1, 'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5)},
) as dag:

    pull_from_gcs = PythonOperator(
        task_id="fetch_gcs_logs",
        python_callable=fetch_gcs_file_content,
        op_kwargs={'bucket_name': 'your-log-bucket', 'file_name': '{{ ti.xcom_pull(task_ids="submit_job", key="job_id") }}.log', "task_instance": "{{ task_instance }}"}
    )


```

In this example, we're using the python operator and a google cloud storage client to pull logs from a file specified in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. You would need to configure your Dataproc job (via your code, config files or startup scripts) to write its logging output to a unique GCS file. The job id pulled from xcom is also being used to create a unique log file name.

**3. Leveraging Dataproc’s Built-in Spark/Hadoop Logging and Airflow's Logging**

Finally, sometimes the simplest solution is to leverage Dataproc’s standard logging mechanism. If your Spark or Hadoop application is already logging to stdout or stderr, you can capture those messages by setting up appropriate cluster logging configuration within your dataproc cluster and then pulling those from the cluster logging in the standard airflow logs, after the job has completed. The benefit here is less complex code, but it does rely on your Dataproc jobs having the appropriate logging configured.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.dataproc import DataprocSubmitJobOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

with DAG(
    dag_id="dataproc_job_logging",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
    default_args={'retries': 1, 'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5)},
) as dag:
    submit_spark_job = DataprocSubmitJobOperator(
        task_id="submit_job",
        region="us-central1",
        project_id="your-gcp-project",
        job={
            "placement": {"cluster_name": "your-dataproc-cluster"},
            "spark_job": {
                "main_class": "org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi",
                 "jar_file_uris": [
                    "file:///usr/lib/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples.jar"
                  ]
            },
        },
    )
```

In this case, the DataprocSubmitJobOperator pulls the logs of the job execution and outputs the logs to airflow. This example is very basic, and will output any standard out/error from your spark job. As mentioned before, this is a low code solution, but may not capture the level of detail you need for all use-cases.

**Further Reading & Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of Google Cloud logging, I’d recommend reviewing the official Google Cloud documentation on Cloud Logging. In addition, familiarize yourself with the Google Cloud client libraries for Python, particularly `google-cloud-logging` and `google-cloud-storage`. "Hadoop: The Definitive Guide" by Tom White is excellent for understanding hadoop logging configurations. Also the "Programming in Scala" by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon and Bill Venners can be useful in understanding Spark and Logging configurations. Finally, be sure to take a look at the official Apache Airflow documentation regarding the Dataproc operators for up to date information on how they work.

In closing, while Airflow doesn’t directly present Dataproc job messages by default, there are multiple ways to surface this vital information. The key is understanding the underlying mechanisms and choosing the right approach for your specific needs. Each of the methods above has its place, and by applying these you will have more visibility in your Dataproc jobs running via Airflow.
