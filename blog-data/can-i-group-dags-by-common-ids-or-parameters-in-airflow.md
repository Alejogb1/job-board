Okay, let's tackle this. I've been around the block with Airflow, seen quite a few production deployments, and grouping DAGs is a problem that often crops up, especially as your infrastructure grows. It's a crucial organizational challenge, honestly, and doing it *well* makes a big difference in maintainability and ease of management. The short answer is: yes, you can absolutely group DAGs by common identifiers or parameters, although Airflow doesn’t offer a native, built-in grouping mechanism *per se* like, say, tagging. What we achieve is grouping through patterns in the dag definition, or external parameterization and filtering. Let me explain.

First, a common scenario. I once had a client who processed data for several different geographical regions, each having a fairly similar processing flow, but different input and output locations. Imagine hundreds of dags, all with similar logic but differing by a single 'region' parameter. This was obviously a maintenance nightmare. It’s situations like these that make a good grouping strategy vital.

So, let's break down how you can accomplish this grouping, along with some code examples illustrating different approaches I've used in the past.

**1. Leveraging DAG IDs and Naming Conventions:**

The most straightforward method hinges on the DAG’s `dag_id`. You can design a naming convention that incorporates the grouping parameter. For example, if your parameter is ‘region’, you could name your DAGs like `process_data_region_us`, `process_data_region_eu`, etc. This isn’t true grouping in the visual sense, but a method to identify and filter.

Here is a basic example to show this:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

regions = ['us', 'eu', 'asia']

def process_data(region):
    print(f"Processing data for region: {region}")

for region in regions:
    with DAG(
        dag_id=f"process_data_region_{region}",
        start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
        schedule_interval=None,
        catchup=False
    ) as dag:
        process_task = PythonOperator(
            task_id=f"process_data_task_{region}",
            python_callable=process_data,
            op_kwargs={"region": region}
        )
```

In this snippet, each DAG is constructed with a unique identifier that embeds the ‘region’ parameter. In the Airflow UI, you could then use filters to display DAGs related to a specific region by searching for "process_data_region_us" for example, providing a clear, if manual, grouping. The task ids, are also defined in this manner for easy identification.

While easy to implement, this method relies on convention and requires careful construction of the dag ids. It's better for smaller sets of parameters.

**2. Utilizing Dynamic DAG Generation (with a Template):**

A more powerful method involves generating DAGs dynamically based on a configuration or metadata. This shifts the grouping mechanism from naming convention to a more structured approach using configuration files, databases, or even environment variables. You define a generic DAG template and populate it with parameters. This results in separate DAG definitions but offers robust parameterisation and flexibility. This is especially helpful when dealing with varying numbers of "groups", parameters or other configurations.

For example, let's say you have a `regions.json` file with data:

```json
{
  "regions": [
    {"id": "us", "input_path": "/data/us", "output_path": "/output/us"},
    {"id": "eu", "input_path": "/data/eu", "output_path": "/output/eu"},
    {"id": "asia", "input_path": "/data/asia", "output_path": "/output/asia"}
  ]
}
```

Then, you can write a script like this:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime
import json

with open('regions.json', 'r') as f:
  regions_data = json.load(f)

def create_dag(region_data):
    with DAG(
      dag_id=f"process_data_{region_data['id']}",
      start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
      schedule_interval=None,
      catchup=False
    ) as dag:
      process_task = BashOperator(
        task_id=f"process_task_{region_data['id']}",
          bash_command=f"echo 'Processing data for {region_data['id']} from {region_data['input_path']} to {region_data['output_path']}'"
      )
      return dag

for region_data in regions_data['regions']:
    dag_instance = create_dag(region_data)
    globals()[dag_instance.dag_id] = dag_instance
```

Here, we iterate through the `regions.json`, create a DAG instance for each using a function and dynamically assign this to the global scope making it available to airflow. Each DAG has its unique `dag_id`, still reflecting the region id, but it’s generated from data. This pattern promotes code reuse, easier scalability and is much less susceptible to mistakes, compared to the first method.

**3. Using TaskGroups and SubDAGs:**

While not strictly "grouping DAGs", TaskGroups or SubDAGs are a way to group related tasks within a single DAG, which provides visual structuring in the Airflow UI. I've found that using them in conjunction with the above methods often produces the clearest result. For instance, if our processing steps are in sequence per region, we can embed a `TaskGroup` for each region within a broader DAG. While this groups tasks *within* a dag, not dags themselves, it adds structure, in addition to the dag id grouping mentioned above. It can be a viable option, especially if the various processes are very dependent and have to be contained in a single execution environment.

Consider this code, using the example from our first method, but now incorporating task groups:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.utils.task_group import TaskGroup
from datetime import datetime

regions = ['us', 'eu', 'asia']

def process_data(region):
    print(f"Processing data for region: {region}")


with DAG(
        dag_id=f"process_data_global",
        start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
        schedule_interval=None,
        catchup=False
    ) as dag:

    for region in regions:
        with TaskGroup(group_id=f'region_{region}') as region_group:
            process_task = PythonOperator(
                task_id=f"process_data_task_{region}",
                python_callable=process_data,
                op_kwargs={"region": region}
                )
```

Here the main dag, `process_data_global` contains `TaskGroup` objects, grouped by region. As you can see, these techniques can often be combined and used together for optimal effect. I've used this approach, for example, to handle tasks such as data quality checks that run alongside processing workflows, where different regions can have different quality check criteria, but must be performed within a single workflow.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further reading and a deeper understanding of Airflow, I highly recommend the following:

1.  **"Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow"** by Bas P. Harenslak and Julian Rutger. This book offers a thorough guide to Airflow’s architecture and best practices for building robust data pipelines. It's exceptionally practical and will fill in the gaps on many aspects of airflow, including dynamic DAG generation.
2.  The official **Apache Airflow Documentation:** The most current and authoritative resource. Pay particular attention to sections on “Writing DAGs” and “Dynamic Task Mapping”.
3.  **"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"** by Martin Kleppmann, while not strictly about Airflow, will deepen your understanding of the principles behind distributed data processing, which will, in turn, help you make better decisions when designing your workflows in Airflow.

**In Conclusion:**

Grouping DAGs effectively in Airflow involves using a combination of techniques, mostly focused on intelligent naming conventions and dynamic DAG generation. TaskGroups can enhance visual organization. While Airflow doesn’t provide native explicit grouping, these approaches provide practical means to maintain organized, scalable and manageable workflows. The best solution will depend on the complexity and specific requirements of your system. I’ve often found that a combination of parameterisation and dynamic dag generation, along with good task group usage gives the greatest degree of flexibility and manageability in real world scenarios. It's about crafting the right level of abstraction for your situation, making your workflows easier to understand, maintain, and scale. Choose the method that best suits your needs and adapt it to your circumstances. Don't be afraid to combine and adjust these strategies.
