Let’s delve into this; allocating specific GPUs to distinct tasks within a single script is more nuanced than simply specifying cuda device ids. It requires a good understanding of how different libraries interact with the available hardware and a considered approach to managing processes. I've tackled this many times over the years, particularly when training large machine learning models where parallelism across multiple GPUs is critical, and believe me, it's a source of frustration if not approached methodically.

The fundamental challenge arises from the inherent process-based nature of operating systems. When you launch a python script, it runs as a single process. By default, libraries like pytorch or tensorflow often grab all available GPUs if not explicitly constrained. What we need to do is either force the individual libraries to only use a certain device or effectively isolate portions of the script into separate processes, each with a specified GPU.

Before even touching code, it’s worth noting that the behavior and capabilities can vary depending on the specific driver version, underlying hardware, and library implementations. Always ensure that your environments are consistent and that your driver software is up-to-date. This step alone will save you from many troubleshooting headaches, trust me.

There are a few robust ways to achieve what you’re after, and I’ve found that each has its sweet spot. I will focus on the approaches that avoid creating entirely independent scripts and instead isolate tasks within the confines of a single file.

**First Method: Explicit Device Specification within the Framework**

This is the most straightforward approach, primarily suitable when you're working with tasks that are relatively independent and can be explicitly coded to reside on particular devices. Libraries like pytorch and tensorflow offer mechanisms to enforce which GPU a given tensor or computation will use. However, this strategy can quickly become unwieldy for highly complex tasks, and can lead to less efficient resource utilization as it depends on the libraries' ability to manage the scheduling.

Let's look at a simple pytorch example:

```python
import torch

# Assuming you have at least two GPUs available, indexed as 0 and 1
device0 = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
device1 = torch.device("cuda:1" if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1 else "cpu")

def task_gpu0():
    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device0) # Operations on GPU 0
    result = torch.matmul(x, x.transpose(0, 1))
    print(f"Task GPU 0 Result on device: {result.device}")

def task_gpu1():
    y = torch.randn(2000, 2000, device=device1) # Operations on GPU 1
    result = torch.matmul(y, y.transpose(0, 1))
    print(f"Task GPU 1 Result on device: {result.device}")


task_gpu0()
task_gpu1()
```

In this snippet, we define two `torch.device` objects, one for `cuda:0` and the other for `cuda:1` (or the CPU if either or both are not available). We then force all operations within `task_gpu0` to happen on `device0` and within `task_gpu1` on `device1`. If you run this script and have two compatible GPUs, you will see outputs indicating that computations happened on the respective devices. If `cuda:1` is unavailable, the computations will happen on the cpu. This method keeps everything within a single process.

**Second Method: Multiprocessing with Explicit Device Assignment via Environment Variables**

The next approach revolves around python's `multiprocessing` library. Here we spawn separate processes and within each process, specify which gpu should be targeted through an environment variable. This approach is more robust as each process is independently scheduled by the operating system, and doesn’t rely on the library's internal device management as much.

Here's how that looks using the same basic operations:

```python
import torch
import multiprocessing
import os


def task_process(gpu_id):
    os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = str(gpu_id)
    device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
    result = torch.matmul(x, x.transpose(0, 1))
    print(f"Process Task on GPU {gpu_id}: result on device {result.device}")


if __name__ == '__main__': # Necessary for multiprocessing on some platforms.
    processes = []
    for gpu_id in [0, 1]:  # Assuming you have two gpus
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=task_process, args=(gpu_id,))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()

    for p in processes:
       p.join()
```

In this code, each process gets its own copy of the python environment. Before torch operations are even initiated, we use `os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES']` to set the environment variable that controls which gpus are accessible to the current process. This ensures that within each process, only the assigned gpu will be seen. On Linux, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` sets the visible devices, and thus torch will think it only has that device even if others are available. On Windows, this method usually works similarly, but depending on the driver version, can be more unpredictable. Again, check your drivers. `if __name__ == '__main__':` is necessary in this instance to make it cross-platform compatible for multiprocessing.

**Third Method: Using the `torch.distributed` package.**

For more complex, multi-node, multi-gpu setups and when there’s a need to share data across different processes or gpus, the `torch.distributed` package in Pytorch offers a very powerful way to manage such workloads. It's more involved to set up initially, but it provides a lot of control and optimization opportunities once understood. This is not merely about assigning GPUs but about distributing the computation.

Here's a simplified example to demonstrate assigning specific tasks to specific gpus. Note that in practice, more complex initialization is needed, and you will need to run multiple processes with specified ranks, which this example abstracts away, assuming that the environment is setup in a way where each process will only see a single device:

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist
import os

def distributed_task(rank):
     os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = str(rank)
     dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'gloo',
                            init_method='env://',
                            world_size=2, rank=rank)

     device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

     x = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
     result = torch.matmul(x, x.transpose(0, 1))
     print(f"Rank {rank} Result device {result.device}")

     dist.destroy_process_group()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # In reality you'd initialize your processes using something like
    # torch.multiprocessing.spawn, using a specific init method
    processes = []
    for rank in [0, 1]:
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=distributed_task, args=(rank,))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()

    for p in processes:
      p.join()
```

In the distributed scenario, we are also using environment variables similar to the second example but with an additional initialization step for the distributed environment, using `dist.init_process_group`. The `backend` determines how communication occurs across gpus and potentially across network nodes. `nccl` is typically the fastest for gpus, while `gloo` can work across cpus. This example shows device assignment through `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` similar to the previous one and assumes it's being launched with two processes where the rank will match the gpu id.

**Recommended Resources**

For a deeper dive into these concepts, I would strongly recommend the following resources:

1.  **"Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann:** This book has a comprehensive section on distributed training, covering topics such as `torch.distributed`, data parallel training, and model parallel training. It's essential if you’re using pytorch in any serious capacity.

2.  **TensorFlow documentation:** Particularly the sections on “Using GPUs” and “Distributed training”. TensorFlow has its own approach, and it is worthwhile to understand how it differs from PyTorch, especially if you are working with both.

3.  **CUDA Toolkit Documentation:** While not directly about Python, a solid grasp of how CUDA works at the driver level will significantly enhance your understanding of how libraries interact with the GPU. Refer to the official Nvidia documentation for up-to-date information on drivers and supported architectures.

4.  **"Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach" by David B. Kirk and Wen-mei W. Hwu:** This book provides an in-depth look at the architecture of GPUs and parallel programming, which will ultimately assist you in writing more optimized and efficient code.

In summary, assigning GPUs to tasks isn't always trivial, and the best method hinges on the specific use case and complexity of the script. My experiences have always benefited from methodical experimentation and understanding how the underlying libraries actually use the available hardware. Start with the basics, understand the nuances of each approach, and always check that your drivers are up to date. Good luck.
