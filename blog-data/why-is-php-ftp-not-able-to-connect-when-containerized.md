Let's talk about PHP and FTP connections inside containers. It's a situation I've encountered more times than I care to remember, and it invariably boils down to a few common culprits. I recall one particularly frustrating project where we were deploying a legacy PHP application to docker, and the FTP component, which was critical for image uploads, simply refused to cooperate. We spent a good part of a day just chasing down configuration issues. The core problem, in my experience, isn't usually with the PHP ftp extension itself, but with the networking and environment constraints that containerization introduces.

Firstly, and this is fundamental, remember that containerized applications don't directly inherit the host system's network configuration. By default, a docker container operates within its own isolated network namespace. This means your PHP code attempting to connect to an FTP server using a hostname like `ftp.example.com` needs to resolve that name within the container's context, and any communication needs to traverse the container's network bridge. If the container's network configuration is not properly set up, DNS resolution might fail. The PHP ftp extension relies heavily on underlying system libraries for name resolution, so this failure will cascade up to your PHP application.

Secondly, and this is frequently overlooked, we have the active versus passive FTP modes. In active mode, the server initiates the data connection back to the client after the initial control connection. This is problematic inside a container, because the server might be sending its connection request to an ip address that is internal to the container’s network (or just simply wrong and unreachable from the outside, given the typical nature of NAT used by Docker). In contrast, passive mode has the client initiate the data connection after the server tells it which port to connect to. This is typically the preferred method when dealing with NAT environments such as containers. A quick fix for this (when FTP server configuration cannot be changed) is ensuring the php ftp client explicitly uses passive mode when connecting.

Third, firewalls both within the container and on the network where the FTP server resides are common causes of connectivity issues. Container firewalls, if enabled (not very common, but possible) can restrict outbound connections to specific ports, typically only 80 or 443. If you’re using Docker Compose, the defined network can also have its own implicit firewall rules. Similarly, the host where the FTP server lives may have an external firewall preventing connections on the necessary ports. Standard FTP servers run on port 21 for control, and a varying range of ports for the actual data transfers, depending on the mode. You’ll need to ensure any relevant firewall is configured to allow both inbound and outbound data traffic for the control and data ports. The specific range of ports is often a configurable setting within the FTP server itself, and it will be dependent on the specific implementation.

Let's look at some code examples to illustrate this:

**Example 1: Basic connection with passive mode enabled**

```php
<?php

$ftp_server = "ftp.example.com";
$ftp_user = "user";
$ftp_pass = "password";

$conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server);

if(!$conn_id){
  echo "Failed to connect to FTP server";
  exit;
}

$login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user, $ftp_pass);

if (!$login_result) {
    echo "Failed to login to FTP server";
    ftp_close($conn_id);
    exit;
}

ftp_pasv($conn_id, true); //Enabling passive mode

$files = ftp_nlist($conn_id, ".");
if ($files === false) {
    echo "Unable to list files on FTP server";
} else {
    print_r($files);
}

ftp_close($conn_id);

?>
```

This first example demonstrates the basic ftp connection, and it also specifically sets the connection mode to passive using `ftp_pasv($conn_id, true);`. This is a crucial step for using the FTP protocol from behind a NAT such as the Docker container network.

**Example 2: Explicitly specifying the port**

```php
<?php

$ftp_server = "ftp.example.com";
$ftp_port = 2121; // Non-standard port for demonstration purposes.
$ftp_user = "user";
$ftp_pass = "password";

$conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server, $ftp_port);

if(!$conn_id){
  echo "Failed to connect to FTP server";
  exit;
}


$login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user, $ftp_pass);

if (!$login_result) {
    echo "Failed to login to FTP server";
    ftp_close($conn_id);
    exit;
}

ftp_pasv($conn_id, true);

// Example of downloading a file
$remote_file = 'file.txt';
$local_file = '/tmp/downloaded_file.txt';

$download_result = ftp_get($conn_id, $local_file, $remote_file, FTP_BINARY);

if(!$download_result) {
  echo "Failed to download file: ". $remote_file;
} else {
    echo "File ". $remote_file . " successfully downloaded to " . $local_file;
}

ftp_close($conn_id);

?>
```

Here, the port is specified explicitly during the `ftp_connect` call, using `ftp_connect($ftp_server, $ftp_port)`. This is useful when your FTP server isn't using the default port 21. Note also the file download function used by `ftp_get` and that passive mode is also set. This combination is key in establishing a reliable connection and data transfer. Also, take into account that `FTP_BINARY` needs to be specified during file transfer when the files are not text based (images, videos, etc)

**Example 3: Debugging Connection Errors**

```php
<?php

$ftp_server = "ftp.example.com";
$ftp_user = "user";
$ftp_pass = "password";

$conn_id = @ftp_connect($ftp_server, 21, 10); //Timeout set to 10 seconds

if(!$conn_id){
  $error = error_get_last();
  echo "FTP Connection Failed: " . $error['message'] . "\n";
  exit;
}


$login_result = @ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user, $ftp_pass);


if (!$login_result) {
    $error = error_get_last();
    echo "FTP Login Failed: " . $error['message'] . "\n";
    ftp_close($conn_id);
    exit;
}


ftp_pasv($conn_id, true); //Passive mode

$files = ftp_nlist($conn_id, ".");

if ($files === false) {
    $error = error_get_last();
    echo "FTP NLIST failed: " . $error['message'] . "\n";
} else {
    print_r($files);
}

ftp_close($conn_id);

?>
```
This third example illustrates proper error handling using `@` to suppress default warnings/errors, and then capturing the last error message using `error_get_last()`. This is helpful for debugging connection issues because the default php error messages are not particularly informative when using ftp functions. This is a very important step when troubleshooting ftp connectivity issues in PHP. Note also the timeout parameter provided to the `ftp_connect` function. This will help you identify cases when the server is unreachable by timing out the connection attempt.

For further study, i would recommend looking into some authoritative sources. "TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols" by W. Richard Stevens is a classic for network protocols. When it comes to PHP specifics, the official php documentation is your best bet, specifically the functions under the `ftp` extension. Also, researching the specific implementations of the FTP servers that are used in your setups will provide better details on their configurations and expected behaviors. For Docker specifically, focus on the networking documentation provided by docker which will provide key insights on the differences between host and container networks.

In summary, while PHP's ftp functions are quite robust, containerization introduces extra layers of complexity. The most common culprits for connection issues are almost always related to network configurations, be it DNS resolution, FTP mode conflicts, or firewall restrictions. The examples above should give you a starting point on how to fix some of these typical problems. By addressing these aspects, you can resolve most issues preventing PHP applications from establishing FTP connections when containerized.
