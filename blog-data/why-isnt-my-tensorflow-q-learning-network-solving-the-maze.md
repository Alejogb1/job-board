Let's unpack this. It’s frustrating when a Q-learning agent seems to just wander aimlessly in a maze, especially after you've meticulously constructed the network. I’ve certainly been there. Instead of assuming some sort of fundamental flaw in the architecture, let’s consider the practical nuances that often trip up Q-learning implementations, particularly in maze environments using TensorFlow. My experience with similar projects suggests that the devil is often in the details of implementation and hyperparameter tuning, rather than the core algorithm itself.

First, let’s get the obvious out of the way: are we truly sure the environment representation is correct? If the agent isn't receiving accurate or consistent state information, it cannot learn effectively. This isn't directly related to TensorFlow, but it’s the most common culprit. For example, I once spent days chasing a bug where my maze representation had swapped the x and y coordinates internally, resulting in chaotic and unpredictable agent behavior. The reward system also requires careful scrutiny. Are we sure the agent is receiving both positive and negative reinforcement signals appropriately? A reward function that is sparse or improperly scaled can hinder effective learning. Consider moving past solely giving a high reward at the end of the maze, giving a very slight positive reward for each step could also be something to explore.

Now, let's dive deeper into the issues stemming from TensorFlow and the Q-learning framework itself. A prime suspect is the update mechanism within Q-learning. Specifically, are you using an appropriate target network and handling experience replay correctly? In my experience, the stability of the Q-learning training process is critically dependent on these two techniques. A common mistake involves not having a target network—this is the source of the ‘moving target’ problem, where the agent chases an ever-shifting estimation, never truly converging. The target network provides a stable set of target values against which the main Q-network is updated, significantly increasing training stability. Experience replay further enhances learning by breaking correlations in the training data, using a memory buffer and sampling random experiences from the past. Let me show you some snippets of what I've found that works, with comments:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import random

class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.buffer = []
        self.position = 0

    def push(self, experience):
        if len(self.buffer) < self.capacity:
            self.buffer.append(None)
        self.buffer[self.position] = experience
        self.position = (self.position + 1) % self.capacity

    def sample(self, batch_size):
        if len(self.buffer) < batch_size:
          return None
        return random.sample(self.buffer, batch_size)

    def __len__(self):
      return len(self.buffer)

class QNetwork(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_uniform')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_uniform')
        self.output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(action_size, kernel_initializer='he_uniform')

    def call(self, state):
        x = self.dense1(state)
        x = self.dense2(x)
        return self.output_layer(x)


def update_q_network(q_network, target_network, optimizer, state_batch, action_batch, reward_batch, next_state_batch, done_batch, gamma):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        q_values = q_network(state_batch)
        next_q_values_target = target_network(next_state_batch)

        max_next_q_values = tf.reduce_max(next_q_values_target, axis=1)
        target_q_values = reward_batch + gamma * max_next_q_values * (1 - done_batch)

        mask = tf.one_hot(action_batch, q_values.shape[1])
        predicted_q_values = tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(q_values, mask), axis=1)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(target_q_values - predicted_q_values))

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, q_network.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, q_network.trainable_variables))
    return loss
```

This snippet outlines the basic components: a `ReplayBuffer` to hold transition experiences, a `QNetwork` model in TensorFlow, and the `update_q_network` function which updates the `q_network` using samples from the `replay_buffer`, while calculating losses and gradients.

Another crucial aspect is exploration versus exploitation. If your agent is always choosing the actions it thinks are best at the moment, it’s likely to get stuck in suboptimal areas. Implementing an epsilon-greedy policy, where you take random actions with a small probability (epsilon), is crucial for exploring the environment effectively, at least early in training. This probability can be decayed over time to favour exploitation as learning progresses.

```python
def epsilon_greedy_policy(q_network, state, epsilon, action_size):
  if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
    return np.random.randint(action_size) # Explore: choose a random action
  else:
    q_values = q_network(np.expand_dims(state, axis=0)) #Exploit: choose the best action
    return np.argmax(q_values.numpy())

def train_q_learning(env, q_network, target_network, optimizer, replay_buffer, num_episodes, batch_size, gamma, epsilon_start, epsilon_end, epsilon_decay, update_freq, tau):
  epsilon = epsilon_start
  for episode in range(num_episodes):
      state = env.reset()
      done = False
      while not done:
          action = epsilon_greedy_policy(q_network, state, epsilon, env.action_space.n)
          next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
          replay_buffer.push((state, action, reward, next_state, done))

          if len(replay_buffer) >= batch_size and (env.global_step % update_freq == 0):
              experiences = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
              state_batch, action_batch, reward_batch, next_state_batch, done_batch = zip(*experiences)
              state_batch = np.array(state_batch, dtype=np.float32)
              action_batch = np.array(action_batch, dtype=np.int32)
              reward_batch = np.array(reward_batch, dtype=np.float32)
              next_state_batch = np.array(next_state_batch, dtype=np.float32)
              done_batch = np.array(done_batch, dtype=np.float32)


              loss = update_q_network(q_network, target_network, optimizer, state_batch, action_batch, reward_batch, next_state_batch, done_batch, gamma)
              #Soft update of target network
              for target_weight, q_weight in zip(target_network.trainable_variables, q_network.trainable_variables):
                target_weight.assign(target_weight * (1 - tau) + q_weight * tau)
          state = next_state
          env.global_step += 1
      epsilon = max(epsilon_end, epsilon - epsilon_decay)
      if episode % 10 == 0:
        print(f"Episode {episode}, epsilon: {epsilon:.2f}")
```

This gives you the skeleton of the training loop incorporating the exploration through the use of the epsilon-greedy policy, as well as the soft updates on the target network.

Finally, hyperparameter tuning plays a considerable role. The learning rate of the optimizer, the discount factor (gamma), the size of the replay buffer, the frequency of target network updates, the rate of epsilon decay; all these have a significant impact on training. I remember one project where increasing the replay buffer size by a factor of ten suddenly enabled the agent to learn consistently, showcasing the importance of empirically fine-tuning. Here's a small snippet showing how we can intialize and set up some hyper parameters:

```python
import gym
# Initialize the environment
env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v1', is_slippery=False)
env.global_step = 0
state_size = env.observation_space.n
action_size = env.action_space.n
# Initialize hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.001
gamma = 0.99
replay_buffer_capacity = 10000
batch_size = 64
num_episodes = 500
epsilon_start = 1.0
epsilon_end = 0.01
epsilon_decay = (epsilon_start - epsilon_end) / num_episodes
update_freq = 4
tau = 0.005
# Initialize the networks and optimizer
q_network = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
target_network = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
target_network.set_weights(q_network.get_weights())
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate)
# Initialize replay buffer
replay_buffer = ReplayBuffer(replay_buffer_capacity)
# Train the agent
train_q_learning(env, q_network, target_network, optimizer, replay_buffer, num_episodes, batch_size, gamma, epsilon_start, epsilon_end, epsilon_decay, update_freq, tau)

```

For further reading, I strongly recommend exploring "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. It’s the canonical text for the field and provides a robust theoretical foundation. For practical implementations and various techniques, the book "Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On" by Maxim Lapan offers a good starting point, but do take note that these two are often not directly related in a practical sense, and bridging the theory to implementation requires experience and understanding of your model. Also, diving into the research papers on deep q-networks and double q-learning could give you a deeper view of the technicalities behind the algorithms.

Debugging reinforcement learning problems isn't straightforward, and it often requires meticulous attention to detail. Don't be discouraged if it takes some time and experimentation to get your agent to navigate the maze. Review these common pitfalls, experiment with different hyperparameters, and continue iterating on your implementation, and things should fall into place. Remember, building robust reinforcement learning solutions requires patience, persistence, and a methodical approach.
