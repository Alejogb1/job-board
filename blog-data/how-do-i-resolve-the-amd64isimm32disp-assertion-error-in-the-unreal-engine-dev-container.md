Alright, let's tackle this `amd64_is_imm32(disp)` assertion error you're facing within your Unreal Engine dev container. This one rings a bell; I remember encountering something similar back when I was heavily involved in optimizing some custom rendering modules for a game that pushed the boundaries of the engine’s capabilities. It's certainly a frustrating roadblock, but let's break it down methodically. The core issue, as the assertion implies, revolves around the size of the displacement (`disp`) value being passed in a context where a 32-bit immediate value is expected within the x86-64 (amd64) architecture. When you're deep in engine code, this often arises due to either incorrect assembly generation, a compiler misinterpretation, or more commonly, issues with how memory addresses are being handled, particularly within generated shaders or low-level engine components.

First, let's clarify what's going on under the hood. In x86-64 assembly, certain instructions that involve accessing memory locations utilize a displacement value, or offset, from a base register. This displacement can be encoded as a small immediate value (typically up to 32 bits) or require a more complex addressing mode. The assertion is essentially the code's way of screaming, "Hey, I expected a 32-bit displacement here, but something larger or different is showing up." This usually means the generated assembly is attempting to use an addressing scheme that involves a displacement outside of the permitted 32-bit range, which then triggers this error.

Let's consider scenarios where this might commonly manifest within the Unreal Engine context, especially inside a dev container. Often, it's not the core engine code that's failing initially, but custom plugin modules, generated HLSL shaders, or dynamically created code through blueprints. For the sake of illustration, let’s imagine a custom shader that uses a very large, dynamically allocated constant buffer. If the shader compiler isn't correctly mapping memory addresses relative to a specific base pointer and tries to inline an absolute address as the displacement, you can easily see how that might lead to a value outside the 32-bit limit. Also, I've seen this pop up when working with large custom UStructs in blueprint where the memory offsets weren't handled perfectly with the compiler in certain older engine versions.

Now, on to solutions. It’s crucial to approach this methodically rather than just poking around randomly. Here’s how I'd typically proceed:

1.  **Narrowing the Scope:** Start by isolating where the error is occurring. The call stack or error messages in your Unreal log should provide clues. Identify the specific function or component triggering the assertion. This usually involves carefully examining the log output for function names or source file names related to the problematic code. Knowing where the fault is originating will help you focus on the relevant parts of the code base. Don’t ignore the potentially less obvious stack frames. Often the root cause is buried a few levels up, but it is worth checking the context surrounding it to identify the misstep. I have seen many occasions where some small issue with memory allocation or some overlooked compiler optimisation, caused a memory misalignment issue which resulted in this particular assertion failure.

2.  **Shader Debugging:** If the error points to a generated shader, utilize the engine's built-in shader debugging tools to inspect the HLSL code being generated. Check to see if you're dealing with very large constant buffers or complex struct layouts. Sometimes the issue is not the shader code itself, but rather the way data is passed from the cpu to the gpu. If a large data structure is being passed from the cpu to the gpu this can often be the source of displacement issues. The idea is to use the shader debugger to look at the exact assembly code being generated. Try simplifying the shader to identify the exact section that triggers this assertion. Pay close attention to memory access patterns and how constants are being indexed.

3.  **Reviewing Custom Modules/Plugins:** If the issue stems from a custom module or plugin you've built, carefully review how you are allocating memory and how pointers are being handled, particularly if you are accessing memory using addresses derived from calculations. Make sure that you are correctly utilizing the engine's memory management functions and avoid direct pointer arithmetic. Look out for any code that creates or manipulates offsets, address calculations, or where you are passing addresses to external libraries. Pay particular attention to any casts being made as this is often where addressing issues can arise.

4.  **Compiler Options:** Examine the compiler settings within your build configuration and consider how they may affect code generation. Occasionally certain levels of compiler optimisation, especially in older versions of the engine, could generate assembly that triggers such an assertion. Try experimenting with different optimisation flags or different compiler versions. While compiler optimisation should increase efficiency it can often also introduce issues. You can also try using static analysis tools to examine your code for potential issues related to memory manipulation and pointer handling.

To illustrate this, here are three simplified code examples, not directly from Unreal Engine but indicative of the kinds of scenarios that can lead to this assertion:

**Example 1: Incorrect Constant Buffer Offset (HLSL-like concept):**

```cpp
// Hypothetical scenario within an HLSL shader context
struct LargeData {
    float data1[5000];
    float data2;
};

cbuffer Constants : register(b0)
{
    LargeData myData;
    float someValue;
}

//In assembly, if 'myData.data1[x]' is accessed with a direct, large offset from constants.
// Instead of using a register to point to the base and a smaller relative offset to access the data
float exampleFunc() {
    return myData.data1[4000]; // This could generate a large displacement value
}
```
In this case, if the compiler directly encoded the offset to `data1[4000]` from the constant buffer base as a literal, rather than a register-based offset, the displacement may exceed 32 bits. The proper way to solve this issue is to ensure the data is accessed using appropriate base pointers and relative offsets.

**Example 2: Improper Pointer Arithmetic in C++ Plugin:**

```cpp
// Hypothetical C++ plugin code within an Unreal Engine context

struct MyStruct {
  uint8_t data[1024*1024]; // Large struct
};


void processStruct(MyStruct* structPtr) {
   uint8_t* offsetPtr = (uint8_t*)structPtr + (1024*500); // Large offset
   *offsetPtr = 42; //access memory at large offset
}

void CallProcessStruct(){

  MyStruct* myStruct = (MyStruct*)FMemory::Malloc(sizeof(MyStruct));
  processStruct(myStruct);
  FMemory::Free(myStruct);
}

```
In this example, direct pointer arithmetic creates a large offset, which might become a non-immediate value during code generation. A much better solution would be to access the data structure using smaller offsets, relative to the base pointer that is within the structure itself rather than just casting and adding an offset from the beginning of the structure. For example by using a struct member rather than an arbitrary offset.

**Example 3: Issue in a dynamically created function:**

```cpp
// Hypothetical dynamically created function
// This is an overly simplistic example to represent a potential addressing issue

int* dynamicFunc(int* baseAddr, int largeOffset) {
    return baseAddr + largeOffset; // Might cause problems if `largeOffset` can result in too large displacement

}

int main(){
    int* arr = new int[10000];

    int* pointer = dynamicFunc(arr, 9000);

    delete []arr;
    return 0;
}
```

Here, if `largeOffset` is too large, this might not be represented as a relative, immediate offset within the assembly leading to an access violation. The better approach is to re-evaluate the design and use iterative methods to access the data structure to reduce the large single offset.

*   **"Optimizing C++" by Kurt Guntheroth:** Covers in depth the optimisation techniques of C++, and provides insights into how compilers transform code. This will allow you to better understand why an assertion such as this may have been triggered.
*   **The Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual:** For the nitty-gritty detail on the x86-64 instruction set and addressing modes, the Intel manuals are the ultimate source of truth. These are accessible for free from Intel's website.
*   **Shader Model Documentation by Microsoft:** While specific to DirectX, understanding shader models (like those used in HLSL) is important when diagnosing shader-related compilation and runtime issues.

The key is to systematically trace the problem, investigate the source code and assembly, and adjust code/data structures to work within the bounds of the x86-64 instruction set. I hope these insights are useful in your troubleshooting journey. Remember, patience and a systematic approach are crucial.
