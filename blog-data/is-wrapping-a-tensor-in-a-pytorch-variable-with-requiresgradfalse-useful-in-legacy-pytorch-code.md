Alright, let's tackle this. It’s a question that brings back a few memories, actually, from some of the early PyTorch projects I worked on where we had a mix of code bases—some using the older `Variable` wrapper and some transitioning to raw tensors.

The core of your question revolves around the now-deprecated `torch.autograd.Variable` and its specific usage with `requires_grad=False`. To be clear, since PyTorch 0.4, the `Variable` class has been merged directly into the `Tensor` class. The behavior you're asking about, where you wrap a tensor to control gradient calculation, is now handled directly by the `.requires_grad` attribute on the tensor itself. However, in legacy code, you’ll definitely encounter this pattern. So, is wrapping a tensor in an older `torch.autograd.Variable` with `requires_grad=False` useful? The short answer is, within the specific confines of old PyTorch versions, yes, absolutely, but with some specific nuances to consider.

Back when `Variable` was a distinct type, explicitly setting `requires_grad=False` was *the* way to tell the autograd engine to not track operations on that particular variable. It was crucial in several common situations:

*   **Freezing Pre-trained Models:** When you used pre-trained layers from a model, you often didn’t want to fine-tune their weights. You only wanted to update the weights of your custom layers. Creating `Variable` instances with `requires_grad=False` for the pre-trained layers prevented any gradient calculations for their parameters, saving you both computation and, crucially, preventing any unwanted modification of those learned representations. This is where the utility really shined through, in the early days, especially when fine-tuning pre-trained models wasn’t as straightforward as it is today.
*   **Input Manipulation without Gradients:** Sometimes you needed to perform operations on your input data that were *not* part of the neural network's training process. For example, you might be applying a pre-processing step on your input before feeding it into your neural network, and you definitely don't want those pre-processing calculations to be included in the gradient calculation of your learning phase. Setting `requires_grad=False` ensured such operations did not affect the backpropagation. It was a handy and efficient method to ensure only the relevant parts of the computational graph were considered.
*   **Batch processing**: During data loading, one might have to perform data manipulations, and `requires_grad=False` allowed us to do that before inputting data into a model without disrupting the computational graph built during backpropagation.

Let’s look at some code snippets that simulate how this usage would play out in practice. The key thing to remember is that in modern PyTorch, we’d avoid the explicit `Variable` call and directly manipulate the tensor's `.requires_grad` attribute.

**Snippet 1: Freezing Pre-trained Parameters**

```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Variable

# This emulates the old Variable wrapping
def legacy_variable(tensor, requires_grad):
    return Variable(tensor, requires_grad=requires_grad)

# Assume we have some pre-trained weights, these would be actual tensors in a model
pre_trained_weights = torch.randn(10, 5)
my_new_weights = torch.randn(5, 2)

# In the old days you'd do this to prevent backprop on pre-trained weights
frozen_weights = legacy_variable(pre_trained_weights, requires_grad=False)
trainable_weights = legacy_variable(my_new_weights, requires_grad=True)

# Now you can do your computations. In a typical neural net, this would include
# forward passes through a network.
output = frozen_weights @ trainable_weights

# in modern PyTorch, `requires_grad=False` will prevent any gradients on the frozen weights
output.mean().backward() # This will only update trainable weights
print("Gradient of frozen_weights:", frozen_weights.grad)
print("Gradient of trainable_weights:", trainable_weights.grad)
```

In the above example, notice that the gradient of the frozen weights is `None`, even though they participated in the computation. This is because `requires_grad=False` prevents gradient accumulation.

**Snippet 2: Pre-processing data with `requires_grad=False`**

```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Variable

def legacy_variable(tensor, requires_grad):
    return Variable(tensor, requires_grad=requires_grad)

input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Suppose you are transforming your input data before feeding it into your model,
# and this operation shouldn't be part of the training gradient, then you would:
pre_processed_input = legacy_variable(input_data, requires_grad=False) * 2 + 1

# These are your model weights
model_weights = legacy_variable(torch.randn(10,5), requires_grad=True)

output = pre_processed_input @ model_weights
output.mean().backward()

print("Gradient of pre-processed_input:", pre_processed_input.grad)
print("Gradient of model_weights:", model_weights.grad)
```

Here, we see the gradient of `pre_processed_input` is again `None` because it was set up to not require gradients. Notice this was all done before passing the data to model.

**Snippet 3: A more involved example showing how it helps avoiding errors**

```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Variable

def legacy_variable(tensor, requires_grad):
    return Variable(tensor, requires_grad=requires_grad)

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Suppose that you want to re-use your input to create another output
input_var_for_training = legacy_variable(input_tensor, requires_grad=True)
input_var_no_grad = legacy_variable(input_tensor, requires_grad=False)

# Training part
model_weights = legacy_variable(torch.randn(10, 5), requires_grad=True)
output_training = input_var_for_training @ model_weights
output_training.mean().backward()

# Another calculation based on the input. this should not affect training
other_calculation = input_var_no_grad * 2 + 1
print("Gradient of other_calculation:", other_calculation.grad) # This would be none
print("Gradient of model_weights:", model_weights.grad) # Gradient updated correctly, as intended
print("Gradient of input_var_for_training:", input_var_for_training.grad)
```

In this third example, if we hadn’t used `requires_grad=False` when computing `other_calculation`, the gradient calculation during backpropagation would have had unexpected consequences. This would have modified the `input_tensor` directly, instead of only the weights.

In terms of resources if you want to delve into the core of these concepts, the original PyTorch papers discussing autograd from Soumith Chintala and his team (search for 'automatic differentiation in PyTorch') are definitely worth reading. You can find them easily online or on scholarly search engines. Furthermore, look into the PyTorch documentation for the versions prior to v0.4 to see the `Variable` based API. Finally, the book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga and Thomas Viehmann provides both theoretical context and practical examples to the use of pytorch, particularly on the workings of autograd.

To sum it up, while the specific `Variable` wrapper is no longer a thing in newer PyTorch, the *need* to control gradient tracking remains crucial, and for legacy code, `requires_grad=False` on Variables was *the* method of ensuring specific operations were excluded from the backpropagation calculations. It served a very important purpose and its effects should not be forgotten even when not directly using it today. Understanding this behavior will not only be helpful in legacy code, but will make more clear the underpinnings of `requires_grad` today. It helped me quite a bit back then and I hope it helps you today.
