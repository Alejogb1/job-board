Let’s tackle this one. I've spent a fair amount of time wrangling data visualization libraries, and Altair, with its declarative approach, has always been a personal favorite. Specifically addressing row and column titles in Altair charts, it’s not always immediately obvious how to achieve the desired results. This isn’t due to any deficiency in the library; rather, it stems from the underlying grammar of graphics and how Altair abstracts away much of the lower-level plotting mechanics. When I first encountered this, while visualizing some longitudinal survey data, I remember feeling like I was missing something fundamental. It turns out, there’s a very particular way to go about it, focusing on the encoding channels and axis properties.

In essence, Altair doesn't have dedicated 'row title' or 'column title' properties in the way you might find in a spreadsheet application. Instead, it leverages the existing encoding system and adds titles to the axes representing your rows and columns. To clarify, when you facet your chart (creating a grid of plots) by one variable, say “category”, it divides your main data into separate plots for each category, these are what we often call 'rows' and 'columns', based on the arrangement. The axes of these plots, typically the x and y axes, then effectively inherit the titles of these 'rows' and 'columns'. Therefore, it's within these axis properties where you’ll define those titles. We're manipulating axis titles, not literal row or column titles.

Let's illustrate this with code. Suppose you're working with a dataset of fictional product sales across different regions and years. Our goal is to create a faceted chart where each row represents a region, and each chart displays sales by year.

First, here’s a basic example to show you how it’s done without focusing too much on styling:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Sample data (simplified)
data = {
    'region': ['North', 'North', 'South', 'South', 'East', 'East', 'West', 'West'],
    'year': [2020, 2021, 2020, 2021, 2020, 2021, 2020, 2021],
    'sales': [100, 120, 150, 160, 90, 110, 130, 140]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='year:O',
    y='sales:Q',
    row='region:N' # Defining our rows
).properties(
    title='Sales by Region and Year'
)

chart
```

In this example, 'region:N' (N is nominal) determines the rows, and 'year:O' (O is ordinal) represents the x-axis, 'sales:Q' (Q is quantitative) the y-axis. What you'll see is that the y-axis title of each row's plot becomes 'sales', and the x-axis title is 'year'. The 'region' labels, though displayed, aren’t set via 'title' they are created by faceting. If we wanted to be more explicit, we could add that by making these changes within the `encode()` function:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Sample data (simplified)
data = {
    'region': ['North', 'North', 'South', 'South', 'East', 'East', 'West', 'West'],
    'year': [2020, 2021, 2020, 2021, 2020, 2021, 2020, 2021],
    'sales': [100, 120, 150, 160, 90, 110, 130, 140]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('year:O', title="Fiscal Year"), # Updated X Axis Title
    y=alt.Y('sales:Q', title="Total Revenue"), #Updated Y Axis Title
    row=alt.Row('region:N', title="Region of Sales")  # Explicit Row Title
).properties(
    title='Sales by Region and Year'
)

chart
```

In this revision, the `alt.X` and `alt.Y` objects allow us to specify the titles for the axes directly, which will propagate to each plot. Furthermore, we've added `alt.Row` within the row parameter, which is the explicit way to define the title of the rows in our facet. This is critical for scenarios where clarity is paramount.

Lastly, if you had a situation requiring both rows and columns, here’s how you would specify their titles:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Sample data (simplified)
data = {
    'region': ['North', 'North', 'South', 'South', 'East', 'East', 'West', 'West'],
    'category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B'],
     'year': [2020, 2021, 2020, 2021, 2020, 2021, 2020, 2021],
    'sales': [100, 120, 150, 160, 90, 110, 130, 140]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)


chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('year:O', title="Fiscal Year"),
    y=alt.Y('sales:Q', title="Total Revenue"),
    row=alt.Row('region:N', title="Region of Sales"),
    column=alt.Column('category:N', title="Product Category") # Explicit Column title
).properties(
    title='Sales by Region, Category and Year'
)


chart
```

Here, we’ve introduced 'category' and used `alt.Column` to specify the column titles, which appears at the top of each column. Essentially, the pattern is consistent: row titles are set via the `row` encoding channel when you're faceting along the vertical dimension, and column titles when you are faceting along the horizontal dimension, using `alt.Row` and `alt.Column` respectively.

The critical take away is that Altair doesn’t have properties dedicated to row/column titles separate from the axes; the correct way to control title for faceted charts is through the `alt.X`, `alt.Y`, `alt.Row` and `alt.Column` definitions. While straightforward once grasped, this concept was initially a point of minor frustration for me. It’s important to internalize these mechanics to craft clear and concise visualizations.

For anyone wanting to delve deeper into this topic and the fundamentals of data visualization, I’d highly recommend reading “The Grammar of Graphics” by Leland Wilkinson. It’s the core theoretical basis upon which Altair is built. Another excellent resource is “Interactive Data Visualization for the Web” by Scott Murray which, while not specific to Altair, provides valuable insight into the broader world of interactive charting and how such libraries are often structured. Finally, the official Altair documentation is always your best resource when you need to double-check details or explore advanced features. Good luck!
