,  It's a question I’ve certainly encountered several times in the past, particularly when dealing with complex forms and wanting to maintain a clean user interface without exposing everything at once. The core challenge lies in the interaction between `simple_form`, Rails' strong parameters, and associated model relationships. It's not uncommon to only need a specific subset of fields from an associated object within a form, and naively including the entire association can lead to messy, often unnecessary, data handling.

My recollection goes back to a project for an inventory management system. We had a `Product` model and each product could have multiple `Supplier` records associated with it via a `has_many` relationship. The form for a product, however, didn't always need all the details of each supplier, especially when we were only focusing on updating pricing or related attributes. Displaying all supplier fields for each associated supplier on the product form would have been overkill and impacted both usability and performance. This situation is where selecting specific fields becomes crucial.

The default behavior of `simple_form` when working with associations is to generally expect nested attributes, allowing you to create or update records within those associations through the primary form. This can be managed through `accepts_nested_attributes_for`, but it also defaults to a "all or nothing" approach. When you want granular control, we need to step away from the standard setup.

Instead of relying on nested attributes for displaying fields, we'll leverage the flexibility of `simple_form` and build custom logic within the view and controller. It’s best to consider the problem not as “how do I pull specific fields using nested attributes,” but rather, “how do I render specific fields from associated records in a form.” There’s a distinction, and this paradigm shift leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.

Let’s illustrate using code. Say, in our inventory application, we have:

```ruby
# models/product.rb
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :suppliers, dependent: :destroy
end

# models/supplier.rb
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :product
end
```

And, let's assume a basic migration structure that includes fields like `name`, `email`, `contact_person` and `phone` on the Supplier model. Now, when we’re editing the product, we only want to display the supplier's name and contact person field, for some reason. We will bypass `accepts_nested_attributes_for` in the product model, this is important. In the view, we'll manually iterate over the suppliers and use simple form to display the selected fields. Here is how:

**View Example 1: Displaying selected fields without nested attributes.**

```erb
# views/products/_form.html.erb
<%= simple_form_for(@product) do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :name %>
  <%= f.input :description %>

  <h3>Associated Suppliers:</h3>

  <% @product.suppliers.each do |supplier| %>
    <div class="supplier-details">
      <%= simple_fields_for "product[suppliers][]", supplier do |supplier_fields| %>
          <%= supplier_fields.input :name, label: "Supplier Name" %>
          <%= supplier_fields.input :contact_person, label: "Contact Person" %>
        <%# We can also add hidden fields for id, since we are updating existing suppliers. %>
        <%= supplier_fields.hidden_field :id %>
      <% end %>
    </div>
  <% end %>
    <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

Notice that we use `simple_fields_for` but without a direct association. We're manually passing the `@product.suppliers` collection. The key here is `product[suppliers][]`. This is crucial for capturing the data on the backend. Also note the hidden field for the `id` of the supplier. This ensures we update the correct records.

**Controller Example 1: Processing the form data without nested attributes.**

```ruby
# controllers/products_controller.rb

def update
  @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  if @product.update(product_params)
    process_suppliers(@product, params[:product][:suppliers] || [])
    redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product updated successfully.'
  else
    render :edit
  end
end

private

  def product_params
    params.require(:product).permit(:name, :description) # exclude nested attributes
  end

  def process_suppliers(product, supplier_params)
     return unless supplier_params.present?

    supplier_params.each do |supplier_hash|
      supplier = product.suppliers.find_by(id: supplier_hash[:id])
      if supplier
          supplier.update(supplier_hash.permit(:name, :contact_person))
      end
    end
  end
```

The `process_suppliers` method iterates through the params and applies updates to existing supplier records, using the `id` of each supplier to find the correct record to update. The controller has been carefully crafted to handle these params without nested attributes and to update the supplier data selectively based on the `id` passed from the form. Notice how we manually handle the updates, permitting only `name` and `contact_person` fields. This is the core of selective field updates in this context.

Now, sometimes you might need to create new associated records. In those cases, we’ll need to be a bit more deliberate. Let’s assume in this form, we want to add a single new supplier with the same fields.

**View Example 2: Adding a new associated object.**

```erb
<%= simple_form_for(@product) do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :name %>
  <%= f.input :description %>

    <h3>Associated Suppliers:</h3>
    <% @product.suppliers.each do |supplier| %>
      <div class="supplier-details">
        <%= simple_fields_for "product[suppliers][]", supplier do |supplier_fields| %>
            <%= supplier_fields.input :name, label: "Supplier Name" %>
            <%= supplier_fields.input :contact_person, label: "Contact Person" %>
            <%= supplier_fields.hidden_field :id %>
         <% end %>
     </div>
    <% end %>

    <h3>Add a New Supplier</h3>

    <%= simple_fields_for "product[new_supplier]", Supplier.new do |new_supplier_fields| %>
      <%= new_supplier_fields.input :name, label: "New Supplier Name" %>
      <%= new_supplier_fields.input :contact_person, label: "New Supplier Contact Person" %>
    <% end %>

  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

Here, we’ve introduced an additional `simple_fields_for` block for a new supplier, using `product[new_supplier]` as the name.

**Controller Example 2: Processing the form data with new object creation.**

```ruby
# controllers/products_controller.rb
def update
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])
    if @product.update(product_params)
        process_suppliers(@product, params[:product][:suppliers] || [])
        if params[:product][:new_supplier].present?
          @product.suppliers.create(params[:product][:new_supplier].permit(:name, :contact_person))
        end
      redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product updated successfully.'
    else
      render :edit
    end
  end

  private

  def product_params
    params.require(:product).permit(:name, :description)
  end

   def process_suppliers(product, supplier_params)
        return unless supplier_params.present?

        supplier_params.each do |supplier_hash|
          supplier = product.suppliers.find_by(id: supplier_hash[:id])
          if supplier
              supplier.update(supplier_hash.permit(:name, :contact_person))
          end
        end
    end
```

Notice the conditional check for `params[:product][:new_supplier]` in the update action and how we create a new record using the permitted params.

These examples illustrate the key to selecting specific fields with `simple_form` is not relying on automatic nested attribute functionality, but creating explicit forms and handling parameter updates manually in the controller. The `simple_fields_for` method works extremely well here.

To deepen your understanding, I recommend exploring these resources:

*   **"Agile Web Development with Rails 7" by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson:** This book provides a comprehensive understanding of Rails fundamentals, including forms and model associations. It is crucial to solidify the underlying framework before focusing on intricate solutions like this.
*   **"The Well-Grounded Rubyist, Second Edition" by David A. Black:** A deeper dive into the Ruby language helps in understanding how Rails operates, particularly its metaprogramming aspects which underpins features like `simple_form` and Active Record associations.

In conclusion, by avoiding the default approach of nested attributes, constructing explicit form segments using `simple_fields_for` and manually handling params in the controller, you can gain granular control over the data shown and updated in Rails forms. This approach, although requiring a few extra lines of code, leads to a more maintainable, cleaner, and performant application. It’s a pattern I’ve found myself relying on more often than not in complex applications over the years.
