Alright, let's tackle this. It’s a situation I've definitely encountered more than once throughout my years working with Ruby on Rails—the dreaded "Kaminari gem won't work." Before we jump into troubleshooting, let’s understand that the inability to use Kaminari isn't usually because of some inherent flaw in the gem itself. More often than not, it points towards integration problems, incorrect configuration, or a mismatch between expectations and implementation. I’ve personally spent frustrating hours debugging this, so I can appreciate the situation.

Let's break this down from my experiences, aiming for practical insights rather than just theoretical explanations. The core issue often stems from the fact that Kaminari, as a pagination engine, expects your data retrieval to be done in a very specific way. It relies on methods to count total records and fetch subsets of data for display on different pages. If you're not adhering to these expectations, it's going to throw a wrench into your application. This isn’t a problem with Kaminari; it’s more often an issue with how the data is being retrieved.

One frequent issue occurs when you're working with custom scopes or complex database queries. I remember this one project particularly well; a large e-commerce site where we were using a lot of custom model methods for filtering. These methods were often returning pure arrays, or custom collections instead of the relation objects expected by Kaminari. Kaminari, you see, needs the ActiveRecord relation in order to inject its `page` method and perform the subsequent pagination logic. If you're feeding it a standard Ruby array, it simply doesn’t know how to paginate it. Let's look at a code example to illustrate this issue:

```ruby
# Incorrect: Returning an array instead of an ActiveRecord relation
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  def self.find_expensive_products
    Product.all.select { |product| product.price > 100 }
  end
end

# Controller
def index
  @products = Product.find_expensive_products.page(params[:page])
end
```

In this example, `Product.find_expensive_products` returns an array, and that's where Kaminari chokes. `page` is not an Array method. The fix is to always return an `ActiveRecord::Relation` when possible. If you need to filter, consider using scopes:

```ruby
# Correct: Using scopes to return ActiveRecord relation
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  scope :expensive_products, -> { where('price > ?', 100) }
end

# Controller
def index
  @products = Product.expensive_products.page(params[:page])
end
```

This revised version uses `where` instead of array-based selection, allowing ActiveRecord to build a relation that Kaminari can then paginate successfully. This highlights a common mistake— treating raw query results like plain data rather than a relational structure.

Another place I’ve seen problems crop up is when you are trying to apply `page` after `group`. Now, SQL `group by` results in a data structure that does not align with Kaminari’s expectation. Let’s imagine a scenario where you want to list categories and have these be paginated:

```ruby
# Problematic code using group by

class Category < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :products
end


# Assuming a products table has category_id

def index
  @categories = Category.joins(:products).group('categories.id').page(params[:page])
end
```

The above code will not work as intended, as the result is an ActiveRecord::Relation of grouped Category records. We should use `group` after the `page` call and use a custom count if needed. An alternative implementation would be:

```ruby
# Correct implementation that allows for pagination of groupings
def index
  @categories = Category.joins(:products).select('categories.*').group('categories.id')
  @paginated_categories = Kaminari.paginate_array(@categories).page(params[:page])
  @categories_count = @categories.count
end

# View code, assuming you have helper methods defined:
#<%= paginate @paginated_categories %>
```
In this example, I am using `Kaminari.paginate_array` to paginate a plain array that is a result of the group operation. It's a necessary step when using a complex `group` clause and needing to paginate a results set that's not directly coming from a query. You’ll also notice I have added a `categories_count`, since that is no longer directly available within the pagination scope.

Furthermore, improper use of joins, especially when using `left_joins` or outer joins can also lead to pagination issues. Kaminari relies on a consistent number of rows being returned to calculate pagination, so a `left_join` resulting in multiple records from the ‘joined’ table being returned for every row can throw off Kaminari’s calculations. Ensure you are using the proper join type. In my experience, a clear understanding of your SQL execution is critical when things get complex. If the raw SQL produces unexpected result sets, Kaminari will struggle to do its part.

Finally, it's worth verifying your Kaminari installation itself. Sometimes, issues can come from version conflicts or simply from an incorrect setup. Ensure that the Kaminari gem is correctly added to your `Gemfile` and that you have properly bundled your application. Check also that you are using a compatible version of Rails, as some older versions may have subtle incompatibilities. Sometimes it's easy to overlook these basic requirements. A good starting point is to always read the most current documentation.

In summary, the inability to use Kaminari generally stems from one of the following: the data you are trying to paginate is not in the form of an `ActiveRecord::Relation`, a complex SQL query is producing unexpected results, or issues with the actual installation or setup of the gem.

For further understanding, I would recommend spending some time with these resources:

*   **"Agile Web Development with Rails 7" by Sam Ruby, David Bryant Copeland, and David Thomas:** This book provides an excellent and practical guide to understanding how ActiveRecord works, especially its interaction with databases. The chapter on database interactions and active records should prove helpful.
*   **The official Rails Documentation on ActiveRecord Querying:** The rails guides provide excellent detail on all aspects of querying data using Active Record. It's often overlooked but essential reading for any Rails developer.
*   **The Kaminari Gem's official documentation:** Obviously, the most crucial place to fully grasp Kaminari’s intended use and configurations. Carefully go through it; it explains several use cases and best practices.

Remember, pagination problems can be frustrating. Always carefully inspect your queries, review your return types, and double check your gem setups. It’s less often an issue with Kaminari itself and more often a consequence of how it interacts with our application’s data. Happy coding.
