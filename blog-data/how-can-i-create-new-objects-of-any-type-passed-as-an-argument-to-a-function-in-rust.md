Alright, let's talk about creating new objects dynamically in Rust. It's a common challenge when you're trying to build flexible, generic code, and it definitely isn't immediately obvious how to approach it. I remember one particularly frustrating incident a few years back, working on a serialization library. We wanted to be able to deserialize data into user-defined types without knowing the type at compile time. The need to generate new instances from a generic type parameter became central to the solution. It’s certainly doable, but it requires a specific understanding of Rust's traits and ownership model.

The primary difficulty lies in Rust's compile-time type system. Unlike some dynamic languages where you can conjure up objects on the fly through reflection, Rust requires explicit type information at compile time, mostly for good reason - performance and memory safety. However, this doesn’t mean we’re stuck. We just need to leverage traits and a little bit of cleverness to achieve dynamic instantiation. The core idea revolves around defining a trait that dictates the ability to create a new instance. Then, any type that implements this trait can be instantiated generically.

The trait we're going to work with is essentially a factory pattern, which we'll call `Creatable`. It will have a single method, `create()`, which returns a new instance of the type that implements the trait. This is fundamental because we need a common interface, a contract, to generate our dynamic instances.

Here’s the general structure:

```rust
trait Creatable {
    fn create() -> Self;
}
```

Now, let’s look at a simple example. Suppose we have a struct, `MyStruct`, and we want to be able to create new instances of it through our `Creatable` trait. We implement the `Creatable` trait for `MyStruct`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyStruct {
    value: i32,
}

impl Creatable for MyStruct {
    fn create() -> Self {
        MyStruct { value: 0 }
    }
}
```

This is straightforward. The `create()` method constructs a new `MyStruct` with a default value for the `value` field. Now, consider a function that receives *any* type that implements `Creatable` and creates a new instance.

```rust
fn create_object<T: Creatable>() -> T {
   T::create()
}

fn main() {
    let my_object: MyStruct = create_object();
    println!("Created object: {:?}", my_object);
}
```

The `create_object` function uses a generic parameter `T`, which is constrained by the `Creatable` trait. This way, you can pass any type that implements `Creatable` and it will correctly invoke the `create()` method defined for that specific type.

This works well for types with basic constructors, but what about situations where you might need to initialize a new object with parameters? Here's where we need a slightly more complex approach. We’ll modify the trait to include a parameterized `create` method. Let's introduce `CreatableParam`.

```rust
trait CreatableParam<P> {
    fn create(param: P) -> Self;
}
```

Now, let's modify our `MyStruct` to take an initialization parameter:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyStructParam {
    value: i32,
}

impl CreatableParam<i32> for MyStructParam {
    fn create(param: i32) -> Self {
        MyStructParam { value: param }
    }
}
```

And here's the corresponding function:

```rust
fn create_param_object<T, P>(param: P) -> T
where
    T: CreatableParam<P>,
{
    T::create(param)
}

fn main() {
    let my_object_param: MyStructParam = create_param_object(10);
    println!("Created parameterized object: {:?}", my_object_param);
}
```

Now `create_param_object` is generic over both the type to be created (`T`) and the parameter type (`P`). The `where T: CreatableParam<P>` clause ensures that `T` implements `CreatableParam` for the given parameter type `P`. This demonstrates that we can create instances using some provided data.

However, there's a catch, which brings us to the third challenge: What if you need to store these dynamically created objects in a collection? You can't directly put objects with different types into a `Vec<T>`. Instead you would need to wrap them in a trait object, like `Box<dyn Creatable>`:

```rust
use std::any::Any;

trait CreatableAny {
    fn create_any(&self) -> Box<dyn Any>;
}

impl<T: 'static + Creatable> CreatableAny for T {
   fn create_any(&self) -> Box<dyn Any> {
      Box::new(T::create())
   }
}

fn create_and_store_objects() -> Vec<Box<dyn Any>>{
    let types: Vec<Box<dyn CreatableAny>> = vec![Box::new(MyStruct{value: 5}), Box::new(MyStructParam{value: 22})];
    let mut objects: Vec<Box<dyn Any>> = Vec::new();

    for type_creator in types {
       objects.push(type_creator.create_any());
    }
    objects
}

fn main(){
   let created_objects = create_and_store_objects();
   for obj in created_objects {
        if let Some(casted) = obj.downcast_ref::<MyStruct>(){
            println!("Downcast to MyStruct: {:?}", casted);
        }
        else if let Some(casted) = obj.downcast_ref::<MyStructParam>(){
            println!("Downcast to MyStructParam: {:?}", casted);
        }
   }

}
```

In the example above, we now have a trait called `CreatableAny`, the `create_any` function allows each type implementing `Creatable` to be returned as a `Box<dyn Any>`. Then the `create_and_store_objects` function creates the objects using the `CreatableAny`, and stores it in a Vector. Finally we need to downcast the result using the downcast_ref method on the Any trait to see what is inside each `Box`. This is not as elegant as having a single common type, but this method allows the user to downcast to their specific type as required. Note the `Any` trait requires that the types be static so that it is stored.

This is a pretty detailed breakdown of creating dynamic objects using Rust. It is often used in scenarios where a library or framework needs to generate objects of types defined by the application that uses it, without knowing about them at compile time. Remember, safety and performance are key in Rust. So, while these methods may seem a bit more elaborate, they help maintain those critical aspects.

For further reading, I'd recommend the official *The Rust Programming Language* book which does a great job explaining traits. Also, the *Programming Rust* by Jim Blandy and Jason Orendorff goes into these concepts with practical examples, and the Rust reference documentation, though technical, is indispensable. Lastly, take a look at *Effective Rust* by Jake Goulding, it covers techniques for building performant Rust applications which can provide deeper insight into this style of design.
