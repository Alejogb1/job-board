A one-sided alternative hypothesis, also known as a directional hypothesis, explicitly states the direction of the expected effect. Unlike a two-sided alternative, which simply posits that a population parameter differs from a null value, a one-sided alternative asserts that the parameter is either *greater than* or *less than* that null value. This distinction directly influences the statistical testing process, impacting the calculation of p-values and the interpretation of results.

The fundamental concept hinges on the researcher’s pre-existing knowledge or theory. I've often encountered situations where prior research strongly suggests an effect can only occur in one specific direction. For instance, while evaluating a new drug, if preliminary studies indicate it can only increase a certain physiological marker, a one-sided alternative becomes appropriate. Using a two-sided hypothesis in such scenarios would be wasteful, diluting statistical power by accounting for improbable negative effects.

**Explanation**

In hypothesis testing, we seek to determine if sufficient evidence exists to reject the null hypothesis, denoted as H₀. The null hypothesis typically represents a state of no effect or no difference. The alternative hypothesis, H₁, provides the contrasting claim. A two-sided (non-directional) alternative might be that a treatment *changes* a measured variable: H₁: μ ≠ μ₀. A one-sided (directional) alternative, however, explicitly claims either the variable *increases* or *decreases*: either H₁: μ > μ₀ or H₁: μ < μ₀, where μ is the population parameter and μ₀ is the hypothesized value under the null.

Choosing between one- and two-sided tests requires careful consideration. Using a one-sided test appropriately increases the power to detect an effect in the specified direction, meaning that we're more likely to reject the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, false and the effect exists in the direction we predicted. Conversely, if the true effect is in the opposite direction, a one-sided test cannot detect it. In my practice, misuse of one-sided tests is common, particularly when researchers adjust to achieve a 'statistically significant' result. A one-sided test must be justified a priori based on sound theoretical underpinnings.

The impact on p-values is significant. With a one-sided test, all the probability mass associated with the rejection region is concentrated in a single tail of the distribution. Consider an example of a standard normal distribution with α=0.05. For a two-sided test, we have 0.025 probability in each tail, while for a one-sided test, we have the full 0.05 in just one tail, consequently reducing the magnitude of z-score required to achieve 'statistical significance'. This is why researchers often choose a one-sided alternative—it increases power to reject the null hypothesis.

**Code Examples**

*Example 1: Implementing a one-sided t-test in Python with `scipy.stats`*

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Sample data for Group A (control) and Group B (treatment)
group_a = np.array([75, 78, 82, 79, 81])
group_b = np.array([84, 88, 85, 89, 91])

#Hypothesis: Group B mean is greater than Group A mean
# Calculate t-statistic and p-value for a one-sided test (greater)
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group_b, group_a, alternative='greater')

print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat:.3f}")
print(f"P-value (one-sided): {p_value:.3f}")


#Interpretation:
#If p < 0.05 (significance level), then we have enough evidence to reject the Null and support the hypothesis, that the mean of group B is significantly greater than the mean of group A.
```
*Commentary:*  This example demonstrates the implementation of a one-sided t-test using the `stats.ttest_ind()` function from `scipy.stats`. The key is the argument `alternative='greater'`, which indicates that we are testing the directional hypothesis that the mean of `group_b` is greater than `group_a`. The resulting p-value is the probability of observing such data, or more extreme, under the assumption of the null hypothesis of no difference.

*Example 2: Calculating a one-sided p-value manually using a normal distribution in R*

```R
# Sample means and standard deviations
mean_a <- 75
mean_b <- 85
sd_a <- 5
sd_b <- 5
n_a <- 10
n_b <- 10

# Calculate the pooled standard error
se_pooled <- sqrt( (sd_a^2/n_a) + (sd_b^2/n_b) )
# Calculate t statistic
t_stat <- (mean_b - mean_a) / se_pooled

# Calculate one-sided p-value for a greater hypothesis
p_value <- 1 - pnorm(t_stat)

print(paste("T-statistic:", t_stat))
print(paste("P-value (one-sided):", p_value))

#Interpretation:
#If p < 0.05 (significance level), then we have enough evidence to reject the Null and support the hypothesis, that the mean of group B is significantly greater than the mean of group A.
```
*Commentary:* Here, the code explicitly calculates the t-statistic and then uses the `pnorm` function with `1 - pnorm()` to obtain the p-value for a one-sided test, focusing on the 'greater than' direction. This example clarifies the underlying computation when using a normal approximation.

*Example 3: One-sided Z-test implementation in Python*

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm

# Sample means and standard deviations
mean_a = 75
mean_b = 85
sd_a = 5
sd_b = 5
n_a = 10
n_b = 10


# Calculate pooled standard error
se_pooled = np.sqrt((sd_a**2 / n_a) + (sd_b**2 / n_b))

# Calculate Z statistic
z_stat = (mean_b - mean_a) / se_pooled

# Calculate one sided p-value, in this case with "greater than" hypothesis
p_value = 1 - norm.cdf(z_stat)


print(f"Z-statistic: {z_stat:.3f}")
print(f"P-value (one-sided): {p_value:.3f}")

#Interpretation:
#If p < 0.05 (significance level), then we have enough evidence to reject the Null and support the hypothesis, that the mean of group B is significantly greater than the mean of group A.

```

*Commentary:* This example closely parallels the R example but in python using the norm.cdf function to calulate the cumalative distrubution function and then subtracting by 1 for a greater-than hypothesis. This code clearly mirrors the underlying manual calculations of a one-sided test.

**Conclusion**

The choice between one- and two-sided alternative hypotheses is not trivial. While a one-sided test can boost statistical power when the direction of the effect is firmly established a priori, it presents a risk of bias and can fail to detect unexpected results in the opposite direction. I recommend employing a two-sided test by default, unless there's overwhelming prior evidence or theory to support a directional claim. Proper implementation involves careful consideration of potential biases and a well-defined research question. The key is to pre-specify the hypothesis based on theory or previous experimental evidence, and to be clear about the direction of effect being studied, before data are collected.
