, let’s tackle this. Adjusting loss weights during Keras Tuner training, while not a directly built-in feature as you might find in core Keras training loops, is absolutely achievable, and it often proves crucial when dealing with imbalanced datasets or multi-objective optimization scenarios. I’ve run into this a fair few times during my years building models, particularly when tackling problems where simply minimizing a generic loss wasn’t producing the desired results. The key here is to understand that Keras Tuner’s search procedure focuses on hyperparameter optimization, but we can definitely influence the training process within each trial’s model build. The trick involves leveraging custom training loops or callback mechanisms and injecting your loss weighting logic there.

Before diving into specifics, it's important to recognize that the usual `loss_weights` parameter in Keras `Model.compile()` might not work directly with Keras Tuner in the way we want when using the default tuner implementation. Keras Tuner generally expects a single loss value as feedback for the hyperparameter optimization process; therefore, we need a way to dynamically manipulate the individual losses without affecting that core search mechanism.

Let's look at how we can achieve this. In the following examples, I will provide concrete Python code utilizing tensorflow and Keras, to illustrate the methods for loss weight adjustments within Keras Tuner. I will assume that you are using a `RandomSearch` tuner but the logic can be extended for other types like Hyperband or BayesianOptimization. For best results, consider referencing the Keras documentation and the original papers on the specific tuning algorithm you decide to implement.

**Example 1: Utilizing a Custom Training Loop Within the `build_model` Function**

This approach provides maximum control and flexibility. Here, we circumvent the typical `Model.fit()` and implement our own gradient computation. Inside this function we implement our weighting of different losses and also pass it along with the metrics we want to observe to the tuner. This technique is ideal when loss weights need to change dynamically based on epoch, batch, or any custom criterion.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras_tuner import RandomSearch, HyperModel
import numpy as np

class WeightedLossModel(HyperModel):
    def __init__(self, num_classes, input_shape):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_classes = num_classes
        self.input_shape = input_shape

    def build(self, hp):
        inputs = keras.Input(shape=self.input_shape)
        x = keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=512, step=32), activation='relu')(inputs)
        outputs = keras.layers.Dense(self.num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)
        model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
        return model

    def fit(self, hp, model, x, y, callbacks=None, **kwargs):
        optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=hp.Float("learning_rate", 1e-4, 1e-2, sampling="log"))
        loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
        metrics = [tf.keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy()]
        batch_size = kwargs.get("batch_size", 32)
        epochs = kwargs.get("epochs", 10)
        dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x, y)).batch(batch_size)

        @tf.function
        def train_step(x_batch, y_batch, current_epoch):
          with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            y_pred = model(x_batch, training=True)
            loss_val = loss_fn(y_batch, y_pred)
            weighted_loss_val = loss_val * (0.5 + 0.5 * current_epoch / epochs) # dynamically weighting loss
          gradients = tape.gradient(weighted_loss_val, model.trainable_variables)
          optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
          return weighted_loss_val, y_pred

        for epoch in range(epochs):
            epoch_loss = 0.0
            epoch_accuracy = 0.0
            num_batches = 0

            for x_batch, y_batch in dataset:
              loss_value, y_pred = train_step(x_batch, y_batch, epoch)
              epoch_loss += loss_value.numpy()
              for metric in metrics:
                  metric.reset_state()
                  metric.update_state(y_batch, y_pred)
                  epoch_accuracy += metric.result().numpy()
              num_batches += 1
            epoch_loss = epoch_loss / num_batches
            epoch_accuracy = epoch_accuracy / num_batches
            print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {epoch_loss:.4f}, Accuracy: {epoch_accuracy:.4f}')

            # This is where we inform the tuner about our optimization objective
            tuner.oracle.update_trial(tuner.current_trial.trial_id, {'loss': epoch_loss, 'accuracy': epoch_accuracy})

        return model  # Returning model is important for Keras tuner

# Sample Data
num_samples = 1000
input_shape = (10,)
num_classes = 3
x = np.random.rand(num_samples, *input_shape)
y = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, num_samples)
y = keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes=num_classes)


hypermodel = WeightedLossModel(num_classes=num_classes, input_shape=input_shape)
tuner = RandomSearch(
    hypermodel,
    objective="loss", # Notice we specify the 'loss' metric here as that's what we report to the tuner
    max_trials=3,
    overwrite=True,
    directory="my_dir",
    project_name="my_project"
)

tuner.search(x, y, epochs=3, batch_size=32)
```

In this example, our custom `fit` method allows us to weight the loss differently depending on the current training epoch, a common method for easing a model into complex learning scenarios. This also means that the `objective` in your tuner instance must match the key that you are updating when you call `tuner.oracle.update_trial()` in your custom `fit` function.

**Example 2: Using Callbacks and Dynamic Loss Weights**

A second approach that is sometimes preferable when dealing with an existing model is to pass a callback within the `fit` method implemented in your hypermodel. This approach makes the code more modular. The callback is used to modify the loss before the backward pass begins.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras_tuner import RandomSearch, HyperModel
import numpy as np

class LossWeightCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, start_weight, end_weight, total_epochs):
        super(LossWeightCallback, self).__init__()
        self.start_weight = start_weight
        self.end_weight = end_weight
        self.total_epochs = total_epochs
        self.current_epoch = 0

    def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None):
        self.current_epoch = epoch

    def on_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None):
      current_weight = self.start_weight + (self.end_weight - self.start_weight) * (self.current_epoch / self.total_epochs)
      # This is an example of modifying the loss weight; this method may need to be customized to your specific need
      # You may be better off by implementing a custom loss function as an alternative
      if hasattr(self.model, 'loss'):
        self.model.loss.loss_weight = current_weight # Here we have a fake implementation
                                                        # on how to pass the loss weight to the loss function.

class WeightedLossModelCallback(HyperModel):
    def __init__(self, num_classes, input_shape):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_classes = num_classes
        self.input_shape = input_shape

    def build(self, hp):
        inputs = keras.Input(shape=self.input_shape)
        x = keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=512, step=32), activation='relu')(inputs)
        outputs = keras.layers.Dense(self.num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)
        model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
        # Here we are faking passing an attribute for changing the loss weight
        model.loss.loss_weight = 1.0
        return model

    def fit(self, hp, model, x, y, callbacks=None, **kwargs):
        epochs = kwargs.get("epochs", 10)
        # The parameters below will dictate the progression of the loss weight
        callback = LossWeightCallback(start_weight=0.5, end_weight=1.5, total_epochs=epochs)
        if callbacks is None:
          callbacks = [callback]
        else:
          callbacks.append(callback)
        history = model.fit(x, y, callbacks=callbacks, epochs=epochs, **kwargs)
        # For the tuner to work we must return a specific metric
        return {'loss': history.history["loss"][-1], 'accuracy': history.history["accuracy"][-1]}

# Sample Data
num_samples = 1000
input_shape = (10,)
num_classes = 3
x = np.random.rand(num_samples, *input_shape)
y = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, num_samples)
y = keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes=num_classes)

hypermodel = WeightedLossModelCallback(num_classes=num_classes, input_shape=input_shape)
tuner = RandomSearch(
    hypermodel,
    objective="loss",
    max_trials=3,
    overwrite=True,
    directory="my_dir",
    project_name="my_project"
)

tuner.search(x, y, epochs=3, batch_size=32)
```
In this second approach, our callback dynamically modifies a ficticious loss function's weighting. While this implementation might not directly reflect the real implementation of all loss functions, the logic will hold for when you write your own custom loss functions and then pass them to `model.compile`. This is helpful for cases where you need to incorporate some kind of dynamically changing weight.

**Example 3: Custom Loss Function With Weighting**

Finally, we can use custom loss functions that incorporate weighting, and they can be selected within each `build()` method based on hyper parameters being tuned. The weighting within the loss function itself can still change based on epoch, batch or other criteria. This approach is particularly useful when your specific loss calculation needs to accommodate weighting directly within the loss calculation. This keeps your core training and hyperparameter tuning code clean and allows you to focus on loss weight manipulations inside of a specific module.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras_tuner import RandomSearch, HyperModel
import numpy as np

class WeightedCategoricalCrossentropy(tf.keras.losses.Loss):
  def __init__(self, initial_weight=1.0, name="weighted_categorical_crossentropy"):
    super().__init__(name=name)
    self.weight = tf.Variable(initial_weight, trainable=False, dtype=tf.float32)

  def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
    loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    weighted_loss = loss * self.weight
    return weighted_loss

class CustomLossModel(HyperModel):
    def __init__(self, num_classes, input_shape):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_classes = num_classes
        self.input_shape = input_shape

    def build(self, hp):
        inputs = keras.Input(shape=self.input_shape)
        x = keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=512, step=32), activation='relu')(inputs)
        outputs = keras.layers.Dense(self.num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)
        model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
        loss_function = WeightedCategoricalCrossentropy()
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=loss_function, metrics=['accuracy'])
        return model

    def fit(self, hp, model, x, y, callbacks=None, **kwargs):
        epochs = kwargs.get("epochs", 10)
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            weight = 0.5 + 0.5 * epoch / epochs # Dynamically change the weight
            model.loss.weight.assign(weight)  # Here, we update the loss weight
            history = model.fit(x, y, callbacks=callbacks, epochs=1, **kwargs, verbose=0)
            #print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {history.history["loss"][0]:.4f}, Accuracy: {history.history["accuracy"][0]:.4f}')
            tuner.oracle.update_trial(tuner.current_trial.trial_id, {'loss': history.history["loss"][0], 'accuracy': history.history["accuracy"][0]})

        return model


# Sample Data
num_samples = 1000
input_shape = (10,)
num_classes = 3
x = np.random.rand(num_samples, *input_shape)
y = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, num_samples)
y = keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes=num_classes)

hypermodel = CustomLossModel(num_classes=num_classes, input_shape=input_shape)

tuner = RandomSearch(
    hypermodel,
    objective="loss",
    max_trials=3,
    overwrite=True,
    directory="my_dir",
    project_name="my_project"
)

tuner.search(x, y, epochs=3, batch_size=32)
```

In this example we demonstrate the usage of a custom loss function. This is a clean method, especially for multi-objective optimization problems.

**Recommendations:**
For deeper understanding, consider these resources:
*   **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This provides an excellent theoretical foundation for deep learning.
*   **The Keras documentation:** It provides very detailed usage of all aspects of the Keras API, and it is fundamental to know it well.
*   **TensorFlow documentation:** Similarly, it covers details regarding tf.function and other features of the TensorFlow library.
*   **Research papers on multi-objective optimization**: Understanding techniques like Pareto optimization can help frame loss weighting.

In summary, while Keras Tuner doesn't directly expose loss weight adjustment as a hyperparameter, these techniques (custom training loops, callbacks, and custom loss functions) are effective ways to integrate custom loss weighting strategies into your model training process within the Keras Tuner framework. The approach you choose will ultimately depend on your specific problem and the degree of control you need over your training process. Remember, experimentation and rigorous validation are crucial to finding the ideal setup for your task.
