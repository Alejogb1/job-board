Okay, let's tackle this. I've definitely been down this road before, debugging API calls that weren't quite structured the way I expected. You're looking to pass parameters as a hash within a Rails API GET request, and while it might seem like a quirk, there's a standard way to do it, and it's crucial for a well-structured API.

The fundamental issue stems from how GET requests typically handle parameters: they’re appended to the URL as query parameters. A basic GET request might look like `/users?id=123&name=john`. This works fine for simple key-value pairs, but becomes unwieldy, and frankly, less expressive, when you need to pass nested data structures. Rails, of course, gives us tools to manage this elegantly.

The key to getting this working involves how you structure your query parameters in the request. Instead of trying to send an actual javascript hash object directly, you need to encode it as a string that Rails can interpret, which means making use of specific naming conventions.

For instance, if you want to pass a hash like `{ "filter": { "category": "electronics", "price_range": { "min": 10, "max": 100 } } }`, you can’t just put that entire object as a single query parameter. Instead, we use bracket notation: `filter[category]=electronics&filter[price_range][min]=10&filter[price_range][max]=100`. Rails’ parameter parser will then understand this and construct the hash on the server side as you expect it.

Let's break this down with some concrete code examples, starting with the client side - what you'll be sending.

**Example 1: Generating the Query Parameters in JavaScript**

Let's say you are working with javascript client that needs to make the call:

```javascript
function buildQueryParams(params, prefix = "") {
  let str = [];
  for (let p in params) {
    if (params.hasOwnProperty(p)) {
      let key = prefix ? prefix + "[" + p + "]" : p;
      if (typeof params[p] === "object" && params[p] !== null) {
         str = str.concat(buildQueryParams(params[p], key));
      } else {
          str.push(encodeURIComponent(key) + "=" + encodeURIComponent(params[p]));
      }

    }
  }
  return str;
}


const filterParams = {
    filter: {
        category: "electronics",
        price_range: {
            min: 10,
            max: 100
        }
    }
};


const queryString = buildQueryParams(filterParams).join('&');

console.log(queryString);

const url = `/api/items?${queryString}`

console.log("Generated URL:", url)

// Example of how you might use fetch with this:
// fetch(url)
//   .then(response => response.json())
//   .then(data => console.log(data));

```

This JavaScript function, `buildQueryParams`, recursively handles the nested nature of your hash by creating query string parameters in the format `key[subkey][subsubkey]=value`. The `encodeURIComponent` function is crucial, especially if you need to handle special characters. The resulting url generated will be similar to `/api/items?filter[category]=electronics&filter[price_range][min]=10&filter[price_range][max]=100`

Now, on the Rails side, this structure will be automatically parsed. Let's look at that next.

**Example 2: Accessing the Nested Parameters in Rails Controller**

Here is a simplified Rails controller to handle the request.

```ruby
class ItemsController < ApplicationController
    def index
      puts params[:filter]
       # Example of how to use the filter parameters
        @items = Item.where(category: params[:filter][:category])
                     .where('price >= ?', params[:filter][:price_range][:min])
                     .where('price <= ?', params[:filter][:price_range][:max])
       render json: @items
    end
end
```

In this controller, `params[:filter]` will correctly return a hash. We can access the individual values using hash notation: `params[:filter][:category]`, `params[:filter][:price_range][:min]`, and `params[:filter][:price_range][:max]`. Rails automatically handles the parsing of nested parameters when they are formatted correctly in the query string.

**Example 3: A more complex nested structure:**

Sometimes you need something even more complex, for example when dealing with filters on a complex model.

Here is an example of sending a more complex nested parameter:

```javascript
const complexFilter = {
    filter: {
        category: "books",
        author: {
            name: "Tolkien",
            born: {
                year: 1892,
                place: "South Africa"
            }
        },
        published_date_range: {
             start: "1954-07-29",
             end: "1955-10-20"
        }

    }
}

const complexQueryString = buildQueryParams(complexFilter).join('&');
console.log(complexQueryString);
const complexUrl = `/api/books?${complexQueryString}`
console.log("Complex URL:", complexUrl)

```

And on the server side, in your Rails controller you could then access the parameters in a similar way:

```ruby
class BooksController < ApplicationController
    def index
      puts params[:filter]

      @books = Book.where(category: params[:filter][:category])
      .joins(:author)
      .where("authors.name = ?", params[:filter][:author][:name])
      .where("authors.born_year = ?", params[:filter][:author][:born][:year])
      .where("authors.born_place = ?", params[:filter][:author][:born][:place])
      .where("publication_date >= ?", params[:filter][:published_date_range][:start])
      .where("publication_date <= ?", params[:filter][:published_date_range][:end])
       render json: @books
    end
end
```

This underscores how consistently nested query string parameters are parsed by Rails.

To really solidify your understanding here, I'd suggest taking a look at a few resources:

1.  **"The Rails API" documentation:** The official Rails guides are your best source for in-depth information on parameters handling. Pay specific attention to the sections covering query parameters and nested parameters.
2. **"Programming Ruby" by Dave Thomas:** While this is a broader ruby book, it's fantastic for building an understanding of the core concepts of ruby. The parameter parsing here is essentially Ruby doing its work.
3. **RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax:** Though not rails specific, this is where the standard for query parameters originates and gives you the deeper understanding of the underlying protocols.

In summary, when passing parameters as a hash within a Rails API GET request, you should structure your query string using bracket notation (`[ ]`). This will enable Rails to correctly parse it and reconstruct the nested hash structure within your controller's `params` hash. It is very important to remember that you are not sending a raw javascript object, but rather a string that Rails can understand. This might seem strange at first but will become second nature quickly. Make sure to understand the naming conventions thoroughly and the automatic parsing that Rails provides. It's a core part of building robust and flexible APIs.
