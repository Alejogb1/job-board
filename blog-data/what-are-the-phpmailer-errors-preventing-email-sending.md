Right then, let's tackle this one. I’ve spent more evenings than I care to remember debugging email delivery issues with phpmailer, and it’s a beast that can throw up some pretty varied errors. The core of it usually boils down to a few key areas: server configuration, authentication, and message formatting. It's rarely ever the phpmailer library itself that's faulty— it’s usually something else in the pipeline. Let's explore the common culprits and how I’ve approached resolving them in past projects.

First and foremost, we need to consider the *server configuration* issues. This is where many beginners (and, let's be honest, seasoned devs on bad days) trip up. A typical failure point is the `sendmail` binary path or the usage of a local SMTP server. In some development environments, particularly on windows machines, the default php configuration often doesn't have a proper mail transfer agent (MTA) set up. This results in phpmailer being unable to establish a connection to send mail locally. The error message you’ll often see here involves a failure to open a socket or a timeout during connection attempt.

A solution that I frequently employ in situations where a proper MTA is not available or not desirable is configuring phpmailer to use a remote smtp server, like those provided by google, sendgrid, or mailgun. This involves setting the `isSMTP()` method to `true` and then populating the `smtp` attributes, such as `host`, `port`, `smtpauth`, `username`, and `password` with the proper details. I had a project once where a client insisted on using a hosting provider which had severe email sending limitations from within their shared hosting environment. Using an external SMTP service was the only viable option. The project was a membership system that relied heavily on email notifications, and so, a proper sending mechanism was critical to the functionality.

Here is some sample php code demonstrating this configuration:

```php
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Assumes you are using composer

$mail = new PHPMailer(true); // Passing `true` enables exceptions

try {
    // Server settings
    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_OFF; // Enable verbose debug output (SMTP::DEBUG_SERVER for more)
    $mail->isSMTP(); // Send using SMTP
    $mail->Host = 'smtp.example.com'; // Set the SMTP server to send through
    $mail->SMTPAuth = true; // Enable SMTP authentication
    $mail->Username = 'your_username'; // SMTP username
    $mail->Password = 'your_password'; // SMTP password
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS;   // Enable TLS encryption; `PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS` encouraged
    $mail->Port = 587; // TCP port to connect to, use 465 for `PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS`

    //Recipients
    $mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Mailer');
    $mail->addAddress('recipient@example.com', 'Joe User'); // Add a recipient
    $mail->addReplyTo('info@example.com', 'Information');


    // Content
    $mail->isHTML(true); // Set email format to HTML
    $mail->Subject = 'Test email subject';
    $mail->Body = 'This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>';
    $mail->AltBody = 'This is the plain text version of the email';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Message has been sent';

} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}

?>
```

The important takeaway here is that if you are seeing errors related to 'could not connect to smtp host' or similar, your first point of investigation should be these configuration settings. Often typos in these values are the culprits. Remember to check your firewall if that error persists even with the correct parameters.

Moving on, let's talk about *authentication failures*. Once the server connection is established, phpmailer needs to correctly authenticate against your SMTP server to gain authorization to send an email. Incorrect usernames, passwords or an incorrect security protocol choice, such as not using an encrypted connection, will cause a connection rejection. If your server is configured correctly, but you get errors indicating authentication failure, double-check your credentials. A common mistake is also failing to enable less secure app access in your email provider settings if you are using an smtp server that requires this setting, which is the case for older gmail accounts. Furthermore, if you use two-factor authentication you must generate an app specific password.

Let's look at another practical scenario: a user forgot their password, and the email reset failed to be sent. Here is a demonstration with a specific change in security parameter for a case where a simple secure tls connection was not working:

```php
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';


$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {
    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_OFF;
    $mail->isSMTP();
    $mail->Host = 'smtp.example.com';
    $mail->SMTPAuth = true;
    $mail->Username = 'your_username';
    $mail->Password = 'your_password';
    //Change here to specify SMTPS
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS; // Use SMTPS
    $mail->Port = 465; // Use 465 for SMTPS

    $mail->setFrom('passwordreset@example.com', 'Password Reset');
    $mail->addAddress('user@example.com', 'User Name');

    $mail->isHTML(true);
    $mail->Subject = 'Password Reset Request';
    $mail->Body    = 'Please click the following link to reset your password: <a href="example.com/reset">Reset</a>';
    $mail->AltBody = 'Please click the following link to reset your password: example.com/reset';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Password reset email sent successfully!';

} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Password reset email could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
?>
```

Remember that port 465 should be used when `SMTPSecure` is set to `PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS`, which is crucial for ensuring secure email transmission over an smtps connection.

Finally, *message formatting* also contributes to errors. Issues with the `from`, `to`, and `reply-to` headers or an invalid email subject or body can lead to emails being flagged as spam or even rejected by receiving email servers. Pay careful attention to the email headers and ensure they conform to rfc 5322. This is particularly important when working with content like html, where broken tags can cause problems for email clients. Some providers are very strict about these details to prevent unwanted emails, and incorrectly formatted headers can be automatically filtered.

Here is a final code example highlighting a few key formatting components such as adding attachments and using different content formats. In a past project, clients used to receive the wrong attachment due to an incorrect pathing issue.

```php
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {
    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_OFF;
    $mail->isSMTP();
    $mail->Host = 'smtp.example.com';
    $mail->SMTPAuth = true;
    $mail->Username = 'your_username';
    $mail->Password = 'your_password';
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS;
    $mail->Port = 587;

    $mail->setFrom('account@example.com', 'Account');
    $mail->addAddress('client@example.com', 'Client Name');

    $mail->addAttachment('/path/to/your/file.pdf', 'document.pdf'); // Add attachments
    $mail->addStringAttachment('This is a text attachment', 'text_attachment.txt');
    $mail->isHTML(true);
    $mail->Subject = 'Your Account Statement';
    $mail->Body    = 'Dear Client,<br><br>Please find your monthly account statement attached. <br><br> Regards';
    $mail->AltBody = 'Dear Client,\n\nPlease find your monthly account statement attached.\n\nRegards';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Email with attachment sent successfully';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Email with attachment could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
?>
```

This is not an exhaustive list of problems, but I’ve found these to be the most commonly encountered issues with phpmailer. For anyone looking to understand the intricacies of email protocols, I would highly recommend the following readings: "Internet Email: Protocols, Standards, and Implementation" by David Wood. It’s dense, but it delves deep into the underlying standards. Also, the rfc documents for smtp, mime, and email formatting from the ietf website are invaluable. They are the fundamental specifications and are an important reference to understand the correct standards.

In summary, carefully scrutinize your phpmailer configuration, your SMTP settings, and the format of your emails and you'll be well on the way to achieving reliable email sending with phpmailer. It's a process of systematic debugging rather than some magical fix, and over the years, I’ve come to appreciate the clarity it brings to the often complex domain of email delivery.
