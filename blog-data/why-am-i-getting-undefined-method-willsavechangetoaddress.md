Alright, let's tackle this. Undefined method errors, particularly ones involving active record's change tracking mechanisms, are a frequent source of head-scratching. 'will_save_change_to_address' specifically points to a problem with how active record's change tracking is being accessed in a particular context, usually within a rails application. I've seen this exact error pop up on several projects, and it's almost always related to the version of rails being used and how certain fields or methods are being accessed in models and callbacks.

The fundamental issue stems from Active Record's internal mechanics regarding attribute change detection. In more recent versions of Rails (specifically since Rails 5.0), the way we check if a field will change on saving has changed. Instead of the older `attribute_changed?`, we now have `will_save_change_to_attribute?` and its related variants. The "will_save" prefix is critical here because it checks if the change will persist to the database *after all callbacks are executed*, whereas other change-related methods show the change immediately or upon initial assignment. However, `will_save_change_to_address` doesn’t materialize out of thin air; it’s dynamically generated based on your model’s attributes. When you hit that `undefined method` error, it generally signifies one of the following: you are either accessing this method outside of an ActiveRecord instance (like in a class method) or you are using an older rails version that doesn't support `will_save_change_to_*?`. Let's break down those scenarios and their solutions further.

First, the most common cause is *trying to use a change-tracking method on a non-instance* or static context of your model. Consider the following simplified scenario: we have a `User` model with an `address` attribute, and we’re trying to access its change tracking directly in a class method.

```ruby
# models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def self.check_address_change
    if will_save_change_to_address?
      puts "Address will be changed"
    else
      puts "Address will not be changed"
    end
  end
end

# Somewhere in your code (not within an instance)
User.check_address_change
```

In this instance, running `User.check_address_change` would trigger the `NoMethodError` because you’re calling an instance method (`will_save_change_to_address?`) on the *class* `User`. These change-tracking methods only exist on *instances* of the model—the specific records you retrieve from the database or are about to save. The fix here is to call this method within a scope where you have a valid model instance (an instantiated object, not the class definition), such as within an instance method or a before_save callback:

```ruby
# models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  before_save :check_address_change

  def check_address_change
     if will_save_change_to_address?
       puts "Address will be changed"
     else
       puts "Address will not be changed"
     end
   end
end

# Now, when you update a user
user = User.find(1)
user.address = 'New Address'
user.save # The callback will now execute correctly
```

Secondly, another common culprit is using the method on an attribute that *isn't directly associated with a database column*. If you are attempting to use change tracking on a virtual attribute (defined with `attr_accessor` or similar), you won't have the corresponding `will_save_change_to_*?` method generated. ActiveRecord is designed to provide these methods specifically for database-backed columns.

```ruby
# models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  attr_accessor :formatted_address

  before_save :check_formatted_address_change

    def check_formatted_address_change
      if will_save_change_to_formatted_address?
        puts "Formatted address will be changed" # Will error
      end
    end
end
```

In this scenario `formatted_address` is a virtual attribute and there is no related database column, therefore, `will_save_change_to_formatted_address?` is not generated. To resolve this, you'd have to keep a separate internal state of this change if tracking this change is actually critical.

Finally, it's worth confirming *your Rails version*. Prior to Rails 5, `attribute_changed?` was the typical method used. If you’re encountering the error and are using an older version, the solution isn't to use `will_save_change_to_*?`, but rather the older syntax:

```ruby
# models/user.rb (Rails < 5)
class User < ApplicationRecord
  before_save :check_address_change

  def check_address_change
     if address_changed?
       puts "Address was changed"
     else
      puts "Address was not changed"
    end
  end
end
```

This snippet is for demonstration purposes only if you're running a really old version of Rails. It's strongly suggested to upgrade if this is the case and adapt the syntax to `will_save_change_to_address?` as it is more precise and robust. When dealing with these versioning nuances, always consult the official rails documentation for the relevant version.

To deep dive into these concepts, I recommend reviewing the following resources: "Agile Web Development with Rails" by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson—the bible for rails developers. More specific documentation of interest would include the ActiveRecord module in Rails API documentation, especially for change tracking methods and callbacks. "The Rails 6 Way" by Obie Fernandez, which is now a bit dated but contains valuable principles, can also provide a broader understanding of Rails conventions. Reading the source code of Active Record itself is also an illuminating, albeit advanced, method for grasping the inner workings. Specifically look at the `ActiveRecord::AttributeMethods::Dirty` module. Remember, understanding the underlying principles here—model instantiation, the lifecycle of callbacks, and attribute handling—is key to resolving these types of errors efficiently and building robust applications.
