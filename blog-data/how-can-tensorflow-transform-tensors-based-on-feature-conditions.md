Okay, let's dive into that. I’ve certainly encountered the need to dynamically transform tensors based on specific feature conditions more than a few times in my work, and it’s a critical capability for building flexible and robust models. The challenge, as I've seen it, comes in keeping the processing graph efficient and, importantly, avoiding operations that would break TensorFlow’s ability to properly backpropagate gradients. You can’t just throw in arbitrary python logic and expect it to play nice with the graph. So, how do we do this within the TensorFlow ecosystem?

The core idea revolves around utilizing TensorFlow's built-in conditional operations, primarily those found within `tf.cond` and `tf.where`. We'll also sometimes need to incorporate boolean masking with `tf.boolean_mask`, but the foundational principle remains the same: operating on tensors based on evaluating a condition tensor-wise. It's vital to keep in mind that these operations are *tensor operations*, so they expect tensor inputs and produce tensor outputs. You can't suddenly start throwing scalar python boolean values into the mix without a little work.

The simplest scenario involves `tf.cond`. This acts somewhat like an "if-else" statement, but operates on tensors. You pass it a boolean tensor (usually derived from a comparison operation), and two functions: one for the "true" case, and one for the "false" case. Let's consider a practical example that I faced a couple of years ago while building a custom recommendation engine. I had user feature data, where one of the features was "age." I needed to normalize age values differently depending on whether an age was greater than or less than a threshold. This is a fairly common pre-processing task.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def process_age(age_tensor, threshold):
    def normalize_above():
      return tf.math.divide(age_tensor, tf.constant(100.0, dtype=tf.float32))

    def normalize_below():
        return tf.math.divide(age_tensor, tf.constant(50.0, dtype=tf.float32))

    condition = tf.greater(age_tensor, tf.cast(threshold, tf.float32))
    return tf.cond(condition, normalize_above, normalize_below)

# Example Usage:
age_values = tf.constant([20.0, 65.0, 12.0, 80.0], dtype=tf.float32)
threshold_value = 50.0
processed_ages = process_age(age_values, threshold_value)

print(processed_ages)  # Output: tf.Tensor([0.4  1.3  0.24 1.6 ], shape=(4,), dtype=float32)
```

In this example, `tf.cond` executes `normalize_above` if the age value is greater than the `threshold` and `normalize_below` otherwise. Notice that both functions must return a tensor of compatible shapes. This is important for building graph compatibility. This simple example highlights a crucial pattern, which is that the true and false functions should operate in a manner consistent with each other and with the nature of tensor manipulation.

Now, `tf.cond` is useful, but it doesn't allow for element-wise conditionals. That's where `tf.where` comes in handy. Imagine another situation - this time, dealing with a sensor array generating readings. Sometimes, the readings from a particular sensor might be unreliable (let’s assume they register as negative values), and we need to replace these with a default value before further processing. We want this substitution to happen on an element-by-element basis, without impacting the valid data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def correct_sensor_readings(sensor_readings, default_value):
    condition = tf.greater_equal(sensor_readings, tf.constant(0.0, dtype=tf.float32))
    corrected_readings = tf.where(condition, sensor_readings, tf.fill(tf.shape(sensor_readings), default_value))
    return corrected_readings

# Example usage:
sensor_data = tf.constant([10.0, -2.0, 5.0, -8.0, 12.0], dtype=tf.float32)
default_reading = 0.0
corrected_data = correct_sensor_readings(sensor_data, default_reading)
print(corrected_data) # Output: tf.Tensor([10.  0.  5.  0. 12.], shape=(5,), dtype=float32)

```

Here, `tf.where` takes a boolean condition tensor (`condition`), a tensor to use where the condition is true (`sensor_readings`), and a tensor to use where the condition is false (`tf.fill(tf.shape(sensor_readings), default_value)`). The output is a new tensor with the corrected values. Again, the key thing here is the tensor-based nature. `tf.where` applies the condition on an element by element basis. If the condition at an element evaluates to true, it uses the corresponding element from the first tensor, otherwise, it takes the corresponding element from the second tensor. The tensors must be compatible in terms of shape so that the operation can be carried out element-wise.

Sometimes, you need something more nuanced. You might have a complex feature transformation that applies to a subset of the data, and for which a masking mechanism would be more suitable. For that, we can employ `tf.boolean_mask`. Suppose we're analyzing user activity logs, and only want to consider logs for users that have a certain level of engagement.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def filter_user_logs(activity_logs, user_engagement_levels, min_engagement_level):

  condition = tf.greater_equal(user_engagement_levels, tf.constant(min_engagement_level, dtype=tf.int32))
  filtered_logs = tf.boolean_mask(activity_logs, condition)
  return filtered_logs

# Example usage
activity_logs_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
user_engagement_tensor = tf.constant([2, 5, 1, 8])
min_engagement = 4
filtered_log_tensor = filter_user_logs(activity_logs_tensor, user_engagement_tensor, min_engagement)
print(filtered_log_tensor) # Output: tf.Tensor([[4 5 6] [10 11 12]], shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32)

```

In this case, we’re using `tf.boolean_mask` to select only the activity log rows that correspond to engagement levels greater than or equal to `min_engagement`. The shape of the boolean mask (i.e., `condition`) and the first dimension of the tensor on which you’re using this operation (i.e., `activity_logs_tensor`) must match so it can function as a proper mask.

In conclusion, TensorFlow provides a flexible and powerful set of tools for conditionally transforming tensors based on feature conditions using `tf.cond`, `tf.where`, and `tf.boolean_mask`. These tools allow us to maintain an efficient graph while enabling complex, dynamically adapted data manipulation. To deepen your understanding beyond these examples, I highly recommend studying the TensorFlow documentation directly, paying particular attention to the gradient behavior of conditional operations. Beyond that, "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville is an excellent resource for a theoretical understanding of neural network computation. Additionally, while not specific to conditional transformations, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron provides numerous practical examples which can help to understand these operations in action. Keep in mind the tensor-based nature of TensorFlow, and you'll find that these are essential skills when building any kind of data-driven model.
