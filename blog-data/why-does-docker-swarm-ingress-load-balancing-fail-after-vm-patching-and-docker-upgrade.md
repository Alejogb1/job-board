Alright,  I've actually seen this scenario play out a few times in my career, particularly after large-scale infrastructure maintenance. The problem you’re describing, where Docker Swarm ingress load balancing hiccups after virtual machine patching and docker upgrades, is usually a confluence of factors related to network state, internal service discovery, and the way docker manages updates. It's rarely a single point of failure but more a cascade of subtle issues.

Let's break it down. The core of the issue lies in how Docker Swarm handles routing mesh updates and endpoint reconciliation after changes to the underlying infrastructure. When you patch your VMs, you're essentially triggering a potential network state change. Upgrading docker itself also introduces new software versions which may include changes in how these routing decisions are made. The ingress load balancing in Swarm is achieved through a routing mesh where each swarm node participates in routing requests to services. This routing is based on internal DNS resolution, specific port mapping, and kernel-level networking features.

Here's the scenario as it often unfolds. After patching, individual VM network interfaces might get momentarily disrupted. While the system may appear to recover, the docker daemon on those machines could temporarily lose its connection to the swarm overlay network. This could result in the node falling out of sync with the routing mesh. Furthermore, a docker upgrade can introduce subtle changes to the internal DNS server utilized by swarm (usually embedded), or even modify the way service endpoints are published and discovered. Consequently, once nodes rejoin the swarm, they might not correctly synchronize the updated service endpoints or their routing tables. The result is unpredictable routing of ingress traffic, including failures.

Let’s consider some practical cases where this goes wrong.

*   **Internal DNS issues:** The swarm overlay network relies on an internal DNS server for service discovery. If this server fails to update its records, or if nodes fail to synchronize these updates, then routing of requests to your services fails.

*   **Endpoint reconciliation failure:** Docker swarm needs to reconcile endpoints of services after restart. After a docker upgrade, subtle differences in the new docker daemon may cause this synchronization to fail. This leads to traffic not being correctly routed to service instances.

*   **Inconsistent ingress routing configuration:** Changes during a docker upgrade, or even just subtle differences in the configuration of different nodes, could cause inconsistencies in how ingress is routed. This could include port clashes, stale VIP entries, or other network mismatches.

Now, let's look at some code snippets to illustrate how these problems might manifest and how to address them, keeping in mind these are simplified representations of more complex real-world scenarios.

**Example 1: Checking Swarm Service State and Reconciling Endpoints**

This bash script example demonstrates how to monitor the status of a service in Docker Swarm and force a rolling update, which could help in synchronizing endpoints if an issue is detected after a Docker upgrade or patching.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

service_name="my_service"

# Check service replicas
desired_replicas=$(docker service inspect --format '{{.Spec.Mode.Replicated.Replicas}}' "$service_name")
running_replicas=$(docker service ps --filter "desired-state=running" --format '{{.ID}}' "$service_name" | wc -l)

echo "Desired replicas: $desired_replicas"
echo "Running replicas: $running_replicas"

if [ "$running_replicas" -ne "$desired_replicas" ]; then
    echo "Service replicas mismatch. Attempting rolling update to reconcile..."
    docker service update --force "$service_name"
    echo "Rolling update initiated."
else
    echo "Service replicas match. Service seems healthy."
fi

# optional: check actual service logs if issue is persistent
# docker service logs "$service_name" --since 1m
```

This script will output the current and desired replicas. A mismatch suggests problems. The `--force` flag forces a rolling restart of the service, which triggers a reconciliation of endpoints across the swarm.

**Example 2: Investigating Node Network Connectivity within Swarm**

This example uses `docker node inspect` and filters to view each node’s network interface information, to quickly verify if overlay networks are configured correctly, which would indicate a possible routing issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get all swarm node ids
node_ids=$(docker node ls --format "{{.ID}}")

for node_id in $node_ids; do
  echo "Checking node: $node_id"
  docker node inspect "$node_id" | jq '.[0].Description.Platform, .[0].Status, .[0].Spec.Availability, .[0].ManagerStatus, .[0].Spec.Role, .[0].Description.Engine.Swarm.LocalNodeState, .[0].Description.Engine.Swarm.JoinTokens, .[0].Status.Addr , .[0].Status.State'
  docker node inspect "$node_id" | jq '.[0].Description.Engine.Swarm.NodeAddr, .[0].Description.Engine.Swarm.RemoteManagers, .[0].Description.Engine.Swarm.ClusterInfo, .[0].Spec, .[0].ManagerStatus, .[0].ManagerStatus.Reachability'
  docker node inspect "$node_id" | jq '.[0].Description.Engine.Swarm.ClusterInfo.DataPathAddr'
  echo "--------"
done

# Optional :  Checking routing table in each node can also help identify routing issues, especially network level misconfigurations
# ssh <node_ip> 'ip route'
```

Here, we’re using `jq` to extract specific fields that are vital for identifying node states and any issues related to network connectivity. Look for `Availability`, `State`, `NodeAddr`, `Reachability`, and `LocalNodeState`. Any status other than ‘active,’ ‘ready,’ or ‘reachable’ for these key elements should prompt further investigation of network issues.

**Example 3: Debugging Service Networking by Executing a Test Command**

This example executes a basic `curl` command from within the docker container and shows the output to help assess basic networking and access issues. This helps confirm that the container itself can access the target service, which aids in diagnosing load balancing problems.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

service_name="my_service"
target_container=$(docker ps -q --filter name="${service_name}")
if [ -z "$target_container" ]; then
  echo "No containers found for $service_name"
  exit 1
fi

target_url="http://localhost:8080" # Replace with relevant URL

for container_id in $target_container; do
  echo "Testing connectivity from container: $container_id"
  output=$(docker exec "$container_id" curl -s -I "$target_url" | head -n 1)
  echo "Output for container $container_id: $output"
done
```

This script checks connectivity by running curl directly within the container. Any failure here would point towards the container application’s network configuration or an application issue and not necessarily a Docker Swarm problem.

Now, the key to resolving this kind of issue is a methodical approach. After a disruptive event like patching or an upgrade, start by verifying the health of your swarm nodes (as seen in example two). Are they all active? Are they correctly joined to the swarm? Review Docker daemon logs for any errors. Then, check the service states (as in example one) to confirm all replicas are operational. Finally test the accessibility of your service internally from the container using curls (as in example three) to ensure the application itself is working.

For further understanding, I strongly recommend reviewing the official Docker documentation on swarm mode networking. It's crucial to familiarize yourself with concepts like the ingress routing mesh, the overlay network, and the internal DNS. Also, you might find it useful to delve deeper into papers on distributed systems and consensus algorithms, which underpin the functioning of Swarm's internal workings. Look for research papers or academic publications related to topics like “Gossip Protocol,” “Raft Consensus,” or “Overlay Networking” in distributed systems. These sources give you the underlying principles behind how Swarm does its magic. A book such as "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann can also give great practical knowledge of how such distributed systems work.

In my experience, proactively monitoring swarm health and implementing thorough post-patching procedures significantly mitigates these kinds of problems. It’s often about a blend of understanding the underlying technology and diligently executing good operational practices. The troubleshooting, as I've illustrated with the examples, is quite systematic, so having that workflow solidified will prove highly beneficial.
