Okay, let's untangle this recurrent neural network input shape discrepancy. It's a common point of confusion, and I recall facing similar situations early in my deep learning journey. It's not that your RNN *needs* the third dimension, per se, but rather that it expects the input to be organized in a way that signifies temporal or sequential information. Let's break down why your array is (100, 4) and why the expectation is (100, 4, ?).

The array (100, 4) suggests you have 100 samples or observations, and each sample has 4 features. This, in itself, isn't incorrect for many types of machine learning tasks. However, the crux of the matter with an RNN – especially a vanilla, sequence-based one – lies in the treatment of *sequences*. Think of an RNN as processing data across time. Therefore, the input needs an additional dimension to represent *time steps within each sample*. This is where the question mark in the (100, 4, ?) comes into play. This '?' represents the length of each sequence that your RNN will process, also referred to as the time-step dimension.

To illustrate, let’s imagine a past project where I was working on predicting stock prices. We were using several features, such as opening price, closing price, high, and low, which can be represented by your 4 features. Now, consider we were inputting these prices on a *daily* basis. Here's how this plays out with different sequence lengths.

**Scenario 1: Single Day Input (No Sequence)**

In the very first iteration, let’s say we fed the model one day at a time. We'd effectively be ignoring the time-series nature of the data and just passing in (4,). We had 100 days of training data. Then, our array, before reshaping for the RNN would indeed have a shape of (100, 4), that is, 100 rows (days) of data, with 4 columns representing the features (opening, closing, high, low). Now, this data cannot be used for an RNN directly, since we're not giving it any sequence information.

**Scenario 2: Sequence-Based Input (Sequence Length of 10)**

In our second iteration, we decided we would use the past 10 days for predicting the next day, and we would move this 10-day window forward by 1 day each time. This approach leverages the time-based sequence information and this required us to reshape the data appropriately for RNN input. In this case, we are now training the model by feeding a chunk of 10 consecutive days as an individual data point, that is, a sequence. So, the input shape becomes (100, 10, 4) after we structure our data that way. This would indicate 100 training examples ( sequences of 10 days), each sequence containing 10 timesteps, with 4 features per timestep.

The key takeaway here is that the third dimension is not a mandatory “always needed” dimension; it's a dimension that specifies how many time steps each sample should contain. If you have no sequence information to feed to your RNN then this would be set to 1. If each of your sequences have different lengths, then this third dimension becomes tricky and will be the subject of another discussion on sequence padding.

Let’s transition from this explanation to code.

**Code Snippet 1: Reshaping for Single Timestep RNN**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate 100 samples with 4 features each (your current data)
data_2d = np.random.rand(100, 4)
print(f"Original shape: {data_2d.shape}")

# Reshape to create a sequence of length 1
data_3d_single_timestep = data_2d.reshape(100, 1, 4)
print(f"Reshaped shape for single timestep: {data_3d_single_timestep.shape}")
```

This example shows how to transform your data to a 3d tensor using a reshape with a sequence length of one.

**Code Snippet 2: Reshaping for a Sequence of Length 5**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate 100 days worth of data, with 4 features each
data_2d = np.random.rand(100, 4)

# create an empty array
sequence_length = 5
num_sequences = 100 - sequence_length + 1
data_3d_seq_5 = np.zeros((num_sequences, sequence_length, 4))

# structure our data into 5 day sequences
for i in range(num_sequences):
    data_3d_seq_5[i,:,:] = data_2d[i:i+sequence_length, :]
print(f"Reshaped shape for a sequence of 5 timesteps: {data_3d_seq_5.shape}")

```
Here, we construct a training array with sequence length 5, where each sequence shifts one day at a time.

**Code Snippet 3: Using a Sequence Length of 10, with gaps.**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate 100 days of data, with 4 features
data_2d = np.random.rand(100, 4)
sequence_length = 10
stride = 2
num_sequences = int((100 - sequence_length) / stride) + 1
data_3d_seq_10 = np.zeros((num_sequences, sequence_length, 4))

# here we create 10-day sequences and move by 2 days between sequences
for i in range(num_sequences):
    start = i*stride
    data_3d_seq_10[i,:,:] = data_2d[start:start + sequence_length,:]
print(f"Reshaped shape for a sequence of 10 timesteps with stride 2: {data_3d_seq_10.shape}")
```

Here we demonstrate how we create 10-day sequences, but move 2 days forward each sequence. The number of training sequences is therefore reduced from what we saw in code snippet 2. This approach can be useful to introduce less dependency between training data points.

**Recommendations**

For further understanding, I’d recommend exploring "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, which offers a comprehensive dive into recurrent networks. Another excellent resource would be "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, which provides more practical examples and implementation details using Keras, a popular deep learning library. Also, for a more mathematical focus, I often refer back to "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop, although this can be quite heavy for beginners.

Finally, remember that the correct input shape for your RNN is not something you should force without understanding the *temporal structure* in your data. This third dimension serves to capture the concept of time or sequence within each data instance, and it is not mandatory if your data does not have this time-based dependency. Once you grasp the significance of this temporal aspect, you'll find yourself much more comfortable working with RNNs. This is a common area for people to stumble when starting out, but it is well worth understanding as it is a cornerstone concept in RNNs.
