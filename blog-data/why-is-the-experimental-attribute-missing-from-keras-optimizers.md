Alright, let’s address this question about the absence of an ‘experimental’ attribute in Keras optimizers. It's a point that’s come up a few times in my own work, and I understand the curiosity it sparks. After all, we often see such labels in other parts of the TensorFlow ecosystem, indicating features under active development or with a higher chance of API changes.

To really understand why this specific attribute isn't present in Keras optimizers, we need to consider how Keras and TensorFlow (and, now, JAX and PyTorch) are designed for experimentation, and where that experimentation lives in the framework. It's not so much about a lack of experimental features in optimizers themselves, but rather the way that Keras manages their inclusion and evolution. This is a subtle but crucial distinction.

My background involves a fair bit of model development, particularly in areas like computer vision, and I've used Keras and its various backend options extensively. I recall, specifically, a project a few years back when we were evaluating a cutting-edge optimiser for a complex segmentation task. We were essentially at the bleeding edge, and it brought home the importance of distinguishing between tried-and-tested algorithms and those still in flux. There, we dealt not with a flag but rather the explicit import of unstable and sometimes volatile classes and APIs.

Keras fundamentally works on the principle of providing a high-level, user-friendly interface. It's designed to make common machine learning tasks accessible without needing to delve deep into the specifics of every algorithm's implementation. Optimizers, in this context, are seen as core tools that are generally expected to be stable and reliable. This contrasts with something like a new layer type or a custom loss function, where an ‘experimental’ flag might be more pertinent to highlight potential instability or API changes.

The development of optimizers, especially complex ones that incorporate adaptive learning rates or sophisticated momentum techniques, is an active research area. When novel algorithms are introduced, they’re typically peer-reviewed and undergo rigorous testing. Before reaching the Keras API, they’re often implemented first in more research-oriented backends like TensorFlow or JAX. This allows the researchers and core development teams to iron out any issues before exposing them to the broader user community. So, instead of using an ‘experimental’ flag, what you might see in practice is a slower, more cautious integration process, giving these experimental optimization techniques time to mature.

Here's a thought process around what's happening from a code perspective. In many cases you will find new optimization implementations start life in research papers. The researchers often write a Python implementation as part of that process. When the algorithms are sufficiently vetted, these get incorporated into frameworks like TensorFlow, but often without an 'experimental' tag.

Let me elaborate with a few practical examples in Python and Keras, using some pseudo-code to illustrate the underlying ideas. Suppose researchers develop a very advanced optimization technique they call `AdvancedAdam`.

```python
# Example 1: Pseudo-code showing how an experimental optimizer might be incorporated
# first as a stand-alone class before reaching Keras.

import numpy as np

class AdvancedAdam:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=1e-7):
        self.lr = learning_rate
        self.beta_1 = beta_1
        self.beta_2 = beta_2
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.m = None # First moment vector
        self.v = None # Second moment vector
        self.t = 0


    def initialize_variables(self, shape):
        self.m = np.zeros(shape)
        self.v = np.zeros(shape)

    def apply_gradients(self, params, gradients):
        self.t += 1
        if self.m is None:
             self.initialize_variables(params.shape)

        self.m = self.beta_1 * self.m + (1 - self.beta_1) * gradients
        self.v = self.beta_2 * self.v + (1 - self.beta_2) * gradients**2

        m_hat = self.m / (1 - self.beta_1**self.t)
        v_hat = self.v / (1 - self.beta_2**self.t)

        params = params - self.lr * m_hat / (np.sqrt(v_hat) + self.epsilon)

        return params


```

Here, `AdvancedAdam` is entirely separate from Keras. It’s a standalone class. This is often the development step that happens before integration. If the algorithm proves robust and useful, it might become incorporated into TensorFlow's core libraries.

Now, when it's integrated in a framework, let's say that it might be made available like this:

```python
# Example 2: How the optimizer could appear in TensorFlow before becoming part of Keras

import tensorflow as tf

class AdvancedAdamTensorFlow(tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer):
  # Implementation will be using TensorFlow specific ops, instead of Numpy.
  # ...
  def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=1e-7, name='AdvancedAdamTensorFlow'):
    super().__init__(name=name)
    self._learning_rate = self._build_variable(learning_rate, dtype=tf.float32, name='learning_rate')
    self._beta_1 = self._build_variable(beta_1, dtype=tf.float32, name='beta_1')
    self._beta_2 = self._build_variable(beta_2, dtype=tf.float32, name='beta_2')
    self._epsilon = self._build_variable(epsilon, dtype=tf.float32, name='epsilon')
    self._t = self._build_variable(0, dtype=tf.int64, name='t')

  def build(self, var_list):
    # Method responsible for initialization of parameters.
    # ...

  def apply_gradients(self, grads_and_vars):
    # Method responsible for application of gradients.
    # ...
    pass
```

Note that in the above, this version is tightly coupled to TensorFlow. At this level, it still may not be considered part of Keras. Once fully tested there and considered stable, it will be available in Keras through `tf.keras.optimizers`.

And finally, when it has made its way into Keras, you might use it like this:

```python
# Example 3: How you would use the final optimizer in Keras

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential


model = Sequential([
    Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.AdvancedAdamTensorFlow(learning_rate=0.01, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999)
# Or: optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy training data
x_train = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100, 10), maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
y_train = tf.one_hot(y_train, depth=10)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)
```

Here, the usage is streamlined through the Keras `model.compile` interface. Notice the lack of an `experimental` flag. The maturity is implicit through the integration process into `tf.keras.optimizers`. You would rely on the thorough review the algorithm went through prior to its inclusion.

For understanding more about optimizer algorithms, I'd suggest looking at books like "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, or "Optimization for Machine Learning" by Sra, Nowozin, and Wright. For a deeper dive into the optimization landscape, reading original papers from researchers like Kingma and Ba on Adam or Sutskever et al. on Momentum techniques will be very helpful. Also keep an eye on journals like *JMLR* or *NeurIPS* where new techniques are often published.

In summary, the absence of an ‘experimental’ attribute isn’t because Keras shies away from innovative methods, but rather because of a considered process. New optimizers are generally introduced into a mature, stable API once they’ve demonstrated reliability and robustness through earlier stages in research and development. The framework prioritizes a smooth user experience and assumes its available optimizers are ready to use. You won't find an 'experimental' tag here, because this space favors a steady, well-tested methodology over rapid and potentially volatile development cycles. The development occurs outside of the Keras library itself.
