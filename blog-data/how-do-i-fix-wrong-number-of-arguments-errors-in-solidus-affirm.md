Okay, let's tackle this. I've seen my share of "wrong number of arguments" errors in Solidus, particularly when interacting with external services like Affirm, and they can be a bit of a head-scratcher initially. These errors usually stem from a mismatch between the number of arguments a method expects and the number you're providing during a call. It’s a fundamental issue in programming, and when it’s related to an external library, tracing the problem requires a methodical approach.

Specifically regarding Solidus and Affirm, these errors typically surface when dealing with their API interactions, particularly within payment gateway logic or custom integrations. The crux of the issue often lies in how the data is being formatted or passed when creating authorization tokens, capturing payments, or even when querying transaction status. Often, the structure of data expected by Affirm’s API is not precisely matching what's being passed from Solidus.

My experience includes a particularly memorable project where I was integrating Affirm into a bespoke Solidus application. We had several recurring "wrong number of arguments" issues that seemed inconsistent. After a thorough debugging session, it turned out there were multiple contributing factors, ranging from outdated library versions to misconfigured environment variables. The solution required diving into both the Solidus and the Affirm API documentation, comparing what we *thought* was being sent with what was actually expected.

Let's break this down into common causes and how to resolve them:

**1. Incorrect method signature within custom logic:**

Solidus allows you to customize many aspects of the checkout and payment processing. If you have created a custom payment method, a custom service, or even an override within the existing Solidus Affirm integrations, make sure your methods align with the arguments expected by the underlying libraries, gems, or API calls. A typical scenario is that a method is defined as expecting, say, three parameters, but it’s being called with either two or four parameters.

Here's an example showcasing a hypothetical scenario. Suppose you've customized the `capture` method for Affirm payments, and you might incorrectly be providing more or less parameters than what the underlying logic expects:

```ruby
# Incorrect capture method
class CustomAffirmPaymentCaptureService
  def capture(payment, amount, capture_id)
    # Incorrect because in this made up example, Affirm might only expect payment and amount.
    affirm_capture = Affirm.capture(payment, amount, capture_id)
    # other logic
  end
end

# Corrected capture method based on the (hypothetical) expected behavior
class CorrectedAffirmPaymentCaptureService
  def capture(payment, amount)
    affirm_capture = Affirm.capture(payment, amount)
    # other logic
  end
end
```

In the `CustomAffirmPaymentCaptureService` example, if the underlying `Affirm.capture` method only expects `payment` and `amount`, calling the service with an additional `capture_id` parameter will result in the "wrong number of arguments" error. The corrected version demonstrates how to align the number of parameters to the underlying `Affirm.capture` method.

**2. Mismatched gem or library versions:**

Outdated or mismatched versions of the Solidus Affirm gem or related libraries can lead to API changes that aren't reflected in your codebase. A method might have had a specific signature in one version and a completely different signature in another. The key here is meticulously reviewing the changelogs when you update any related gems.

This can be especially tricky with gem dependencies. It is advisable to start with very specific gem versioning in your Gemfile to lock dependencies down and ensure compatibility. It is also important to be aware of any dependencies that the Solidus Affirm gem relies on. Often the underlying http client can have updates that are not directly related to Affirm itself, but can cause changes.

Here’s an example illustrating how outdated gems might cause issues:

```ruby
# Assume the Affirm gem changed method signature in version x.y.z
# Gemfile.lock shows an older version before x.y.z is used.

# In code, method signature is the old one.
class SomeAffirmInteraction
  def initiate_payment(order_id, user_id, total, currency)
    Affirm.create_token(order_id, user_id, total, currency) # Older version expected this 
  end
end

# After upgrading, Affirm gem might expect an object with all payment information.
# And the function now expects: Affirm.create_token({order_id: order_id, user_id: user_id, total: total, currency: currency})

# Newer version example. This should work:
class UpdatedAffirmInteraction
  def initiate_payment(order_id, user_id, total, currency)
    Affirm.create_token({order_id: order_id, user_id: user_id, total: total, currency: currency}) # newer version expects the parameters wrapped in a hash
  end
end
```

In this case, the initial `SomeAffirmInteraction` class expects individual parameters whereas the new Affirm gem requires the parameters to be passed as a hash object. Updating and reconfiguring the code to match the version is necessary to avoid the “wrong number of arguments” issue.

**3. Incorrect API calls with data mapping issues:**

Affirm, like many other APIs, expects data to be provided in a very specific format – often as a JSON payload. If you're constructing your request data incorrectly, or if you are failing to send all expected fields or sending unexpected fields, you may hit the "wrong number of arguments" error, although, in this case, it's indirectly a misconfiguration because you are not giving the API what it expects.

Let’s look at another example involving creating an authorization token:

```ruby
# Example with incorrect data mapping, perhaps from a different API reference or assumptions.
class IncorrectAffirmTokenService
  def create_auth_token(order, customer)
    payload = {
      order_number: order.number,
      customer_email: customer.email,
      amount: order.total
      # Hypothetical: missing the required "currency" field in the payload
    }

    response = Affirm.create_authorization_token(payload) # This might result in "wrong number of arguments" on affirm side
  end
end


# Example with correct data mapping, based on Affirm's expected payload structure.
class CorrectAffirmTokenService
  def create_auth_token(order, customer, currency = 'USD')
    payload = {
      order_number: order.number,
      customer_email: customer.email,
      amount: order.total,
      currency: currency # Now we have currency, which might be required by the Affirm api.
    }
    response = Affirm.create_authorization_token(payload)
  end
end
```

Here, the initial `IncorrectAffirmTokenService` is missing the `currency` key, which may be required by the `Affirm.create_authorization_token` method. The corrected `CorrectAffirmTokenService` adds the `currency` parameter to the payload ensuring the Affirm method receives the proper data to complete the request without a "wrong number of arguments" error.

**Debugging Strategies**

*   **Examine stack traces thoroughly:** When the error occurs, the full stack trace can show precisely where the issue arises, enabling you to narrow it down to the problematic method call.
*   **Use logging effectively:** Log data and method calls just before interacting with the Affirm API. Inspecting these logs can reveal the data format and parameter numbers in real time.
*   **Review official Affirm API documentation:** Regularly refer to the most recent documentation provided by Affirm. Their API is subject to change, and it's essential to have the most up-to-date information. I highly recommend using their developer portal and official API guides.
*   **Utilize Solidus's debug tools:** Solidus includes various debugging mechanisms. Leverage these to inspect the parameters being passed to your custom logic.

**Recommended Resources:**

*   **Affirm's Developer Documentation:** Refer to Affirm's official developer documentation.
*   **Solidus Official Documentation:** It is essential to be comfortable with Solidus's core mechanisms. You'll often find hints on debugging, or areas to be mindful of.
*   **"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler:** A cornerstone resource for writing clean, understandable code. This book helps avoid unnecessary complexity that may lead to hard to detect parameter problems.
*   **"Working Effectively with Legacy Code" by Michael Feathers:** If you are working with an older Solidus setup, this book will be invaluable in safely modifying existing code, particularly during library upgrades.

In summary, fixing "wrong number of arguments" errors in Solidus Affirm requires meticulousness. The steps include verifying the function call itself, ensuring gem versions are compatible, and validating that your data mappings are aligned with Affirm's API specifications. Through systematic debugging and by using these recommended resources, these errors can be addressed efficiently.
