,  I've seen this issue pop up quite a few times, especially when developers are transitioning from word-based embeddings to document-based ones. The frustration is understandable; you're expecting the doc2vec object to behave similarly to its word2vec cousin, and then boom, those familiar methods are just…gone. It’s not a bug, per se, but rather a fundamental difference in how these models are structured and intended to be used.

The key discrepancy lies in the underlying mathematical representation. Word2vec, at its core, represents individual *words* as vectors within a high-dimensional space. Similarity between words is therefore a function of their vector proximity. Calculating cosine similarity, for example, becomes a relatively straightforward operation involving simple vector arithmetic on those word vectors. The methods like `n_similarity`, and `most_similar` are specifically built around the idea of measuring distances between those word-level vectors.

Doc2vec, or paragraph vectors as Mikolov et al. initially termed it in their 2014 paper "Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents”, extends this concept, but at the *document* level, or as an extension to represent paragraphs of text, rather than specific single words. This doesn't simply mean averaging the word vectors of a document; rather, during the training phase, the model learns a separate vector representation for each document *in conjunction* with the word vectors. Thus, the document vectors themselves have no associated internal composition based on underlying word vectors after the training is complete. They’re independent, learned parameters.

What this means, practically, is that while both word2vec and doc2vec are generating vectors, the context and nature of those vectors are different. With doc2vec, it's not about calculating the similarity *between* the document vector and other vector components. The vectors are not designed to have direct similarity with underlying word embeddings. Consequently, the methods that are tailored for word-vector comparisons aren't directly transferable without modification. The original doc2vec models have focused instead on inference of vectors for unseen documents and similarity between these document vectors.

Here’s the catch: while the direct methods aren't there, that *doesn't* mean you can't calculate document similarities. You just have to do it more explicitly. The doc2vec model still provides you with the document vectors themselves through something like `model.dv` (document vectors), and you're then free to employ standard vector similarity metrics, such as cosine similarity, on these document vectors.

Let's illustrate with some code. We'll use gensim, a common and solid choice for these models, because it’s robust, well-documented, and I've used it in various projects:

```python
from gensim.models.doc2vec import Doc2Vec, TaggedDocument
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np


# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
documents = [
    "This is the first document.",
    "The second document is here.",
    "Another document example.",
    "The first document again."
]

# Prepare data for doc2vec
tagged_docs = [TaggedDocument(words=doc.split(), tags=[str(i)]) for i, doc in enumerate(documents)]


# Train a doc2vec model
model = Doc2Vec(tagged_docs, vector_size=10, window=2, min_count=1, epochs=20)


# Example 1: Obtaining a document vector
doc_id = '0' # String representation, not index!
vector = model.dv[doc_id]

print(f"Vector for document ID '{doc_id}': {vector[:5]}...")

# Example 2: Calculating cosine similarity between two document vectors

doc_id1 = '0'
doc_id2 = '1'

vec1 = model.dv[doc_id1]
vec2 = model.dv[doc_id2]
similarity = cosine_similarity(vec1.reshape(1,-1), vec2.reshape(1,-1))[0][0]

print(f"Cosine similarity between documents {doc_id1} and {doc_id2}: {similarity}")

# Example 3: Calculating similarity of new, unseen data.
new_doc = "This is a completely new document."
new_vector = model.infer_vector(new_doc.split())

# Similarity of new document with doc_id2
new_doc_similarity = cosine_similarity(new_vector.reshape(1,-1), vec2.reshape(1,-1))[0][0]
print(f"Similarity between new document and document {doc_id2}: {new_doc_similarity}")
```

In this snippet, you'll observe that we don't use the `n_similarity` or `most_similar` directly on the `model` object as we would with word2vec. Instead, we retrieve the document vectors from `model.dv` and then explicitly use `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity` to compare them. `infer_vector` can be used to infer vectors of new, unseen documents. This explicit approach allows us to perform the desired calculations.

Now, sometimes you will find yourself wanting more advanced document similarity metrics beyond simple cosine similarity. In that case, you might consider exploring methods outlined in papers such as "Learning Deep Structured Semantic Models for Web Search using Clickthrough Data" by Huang et al. (2013), which introduces more advanced representation learning techniques. For a deeper dive into the theoretical underpinnings of document embeddings, I also recommend examining the original Doc2Vec paper by Mikolov et al.. These provide valuable insight into the nuances of vector representation.

The critical point to take away here is that the missing methods are not an oversight; they are absent due to the fundamental differences between word-level and document-level vector representations. Doc2vec is not meant for measuring the similarity between a single document and words; it’s meant to be used with the document vectors directly. You have the freedom to choose the similarity metrics yourself, and this is in fact usually beneficial, as it allows you to tailor the analysis to suit the task you are trying to address.

I've personally encountered this issue on a project dealing with topic clustering of research papers. I was initially perplexed by the lack of expected methods but quickly realised that using the doc vectors directly coupled with cosine similarity was the correct approach. After that it just clicked and the similarity matching performed as anticipated. It just requires understanding the core functionality and how the model is designed, and then constructing your comparison methods accordingly. Don't be discouraged, understanding these design choices can make you a much stronger developer in the long run.
