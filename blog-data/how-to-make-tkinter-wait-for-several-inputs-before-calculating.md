Alright, let's tackle this. I remember a project back in my early days, a data analysis tool where users had to input several parameters before the heavy lifting could begin. We used tkinter for the gui, and the initial naive implementation would try to run calculations after each input field changed. That wasn't going to work, was it? So, figuring out how to make tkinter wait for all the necessary inputs before triggering the computation became crucial. The core problem is that tkinter’s event loop reacts to each user interaction individually, not as a batch. We need a way to collect all the required input values and *then* process them. There are a few elegant ways to manage this; the ideal approach usually depends on the specific complexity of your application.

Let's start by outlining the fundamental issue. Tkinter widgets fire off events constantly – a button press, text entered into a box, a selection made in a list. These events are picked up by tkinter’s mainloop and trigger bound functions, or callbacks. Now, suppose our computation requires values from multiple entry fields. The straightforward method of attaching a callback to each field’s `<keyrelease>` event, for instance, will trigger the computation with *every* keystroke in *every* field, resulting in lots of unnecessary and probably incomplete computation cycles. We need to accumulate these values.

One simple approach is to leverage the button’s command callback as our trigger point. We ensure all the input fields are populated and then trigger the calculation only when the user clicks the button. The key here is to use `get()` methods on the input widgets to retrieve the current values *only* within the button's command function, not during each input event.

```python
import tkinter as tk

def calculate_data():
    try:
        input1 = float(entry_1.get())
        input2 = float(entry_2.get())
        input3 = float(entry_3.get())
        result = (input1 + input2) * input3
        result_label.config(text=f"Result: {result}")
    except ValueError:
        result_label.config(text="Invalid input")

window = tk.Tk()

tk.Label(window, text="Input 1:").grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=tk.W)
entry_1 = tk.Entry(window)
entry_1.grid(row=0, column=1)

tk.Label(window, text="Input 2:").grid(row=1, column=0, sticky=tk.W)
entry_2 = tk.Entry(window)
entry_2.grid(row=1, column=1)

tk.Label(window, text="Input 3:").grid(row=2, column=0, sticky=tk.W)
entry_3 = tk.Entry(window)
entry_3.grid(row=2, column=1)

calculate_button = tk.Button(window, text="Calculate", command=calculate_data)
calculate_button.grid(row=3, column=0, columnspan=2)

result_label = tk.Label(window, text="")
result_label.grid(row=4, column=0, columnspan=2)

window.mainloop()
```

This code snippet effectively handles the multiple inputs. The `calculate_data()` function will only execute when the user clicks the "Calculate" button and all three entry fields will provide values at that time. It checks, with `try/except` for any non-numerical input, and handles such cases gracefully by displaying "Invalid Input". This is the most straightforward approach and generally serves well for scenarios with a small and predefined number of inputs.

However, what if your application has a more dynamic set of input fields, or you require more complex validation before running the calculations? Then, we can introduce a mechanism to track input field readiness before activating the calculate function. One way to do this is by disabling the calculate button until all fields contain valid data.

```python
import tkinter as tk

def validate_input(event):
    try:
        float(event.widget.get())
        event.widget.config(bg="white") # reset background color on valid input
    except ValueError:
        event.widget.config(bg="red") # set background color on invalid input
        return False
    enable_calculate_if_ready()
    return True

def enable_calculate_if_ready():
    all_valid = all(validate_input(tk.Event(widget=entry)) for entry in entries) # create dummy event for validation checks
    calculate_button.config(state=tk.NORMAL if all_valid else tk.DISABLED)


def calculate_data():
    inputs = [float(entry.get()) for entry in entries]
    result = sum(inputs)
    result_label.config(text=f"Result: {result}")

window = tk.Tk()

labels = ["Input 1:", "Input 2:", "Input 3:", "Input 4:"]
entries = []

for i, label_text in enumerate(labels):
    tk.Label(window, text=label_text).grid(row=i, column=0, sticky=tk.W)
    entry = tk.Entry(window)
    entry.grid(row=i, column=1)
    entry.bind("<FocusOut>", validate_input) # validate on unfocus
    entries.append(entry)

calculate_button = tk.Button(window, text="Calculate", command=calculate_data, state=tk.DISABLED)
calculate_button.grid(row=len(labels), column=0, columnspan=2)


result_label = tk.Label(window, text="")
result_label.grid(row=len(labels) + 1, column=0, columnspan=2)

window.mainloop()
```

In this example, I introduced a validation function, `validate_input`, that is triggered when an input field loses focus. This function checks whether the entered value is a valid number and modifies the input field’s background to visually indicate valid and invalid entries. It also updates button activation based on all fields.

Now, let's imagine our system requires asynchronous validation or some sort of network call before proceeding. Here, we can’t immediately validate inputs and instead need to make a callback to validate the data. Using a slightly different approach, we can queue up calculations rather than waiting for a button press. This can be helpful in scenarios where the inputs are continuously being updated, and a 'calculate' process needs to happen when the conditions are met. Here, we can implement an 'observer pattern' to manage the state of input fields.

```python
import tkinter as tk
import time
from threading import Thread

def validate_input(event, field_id):
    try:
        value = float(event.widget.get())
        event.widget.config(bg="white") # reset background color on valid input
        input_data[field_id] = value
        update_queue()
    except ValueError:
       event.widget.config(bg="red") # set background color on invalid input
       input_data[field_id] = None  # Invalidate data if input is invalid
       update_queue()

def update_queue():
    if all(value is not None for value in input_data.values()):
        if not processing_calculation:
           run_calculation_async()

def run_calculation_async():
    global processing_calculation
    processing_calculation = True
    calculation_thread = Thread(target=calculate_data)
    calculation_thread.start()

def calculate_data():
    time.sleep(2) # simulate calculation process
    total = sum(input_data.values())
    result_label.config(text=f"Result: {total}")
    global processing_calculation
    processing_calculation = False


window = tk.Tk()

input_data = {}
processing_calculation = False
labels = ["Input 1:", "Input 2:", "Input 3:"]
entries = []

for i, label_text in enumerate(labels):
    tk.Label(window, text=label_text).grid(row=i, column=0, sticky=tk.W)
    entry = tk.Entry(window)
    entry.grid(row=i, column=1)
    entry.bind("<FocusOut>", lambda event, idx=i: validate_input(event, idx)) # Pass field ID
    entries.append(entry)
    input_data[i] = None # Initialize data as None

result_label = tk.Label(window, text="")
result_label.grid(row=len(labels), column=0, columnspan=2)

window.mainloop()

```
Here, we’ve decoupled the calculation logic into a separate thread. The `validate_input()` function also stores the validated input values into a dictionary, and updates the queue to begin processing if all data is available. This asynchronous approach ensures the GUI remains responsive even when the calculations take time.

Now, concerning resources for you: *Programming in Python 3, 2nd Edition* by Mark Summerfield is excellent for deep-diving into Python’s core functionalities; for more GUI-specific development, *Tkinter GUI Application Development Hotshot* by Bhaskar Chaudhary can prove quite helpful. For deeper insights into asynchronous programming paradigms, I highly recommend checking out *Concurrency in Go* by Katherine Cox-Buday or *Effective Java* by Joshua Bloch, as these texts, despite being language-specific, provide core concepts that are universally applicable.

These examples and ideas should cover the primary methods needed to handle tkinter input waits. Depending on your use-case, it could be a combination of these, or more intricate design patterns, but the foundations are the same. Start with simple button-based approach for initial clarity. Remember, careful planning of your gui event interactions will eliminate unexpected behaviors and create a more robust and responsive application. Good luck!
