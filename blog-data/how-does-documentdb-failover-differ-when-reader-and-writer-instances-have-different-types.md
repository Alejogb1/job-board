, let's unpack this. The question touches on a critical area in distributed database systems, and specifically how failover behaves when the read and write endpoints (instances) in a DocumentDB setup aren’t homogenous. It's something I've encountered more than once in the field, and the devil, as they say, is often in the details.

Frankly, the ‘standard’ failover scenario – where all instances are identical – is relatively straightforward. We’re swapping out a failing instance with a healthy one of the same type, ensuring minimal service disruption and hopefully, data consistency. However, when reader and writer instances are architecturally disparate, things get… nuanced. We're no longer just replacing a component; we're potentially dealing with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and data access paths that impact failover procedures. Let's dive into how.

First, consider a scenario I faced at a previous firm. We had a legacy DocumentDB system, where the 'writer' instance, responsible for all transactional writes, was a beefy server with significant memory and storage—optimized for heavy-duty write operations. Meanwhile, the ‘reader’ instances, deployed in a separate cluster, were scaled out to handle read-heavy workloads. These reader instances were optimized for query performance and had a somewhat reduced storage footprint. This type of architecture isn’t unusual; you often find this read-optimized setup to improve performance at scale.

The key difference during a failover event here comes down to the *role* of the new ‘writer’ instance. If the primary writer fails, one of the reader instances might be promoted to take its place. This promotion isn't as simple as swapping labels. The reader instance is unlikely to have the same resources or optimal configuration as the original writer. This can lead to performance bottlenecks, specifically in transactional writes. Moreover, the failover mechanism has to adjust to the new architecture, which, due to initial architectural differences, may initially be poorly equipped to handle the primary write tasks. The failover mechanism now not only has to ensure service continuity, but also manage the functional differences.

Now, what does this look like in a more technical, code-oriented context? Let's imagine a simplified representation using pseudo-code (since actual DocumentDB failover logic is far more complex and proprietary) to illustrate the problem:

**Snippet 1: Basic Failover (Homogenous Instances)**

```python
# Assumes instances have the same 'type' and resource profile

class DocumentDBInstance:
    def __init__(self, instance_id, is_writer=False, status="healthy"):
        self.instance_id = instance_id
        self.is_writer = is_writer
        self.status = status

    def set_status(self, status):
      self.status = status

def failover_homogenous(instances, writer_id):
    for instance in instances:
       if instance.instance_id == writer_id:
         instance.set_status("failed")

    # Find a healthy instance and promote it to writer
    for instance in instances:
      if instance.status == "healthy":
         instance.is_writer = True
         print(f"Instance {instance.instance_id} promoted to writer.")
         return instance

    return None # No suitable instance found.
    
# Example usage
instances = [
    DocumentDBInstance("instance_1", is_writer=True),
    DocumentDBInstance("instance_2"),
    DocumentDBInstance("instance_3")
]

new_writer = failover_homogenous(instances, "instance_1")
if new_writer:
   print(f"New writer instance ID: {new_writer.instance_id}")
else:
    print("Failover failed")

```

This first code segment demonstrates an idealized scenario of homogenous instances, making failover extremely straightforward. A replacement writer is selected and the system can continue operating.

Now, let’s see what happens when we introduce different types of instances.

**Snippet 2: Failover with Reader/Writer Distinction**

```python
# Now we have different Instance types (WriterInstance, ReaderInstance)

class DocumentDBInstance:
  def __init__(self, instance_id, status="healthy"):
    self.instance_id = instance_id
    self.status = status

  def set_status(self, status):
    self.status = status

class WriterInstance(DocumentDBInstance):
    def __init__(self, instance_id, is_writer=True, status="healthy"):
       super().__init__(instance_id, status)
       self.is_writer = is_writer

class ReaderInstance(DocumentDBInstance):
    def __init__(self, instance_id, is_writer=False, status="healthy"):
        super().__init__(instance_id, status)
        self.is_writer = is_writer


def failover_heterogenous(instances, writer_id):
   for instance in instances:
       if isinstance(instance, WriterInstance) and instance.instance_id == writer_id:
            instance.set_status("failed")
            break

    # First attempt: Find a backup writer (assuming we have one)
   for instance in instances:
       if isinstance(instance, WriterInstance) and instance.status == "healthy":
            instance.is_writer = True
            print(f"Writer instance {instance.instance_id} promoted to primary.")
            return instance

   # If no backup writer, promote a reader (if we must!)
   for instance in instances:
     if isinstance(instance, ReaderInstance) and instance.status == "healthy":
          instance.is_writer = True
          print(f"Reader instance {instance.instance_id} promoted to primary (with caveats).")
          return instance

   return None # No suitable instance found.

# Example usage
instances = [
  WriterInstance("writer_1"),
  ReaderInstance("reader_1"),
  ReaderInstance("reader_2")
]

new_writer = failover_heterogenous(instances, "writer_1")

if new_writer:
  print(f"New writer instance ID: {new_writer.instance_id}")
else:
    print("Failover failed")
```

This snippet illustrates the key difference. We now have to check the instance *type* during failover. Ideally, we'd promote another `WriterInstance`. If that's not available, we have to use a `ReaderInstance` as a stopgap. This second example has logic to check for a healthy writer first, and if none exists, it promotes a reader to a writer. In a real world system, it’s imperative to log and alert on this promotion of a reader because this represents a reduction in service quality compared to the prior configuration.

Finally, we must consider the steps involved in reconfiguring a system with a reader instance as the new writer.

**Snippet 3: Reader to Writer Reconfiguration**
```python
class WriterInstance(DocumentDBInstance):
  def __init__(self, instance_id, is_writer=True, status="healthy", write_buffer_size=1000):
       super().__init__(instance_id, status)
       self.is_writer = is_writer
       self.write_buffer_size = write_buffer_size

class ReaderInstance(DocumentDBInstance):
    def __init__(self, instance_id, is_writer=False, status="healthy", read_buffer_size=500):
        super().__init__(instance_id, status)
        self.is_writer = is_writer
        self.read_buffer_size=read_buffer_size

def promote_reader_to_writer(reader_instance, desired_write_buffer_size=1000):
    if not isinstance(reader_instance, ReaderInstance):
        raise ValueError("Must be a ReaderInstance to promote.")
    
    print(f"Starting reconfiguration for {reader_instance.instance_id}")
    
    # Simulate the steps needed to reconfigure a reader to become a writer
    # This is a HIGHLY simplified version for illustrative purposes!

    #1.  Expand resource limits (e.g., allocated buffer sizes)
    reader_instance.read_buffer_size = desired_write_buffer_size

    #2.  Enable writer capabilities and adjust access control settings
    reader_instance.is_writer=True

    #3.  Replication configuration update
    print(f"Reconfiguration complete. Reader {reader_instance.instance_id} promoted to writer.")

# Example Usage
reader = ReaderInstance("reader_instance_1")
promote_reader_to_writer(reader, desired_write_buffer_size=1500)
print(f"New write buffer size: {reader.read_buffer_size}")

```
This third snippet demonstrates, in a simplified manner, the process by which a reader is reconfigured for writer capabilities during a failover event. This could include actions like reallocating system resources such as buffer sizes, updating access control rules and initiating replication.

From my experiences, I'd advise the following:

1.  **Explicit Instance Types:** Don't rely on conventions. Implement mechanisms to clearly distinguish between different instance types. This is crucial for both failover and monitoring.
2.  **Prioritized Failover:** Prioritize failing over to a like-for-like instance type, if available. This avoids the performance and functional degradation of using a less than ideal node.
3.  **Automated Reconfiguration:** If promotion of a dissimilar type is necessary, have a robust process in place for reconfiguration. This might involve parameter adjustments, security configuration changes, and so on.
4.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** It's crucial to detect such scenarios promptly. If failover happens and the system operates with a downgraded type of writer, an alert should be raised.
5.  **Data Replication Check:** Make certain your replication mechanisms take into account that the new writer may have a different configuration, to guarantee transactional integrity.
6.  **Regular Testing:** Regularly test your failover mechanisms to ensure they operate correctly, even when the instances aren't homogeneous.

For further reading, I recommend looking at the seminal work “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” by Martin Kleppmann, which offers detailed insight into distributed data systems and failover mechanisms. Another excellent resource is “Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design” by George Coulouris, et al., which covers fundamental concepts of distributed systems that are directly relevant to DocumentDB architectures. For a deeper dive on distributed database concurrency and reliability, I recommend research papers from database conferences such as VLDB and SIGMOD.

In summary, while document databases offer immense flexibility, dealing with heterogeneous reader/writer instances during failover requires careful planning, robust code and constant monitoring. Neglecting these factors can lead to performance bottlenecks and data inconsistencies. The key is understanding the architectural nuances and implementing a failover strategy that accounts for them.
