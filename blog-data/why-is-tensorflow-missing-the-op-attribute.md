Let's jump right in. I’ve certainly encountered that puzzling situation a few times over the years, especially when working with custom TensorFlow operations. The absence of a direct 'op' attribute on TensorFlow tensors, or rather, the often assumed expectation of such, stems from the way TensorFlow abstracts its computational graph and manages operation execution. It's not a straightforward 'thing that's just missing,' but a conscious design choice, rooted in how TensorFlow handles symbolic tensors.

See, when you interact with TensorFlow, especially in the earlier versions and even some aspects of the newer `tf.function` workflow, you're largely dealing with symbolic tensors. These aren't immediate numerical results, but rather placeholders that represent the output of operations within a computational graph. They carry metadata about where in the graph they originate, their shape, their data type, but they're *not* directly tied to the specific operation that created them in a way that is directly accessible via an 'op' attribute in the manner that some might expect. This can be a little counter-intuitive if you're coming from a more eager execution environment.

In a more traditional framework, an operation might immediately evaluate and return an object containing both the result and possibly some metadata about the operation. TensorFlow's graph-based approach decouples operation definition from execution, enabling optimizations like graph pruning, parallel execution, and distributed training, where symbolic representation is key. This is a trade-off: less immediate operation visibility for superior performance and flexibility.

Instead of a direct 'op' attribute, TensorFlow relies on the graph itself and other mechanisms. When you call `tf.add(a, b)`, you’re creating a node in the graph, and that node represents an addition operation. The resulting tensor, say `c = tf.add(a, b)`, encodes that origin within TensorFlow's internal structures. You can't access the direct operation that created `c` as a property called `c.op`, that doesn't exist on the tensor object itself. The node representing the addition is recorded elsewhere in the computational graph.

This often manifests when users try to introspect their computations, perhaps debugging a custom gradient or a more complex network. The intuitive idea of asking a tensor “how were you born” by looking for an ‘op’ doesn't work. The information is there, but not in that readily available form.

Let’s explore this further with some examples.

**Example 1: Basic Tensor Operations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(5.0)
b = tf.constant(2.0)
c = tf.add(a, b)
d = tf.multiply(c, a)

print(a)
print(c)
print(d)
# print(c.op) # This would cause an AttributeError
print(type(c)) # <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.EagerTensor'> for eager mode

# trying to reach a source op through graph structures is verbose and cumbersome in graph mode
# especially since the result itself isn't holding this information
```

Here, `c` represents the symbolic output of the `tf.add` operation. It holds the result, and importantly, it carries the lineage within the graph, but it doesn’t have a `c.op` attribute you can access. The result is an `EagerTensor` (when eager mode is on), or a tensor representing part of the computational graph when in graph mode. This emphasizes that the core of TensorFlow is symbolic execution, regardless of whether eager mode is enabled for simpler debugging and immediate results.

**Example 2: Gradient Calculation**

This becomes even clearer when we deal with gradients:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = x * x * 2.0
  z = tf.math.sin(y)

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)

print(dz_dx)
# print(y.op)  # Again, this will raise an error

print(type(dz_dx)) # <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.EagerTensor'>
```

We're computing a gradient here, and again, the intermediate tensors like `y` do not carry a direct reference to the operation that created them. The `GradientTape` tracks the operations, but the output tensors only carry data and location in the graph. Even `dz_dx` which results from derivative calculation doesn't expose the individual derivative operations directly via an `.op` attribute. The gradient calculation is itself an operation performed on the graph, which results in a new tensor. The important takeaway here is that the flow of tensors through the graph doesn't make their source operation directly accessible in this way.

**Example 3: Custom Layer and Operation**

And finally, custom components follow the same principle:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
      super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
      self.units = units
      self.w = self.add_weight(name="kernel", shape=[1,units])


    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

layer = CustomLayer(units=10)
input_data = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]])
output_tensor = layer(input_data)
print(output_tensor)
# print(output_tensor.op) # Attribute error again


print(type(output_tensor)) #<class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.EagerTensor'>
```

Even with custom layers and operations, the `output_tensor` produced by the call method doesn't have an 'op' attribute, although it is produced by a custom `tf.matmul` op.  The `layer` instance holds state (weights), but the actual matrix multiplication result is just that: a result. The `call` function generates graph elements, but the resulting tensors are again symbolic representations, not carrying the immediate source operation directly as a property.

For further detailed understanding of TensorFlow’s graph execution model, I'd suggest looking into the original TensorFlow paper, *TensorFlow: A System for Large-Scale Machine Learning* by Abadi et al. That paper clarifies many of the design choices around the symbolic graph execution that ultimately lead to this very scenario. In addition, exploring the TensorFlow documentation on graph building and execution, specifically the `tf.Graph` and `tf.function` sections is very informative. Also, the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron, while not deeply technical, provides a good applied overview and explains those concepts in a way that's readily understandable. Understanding these aspects of TensorFlow's design helps resolve the 'missing op' puzzle. Instead of thinking of tensors as immediately accessible results tied to their generating operations, view them as symbolic representations that carry metadata about their origin and are managed by the computational graph, which is often hidden under the hood by abstraction and eager execution. It's a key component of TensorFlow's power, once you adjust your perspective.
