Alright,  It’s a situation I've found myself in more than a few times, particularly when I was experimenting with T5 for various text generation tasks beyond straightforward supervised fine-tuning. You need the raw logits from a T5 model, specifically using the `forward()` method, but you don't have labels. That's completely valid, and in many cases, it’s the precise thing you need for advanced manipulation or analysis.

The core concept is understanding what the `forward()` method of a Hugging Face model returns. With T5, typically it yields an `EncoderDecoderModelOutput` object if you pass in both `input_ids` and `labels`, or a `Seq2SeqModelOutput` when no labels are present. Crucially, these objects contain the `logits` attribute, which is exactly what you're after.

The "problem," if we can even call it that, is that many examples and tutorials are often focused on fine-tuning, where labels are typically required. But remember, those labels are primarily used to calculate loss; they’re not intrinsically required for the model to generate its output, which includes the logits.

When you omit the labels from the forward call, you're essentially performing inference, not training. The model still processes the input and produces its prediction, and the logits are a fundamental component of that. These logits represent the raw scores for each token in the vocabulary at each decoding step, before any softmax or argmax operations.

To obtain them directly, all you need to do is omit the `labels` argument when you call the `forward()` method. Let me illustrate that with some Python snippets.

**Example 1: Basic Logit Retrieval**

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

# Load the pretrained model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Prepare input text
input_text = "translate English to German: The cat sat on the mat."
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Forward pass WITHOUT labels
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Access the logits
logits = outputs.logits

print(f"Shape of logits: {logits.shape}")
print(logits[0, :5, :5]) # print a small section to show the output is numbers and has the expected shape.
```

In this first example, the `forward()` method is called with the tokenized input, but crucially *without* passing any labels. The result is a `Seq2SeqModelOutput` object (or `EncoderDecoderModelOutput` as defined in some versions of the library), and we directly access the `logits` attribute. The shape of the logits will be `(batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size)`, reflecting the raw scores for each token in the vocabulary for each position in the sequence within your batch.

**Example 2: Controlling Generation and Obtaining Logits**

Often, we're generating more than one token, and we need the logits along the way. We can use the `generate()` method and retrieve those. Though generate itself does not directly output the logits, we can access the logits produced internally in the decoding loop. Let's do that with `past_key_values` and then extract the relevant logits.

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

# Load the pretrained model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Prepare input text
input_text = "translate English to German: The cat sat on the mat."
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Initial forward pass to get the encoder output.
encoder_outputs = model.encoder(input_ids=inputs['input_ids'], attention_mask=inputs['attention_mask'])

# Decoding loop with logits storage
past_key_values = None
generated_ids = []
logits_list = []

decoder_input_ids = torch.tensor([[model.config.decoder_start_token_id]], dtype=torch.long)
while True:

    decoder_outputs = model.decoder(input_ids=decoder_input_ids,
                                    encoder_hidden_states=encoder_outputs[0],
                                    encoder_attention_mask=inputs['attention_mask'],
                                    past_key_values=past_key_values)
    next_token_logits = model.lm_head(decoder_outputs[0][:, -1, :]) # get only the logits for the next token
    logits_list.append(next_token_logits)

    next_token_id = torch.argmax(next_token_logits, dim=-1)
    generated_ids.append(next_token_id)

    decoder_input_ids = next_token_id.unsqueeze(0)
    past_key_values = decoder_outputs.past_key_values

    if next_token_id == model.config.eos_token_id or len(generated_ids) > 50:
        break

# Stack logits and print shape
logits = torch.cat(logits_list, dim=0)
print(f"Shape of logits: {logits.shape}")
print(logits[0, :5]) # print the first set of scores for the first generated token
```
In this example, we perform decoding step-by-step. In each step, we store the logits for the next predicted token. These logits will now reveal a more granular picture of the model's output during the generation process.

**Example 3: Logits for specific tasks (e.g., for contrastive learning)**

This example focuses on getting logits for particular scenarios. Here, let's assume we are trying a contrastive learning setup, where we feed two similar inputs.

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

# Load the pretrained model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Prepare two similar input texts
input_text1 = "summarize: The cat sat on the mat, and it looked very comfortable."
input_text2 = "summarize: A feline was situated upon the floor covering, exhibiting a state of relaxation."
inputs1 = tokenizer(input_text1, return_tensors="pt")
inputs2 = tokenizer(input_text2, return_tensors="pt")


# Forward pass for both inputs, without labels
outputs1 = model(**inputs1)
outputs2 = model(**inputs2)


# Access logits
logits1 = outputs1.logits
logits2 = outputs2.logits

print(f"Shape of logits1: {logits1.shape}")
print(f"Shape of logits2: {logits2.shape}")
print("Example logits 1:", logits1[0, :5, :5]) # sample of logits from input 1
print("Example logits 2:", logits2[0, :5, :5]) # sample of logits from input 2

# Do something with the logits, for example compute cosine similarity
# Here we are just doing a very basic flattening, but you would usually compare at the token level in more complex cases

logits1_flat = logits1.reshape(logits1.size(0), -1)
logits2_flat = logits2.reshape(logits2.size(0), -1)
cosine_sim = torch.nn.functional.cosine_similarity(logits1_flat, logits2_flat)

print("Cosine similarity of the flattened logits:", cosine_sim)
```

Here, we're processing two related input texts to analyze the generated logits' similarity. In many contrastive learning applications, you’d compare not just flattened logits, but specific token-wise representations. This is only a sample of how you can use the retrieved logits for a specific task.

**In summary,** when using the `forward()` method of a T5 model, you get logits by simply omitting the `labels` parameter. The returned object will contain the `logits` attribute. From here, you can use these logits to perform any number of tasks from direct token selection, to creating custom loss functions for your problem, and more.

**Further Reading**

For deeper understanding, I recommend digging into the original T5 paper: "Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer" by Colin Raffel et al. Additionally, the Hugging Face documentation for the transformers library is extremely helpful. Pay special attention to the `EncoderDecoderModelOutput` and `Seq2SeqModelOutput` classes. And for an understanding of sequence-to-sequence modeling in a broader context, the textbook "Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin has a very comprehensive and practical introduction and treatment of those topics. These resources should provide more than enough knowledge to get you going.
