Let's tackle this nuanced issue head-on. I've seen this particular problem rear its head more times than I’d like to recall, usually during high-throughput system builds or complex data processing pipelines. Specifically, you're encountering a situation where a cancellation request intended for a group of tasks isn’t reliably propagating to individual tasks within that group. It’s a tricky dance, and the devil, as they say, is in the details of how task management and cancellation mechanisms are implemented.

My experience suggests that the root of this problem typically lies in one of three interconnected areas: incorrect scope propagation, insufficient signal handling, or asynchronous race conditions. Let’s break each of those down and then look at some illustrative code.

Firstly, the **scope propagation** aspect is crucial. Task groups are generally designed to operate within a certain execution context, often referred to as a scope. When a cancellation request is issued, it’s ideally transmitted as a signal within that scope. However, if this scope is not correctly inherited or propagated to the individual tasks spawned within the group, those tasks simply won't receive the cancellation signal. Imagine you have a nested structure of tasks, and cancellation is only being applied at the top level, without properly reaching the leaves. The child tasks, oblivious to the parent’s cancellation, will continue running merrily along. It usually boils down to using different cancellable tokens, such as passing the parent's token directly, or using new tokens with a linked cancellation signal.

Secondly, we have the problem of **insufficient signal handling**. Even if the cancellation signal *does* reach the individual tasks, it’s up to those tasks to actually recognize and respond appropriately. Many libraries provide cancellable operations, but if the tasks themselves aren’t explicitly designed to check for cancellation state during their execution loops or long-running operations, they will proceed as if no cancellation request occurred. This often manifests when developers use older, non-cancellable methods, or wrap blocking operations without implementing checks against the passed cancellation token. The absence of proactive checks against the cancellation state, means tasks will disregard it, irrespective of signal strength.

Finally, and often the most difficult to debug, are **asynchronous race conditions**. Imagine a scenario where the cancellation request is triggered concurrently with the start of a task within a group. If these actions are not properly synchronized, or if the task has already started its operation before the cancellation signal has been registered, it may proceed to completion even when it *should* have been canceled. The timing of asynchronous operations can lead to these kinds of unpredictable behaviors, where the cancellation logic may work most of the time, but silently fail in certain, often hard-to-reproduce conditions. We'll address some common concurrency mistakes in the code snippets ahead.

Now, let's delve into some concrete examples. I'll show you how, in a past project, I tackled similar issues using slightly adapted code. These are simplified versions, but they should capture the core concepts and the different failure points I've described:

**Example 1: Scope Propagation Issue**

Let’s assume you're working with a system that uses something akin to .net task-based concurrency. Here’s how you might inadvertently create a scenario where a cancellation doesn’t propagate correctly:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class TaskGroupProblem1
{
    public static async Task RunGroupAsync(CancellationToken parentToken)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting task group.");

        // WRONG: tasks don't receive the parent's token
        var task1 = Task.Run(async () => await LongRunningTask(1), CancellationToken.None);
        var task2 = Task.Run(async () => await LongRunningTask(2), CancellationToken.None);
        var task3 = Task.Run(async () => await LongRunningTask(3), CancellationToken.None);

        await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2, task3);
        Console.WriteLine("Task group finished or cancelled.");
    }


    private static async Task LongRunningTask(int taskNumber)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            await Task.Delay(1000);
            Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskNumber} running.");
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskNumber} completed.");
    }
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
         var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
          var groupTask = RunGroupAsync(cts.Token);
        await Task.Delay(2500);
        cts.Cancel();
        await groupTask;
       Console.WriteLine("Main finished.");
    }

}
```

In this code, although a `parentToken` is passed to `RunGroupAsync`, the individual tasks are launched using `CancellationToken.None`. Thus, even though the parent is cancelled, child tasks continue to execute. This highlights a major issue with token propagation: always pass the token to each underlying task.

**Example 2: Insufficient Signal Handling**

Now, let's look at an example where the signal *is* theoretically present, but not properly handled within a task:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class TaskGroupProblem2
{
    public static async Task RunGroupAsync(CancellationToken parentToken)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting task group.");

        var task1 = Task.Run(async () => await LongRunningTask(1, parentToken));
        var task2 = Task.Run(async () => await LongRunningTask(2, parentToken));
        var task3 = Task.Run(async () => await LongRunningTask(3, parentToken));

        await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2, task3);

        Console.WriteLine("Task group finished or cancelled.");
    }

    private static async Task LongRunningTask(int taskNumber, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
          await Task.Delay(1000);
          // Notice missing cancellation check
          Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskNumber} running.");
        }

         Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskNumber} completed.");
    }

    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
         var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
          var groupTask = RunGroupAsync(cts.Token);
        await Task.Delay(2500);
        cts.Cancel();
        await groupTask;
       Console.WriteLine("Main finished.");
    }
}
```

Here, `parentToken` *is* correctly passed to `LongRunningTask`, but the function itself does not check the `cancellationToken` state within the loop, and thus does not honor the cancellation request. To fix this, you’d need to add explicit checks like `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` within the task's body.

**Example 3: Addressing Asynchronous Race Conditions**

Finally, let’s tackle the potential race conditions:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class TaskGroupProblem3
{
     public static async Task RunGroupAsync(CancellationToken parentToken)
    {
         Console.WriteLine("Starting task group.");

       // Potential race
        var task1 = Task.Run(async () => await LongRunningTask(1, parentToken));
        var task2 = Task.Run(async () => await LongRunningTask(2, parentToken));
        var task3 = Task.Run(async () => await LongRunningTask(3, parentToken));

        await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2, task3);
        Console.WriteLine("Task group finished or cancelled.");
    }

    private static async Task LongRunningTask(int taskNumber, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        try {
             for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            {
                cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
                await Task.Delay(1000);
                Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskNumber} running.");
            }

            Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskNumber} completed.");

        } catch (OperationCanceledException){
            Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskNumber} cancelled.");
        }

    }

    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
         var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
          var groupTask = RunGroupAsync(cts.Token);
        await Task.Delay(2500);
        cts.Cancel();
        await groupTask;
       Console.WriteLine("Main finished.");
    }

}
```

While this snippet does add the proper checks for cancellation state, the core problem of asynchronous start-up still exists. This can be difficult to mitigate without explicit mechanisms for managing the startup phases in your particular concurrency model. The crucial change here is making the cancellation check *before* the long-running tasks. A race could exist when the check is placed within long-running ops. You can often mitigate these through using synchronized start ups or using a mechanism that ensures task cancellations at creation time. This example only offers a partial solution for this common race condition.

To better understand these complex issues, I recommend delving deeper into “Concurrent Programming on Windows” by Joe Duffy, which is a great resource for understanding task-based concurrency, and “Java Concurrency in Practice” by Brian Goetz et al. if you're dealing with a JVM-based environment. Additionally, articles and papers published on ACM or IEEE Xplore around concurrent programming and reactive systems often offer valuable insights. Always look for authoritative sources that go into the theoretical details as well as the practical implications of these issues.

In my experience, debugging these kinds of problems requires a careful approach, a solid understanding of your concurrency primitives, and rigorous testing under various load conditions. It's rarely about finding a single error, but rather about understanding the intricacies of how cancellation works within your chosen frameworks and libraries. Hopefully, this detail offers a good starting point for you.
