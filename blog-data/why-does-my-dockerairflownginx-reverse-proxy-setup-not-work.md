Right, let's unpack this docker-airflow-nginx conundrum. I’ve seen this exact scenario crop up more times than I care to recall, often with variations that make debugging a delightful, if time-consuming, exercise. Usually, the problem isn't just one thing; it’s a confluence of misconfigurations across the three components. Based on my past experiences battling similar setups, there are a few common culprits I'd like to examine.

Firstly, let's consider the networking layer. Docker, by default, isolates containers, so a communication breakdown often starts here. Airflow needs to be exposed to the outside world, usually on specific ports, and nginx needs to know which ports to forward traffic to. I've seen cases where either the docker compose file or the Airflow configurations have conflicting port mappings. This creates situations where traffic seems to vanish into thin air. Typically, what happens is the nginx reverse proxy is listening on port 80 (or 443 for https), but the airflow webserver is running on, say, port 8080 within its docker container but isn't properly mapped to a host port that nginx can access.

Secondly, nginx configuration is often a source of issues. The `proxy_pass` directive needs to be precisely configured to forward requests correctly to the Airflow web server. A common mistake is not specifying the correct hostname or container name that docker assigns, which can change based on how the containers are spun up. I've also encountered problems where nginx doesn't include necessary headers that Airflow relies on, leading to incomplete or broken web pages. Moreover, internal proxy settings, particularly those involving container names instead of direct IP addresses, often need more specific handling than people anticipate.

Lastly, there's also the complexity surrounding the interplay between Airflow's webserver configurations and docker networking. Airflow, like most web applications, needs to be configured to be aware of the domain or host it's running under, which might be different than where it’s exposed. Neglecting to set the right `webserver_base_url` or similar configuration parameters inside airflow’s settings can cause a mismatch between the routing logic of the proxy and the backend server resulting in a variety of symptoms.

Now, let's illustrate these concepts with some code. Let’s begin with a sample `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  airflow-webserver:
    image: apache/airflow:2.8.0
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # Host port 8080 maps to container port 8080
    environment:
      - AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR=LocalExecutor
      - AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80" # Host port 80 maps to container port 80
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    depends_on:
      - airflow-webserver
```

Here we have two services: `airflow-webserver` and `nginx`. The important detail here is the port mapping for airflow: `8080:8080`. This maps the container's port 8080 to host’s port 8080. Nginx will need to communicate to the host port to access airflow.

Next, a very basic `nginx.conf` file:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:8080;  # Notice host.docker.internal
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

This configuration listens on port 80 and forwards all requests to `http://host.docker.internal:8080`. Crucially, `host.docker.internal` resolves to the host machine's network interface from inside the Docker container. This is often the critical missing piece when you're trying to access services within the container. Notice the headers, these are needed by airflow to correctly reconstruct the user’s request.

Finally, for completeness, a quick note on ensuring airflow's configuration, you often need a line like this in the `airflow.cfg`:
```ini
[webserver]
base_url = http://localhost
```
However, this isn’t always necessary but is illustrative to why this is important. Here, we explicitly set the `base_url` to the domain nginx will be accessed through. A mismatch here can cause misdirection in the webserver’s handling of url and links, leading to broken views. If your domain is something other than localhost, you will need to update it there.

The critical part when troubleshooting is examining the nginx logs first. Errors there can often indicate communication failures or improper configuration. Secondly, verifying your airflow's logs should then follow. This will reveal errors in parsing requests or misconfigurations relating to how the app views itself.

To summarize, I’ve found that systematic approach is the best strategy when debugging these setups. Ensure your port mappings are correct and consistent between docker compose and configuration files. Nginx is correctly forwarding traffic to the right location, and that headers are included and that the application is aware of its access points. For further reading, consider exploring the official Docker documentation, particularly the section on networking. Likewise, the Nginx official documentation is an invaluable resource for advanced proxy configurations. Additionally, "High Performance Web Sites" by Steve Souders provides a great understanding of the underlaying HTTP communication, which helps tremendously when debugging these kinds of errors. Lastly, deep-diving into the Airflow documentation specifically the webserver configuration section is essential. I’ve spent many late nights using these resources to diagnose these very problems.
