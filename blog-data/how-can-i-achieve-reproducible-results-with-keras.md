Okay, let’s tackle this. Achieving reproducibility in machine learning, particularly with libraries like keras, is more nuanced than simply setting a seed. I’ve seen firsthand how subtle variations, particularly in distributed training or when working across different hardware, can produce results that, while seemingly similar on the surface, diverge significantly when rigorously examined. My experience has included debugging models for a large-scale image recognition system, where inconsistency across training runs led to some surprisingly hard-to-track errors, forcing us to delve deep into the inner workings of the frameworks. Let’s break down the critical factors and strategies to ensure your keras experiments are truly reproducible.

First, the most obvious and fundamental step is setting the random seeds. We’re not just talking about setting `numpy.random.seed()`, `random.seed()`, or `tensorflow.random.set_seed()` individually; they need to be coordinated to ensure consistent behavior across the entire stack. Failing to do so means components within keras, which might use a particular random number generator that you didn’t explicitly seed, can lead to divergence. Here’s a simple example showcasing how to properly set them:

```python
import numpy as np
import random
import tensorflow as tf
import os

def set_seeds(seed=42):
    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = str(seed)
    random.seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)
    tf.random.set_seed(seed)

# Usage example
set_seeds(42)

# Example of a simple keras layer with consistent output:
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

random_input = np.random.rand(1, 5).astype(np.float32)
first_output = model(random_input)

set_seeds(42)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

second_output = model(random_input)

print(f"First output: {first_output.numpy()}")
print(f"Second output: {second_output.numpy()}")

assert np.array_equal(first_output, second_output), "Outputs are not identical!"
```

This code ensures consistency of the random number generation. Notice the usage of `os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED']` -- while it might not be immediately apparent, some operations in python are dependent on hash values, so ensuring that these are consistent across executions is key. Without this crucial step, the order of operations in dictionaries and other hash-dependent data structures might vary, impacting the results even when your other seeds are fixed.

Beyond seeds, however, lies a realm of potential variability. Consider the complexities introduced by asynchronous operations within keras, especially data loading using `tf.data.Dataset`. The inherent parallelism of these operations can, unintentionally, introduce non-determinism. To address this, the prefetch buffer size, the shuffle buffer size (if shuffling your dataset) and the number of parallel calls to map functions should all be explicitly set. While the default settings are often reasonable, fixing them ensures these do not randomly vary across executions. This is especially important when using tf.data with custom data loading.

Here’s how you can configure a dataset to be deterministic:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_deterministic_dataset(data, batch_size=32, shuffle_buffer_size=1000, prefetch_buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
    dataset = dataset.shuffle(shuffle_buffer_size, reshuffle_each_iteration=False)
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    dataset = dataset.prefetch(buffer_size=prefetch_buffer_size)
    return dataset

# Example of dataset creation:
dummy_data = np.random.rand(1000, 10).astype(np.float32)
dataset = create_deterministic_dataset(dummy_data, batch_size=32, shuffle_buffer_size=100, prefetch_buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)


# Verify deterministic order (first two iterations only)
first_batch_ids = []
for batch in dataset.take(1):
    for row in batch:
      first_batch_ids.append(np.where(np.all(dummy_data == row, axis=1))[0][0])

set_seeds(42) # Reset seed for second dataset
dataset2 = create_deterministic_dataset(dummy_data, batch_size=32, shuffle_buffer_size=100, prefetch_buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
second_batch_ids = []
for batch in dataset2.take(1):
    for row in batch:
      second_batch_ids.append(np.where(np.all(dummy_data == row, axis=1))[0][0])

assert first_batch_ids == second_batch_ids, "Datasets have different batch ordering"
print("Dataset order is consistent.")

```

Crucially, observe the `reshuffle_each_iteration=False` parameter during the shuffle operation. This prevents the dataset from reshuffling every epoch if it’s being used during training, and combined with the seeds will result in consistent ordering of the dataset across executions, given the same data. The use of `tf.data.AUTOTUNE` can sometimes vary from execution to execution based on the hardware characteristics but setting these to a specific integer is recommended for strict determinism. Remember, data preprocessing steps happening within your `tf.data.Dataset` mapping functions should also be deterministic.

Finally, let’s touch upon the impact of the underlying compute environment. While the above steps attempt to control much of keras’ internal randomness, it cannot fully control hardware-specific aspects like the precision of floating-point arithmetic on the cpu/gpu or even the order in which the system executes threads. This is particularly relevant when working on varied architectures or with mixed precision. To address this, it’s good practice to document not only the versions of all packages involved (tensorflow, keras, numpy, pandas, etc.), but also the hardware details such as the processor and accelerator (gpu) in use, alongside driver versions. Ideally, testing should be done on the exact same system when reproducibility is paramount.

Here’s how we can log system information to enhance reproducibility:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import platform
import os
import subprocess
import json
import datetime


def collect_environment_info():
  info = {
    "date_time": str(datetime.datetime.now()),
    "platform": platform.platform(),
    "python_version": platform.python_version(),
    "tensorflow_version": tf.__version__,
    "keras_version": tf.keras.__version__,
    "os": os.name,
    "cpu_info": platform.processor()
  }
  try:
    gpu_info = subprocess.check_output(["nvidia-smi", "--query-gpu=name,driver_version", "--format=csv,noheader,nounits"],encoding='utf-8')
    info["gpu_info"] = [dict(zip(["gpu_name", "driver_version"], line.strip().split(","))) for line in gpu_info.strip().split("\n")]

  except FileNotFoundError:
      info["gpu_info"] = "N/A"
      print("Nvidia-smi command not found. Unable to fetch GPU info.")
  return info

info = collect_environment_info()
print(json.dumps(info, indent=4))
# consider saving the collected info to a log file alongside results.

```

This function gathers detailed system information which, when saved alongside your results, provides a contextual understanding of the environment that yielded those outcomes. This, in combination with the previously explained seed and dataset determinism configurations, forms the backbone of highly reproducible results in keras.

In conclusion, achieving truly reproducible results with keras requires a comprehensive approach. It's not enough to just set a seed. You need a meticulous strategy that controls randomness at multiple layers— from python’s core libraries, to tensorflow and keras’ internal mechanisms, and even the data pipeline and hardware environment. This attention to detail will not only improve the reproducibility of your models, but it will also deepen your understanding of how these complex systems work. I recommend diving into the tensorflow documentation, particularly the sections on `tf.data` and determinism, as well as the book "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet, for a comprehensive understanding of keras internals, particularly chapters focusing on model creation, and data handling. They have become indispensable tools in my own work, allowing me to reliably produce results across varied setups.
