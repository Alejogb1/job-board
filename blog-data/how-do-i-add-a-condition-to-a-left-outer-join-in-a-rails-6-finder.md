Okay, let's tackle this. I've definitely been down this road before, specifically back when we were migrating that sprawling e-commerce platform to a more microservices-oriented architecture. We had a peculiar situation where performance was tanking, and after some analysis, we traced it back to inefficient queries involving left outer joins with conditional filters. It turned out we were inadvertently fetching a ton of unnecessary data. The straightforward `joins` method wasn't cutting it. So, let's break down how you can effectively add conditions to left outer joins in Rails 6, because it’s not always as obvious as it should be.

The core issue arises because the standard `joins` method in ActiveRecord typically generates an `INNER JOIN`. When you need to preserve all records from your primary table while also including potentially matching records from a related table—and, crucially, apply a condition only to those related records—you're venturing into the realm of left outer joins with specific filter criteria. Here's how to approach it.

Essentially, we leverage the power of raw SQL fragments within our ActiveRecord queries. This allows for finer-grained control over the generated SQL, enabling us to craft precisely the joins we need. We'll use `where` in conjunction with `joins` or `left_outer_joins` and provide a string containing the join condition in the `ON` clause of the sql.

Let's illustrate with a simplified example. Imagine we have two models: `Users` and `Orders`. We want to fetch all users, including those who haven't placed any orders, but *only* include orders that are marked as 'completed' in our results.

**Code Snippet 1: Using a SQL string in a `where` clause**

```ruby
users = User.left_outer_joins(:orders)
            .where("orders.status = 'completed' OR orders.id IS NULL")
            .select("users.*, orders.*")
```

In this first snippet, I've used `left_outer_joins(:orders)`, which does most of the heavy lifting in constructing the basic left join, then the `.where` method to insert the filtering condition. This generates a sql query where the `ON` clause will include the join criteria defined by the association *and* `orders.status = 'completed' OR orders.id IS NULL`. The key here is the `OR orders.id IS NULL` clause; this ensures that *all* users are included in the result, even if they don’t have orders, and that *only* the orders that match the `completed` status are included in the cases that a user *does* have related orders. It is also crucial to note the `select` method. We need to specify the fields of both models that we're interested in to ensure we get all needed attributes in the result. In the case above, I've used `select("users.*, orders.*")` to include all fields.

However, this can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or SQL errors, particularly with more complex conditional logic. It's also a bit less readable, as all the criteria are jammed into a string. Therefore, let's look at a better way.

**Code Snippet 2: Using `left_outer_joins` with string conditions in the `ON` clause**

```ruby
users = User.left_outer_joins(
            "LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON orders.user_id = users.id AND orders.status = 'completed'"
            ).select("users.*, orders.*")
```

In this second example, instead of relying on `where`, I've used a raw string within the `left_outer_joins` method itself. Here, the entire join condition is specified within a raw SQL string passed to `left_outer_joins`. We explicitly specify the `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, the tables to join, and, crucially, the condition `orders.status = 'completed'` directly within the `ON` clause. Note, we have also specified a select clause including both fields from both tables. This method is generally preferred, particularly for complex conditions, because you're writing the entire join explicitly. Also, it should be noted that we do not need an `OR orders.id IS NULL` condition because the join itself is a *left outer join*. Records will not be filtered out, and only non-matching records will have *null* values.

The first two examples work but it's worth noting that string-based queries can sometimes be less maintainable and slightly prone to errors, especially when dealing with complex conditional logic. Parameters should be used where possible to avoid sql injection attacks. Therefore, let's examine a third method.

**Code Snippet 3: Leveraging `left_outer_joins` with dynamic parameters**

```ruby
users = User.left_outer_joins(
        "LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON orders.user_id = users.id AND orders.status = ?" , "completed"
).select("users.*, orders.*")
```
The third example uses the same string condition format as the second example but with parameterization. This approach combines the explicitness of the string method with the safety of parameterization which provides added security against SQL injection vulnerabilities. This approach is generally preferred where user inputs can be included in query conditions.

In terms of when to choose one approach over another, my personal experience has led me to the following conclusions. Generally, the parameterized version of `left_outer_joins` with a raw string (as shown in snippet 3) is my preferred way to approach conditional left joins. The second method is nearly identical to the third, it is simply not parameterized. I use the first approach (using the `where` clause) only when conditions become excessively complex or when I need to combine the left join with other `where` clauses against the `users` table.

While Rails 6's query interface is quite powerful, there are cases, especially with more intricate join logic, where using raw sql within `joins`, `left_outer_joins`, and `where` is unavoidable. It's critical to have a solid understanding of both the database's query semantics and Rails' ActiveRecord capabilities.

For further reading, I strongly recommend delving into Joe Celko's work, specifically "SQL for Smarties: Advanced SQL Programming," which offers a deep understanding of SQL concepts beyond basic queries. Additionally, "Agile Web Development with Rails 6" by David Heinemeier Hansson provides comprehensive coverage of Rails' query interface and its underlying mechanisms. Lastly, for a better understanding of parameterized queries, a general reference to the documentation of your particular database, such as Postgres or MySQL, is useful.

In summary, adding conditions to left outer joins in Rails 6 requires a blend of ActiveRecord knowledge and an ability to work with raw SQL snippets. By understanding the mechanics behind these queries, and knowing when it’s advantageous to use raw sql fragments, you can improve application performance and query accuracy. It was through practical application and a bit of hard earned experience from prior work that I have come to utilize these methods as the most flexible and robust approaches for conditional left outer joins.
