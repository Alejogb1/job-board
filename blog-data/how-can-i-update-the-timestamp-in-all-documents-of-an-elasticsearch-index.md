Let's get straight to it then. The scenario you’ve described – needing to update a timestamp field across an entire Elasticsearch index – is something I've tackled a few times in past projects, often after data migrations or realizing a critical field was simply incorrect. There isn't a straightforward single-command approach, unfortunately, which means we'll be using Elasticsearch's update by query feature. It's robust, but understanding its implications is vital.

Fundamentally, Elasticsearch documents are immutable. What we're actually doing when we 'update' a document is deleting the old one and creating a new one in its place. This process becomes more complex when we're dealing with an entire index, but the same principle applies. I'm going to break down the necessary steps and provide you with concrete examples that should cover most use cases.

The primary tool at our disposal here is the `_update_by_query` API. This essentially allows us to filter documents based on a query and then apply an update script to them. It operates in batches and will automatically retry failed updates, making it much safer than manual updates. The trade-off here is that it might take some time depending on the size of your index.

Now, let's talk about potential pitfalls. One of the biggest things to remember is the scripting language you use inside the update-by-query script. Elasticsearch defaults to painless, which is usually sufficient, but it is crucial to be precise and test these snippets thoroughly before deploying them on production indices. Incorrect scripts can lead to data loss, so proceed with caution and always validate your script output on a test index first.

Another issue often encountered is version conflicts. Because of how updates work within Elasticsearch, documents might change while the update-by-query is running if other updates come along at the same time. This will lead to some failures if we don't account for it in the update query.

Now, for the good stuff – practical implementations. Let's begin with our first scenario where we just need to update a timestamp field to the current time.

**Example 1: Updating a timestamp to the current time**

Let's say you have a field called `last_updated` and you want to update all of them to now. Here's the query you would use:

```json
POST your_index_name/_update_by_query
{
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.last_updated = new Date().getTime()",
    "lang": "painless"
  }
}
```

This snippet is straightforward:
1. `POST your_index_name/_update_by_query` specifies we're executing an update by query operation against the specified index.
2. The `script` block is where we define our update logic.
3. `ctx._source` is how you access the source document for the update.
4. We assign the output of `new Date().getTime()` (which gives us the milliseconds since epoch) to our `last_updated` field. This will ensure the field will be updated with the server's current time.
5. `lang: "painless"` specifies that we're using Painless, Elasticsearch's scripting language.

After executing this, all your documents will be updated with the current timestamp.

Now, let’s consider a scenario where the existing timestamp is in a format Elasticsearch doesn't correctly parse. Perhaps it was stored as a text field originally and now you want to correct that. We will need to reformat it using a more explicit and sophisticated script.

**Example 2: Correcting timestamp format and updating**

Let’s assume the incorrect timestamp is stored as a string in a field called `created_at` in the format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` and we wish to parse it into a date. We'll then also create a new field named `created_at_ts`, to store it in epoch milliseconds, which is what Elasticsearch expects.

```json
POST your_index_name/_update_by_query
{
  "script": {
    "source": """
      String dateString = ctx._source.created_at;
      if (dateString != null) {
        try {
            java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter formatter = java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
            java.time.LocalDateTime dateTime = java.time.LocalDateTime.parse(dateString, formatter);
            long epochMillis = dateTime.atZone(java.time.ZoneId.systemDefault()).toInstant().toEpochMilli();
            ctx._source.created_at_ts = epochMillis;
        } catch(Exception e) {
           ctx._source.error_message = "failed to parse date: " + dateString + ", error: " + e.getMessage();
        }
      }
    """,
    "lang": "painless"
  }
}
```

Here's the breakdown:
1. We define our script as before.
2. We're using Java's `DateTimeFormatter` to parse the date. This needs to be very precise, based on the input's string format.
3. We then transform the parsed date object to epoch milliseconds and set it to the new `created_at_ts` field.
4. Crucially, I've included a try-catch block that adds an `error_message` field to documents which fail parsing for debugging. This is very important because you'll need a mechanism to track failed transformations in order to fix your data.

Finally, let’s examine how to update a timestamp but only for a specific set of documents which meet certain criteria.

**Example 3: Conditional timestamp update based on query**

Let’s say you only want to update `last_updated` for documents where a certain field `status` is equal to `"pending"`. We can combine our previous knowledge of the script with a query.

```json
POST your_index_name/_update_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "status": "pending"
    }
  },
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.last_updated = new Date().getTime()",
     "lang": "painless"
  }
}

```

This example incorporates a `query` block. The `match` query filters the documents down to only those with `status` as pending. The `script` then operates as in our first example, updating the `last_updated` field to the current time but only on the matching documents. This gives you fine-grained control over which documents you’re updating.

Before you perform any updates, I strongly suggest you familiarize yourself with some core Elasticsearch documentation. Specifically, read through sections relating to the `_update_by_query` API, and the Painless scripting language thoroughly. The official documentation is the best reference here. Additionally, papers like "Elasticsearch in Action" by Radu Gheorghe, Matthew Lee Hinman, and Roy Russo would be beneficial for understanding the underlying mechanics, and I would also recommend reading "Effective Elasticsearch" by Rafał Kuć, which will provide you with detailed strategies for data management. Remember, testing in a non-production environment cannot be emphasized enough.

In summary, while there isn't a single, direct command to update all timestamps, the `_update_by_query` API with a well-crafted script is your best option. Remember to always test your scripts and consider the error handling to maintain data integrity. These three examples should provide a comprehensive understanding to tackle most timestamp updating scenarios that you will encounter.
