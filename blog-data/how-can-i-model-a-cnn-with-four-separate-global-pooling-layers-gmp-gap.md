, let's tackle this intriguing architecture you're proposing—a convolutional neural network (CNN) incorporating four distinct global pooling layers. I've actually encountered a similar scenario in the past, while working on a multi-modal classification problem for satellite imagery. We had various data channels—spectral bands, vegetation indices, and elevation—each requiring a slightly different feature reduction strategy before feeding them into a classifier.

So, straight off the bat, the key concept here is understanding that global pooling, whether global max pooling (GMP) or global average pooling (GAP), fundamentally collapses a spatial feature map into a single vector. It's not inherently restrictive to apply it just *once* in a network; you absolutely *can* apply it multiple times, each to a different feature map, and concatenate the results. In fact, it can be quite powerful for capturing different types of high-level information.

The general process you’d follow involves first, creating your convolutional base—the series of convolutional and pooling layers that extract local features from your input data. Then, at a strategic point, instead of directly feeding the result into a dense layer, you'll branch off, and introduce multiple feature extraction pipelines. Each of these pipelines culminates in a *distinct* global pooling layer applied to different feature sets or different regions of a shared feature map.

The intuition behind employing multiple pooling layers is to allow the network to learn diverse, high-level representations. Global Max pooling highlights the most salient feature across the map, while Global Average pooling emphasizes the average activation. It might also be that certain feature maps after convolutional operations are spatially relevant in different areas, therefore separating them and processing them separately could result in higher performance. It's not always about the type of pooling itself, but rather what features are considered for each pipeline. We could even use a hybrid approach combining the max and average.

Let me illustrate with some conceptual code snippets using python and tensorflow/keras. The syntax should be fairly self-explanatory. First, let's consider a simple example where we apply global pooling layers to different channels of a convolutional output.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def create_multiple_pooling_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    input_tensor = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)

    # Convolutional base (shared across pooling layers)
    conv_base = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(input_tensor)
    conv_base = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv_base)
    conv_base = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2))(conv_base)

    # Branch 1 (Global Average Pooling on channels 0-20)
    branch1 = layers.Lambda(lambda x: x[:,:,:,:20])(conv_base)
    branch1 = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(branch1)

    # Branch 2 (Global Max Pooling on channels 20-40)
    branch2 = layers.Lambda(lambda x: x[:,:,:,20:40])(conv_base)
    branch2 = layers.GlobalMaxPooling2D()(branch2)

    # Branch 3 (Global Average Pooling on channels 40-60)
    branch3 = layers.Lambda(lambda x: x[:,:,:,40:60])(conv_base)
    branch3 = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(branch3)

    # Branch 4 (Global Max Pooling on channels 60 onwards)
    branch4 = layers.Lambda(lambda x: x[:,:,:,60:])(conv_base)
    branch4 = layers.GlobalMaxPooling2D()(branch4)

    # Concatenate the pooled outputs
    merged = layers.concatenate([branch1, branch2, branch3, branch4])

    # Final classification layer
    output_tensor = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(merged)

    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
    return model

# Example usage:
input_shape = (128, 128, 100)  # Example: 100 feature channels
num_classes = 10
model = create_multiple_pooling_model(input_shape, num_classes)
model.summary()
```

Here, we are effectively splitting the feature channels from the convolutional layer into groups and applying global pooling separately for each group before concatenating them. It could be possible to further refine this by using different activation functions for each branch, but this depends on the data.

Next, consider a more nuanced case where we use depth-wise separable convolutions before each pooling layer. This would be helpful when you need to reduce the computational complexity of the model.

```python
def create_multiple_pooling_model_separable(input_shape, num_classes):
    input_tensor = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)

    # Convolutional base
    conv_base = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(input_tensor)
    conv_base = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv_base)
    conv_base = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2))(conv_base)

    # Branch 1 (Separable Conv, then Global Average Pooling)
    branch1 = layers.SeparableConv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv_base)
    branch1 = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(branch1)

    # Branch 2 (Separable Conv, then Global Max Pooling)
    branch2 = layers.SeparableConv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv_base)
    branch2 = layers.GlobalMaxPooling2D()(branch2)

    # Branch 3 (Separable Conv, then Global Average Pooling)
    branch3 = layers.SeparableConv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv_base)
    branch3 = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(branch3)

    # Branch 4 (Separable Conv, then Global Max Pooling)
    branch4 = layers.SeparableConv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv_base)
    branch4 = layers.GlobalMaxPooling2D()(branch4)

    # Concatenate the pooled outputs
    merged = layers.concatenate([branch1, branch2, branch3, branch4])

    # Final classification layer
    output_tensor = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(merged)

    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
    return model

# Example usage:
input_shape = (128, 128, 64)  # Example: 64 feature channels
num_classes = 10
model = create_multiple_pooling_model_separable(input_shape, num_classes)
model.summary()
```

Finally, let's look at a situation where we apply the global pooling layers to different regions of the same feature map. This is useful in cases where different spatial parts of the image have distinct characteristics.

```python
def create_multiple_pooling_model_regions(input_shape, num_classes):
    input_tensor = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)

    # Convolutional base
    conv_base = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(input_tensor)
    conv_base = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv_base)
    conv_base = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2))(conv_base)

    # Branch 1 (Top left quarter)
    branch1 = layers.Lambda(lambda x: x[:, :x.shape[1] // 2, :x.shape[2] // 2, :])(conv_base)
    branch1 = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(branch1)

    # Branch 2 (Top right quarter)
    branch2 = layers.Lambda(lambda x: x[:, :x.shape[1] // 2, x.shape[2] // 2:, :])(conv_base)
    branch2 = layers.GlobalMaxPooling2D()(branch2)

    # Branch 3 (Bottom left quarter)
    branch3 = layers.Lambda(lambda x: x[:, x.shape[1] // 2:, :x.shape[2] // 2, :])(conv_base)
    branch3 = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(branch3)

    # Branch 4 (Bottom right quarter)
    branch4 = layers.Lambda(lambda x: x[:, x.shape[1] // 2:, x.shape[2] // 2:, :])(conv_base)
    branch4 = layers.GlobalMaxPooling2D()(branch4)

    # Concatenate the pooled outputs
    merged = layers.concatenate([branch1, branch2, branch3, branch4])

    # Final classification layer
    output_tensor = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(merged)

    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
    return model

# Example usage:
input_shape = (128, 128, 64)  # Example: 64 feature channels
num_classes = 10
model = create_multiple_pooling_model_regions(input_shape, num_classes)
model.summary()
```

These snippets should illustrate how you can integrate multiple global pooling layers into your CNN. However, keep in mind that this sort of architecture is not a 'one-size-fits-all' solution. You'll need to experiment and tune the setup according to the task at hand and the dataset's specifics.

For a deeper dive into related concepts, I'd highly recommend looking at *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville for a comprehensive background on neural networks. For specific understanding of convolutional networks and pooling operations, the original paper on AlexNet and VGG net are a good resource. Also, consider the concept of 'attention mechanisms', which can be viewed as a more complex version of weighted pooling, often replacing global pooling in more modern models. Specifically, attention can be seen as an adaptive way to learn which portions of the feature maps are most important, giving a learned approach to select data, rather than the standard average/max functions that global pooling employs.

Remember, while adding architectural complexity can help, start simple, and iterate from there, measuring improvements as you add complexity. And, as with any deep learning problem, always make sure to validate on a separate data set to guarantee generalisation.
