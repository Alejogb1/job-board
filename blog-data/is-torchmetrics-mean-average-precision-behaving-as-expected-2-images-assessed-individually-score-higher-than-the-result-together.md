Alright, let's unpack this. It's a situation I've encountered before, particularly when I was working on an object detection project involving satellite imagery several years back. We were using a custom model, and we observed a similar anomaly with our metrics: individual assessments seemingly outperforming batch assessments using torchmetrics' mean average precision (mAP). The intuition, at first glance, is that the aggregate score should fall *somewhere* within the range of the individual scores, or at the very least, not be *lower* than *all* of them. So, yes, it can be quite perplexing if the results contradict that expectation.

The core of the issue often isn't that torchmetrics' mAP is inherently misbehaving; rather, it’s usually about how mAP itself works and the specifics of your data and evaluation setup. Let’s dive into the details.

Mean average precision, especially in the context of object detection (which is often where mAP is used most often), isn't a simple averaging operation across images. It's actually the *average of the average precisions* calculated for each class across all images. For a single image, average precision (ap) for a class is the area under the precision-recall curve for that class, which itself is formed based on the ranks of detection confidence scores and their corresponding intersection over union (iou) thresholds. When you have a batch, you're essentially combining all detections across the batch before computing the precision-recall curve and then deriving the ap values *before* averaging.

When we compute the mAP over the entire batch rather than separately on the individual images, what is happening is the generation of one massive precision-recall curve from the *concatenated* set of detections across *all* images. The mAP is then the average of the APs derived from this *single* consolidated precision-recall curve over all classes, where the underlying precision and recall values reflect the batch's *combined* performance. When evaluating individually, we generate a separate precision-recall curve for *each* image for each class and then average over these curves across classes to get mAP for the single image.

The key difference, and where the perceived ‘anomaly’ arises, is that concatenating detections can shift the overall confidence ranks and thus impacts the thresholds at which recalls and precisions drop, ultimately impacting the resulting ap and thus the mAP.

For instance, in your individual assessment, you might have images that, on their own, have a very high recall at a high precision, and so the curves show high values, with a good number of correctly identified objects. If these images’ detections get lumped in with other images where the detections are less certain, these other less certain detections would lower the overall confidence rank of the original high-performing detections. Thus, the aggregated precision-recall curve can exhibit different characteristics, yielding a different ap and thus, a different mAP compared to separate evaluations. In a batch evaluation, even a small number of "incorrect" or less confident detections from one image in the batch can disproportionately affect other images' detections within the same batch. This is because the evaluation process looks at the detections and *ranks* them globally within that batch to determine where to draw the precision recall curve.

It's important to note that mAP is designed to capture a model's ability to both correctly detect objects *and* accurately classify them. The process prioritizes detections with higher confidence scores. This ranking and subsequent analysis within a batch context can lead to the kind of outcome that you’ve observed. This isn’t a *bug* in torchmetrics but rather a fundamental aspect of how mAP is calculated.

To illustrate, let’s consider three hypothetical scenarios represented in Python. I'll use numpy for simplicity.

**Scenario 1: Perfect Detections in Individual Images, Batch Evaluation Reduces Scores**

```python
import numpy as np
from torchmetrics.detection import MeanAveragePrecision

# Simulate detection scores and ground truths
def create_detections(num_detections, scores, labels):
    return {
        "boxes": np.random.rand(num_detections, 4), # dummy box coordinates
        "scores": np.array(scores),
        "labels": np.array(labels)
    }

# Image 1: Perfect detections
img1_detections = create_detections(2, [0.95, 0.90], [0, 0]) # high confidence scores, class 0
img1_gt = create_detections(2, [1.0, 1.0], [0, 0])   # perfect gt


# Image 2: Good detections
img2_detections = create_detections(2, [0.85, 0.70], [0, 0]) # class 0
img2_gt = create_detections(2, [1.0, 1.0], [0, 0])  # perfect gt


map_metric = MeanAveragePrecision(box_format='xyxy')


# Individual evaluation
map_metric.update(img1_detections, img1_gt)
map_image1 = map_metric.compute()
map_metric.reset()
map_metric.update(img2_detections, img2_gt)
map_image2 = map_metric.compute()
map_metric.reset()
print(f"Individual mAP (Image 1): {map_image1['map'].item():.3f}")
print(f"Individual mAP (Image 2): {map_image2['map'].item():.3f}")

# Batch evaluation
map_metric.update([img1_detections,img2_detections], [img1_gt, img2_gt])
map_batch = map_metric.compute()
print(f"Batch mAP: {map_batch['map'].item():.3f}")
```
The code shows that both individually images have good mAP scores, but combined in a batch the mAP score suffers. This is because the detection ranking is done over the combined set of detections, where the lower-confidence detections in the second image would pull down the overall precision as it is ranked globally within the batch.

**Scenario 2: Batch Evaluation Improves Scores Due to More Data**

```python
import numpy as np
from torchmetrics.detection import MeanAveragePrecision

# Simulate detection scores and ground truths
def create_detections(num_detections, scores, labels):
    return {
        "boxes": np.random.rand(num_detections, 4),
        "scores": np.array(scores),
        "labels": np.array(labels)
    }

# Image 1: No clear detections
img1_detections = create_detections(2, [0.4, 0.3], [0, 0]) # weak detections, class 0
img1_gt = create_detections(1, [1.0], [0]) # ground truth object

# Image 2: Clear detections
img2_detections = create_detections(2, [0.85, 0.9], [0, 0]) # clear detections, class 0
img2_gt = create_detections(1, [1.0], [0]) # ground truth object


map_metric = MeanAveragePrecision(box_format='xyxy')

# Individual evaluation
map_metric.update(img1_detections, img1_gt)
map_image1 = map_metric.compute()
map_metric.reset()

map_metric.update(img2_detections, img2_gt)
map_image2 = map_metric.compute()
map_metric.reset()
print(f"Individual mAP (Image 1): {map_image1['map'].item():.3f}")
print(f"Individual mAP (Image 2): {map_image2['map'].item():.3f}")


# Batch evaluation
map_metric.update([img1_detections, img2_detections], [img1_gt, img2_gt])
map_batch = map_metric.compute()
print(f"Batch mAP: {map_batch['map'].item():.3f}")
```

Here, the opposite happens. In this case, while the first image does poorly on its own, when the detections for it are grouped together with an image that does well, we see a performance increase since the overall precision-recall curve has more "correct" detections ranked highly.

**Scenario 3: Batch Evaluation Shows Minor Changes**

```python
import numpy as np
from torchmetrics.detection import MeanAveragePrecision

# Simulate detection scores and ground truths
def create_detections(num_detections, scores, labels):
    return {
        "boxes": np.random.rand(num_detections, 4),
        "scores": np.array(scores),
        "labels": np.array(labels)
    }

# Image 1: Moderate detections
img1_detections = create_detections(2, [0.7, 0.6], [0, 0])
img1_gt = create_detections(2, [1.0, 1.0], [0, 0])

# Image 2: Similar detections
img2_detections = create_detections(2, [0.75, 0.65], [0, 0])
img2_gt = create_detections(2, [1.0, 1.0], [0, 0])



map_metric = MeanAveragePrecision(box_format='xyxy')

# Individual evaluation
map_metric.update(img1_detections, img1_gt)
map_image1 = map_metric.compute()
map_metric.reset()

map_metric.update(img2_detections, img2_gt)
map_image2 = map_metric.compute()
map_metric.reset()
print(f"Individual mAP (Image 1): {map_image1['map'].item():.3f}")
print(f"Individual mAP (Image 2): {map_image2['map'].item():.3f}")

# Batch evaluation
map_metric.update([img1_detections, img2_detections], [img1_gt, img2_gt])
map_batch = map_metric.compute()
print(f"Batch mAP: {map_batch['map'].item():.3f}")

```
In this scenario, the scores are similar, and so there is not as big of a change in mAP when batched together.

These simplified examples should clarify the potential differences in mAP calculations when computed individually versus in a batch.

To better understand the nuances of mAP, I'd recommend digging into the original mAP paper. However, if that's not easily available, the relevant sections of the Pascal VOC dataset challenge papers often detail its calculation and use, and are easily found on the internet. Additionally, the ‘Evaluating Object Detection Results’ section from the COCO dataset paper will help clarify the specific variations used in different benchmarks (refer to Lin, Tsung-Yi, et al. "Microsoft coco: Common objects in context." _European conference on computer vision_. Springer, Cham, 2014). Another useful resource is the book "Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference" by Simon J.D. Prince. It provides an approachable, yet rigorous, discussion of performance evaluation in object detection.

In practical terms, your individual results should not be taken as standalone, as they are influenced by how mAP is calculated per image. Rather, the batch evaluation result provides a clearer and more meaningful understanding of how the model works across multiple samples, and the batch mAP is typically the single value reported in papers.

In conclusion, your observation isn't due to torchmetrics misbehaving. Instead, it’s a characteristic of how mAP is computed. Analyzing your model's performance, it is essential to be mindful of this characteristic, especially when comparing results obtained through different evaluation methods. The batch mAP is almost always the more relevant measure of overall model performance.
