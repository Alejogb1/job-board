Okay so you're getting that `glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred` warning in R huh Been there done that got the t-shirt and probably a few debugging scars too This is a classic and it usually means your logistic regression model is having a really hard time fitting the data properly Basically your model is trying so hard to make perfect predictions that its probabilities are getting squished right up against 0 or 1 and that makes the internal calculations go a bit haywire

I remember back in my early days probably 2015 or so I was working on some customer churn data a pretty standard problem for anyone dabbling in this stuff I had this nice dataset with a bunch of features like number of purchases last login time demographics the whole shebang And yeah I threw a logistic regression at it expecting some nice area under the curve AUC action What I got was this same damned `glm.fit` warning staring me in the face like a mocking digital owl

My initial reaction was panic typical newbie I started questioning everything Was my data garbage Was my model a hopeless case Was I just bad at this? After a caffeine induced deep breath I realized it wasn't the end of the world just a sign that something specific was off Let me break down what I've learned since then hopefully saving you some of the headache I went through

The core issue comes from when your model produces fitted probabilities that are incredibly close to 0 or incredibly close to 1 This isn't theoretically impossible but computationally it causes problems Because logistic regression uses the logit function that's the inverse of the sigmoid function if you get probabilities close to 0 or 1 the logit can approach negative or positive infinity respectively And then boom you're dealing with numerical instability R's `glm` function is quite sensitive to this and throws that warning as a heads up

So how do we fix this? Well there's a few avenues we can explore let’s start with the most common first

**1 Data Issues:**

*   **Separation:** This is a big one It means one or more of your predictor variables is perfectly separating your outcome variable for example if every single customer who used a certain feature churned your model will have no wiggle room and be tempted to assign probabilities of 0 and 1 to those respective groups It's like the model is trying to draw a line but the data points are perfectly arranged on opposite sides of the line making the slope go crazy
   *   **Solution:** Check for multicollinearity among the predictors and for perfect separation between the predictor and the dependent variable try adding regularization methods to your model (see regularization section below) A good old contingency table will often help to identify the separation
    *   Here is an example of calculating a contingency table on two of the columns in a dataset in R

```R
# Assuming your dataframe is called 'my_data' and your columns are 'feature_1' and 'churn'
# Adjust the names accordingly
contingency_table <- table(my_data$feature_1, my_data$churn)
print(contingency_table)
```
* **Sparse Data:** If you have too few examples of certain combinations of predictors the model can start making wild predictions because of the lack of information especially if you have high-dimensional data.
   *   **Solution:** Gather more data or combine rare categories of predictors. Feature engineering might be needed and consider regularization.

*   **Outliers:** Extreme values in your predictors can sometimes pull the model to extremes
    *   **Solution:** Explore and handle the outliers. Transformation of the data might be a solution.

**2 Model Issues:**

*   **Model Complexity:** If you have too many predictors relative to the amount of data the model might overfit and try to get the predictions right at all costs leading to those extreme probabilities I am talking about
    *   **Solution:** Consider feature selection using for example methods like the backward elimination of features or using a regularization technique.
*   **Multicollinearity:** When predictors are strongly correlated you are giving your model very redundant information and making it very hard to get coefficients it would not otherwise try to fit so hard
    *   **Solution:** Use variance inflation factors (VIF) and remove predictors or combine them into fewer features. Also regularization methods can help

Here's an example showing how to calculate VIFs in R:

```R
# Assuming 'model' is your fitted glm model object
library(car) # Package needs to be installed once
vif_values <- vif(model)
print(vif_values)
```

**3 Regularization (my personal favorite)**

Regularization is a powerful technique that penalizes the model for making overly extreme predictions It forces the coefficients to be smaller and prevents over fitting It can be implemented with L1 (Lasso) L2 (Ridge) or a combination of both (Elastic net) The idea is basically to not get crazy to use more “sane” coefficients even if the training data is not fitted perfectly

*   **Solution:** Try to incorporate regularization in your model

Here's an example of using L1 regularization with the `glmnet` package in R:

```R
# Assuming 'X' is your predictor matrix and 'y' is your outcome vector
library(glmnet) # Package needs to be installed once
cv_fit <- cv.glmnet(X, y, family = "binomial", alpha = 1) # alpha = 1 for lasso
best_lambda <- cv_fit$lambda.min
regularized_model <- glmnet(X, y, family = "binomial", alpha = 1, lambda = best_lambda)
```

**4. Advanced tricks**

Sometimes all the above will not be enough Here are some further ideas you can try:

*   **Using a different link function:** You can explore other link functions besides logit to help with these cases The most common one would be a probit function

*  **Adding prior distribution:** You can use Bayesian logistic regression that uses a prior distribution that will penalize extreme values

**Resources**

Now if you want to dive deeper than my quick explanation here are some resources I've found useful through the years.

*   "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie Tibshirani and Friedman This book is a must-have if you plan on being more serious about statistical modeling It’s a dense read but it covers all the bases including regularization methods in a very detailed way
*   "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by James Witten Hastie and Tibshirani This book is a lighter version of "The Elements" it covers more or less the same concepts but is easier to digest and includes great real-life examples It's a great start if you’re beginning your journey
*   "Applied Logistic Regression" by Hosmer Lemeshow and Sturdivant it is an in-depth look at logistic regression and it discusses various model issues and solutions it will be great for further deepening your understanding of the technique

Look if I am being honest the first time I saw this warning I almost threw my computer out of the window But yeah after a good night's sleep I realized that most of the problems were due to data issues or that the model was too complex or the data was having too much collinearity The funny thing is that the first solution I tried was to add more features thinking that it would solve everything like adding salt to a recipe that already has too much salt (I am not a chef) Yeah this just exacerbated the problem. It's all part of the learning process

Don't stress too much if you are seeing this warning just methodically check your data explore regularization methods and consider the complexity of your model You'll get there Eventually we always do (hopefully)
