Let's tackle this persistent issue of Telegram bot bans not sticking. From my past experiences, specifically with a bot designed for community moderation back in the 2018 timeframe, I've seen first-hand the various pitfalls that can lead to banned users reappearing as if nothing happened. It's frustrating, to say the least, but often the root cause is a bit more intricate than a simple malfunction. We’ll break it down into a few key areas and explore some code examples to illustrate the points.

Firstly, a core misunderstanding often revolves around the scope and persistence of Telegram's ban functionality. A ban initiated through the Telegram Bot API is, by default, *temporary* if you don’t specify a duration. Without an explicit `until_date` parameter, the ban will effectively be lifted after a relatively short time, often within minutes, which explains why users seem to magically reappear. This isn't a bug; it's how the api is designed to work.

The crucial aspect is the proper use of the `kickChatMember` method (or `banChatMember` in recent bot api versions, these have similar functionalities), specifically the `until_date` parameter. This parameter requires a unix timestamp to indicate *when* the ban should expire. If left absent, or if an earlier date is used, the ban becomes a temporary measure only. Also, it is critical to understand that a bot ban does not persist across different groups – each group is an independent context. Therefore, you'll need to implement the ban logic separately for each group. Furthermore, the ban feature does not, by default, remove previous messages; it only restricts a user's ability to post new content.

Here's an example illustrating the correct method usage with a Python-based Telegram bot framework (using `python-telegram-bot`, specifically, which was what I used on that moderation project):

```python
import telegram
import time

def ban_user(bot, chat_id, user_id, ban_duration_seconds=3600):
    """Bans a user for a specified duration."""
    try:
        until_date = int(time.time()) + ban_duration_seconds
        bot.ban_chat_member(chat_id=chat_id, user_id=user_id, until_date=until_date)
        print(f"User {user_id} banned in chat {chat_id} until {until_date}")
        return True
    except telegram.error.BadRequest as e:
        print(f"Error banning user {user_id} in chat {chat_id}: {e}")
        return False

# Example usage:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    bot = telegram.Bot(token='YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')  # Replace with your actual token
    chat_id = -123456789  # Replace with your chat ID
    user_id_to_ban = 987654321 # Replace with the user id you want to ban
    ban_duration = 7200 # two hours

    success = ban_user(bot, chat_id, user_id_to_ban, ban_duration)
    if success:
        print("Ban successful")
    else:
        print("Ban failed")


```

In this example, we set the ban duration for a defined number of seconds, and use `time.time()` to generate the current unix timestamp, and use this combined to correctly set the `until_date`. Without this specification, you'd encounter the very problem you are experiencing: short lived bans. Remember to replace `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` with your bot's actual token and `-123456789` with your chat id.

Secondly, another common mistake is the lack of a persistent database to keep track of banned users. Simply relying on the bot's memory will not work if the bot restarts or encounters errors. If you are not storing the ban information, a bot restart means all the bans are essentially forgotten. You need to maintain a record of banned users (and their expiry dates, if applicable) in an external storage solution such as a database. This will ensure that when the bot restarts or receives new updates, it can verify the user's ban status.

Here's an example of how you might incorporate a simple SQLite database into the same logic using Python:

```python
import telegram
import time
import sqlite3

def create_bans_table():
    """Creates the bans table if it doesn't exist."""
    conn = sqlite3.connect('bot_data.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bans (
            chat_id INTEGER,
            user_id INTEGER,
            until_date INTEGER,
            PRIMARY KEY (chat_id, user_id)
        )
    ''')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def ban_user(bot, chat_id, user_id, ban_duration_seconds=3600):
    """Bans a user for a specified duration and stores it in the database."""
    try:
        until_date = int(time.time()) + ban_duration_seconds
        bot.ban_chat_member(chat_id=chat_id, user_id=user_id, until_date=until_date)

        conn = sqlite3.connect('bot_data.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute('INSERT OR REPLACE INTO bans (chat_id, user_id, until_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
                       (chat_id, user_id, until_date))
        conn.commit()
        conn.close()

        print(f"User {user_id} banned in chat {chat_id} until {until_date}")
        return True
    except telegram.error.BadRequest as e:
        print(f"Error banning user {user_id} in chat {chat_id}: {e}")
        return False

def is_user_banned(chat_id, user_id):
        """Checks if a user is currently banned."""
        conn = sqlite3.connect('bot_data.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute('SELECT until_date FROM bans WHERE chat_id = ? AND user_id = ?', (chat_id, user_id))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        conn.close()
        if result is None:
            return False
        until_date = result[0]
        return until_date > int(time.time())

# Example usage:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_bans_table()
    bot = telegram.Bot(token='YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')  # Replace with your actual token
    chat_id = -123456789  # Replace with your chat ID
    user_id_to_ban = 987654321 # Replace with the user id you want to ban
    ban_duration = 7200  # two hours

    success = ban_user(bot, chat_id, user_id_to_ban, ban_duration)

    if success:
        print("Ban successful and saved to DB")
    else:
        print("Ban failed")


    # check banned status:
    if is_user_banned(chat_id, user_id_to_ban):
        print("User is currently banned.")
    else:
        print("User is not currently banned.")
```

Here, I've included `create_bans_table` to create the table if it doesn't exist and have modified the `ban_user` function to now persist this data within the sqlite database. The addition of the `is_user_banned` function is essential for checking and implementing restrictions on users based on stored data. You would modify your event handling code to include this function before acting upon new messages.

Lastly, a more subtle challenge comes from the way Telegram handles bot permissions and interactions, particularly in relation to user actions such as joining or leaving, which sometimes might be confusing. Ensure that the bot has admin rights within the chat, including the specific permission to ban members. Also, a user might circumvent a ban if, for instance, they were added to a group by another user. This underscores the need for consistent message handling logic that checks for a user’s ban status whenever they interact with the bot. For this, the `getChatMember` method is particularly useful, allowing you to pull user details and permissions.

Here's a conceptual snippet showing the use of `getChatMember` to address this problem:

```python
import telegram
import time

def handle_new_member(bot, chat_id, user_id):
    """Handles new members joining the chat, verifying ban status."""
    if is_user_banned(chat_id, user_id):
            try:
                bot.ban_chat_member(chat_id=chat_id, user_id=user_id)
                print(f"Re-banned user {user_id} in chat {chat_id}")
            except telegram.error.BadRequest as e:
                print(f"Error re-banning user {user_id} in chat {chat_id}: {e}")
    else:
        print(f"User {user_id} is not banned in chat {chat_id}")

# Example usage:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    bot = telegram.Bot(token='YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')  # Replace with your actual token
    chat_id = -123456789  # Replace with your chat ID
    new_user_id = 987654321  # Replace with the new user that joined

    handle_new_member(bot, chat_id, new_user_id)

```

In this example, we assume the `is_user_banned` function we developed previously. If the new member is banned, we proceed to re-ban them. This ensures consistent application of the ban rules in cases where a user might be added by others. You would typically call this in the relevant event handler provided by your bot framework (e.g. a `message_handler` that triggers on new joiners).

For a deeper understanding, I'd recommend diving into the official Telegram Bot API documentation, which is an authoritative resource. Additionally, "Programming Telegram Bots" by Syed Asad Naqvi provides useful practical examples and in-depth explanations of the bot development process. Finally, “Advanced Python Programming” by Dr. Mark Lutz includes detailed sections on databases and other concepts that will help you to build more robust bots. Remember, a comprehensive approach to these issues should involve correct temporal ban implementation, user persistence, and consistent enforcement of ban rules. It's rarely a singular cause for such behavior, but rather a combination of these factors.
