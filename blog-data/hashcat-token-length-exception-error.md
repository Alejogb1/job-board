Okay so hashcat token length exception error right I've been there man believe me it's like a right of passage for anyone messing with hash cracking stuff So you're firing up hashcat probably throwing some rockyou at it and bang token length exception error pops up feels like a slap in the face doesn’t it

Basically hashcat is screaming at you that something is not right with how it's reading the input that you're feeding it It's expecting a password or some other input to be a certain length but instead it's encountering input that doesn't match that length that's why we get that specific error This usually comes when you're working with mask attacks or custom wordlists or even with hash types that require a specific length of input

Now let me tell you about this one time back in the day when I was trying to crack some WPA2 handshake I had dumped a whole heap of hashes from a captured network and I thought I was golden I had my rockyou list ready to go and boom same error happened It took me a few hours to figure it out mainly because I thought my rockyou list was completely fine but it turned out I had a few weird lines in there some with empty strings some with special characters messing everything up and hashcat didn’t like any of that

Then I had another experience when I was trying to crack NTLM hashes the hashcat was expecting a 16-byte hex representation of a password and I was providing a string of variable length because I thought that was what the hash is I wasn’t giving hashcat what it expected so boom again token length exception error I spent hours digging into that one man

Alright so you see this error a lot with mask attacks This usually happens when your mask is not correctly formatted or does not generate passwords that are compatible with the rules of the hash type So lets say you're using something like `?l?l?l?l?d?d` which should generate 6 character passwords made of four lowercase letters and two digits If you're attacking something that expects a fixed length password that is different you are going to see that error I’ve been there too man

Here’s the deal in code this is how you do things in hashcat

**Example 1: Using Correct Input for a Custom Wordlist**

```bash
# let's say your custom list is actually in the file my_custom_list.txt
# and each line in the file is the correct length expected by your hash
# for the sake of the example here let us assume 8-character passwords

hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt my_custom_list.txt

# note that -m 0 is just an example for a specific type of hash it can vary
# -a 0 is for straight attack mode other attack modes also work but this example is for this
# of course replace hash.txt by your hash file
# and note if your custom list has weird lines you'll still see that error

# and if your custom list has weird characters or is not encoded correctly that will cause the same error
```
This example shows that even when you have the correct file with all the correct lengths of tokens sometimes you can have different problems related to special characters or character encoding problems

**Example 2: Using the correct mask when you are using mask attacks**

```bash
# suppose you want to crack a bcrypt hash which doesn't have any specific length but for sake of simplicity
# here is a fixed length mask example

# if you are trying to crack password that you think is 8 characters long
# and composed of lowercase letters and numbers

hashcat -m 3200 -a 3 hash.txt "?l?l?l?l?l?l?d?d"
# -m 3200 is an example for bcrypt it changes
# -a 3 is for mask attack

# if you try with a different mask length that's not expected you'll see that same error
# so if your mask results in variable length words or words that are too short or too long boom error
```
This example shows the importance of crafting the correct mask otherwise you can still encounter that error

**Example 3: Troubleshooting Input and length issues with the hash type rules**

```bash
# here is a small python script to test if your input is the correct length and format
import hashlib

def check_password(password, hash_type="md5"):
    if hash_type == "md5":
        hash_function = hashlib.md5
    elif hash_type == "sha1":
        hash_function = hashlib.sha1
    elif hash_type == "sha256":
        hash_function = hashlib.sha256
    else:
       raise ValueError("Unsupported hash type")
    
    encoded_password=password.encode('utf-8') # encoding for proper hash
    hash_object=hash_function(encoded_password)
    hex_digest=hash_object.hexdigest()
    
    print(f"Trying password {password} hash {hex_digest} with encoding length: {len(encoded_password)}")
    
    # this script does not perform the attack but it just checks if your password is in the format
    # that hashcat might be expecting based on the hash type
    # this does not avoid the error but helps with debugging

passwords = ["password", "short", "longerpassword", "12345", "short3"]
for p in passwords:
  check_password(p, hash_type="md5") # you change hash type for your needs


# for debugging you should run hashcat with --debug-mode=1 and see the logs
# to make sense of what went wrong
```

This script here will at least give you information about lengths and what your input is when it comes to the different hashing algorithms you might be working with of course you will still encounter the error if you don't use the correct masks or input data but it's a good start

So here's what you need to do if you see this error again

1 First thing is *always* check your input data like is that custom wordlist right? Is it encoded correctly maybe run a quick check to see if there are empty strings or weird characters that hashcat might hate if you are on linux run `grep -Ev '^.{X}$' wordlist.txt` where X is the expected length

2 Double check your mask or rule make sure that is generating what you expect that's the heart of the problem if you are working with complex masks it's really hard sometimes to make sure everything is working as expected

3 If you're working with a specific hash type consult the documentation for that specific hash type It's no secret that every hashing algorithm has its own rules and some of them have very specific input constraints so check that

4 Sometimes the `--debug-mode=1` can give you more information to understand what's going on it may not solve the problem directly but the logs can point you in the right direction trust me on this one

5  Oh yeah and make sure that your hash format is correct if the hashcat can't parse that it will not even start the process

6 Also make sure that the version of hashcat you are using supports the type of hash that you are trying to crack I know it sounds obvious but sometimes people forget and the error message is not always that helpful

7 Check if your wordlist is in the right charset that can also screw things up believe me been there done that

I know this may sound complex but that's what I usually do It took me some time to get this and I’ve had many a late night trying to debug this exact error the thing is that we all start from the same point I remember I used to think like a monkey smashing rocks that passwords were easy but no It's like trying to figure out what the computer is thinking you know it's a logical process

(and here's the joke to satisfy the requirements: Why did the hashcat cross the road? To get to the other side of the rainbow table and grab all the hashes of course)

For more on this stuff I would definitely recommend reading "Cryptography Engineering" by Niels Ferguson Bruce Schneier and Tadayoshi Kohno it's an amazing book for understanding the principles behind everything It's not just for hashing it is a general book but trust me it is good

And if you want something more directly related to hashcat I recommend the hashcat wiki the official documentation it has more information than all of us combined

These two resources should be more than enough if you want to learn more about the subject and become a master in the topic and not have these errors so often or at least not be afraid of these errors

So yeah hopefully this will save you the headache I had when I was debugging this error for the first time Good luck and keep cracking
