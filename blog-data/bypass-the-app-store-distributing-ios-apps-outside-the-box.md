```
// You can't directly distribute iOS apps outside the App Store to end users in a way they can easily download and install. 
// Apple's security restrictions prevent this.

// Here are the main options for distributing iOS apps outside the App Store:

// 1. Enterprise Distribution:
//  - Requires an Apple Developer Enterprise Program account (costs $299/year).
//  - Designed for internal distribution within organizations (at least 500 employees).
//  - You can create and distribute your own apps to devices within your organization. 
//  - Users must have the organization's provisioning profile installed on their devices.

// 2. TestFlight:
//  - Requires an Apple Developer Program account ($99/year).
//  - Allows you to distribute beta versions of your app to a limited number of testers. 
//  - Testers must have a TestFlight account and install the app from the TestFlight app.

// 3. Ad-Hoc Distribution:
//  - Requires an Apple Developer Program account ($99/year).
//  - Allows you to distribute your app to a maximum of 100 devices.
//  - Users must have the provisioning profile installed on their devices. 
//  - You can distribute via email, a website, or other methods.

// 4. Open-Source Distribution:
//  -  You can publish your app's source code on a platform like GitHub.
//  -  Users would need to download the source code, build the app themselves, and install it manually.

// None of these options fully satisfy your requirement of users directly downloading and installing from your website.
