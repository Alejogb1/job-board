Okay so you're wrestling with garbage collection and COM objects in PowerShell right I've been there man trust me it's a special kind of headache

Let me tell you a little something about my past life with this exact scenario I had this script that was automating some ancient Excel stuff interacting with a COM object provided by a third-party library and boy did it leak memory like a sieve I mean it wasn't just leaking it was gushing like a fire hydrant had sprung a leak after a few hours of operation the script would just fall over flat on its face and I'd have to restart it and it was so unreliable that it felt like dealing with a toddler throwing a tantrum every few minutes

So the core problem you're facing is that PowerShell and COM objects don't always play nice when it comes to garbage collection COM objects are basically living in another world that uses reference counting as their way of doing memory management and if PowerShell doesn’t explicitly tell them to release their resources it can get messy fast PowerShell's garbage collector works on a different schedule it doesn't know when or how exactly those COM objects are being used by the script and it won’t know when they are not needed anymore if you don't tell it explicitly

Here's the thing unlike managed .NET objects COM object resources dont free up automatically when PowerShell thinks it doesn't need them anymore you gotta explicitly tell them that you’re done with them by calling the .Dispose method or setting the variable to $null or sometimes by calling the .ReleaseComObject method and sometimes a combination of all those methods The tricky part is figuring out which way works for which object in my early days I’d have a script that worked in a development environment but would just bomb in a production system because of resource exhaustion it was a living hell

Now let’s dig into some examples and what you can do about it

**Example 1: The Classic Leak**

This first example shows what happens if you’re not careful and create a COM object and do nothing to clean it up

```powershell
$excel = New-Object -ComObject Excel.Application
$workbook = $excel.Workbooks.Add()
#Do some excel work here
#No cleanup whatsoever
```

This script looks harmless but its really not after running it once or twice it creates instances of excel that keeps running in the background using up ram resources and the object $excel variable has references to the excel object that are still active even after the script ends if you keep running the script it keeps creating more excel objects and you will see the resources being used skyrocket this is a simple example of a resource leak and what you want to avoid because sooner or later your script will die because of lack of ram resources or cause other system related problems its crucial to know the problem exists before you try to fix it and you have to know to look for it first

**Example 2: Explicitly Cleaning Up with $null**

This is a first attempt to handle resource cleanup its still not bulletproof but it is a better way of releasing resources from COM objects

```powershell
$excel = New-Object -ComObject Excel.Application
$workbook = $excel.Workbooks.Add()
#Do some excel work here

#Clean up
$workbook = $null
$excel.Quit()
$excel = $null
```
Setting a variable to $null tells PowerShell that you are done with the reference which should in theory signal to the .NET runtime to release the memory it was using but it is not 100% foolproof because the COM object may still hold references and not release the resources depending on the COM object implementation.

**Example 3: Using .Dispose() and [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ReleaseComObject()**

This approach usually works a little bit better and is preferred over just using $null although is not always enough but you will have a better chance at freeing up resources that way.

```powershell
$excel = New-Object -ComObject Excel.Application
$workbook = $excel.Workbooks.Add()
#Do some excel work here

#Clean up
$workbook.Close($false) #close without saving
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ReleaseComObject($workbook) | Out-Null
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ReleaseComObject($excel.Workbooks) | Out-Null
$excel.Quit()
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ReleaseComObject($excel) | Out-Null
$excel = $null
$workbook = $null

#add a forced garbage collect just in case
[System.GC]::Collect()
[System.GC]::WaitForPendingFinalizers()
```

Here we're using a combination of methods First we explicitly close the workbook and then we release all COM objects in reverse order of creation This ensures all references are released to the COM object by calling `[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ReleaseComObject()` we use `Out-Null` because it returns an int that we don't care about Finally, we set the variables to `$null` just to make sure PowerShell understands that it can free the references and to top it off we force a garbage collection but be careful when using `[System.GC]::Collect()` as it is not guaranteed to free the resources immediately but helps a little bit

One thing to remember is that COM objects can have dependencies and nested objects so make sure you release the object before you release their parent objects for example in the script above the `$workbook` variable needs to be released before `$excel` because it is created using `$excel.Workbooks.Add()` and if you try to release `$excel` before `$workbook` you risk having orphan objects using resources in the background the correct order of release is very important in this scenario

Also do not forget the very important line `$excel.Quit()` sometimes closing or even disposing does not close the main excel object and it keeps running on the background if you don't call this explicitly The devil is in the details when cleaning up COM objects

And this is not even touching error handling I had cases where an error would interrupt the flow and skip all the clean up code leaving resources dangling like a forgotten laundry load This also highlights the importance of good structured try catch blocks to handle exceptions and errors and ensure proper cleanup even when things go sideways

Also did you know that in some versions of PowerShell especially the older ones the garbage collector is more aggressive when it thinks it is in a remote session context which is why sometimes the same code will perform different depending if you running the same script from a remote session or directly on the computer this is a gotcha to take into account

You are probably asking yourself is there a way to automate this resource clean up process well yes but not really there are some modules that helps with that but they are not very reliable or 100% bulletproof but it is a step in the right direction there is no simple magic bullet to this problem unfortunately you always have to be mindful of how resources are used when dealing with COM objects

For further reading you could check out Jeffrey Richter's "CLR via C#" it's a classic but it goes deep into how the .NET garbage collector works which is essential for understanding the nuances of this problem Another good reference is "Essential COM" by Don Box for a more deep dive into COM architecture itself its a good read to understand how COM object are implemented and how they function it helped me a lot in my early days struggling with the problem it might be a bit outdated but still valid as a resource

So that’s it my friend it’s a tricky issue but with some patience and the right techniques you can avoid these memory leaks Remember to always clean up your COM objects using a combination of `$null` `.Dispose()` and `[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ReleaseComObject()` in the correct order and don't forget that `$excel.Quit()` call I know it looks like a lot of boilerplate code but it’s better than having your script crash in the middle of something important or have your script use all of your computer memory resources I wish there was a better way but sadly there is not

And always handle errors properly so that you can release those resources even if the script fails because what is worst than a failed script its a failed script that leaves resources dangling like a bad dream it will haunt you later you can trust me on that one from first hand experience

Happy scripting and may your COM objects be released properly! I think that was good enough response.
