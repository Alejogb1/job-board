Alright, let’s tackle this. It's a frustrating situation, staring at those zero accuracy scores after hours of training, isn't it? I've definitely been there, more times than I care to recall. What we are witnessing essentially signifies that the model isn't learning anything useful, and there are several common culprits. Let’s break them down.

One crucial area to examine first, which many developers often gloss over, is data preprocessing. I recall a project where we were working with image classification. Everything seemed fine, the network architecture was solid (at least on paper), yet, both training and validation accuracies were stuck at zero. After several frustrating days, the issue was traced back to the input data. We had forgotten to normalize the pixel values properly, leaving them in the raw, [0, 255] range. This resulted in extremely large gradients, which were causing the weights of the neural network to essentially explode and converge on random values. Zero accuracy wasn't surprising in that context.

Data normalization is crucial because it helps to balance the scales within the neural network, ensuring that no single feature dominates others and preventing numeric instability. When your input values have a widely disparate range, it becomes difficult for the optimization algorithm, like stochastic gradient descent, to find the optimal parameter values. Features with larger ranges will have a greater impact on the loss, potentially overshadowing smaller but equally important features.

Another frequent reason why accuracy is stuck at zero is the selection of an inappropriate loss function for your problem. If, for instance, you are dealing with a multi-class classification problem, but you are applying a mean squared error loss, things will break down quickly. Mean squared error (MSE) is designed for regression tasks, and using it for classification doesn't appropriately reflect the model's performance in predicting correct categories. The loss will be high irrespective of the accuracy, and the gradients calculated from the loss will lead the network to random outcomes. Similarly, if you have imbalanced classes in your dataset, using standard loss functions might not be the best approach. You might instead need to use weighted loss functions or employ other data balancing techniques.

Furthermore, the learning rate, a hyperparameter controlling the step size in gradient descent, plays a critical role. If the learning rate is too high, your model might skip over the local minimum of the loss landscape, resulting in chaotic behavior and failure to converge on meaningful predictions. Conversely, if the learning rate is too low, the model will train extremely slowly, potentially getting stuck at a saddle point and displaying negligible improvement in accuracy. It's like trying to find a specific spot on a map, and your steps either overshoot the location, or are too small to get you there.

Let's move on to some code examples for a clearer picture. I'll provide these in python using a very popular deep learning library, pytorch.

**Example 1: Data Normalization Issue**

Here we'll demonstrate the effect of not normalizing data on model training and accuracy. We’ll assume a simplified scenario involving 1000 data points.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Generate some random input data
torch.manual_seed(42)  # For reproducibility
input_data = torch.rand(1000, 10) * 255 # Without normalization
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (1000,)) # Binary labels

# Define a simple neural network
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 10)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(10, 1)
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
        return x

model = SimpleNet()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()  # Binary cross-entropy loss
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

dataset = TensorDataset(input_data, labels.float().unsqueeze(1))
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

for epoch in range(20):
    for inputs, targets in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    with torch.no_grad():
        correct = 0
        total = 0
        for inputs, targets in dataloader:
            outputs = model(inputs)
            predicted = (outputs > 0.5).float()
            total += targets.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == targets).sum().item()
        accuracy = correct/total
        print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

When running this code, expect to see negligible or zero accuracy. Now, let’s implement a corrected version where we normalize the data.

```python
# Normalized input data
normalized_input_data = input_data / 255.0 # Simple normalization
normalized_dataset = TensorDataset(normalized_input_data, labels.float().unsqueeze(1))
normalized_dataloader = DataLoader(normalized_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Train again with the same architecture and parameters
model = SimpleNet()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(20):
    for inputs, targets in normalized_dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    with torch.no_grad():
        correct = 0
        total = 0
        for inputs, targets in normalized_dataloader:
            outputs = model(inputs)
            predicted = (outputs > 0.5).float()
            total += targets.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == targets).sum().item()
        accuracy = correct / total
        print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, Normalized Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

This time, the model will exhibit significantly improved and non-zero accuracy, demonstrating the profound effect of normalization.

**Example 2: Incorrect Loss Function**

Let’s now see what happens when using an MSE loss for a classification problem. We will keep the normalization in place from the last example.

```python
# Reusing the data and dataloader from example 1

model = SimpleNet()
criterion = nn.MSELoss() # Incorrect loss
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(20):
    for inputs, targets in normalized_dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    with torch.no_grad():
        correct = 0
        total = 0
        for inputs, targets in normalized_dataloader:
            outputs = model(inputs)
            predicted = (outputs > 0.5).float()
            total += targets.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == targets).sum().item()
        accuracy = correct / total
        print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, MSE Loss Accuracy: {accuracy}')

```

This snippet will likely return poor performance and low accuracy scores. Switching back to `nn.BCELoss()` will improve the performance of the model, as seen in previous examples.

**Example 3: Learning Rate Issues**

Here's an illustration showing the impact of a high learning rate.

```python
# Reusing dataset, dataloader, and corrected loss from example 1
model = SimpleNet()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1.0) # High learning rate

for epoch in range(20):
    for inputs, targets in normalized_dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    with torch.no_grad():
        correct = 0
        total = 0
        for inputs, targets in normalized_dataloader:
            outputs = model(inputs)
            predicted = (outputs > 0.5).float()
            total += targets.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == targets).sum().item()
        accuracy = correct / total
        print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, High LR Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

You will likely see fluctuations in accuracy and it's unlikely to reach a good performance because the learning rate makes the model jump too far between iterations. By lowering the learning rate to `0.01`, you should obtain more stable and better accuracy.

In terms of further reading, I would highly recommend delving into *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. This is a comprehensive resource that covers many of the theoretical underpinnings and practical aspects of neural networks, including detailed explanations of gradient descent, loss functions, and data preprocessing. Furthermore, *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron provides a practical approach to implementing and debugging machine learning models. Understanding the specific chapters on data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning will be very beneficial. I've spent countless hours with both, and they have proven themselves to be invaluable resources.

In conclusion, seeing zero accuracy in your neural network is an indication that the model is fundamentally failing. Address the basic data handling, the appropriateness of the loss function, and critically, the learning rate. Once these issues are resolved, I am confident that you will start seeing the models learn from the data and generate meaningful results.
