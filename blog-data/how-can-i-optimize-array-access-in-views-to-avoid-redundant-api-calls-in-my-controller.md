Let’s tackle this, shall we? Array access within views often becomes a performance bottleneck, especially when those accesses trigger repeated calls back to your controller. I’ve personally encountered this issue more times than I care to remember, particularly in complex web applications with intricate data structures. The crux of the matter is that each access, if not carefully handled, can initiate a separate, unnecessary API or data retrieval event, leading to significant delays and increased server load. It's an efficiency sink that needs addressing early.

The core problem arises when the view attempts to directly access or manipulate data without any form of caching or pre-processing. In such scenarios, every time the view needs a piece of information, it makes a direct request, often triggering a database query or external service call. This pattern is inefficient, as it leads to numerous redundant fetches of identical data, especially when a single view renders multiple elements based on the same array. There are better ways.

Fundamentally, the solution pivots around minimizing the number of times the controller is queried. There isn't one single "silver bullet" approach, but a combination of strategies is usually the most effective. My own practice has gravitated toward three main techniques: pre-loading, pre-processing, and specialized view helpers.

First, pre-loading data within the controller. Instead of simply passing the raw, unprocessed array to the view, the controller should retrieve all required information in a single, optimized query, and format or enrich that data according to view's requirements. Let’s consider a situation where a view displays a list of user comments along with their associated usernames. Without pre-loading, the view might request the user information for each comment, one by one. This leads to n+1 query problem.

Here's a simplified example using pseudo-code to demonstrate that within the controller:

```pseudo-code
// Controller (Pseudo-code)
function get_comments_with_usernames() {
    $comments = database_query("SELECT * FROM comments");
    $user_ids = collect_user_ids($comments); //extract user IDs
    $users = database_query("SELECT id, username FROM users WHERE id IN ($user_ids)");

    // Now, associate users with their comments efficiently
    $comment_data = [];
    foreach($comments as $comment) {
        $user = $users[$comment->user_id]; //assuming id is the key in $users array
        $comment_data[] = [
            'text' => $comment->text,
            'username' => $user->username,
        ];
    }
    return $comment_data;
}

// Then pass $comment_data to view
```

In this example, the controller makes two database queries. The first fetches all comments, and the second fetches user information, avoiding multiple separate requests per comment. This data is then passed to the view already enriched. This approach minimizes database access and performs all the heavy processing before the view is rendered. This is a vast improvement over a naive implementation.

Secondly, pre-processing data via dedicated classes or helpers. This involves transforming the data from its raw form into a format that’s directly consumable by the view, further minimizing processing there. Often this involves creating data transfer objects (DTOs) or view models, which encapsulate the data specifically for the view's consumption. This way, view logic is simplified and further redundant calculations are avoided.

Here’s another pseudo-code example, this time using a separate data class or DTO:

```pseudo-code
// Data transfer object (DTO)
class CommentViewModel {
  public $text;
  public $username;

  function __construct($comment, $user) {
      $this->text = $comment->text;
      $this->username = $user->username;
  }
}

// Controller (Pseudo-code)
function get_comments_with_usernames_processed() {
    $comments = database_query("SELECT * FROM comments");
    $user_ids = collect_user_ids($comments);
    $users = database_query("SELECT id, username FROM users WHERE id IN ($user_ids)");

    $comment_data = [];
    foreach($comments as $comment) {
        $user = $users[$comment->user_id];
        $comment_data[] = new CommentViewModel($comment, $user); // Pass to DTO
    }
    return $comment_data;
}

//Then pass $comment_data (array of CommentViewModels) to the view
```

Here, we've created a `CommentViewModel` which handles the formatting of each comment's data and encapsulates the text and username. This means the view receives objects that are directly ready for display, requiring no additional logic.

Finally, specialized view helpers can further optimize array access within the view itself. These are utilities that perform specific tasks, like filtering or formatting, preventing those actions from being duplicated or needing to call back into the controller. For example, if a view needs to display only specific data from each array element depending on a condition, it's more efficient to handle the conditional logic within the view helper rather than making a conditional fetch each time.

Consider the following pseudo-code for such a helper within a view:

```pseudo-code
// View helper function (pseudo-code)
function display_user_info($user, $display_email=false) {
    $output = "<span>{$user->username}</span>";
    if ($display_email && isset($user->email)) {
        $output .= " <small>({$user->email})</small>";
    }
    return $output;
}

// View (Pseudo-code)
//assuming commentData is an array of objects with user and comment info

foreach ($commentData as $comment) {
    echo "<div class='comment'>";
    echo display_user_info($comment->user, true); // using our view helper
    echo "<p>{$comment->text}</p>";
    echo "</div>";
}
```

This helper function `display_user_info` formats the user information, including the email address conditionally. This helps prevent repetitive if statements within the view code and also hides the logic away, making the view simpler and cleaner. Each iteration of the loop doesn’t have to make multiple lookups or checks, enhancing performance.

These three methods—pre-loading data at the controller level, pre-processing data into view-specific models, and using view helpers—represent the most effective approaches in my experience. They collectively address the core issue of redundant API calls when accessing arrays in views by moving processing to more appropriate layers and caching results effectively.

For further reading, I’d highly recommend “Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture” by Martin Fowler for its comprehensive discussion on data transfer objects and architectural patterns. Also, "Refactoring" by Martin Fowler is an important resource to ensure proper data handling. For more focused database interaction optimization related to n+1 problems, articles from the "High Performance MySQL" by Baron Schwartz, Peter Zaitsev, and Vadim Tkachenko are excellent. These sources will provide a solid foundation for understanding and resolving these kinds of performance challenges effectively. The key takeaway is to understand where the processing needs to happen, and to structure your data flow accordingly for optimized performance and clean code.
