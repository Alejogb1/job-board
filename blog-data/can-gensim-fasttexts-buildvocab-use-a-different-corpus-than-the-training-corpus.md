Let's dive right into this. I've definitely been down this road before, and it’s a question that highlights a nuanced understanding of how gensim’s `FastText` model actually works under the hood. The short answer is: yes, gensim’s `FastText.build_vocab` *can* use a different corpus than what you'll use for training, but it comes with important caveats that need careful consideration.

Here’s the longer explanation, based on my experiences working on various natural language processing projects over the years, particularly with large and often disparate text datasets. Back in one project, I had to deal with a user-generated content platform that had a specific, curated, high-quality dataset, and a far messier, larger, everyday-content feed. I needed my embeddings to reflect the high-quality data while still being able to handle vocabulary from the larger dataset. It's that scenario, among others, that makes the distinction between `build_vocab` corpus and the training corpus essential.

The `build_vocab` method, in essence, is about constructing the vocabulary of your model. It scans your given text corpus and creates the mapping between tokens (words, characters, or n-grams depending on your setup) and their internal integer IDs that the model will use. This initial vocabulary definition impacts the later training process quite significantly. The vocabulary determines what your embedding matrix will look like and subsequently impacts any downstream tasks. If you then train with data *outside* of what was used during `build_vocab`, FastText will simply ignore the tokens it doesn’t recognize – it’ll treat them as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens. If you choose not to include these tokens in the initial vocabulary, your model's performance will suffer.

The most common approach is to use the same corpus for `build_vocab` and training. This makes intuitive sense: your vocabulary directly represents the language used during training. However, there are situations where it’s useful or even necessary to diverge, as in my past project scenario. For example, you might use a carefully selected dataset for vocabulary creation to ensure only high-quality tokens are captured, but then use a larger corpus of less refined text for the model’s actual training.

Here's a breakdown with some illustrative code examples to demonstrate this principle:

**Example 1: Same corpus for vocabulary and training**

This is the standard approach.

```python
from gensim.models import FastText
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s", level=logging.INFO)

sentences = [
    ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"],
    ["jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"],
    ["this", "is", "another", "sentence"]
]

model = FastText(sentences, vector_size=5, window=3, min_count=1, workers=4)
model.build_vocab(sentences)
model.train(sentences, total_examples=len(sentences), epochs=10)

print(model.wv.get_vector("fox"))
```

In this snippet, I've created a basic `FastText` model. I pass the same `sentences` list to the `FastText` constructor, `build_vocab`, and `train` functions. This is the most straightforward and expected use case.

**Example 2: Different corpus for vocabulary and training**

Here's where things get interesting:

```python
from gensim.models import FastText
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s", level=logging.INFO)

vocab_sentences = [
    ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"],
    ["jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]
]

train_sentences = [
    ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "ran"],
    ["a", "lazy", "cat", "slept", "nearby"],
    ["this", "is", "a", "new", "sentence", "with", "new", "words"]
]

model = FastText(vector_size=5, window=3, min_count=1, workers=4)
model.build_vocab(vocab_sentences)
model.train(train_sentences, total_examples=len(train_sentences), epochs=10)


print(model.wv.get_vector("fox"))
print(model.wv.get_vector("ran")) # This will be a zero vector because "ran" is OOV to model.wv
```

In this example, I use `vocab_sentences` solely for the `build_vocab` stage, and then use `train_sentences` for the actual training. Notice that the word “ran” is not in `vocab_sentences` – it will not have a word vector because it is considered OOV and treated as an unknown word, it defaults to a zero-vector. The training process will only modify the vectors for tokens already present in the vocabulary, as defined by `build_vocab`. This is crucial to understand. The word 'cat' would not be known either.

**Example 3: Using `update` method**

You can add to the vocabulary and train with new data using update functionality. This can avoid the need to rebuild the vocab all the time, as it can be costly:

```python
from gensim.models import FastText
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s", level=logging.INFO)

sentences1 = [
    ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"],
    ["jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]
]

sentences2 = [
    ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "ran"],
    ["a", "lazy", "cat", "slept", "nearby"]
]

model = FastText(sentences1, vector_size=5, window=3, min_count=1, workers=4)
model.train(sentences1, total_examples=len(sentences1), epochs=10)


model.build_vocab(sentences2, update=True) # adding new sentences to vocab

model.train(sentences2, total_examples=len(sentences2), epochs=10)


print(model.wv.get_vector("fox"))
print(model.wv.get_vector("ran")) # this now will have a vector
print(model.wv.get_vector("cat")) # this now will have a vector
```

Here, I start with the `sentences1` corpus, train a bit, and then use the `update=True` parameter in `build_vocab`, which adds new vocabulary from `sentences2` and allows it to train on the new vocabulary. Using this you can avoid rebuilding the full vocabulary from the beginning and add to it over time.

**Key Considerations**

*   **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Tokens:** Any token present in your training corpus but *not* in your `build_vocab` corpus will be considered an OOV token. Gensim handles this gracefully, using a zero vector for OOV tokens (as seen in Example 2).

*   **Performance Impact:** If a significant portion of your training corpus is OOV, the model’s performance will be affected negatively. The idea of having a separate vocab corpus should be approached thoughtfully.

*   **Rationale:** Typically, you would want a different corpus for `build_vocab` if you have a specific curated or reference vocabulary you’d like to work with, and that may not encompass your total training data. One can add to the vocabulary over time using `update=True` as needed.

*   **Min-count:** The `min_count` parameter during initialisation is a crucial way to prevent uncommon words appearing in your vocabulary, even if you don't use a distinct corpus.

**Further Reading**

To get a deeper understanding, I highly recommend looking at the following resources. They are foundational for natural language processing and understanding how word embeddings like FastText operate:

1.  **"Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin:** This is a classic textbook that delves into the theoretical underpinnings of NLP, including word embeddings. The relevant chapters explain the mechanics of embeddings, tokenization and vocabulary construction in great detail.

2.  **"Natural Language Processing with Python" by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper:** While this book is focused on NLTK, it offers valuable insights into the fundamentals of tokenization, vocabulary, and text processing. The first few chapters, are good stepping stones to understanding more advanced models like FastText.

3.  **Original FastText paper:** *“Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information”* by Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin and Tomas Mikolov. This is the seminal paper describing FastText and how it addresses issues with OOV words, even though its focus isn’t specifically about this question, reading the original paper will provide useful context.

In summary, while you can indeed use different corpora for `build_vocab` and training in gensim’s `FastText`, it's essential to be mindful of the implications. A well-defined process for managing your vocabulary, be it with a single corpus or separate ones, directly impacts the effectiveness of your embeddings and downstream tasks. It's not a matter of simple *can you* vs *can't you*; it's about *should you*, and more specifically, *why are you*. The specific use-case needs careful consideration.
