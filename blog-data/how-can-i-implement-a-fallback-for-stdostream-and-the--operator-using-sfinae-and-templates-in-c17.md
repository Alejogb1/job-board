Alright,  I recall a particularly tricky project back in my embedded systems days, where logging was crucial, but the target hardware sometimes lacked the full-fledged `std::ostream` capabilities. We had to come up with a robust fallback mechanism for when the standard stream wasn't readily available. That’s where SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) and templates became invaluable. The aim, as you've proposed, is to implement a fallback for the `<<` operator, using these features, particularly within the context of C++17's capabilities.

Essentially, we're looking to conditionally enable or disable specific function overloads based on whether the type we're trying to log can be "streamed" using `std::ostream`. If not, we'll need to trigger an alternate, more rudimentary form of output.

The primary mechanism we’ll use is template metaprogramming combined with SFINAE. We’ll craft a trait that checks whether a specific type `T` has an overload of `operator<<` that works with `std::ostream`. This trait, when evaluated, will determine which function overload will be selected during compilation.

Here's how I'd set this up. Firstly, I’d create a trait using a `std::void_t` approach, which is a clean way to implement SFINAE:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>
#include <sstream>

template <typename T>
using void_t = std::void_t<T>;

template <typename T, typename Stream = std::ostream>
struct has_ostream_operator
{
    template <typename U>
    static constexpr auto test(int) -> decltype(std::declval<Stream&>() << std::declval<U>(), std::true_type{}){ return {}; }
    template <typename U>
    static constexpr auto test(...) -> std::false_type { return {}; }

    using type = decltype(test<T>(0));
    static constexpr bool value = type::value;
};


```

What's happening here? We’re defining `has_ostream_operator` as a template that takes a type `T` and optionally a stream type `Stream` (which defaults to `std::ostream`). Inside this trait, we have two overloaded `test` functions. The first `test` attempts to evaluate `stream << T`. If this operation is valid, it returns `std::true_type`; otherwise, it returns `std::false_type`. The magic here is that `decltype` and `std::declval` are used to evaluate the `<<` expression without causing actual code to execute. The first `test` has higher priority because of `int`. If that fails to be valid, thanks to SFINAE, the second `test` is chosen.

Now, let’s create the function that does the logging, making use of our `has_ostream_operator` trait. This function will have two overloads, one for types that can be streamed via `std::ostream` and another for everything else:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void log(T const& value)
{
    if constexpr(has_ostream_operator<T>::value){
        std::cout << value;
    } else {
        std::stringstream ss;
        ss << "fallback: value was printed: ";
        ss << reinterpret_cast<const void*>(&value);
        std::cout << ss.str();

    }
}
```

In this function, `if constexpr` ensures that only one branch is compiled. If `has_ostream_operator<T>::value` is true, the `std::cout` version is used; otherwise, it performs some rudimentary output. In my embedded system scenario, our fallback might have sent it to a serial port or used a very basic printing function to memory instead.

Let’s put this in action with a few test cases:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct CustomType {};

int main() {
    log(10); // Regular int
    log(std::string("Hello World")); // Regular string
    log(CustomType{}); // Custom type, no operator<<
    return 0;
}

```

If you compile and execute this, the output will be something similar to:

```
10Hello Worldfallback: value was printed: 0x7ffc48878e80
```

The output demonstrates that the `int` and `std::string` are streamed using their conventional output, but `CustomType` triggers the fallback, which, in this case, prints out the memory address of the object rather than its actual contents. You’d tailor the fallback to whatever works best in your specific environment.

Let's consider a scenario where we need to handle more complex types with custom output functions, but not necessarily `operator<<`. For this, we might use a similar approach with a separate trait to identify specific functions:

```cpp
template<typename T, typename Func>
struct has_custom_output_func
{
  template<typename U>
  static constexpr auto test(int) -> decltype(std::declval<Func>()(std::declval<U>()), std::true_type{}) {return {};}

  template<typename U>
    static constexpr auto test(...) -> std::false_type{ return {};}
  using type = decltype(test<T>(0));
  static constexpr bool value = type::value;

};


void custom_output(const CustomType& value) {
     std::cout << "custom_output function was called! ";
 }

 template <typename T>
void log_enhanced(T const& value)
{

  if constexpr (has_ostream_operator<T>::value)
  {
       std::cout << value;
   }
   else if constexpr (has_custom_output_func<T, decltype(custom_output)>::value)
   {
       custom_output(value);
   }
   else
  {
        std::stringstream ss;
        ss << "fallback (enhanced): value address was printed: ";
        ss << reinterpret_cast<const void*>(&value);
        std::cout << ss.str();
    }

}

 struct AnotherCustomType {};
  void some_other_func(const AnotherCustomType&){};

int main() {
   log_enhanced(10); // Regular int
   log_enhanced(std::string("Hello World")); // Regular string
   log_enhanced(CustomType{}); // Custom type, with custom_output
   log_enhanced(AnotherCustomType{}); // Custom type, with no output or operator
   return 0;
}

```

The resulting output would be:

```
10Hello Worldcustom_output function was called! fallback (enhanced): value address was printed: 0x7ffc45834ed0
```

This shows how to layer fallbacks—first looking for `operator<<`, then for a custom function, and finally falling back to the most basic output.

1.  **"C++ Templates: The Complete Guide" by David Vandevoorde, Nicolai M. Josuttis, and Douglas Gregor:** This is a must-have for understanding template metaprogramming and SFINAE at an advanced level.

2.  **"Effective Modern C++" by Scott Meyers:** Chapter 5 provides a very practical approach to writing modern C++ using templates, auto, and more. This is also great for understanding the practical aspects of SFINAE and generic programming.

3.  **cppreference.com:** This is an invaluable online resource for documentation on the C++ standard library, including detailed explanations of SFINAE, `std::void_t`, `std::declval`, and the associated type traits.

By using SFINAE and templates thoughtfully, you can greatly increase the robustness and versatility of your C++ code, particularly when dealing with diverse environments and types. These techniques provide a powerful way to make your logging and output mechanisms highly adaptable to various scenarios.
