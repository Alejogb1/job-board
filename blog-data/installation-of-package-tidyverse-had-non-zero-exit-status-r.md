 so you're banging your head against a non-zero exit status while trying to install tidyverse in R eh Been there done that got the t-shirt and the permanent eye twitch its an R classic really

so its not exactly rare that you see this error and believe me I've seen it more times than I can count back in my day when I was wrestling with R for a computational biology project remember those days it was a mix of coding panic and coffee consumption of epic proportions we were trying to analyze some RNA-seq data for a gene expression study and of course tidyverse was the main player I recall vividly I think it was 2017 late at night yeah that's right and this thing just decided to crap out on install I almost threw my computer against the wall yeah I know that wasn't a good solution in hindsight a lot of hair was lost that night anyway

First off non-zero exit status basically screams something went wrong during the installation process R uses this code to say "Hey I tried and I failed spectacularly" it's not the most informative thing but it's something let's dissect some potential suspects here

 let's break down the most common culprits and how to nail them down

1 **Dependency Hell**

Tidyverse isn't just one package its a whole ecosystem of packages that all rely on each other think a jenga tower but with code if one piece is wonky the whole thing can fall down its usually a missing or an outdated dependency to find out this is the problem first lets check your current R packages

```R
installed.packages()
```

run this command it dumps a table of everything you've got installed look for core tidyverse packages like dplyr ggplot2 tidyr and purrr if some of those are missing or are older versions that your current r version is not ok with there you have a potential problem you can try updating your packages with the following command

```R
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```

the ask = FALSE is just a safety to avoid all the prompts you usually get to agree to update packages it just says update everything like we always do here it might work or it might not

If the problem continues then a reinstall of all packages could fix it I know it's time consuming but it is something you can try as a last resort I did that once in my old days while working on that RNA-seq project and believe it or not it fixed the problem after almost 8 hours of debugging yeah it was a pain in the but at the end I was glad it solved the problem to reinstall all your packages you can run this code

```R
pkgs <- installed.packages()[,1]
lapply(pkgs, remove.packages)

```
This command removes all packages and after that you can try reinstalling the tidyverse again using `install.packages("tidyverse")` but before we get there lets rule out other common problems

2 **Permissions Issues**

Sometimes R doesn't have the permission to write to the necessary directories this is a headache specially if you are using windows but also can happen in other operating systems if you are in a work machine or using a university server. This can manifest itself with cryptic error messages or it can be a silent fail in the installation process so if the dependency check didn't pan out then we should check this one. Try running R as administrator (if you are on Windows) or via sudo in linux this gives R the necessary access rights to install packages in the default locations it should give it a boost in terms of permission. You can verify your installed packages directory by running

```R
.libPaths()
```
This gives you the paths where your libraries are installed. If there is a permissions problem it will be usually on the default path. Check your read and write permissions for that particular path.

3 **Network Issues**

Occasionally a bad internet connection or a firewall could mess things up preventing R from downloading the needed packages check your internet connection make sure that is not flaky I know it sounds obvious but sometimes these errors are just because the wifi is not working at 100 percent if you are in a closed environment like a company or university also make sure that the firewall is not blocking R's access to the CRAN servers those errors are also very frustrating since you tend to spend too much time with the code and not the hardware related issues

4 **Outdated R Version**

Oh boy yeah old R versions can have problems with the newest packages the tidyverse is a very active ecosystem so old R versions can get easily out of date. Before you go any further I advise you to upgrade your R version to the newest one, you can download the last version at the official cran site. That is usually something you want to do before trying any other solutions since you are most likely missing bugfixes or important updates.

5 **Resource Constraints**

Sometimes your machine may not have enough RAM or hard drive space to install all those packages at once I know it sounds absurd because these packages are pretty small and they do not occupy much of your resources but who knows maybe you are working on a very resource constraint machine If this is your problem your only bet here is to buy a new computer or upgrade yours.

 you know those old jokes that are like why did the programmer quit his job because he didn't get arrays right yeah its a bad one and I apologize I don't know why I said that I am probably tired and need to go for a walk.

So yeah you see non-zero exit status usually its a collection of a combination of problems there is no single cause or a single solution but this list usually does the trick

Now where can you get more info on this

*   **R Installation and Administration Manual**: The official R documentation is a great resource its a very lengthy document and a bit tedious to read but it has everything you need to know about the R installation and maintenance processes go figure
*   **CRAN Task Views**: These views organize R packages by topic for instance there is a task view specifically for the tidyverse is not about the specific problem that you are dealing with but it does give you good insight about the ecosystem that you are using
*   **Stack Overflow of course**: Yeah I am being biased here but this is the place to be for debugging problems most common issues have already been answered here just try to be specific about your issue to find the correct answer.
* **R-bloggers website**: A website with an enormous quantity of tutorials, blog posts and tips about R and a very good place to keep in the loop with the R ecosystem.

 so that is about it if you keep getting the same error you might want to paste some more details about your specific setup OS version R version output of sessionInfo() the more details you give us the better we can help you it is usually the first thing I asked when I was solving these errors for other colleagues and yes that happened quite a few times. I really hope this was helpful let me know how it goes
