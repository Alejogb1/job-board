 so you’re wrestling with `separate` in R right splitting one column into multiple based on a delimiter I’ve been there trust me It's a common data wrangling pain point especially when you're dealing with messy data and let me tell you that I know this all too well been there done that got the t-shirt or rather the stack overflow badge

First off let’s be clear `separate` from the `tidyr` package is your friend in this scenario It's like a data surgeon it cuts things up neatly into what you need it to be You probably already know `dplyr` if you're using `separate` but just a reminder both are parts of the `tidyverse` which is super useful when you start dealing with more complicated stuff

Now let's get down to brass tacks you have a column of data you want to split let's say you have something like this in a dataframe named `my_data`

```
   id                 compound
1  1      compound_A-part1_part2
2  2 compound_B-partX_partY_partZ
3  3           compound_C-onlyone
```

and what you're after is this:

```
   id    compound part1 part2 part3
1  1 compound_A    part1 part2  <NA>
2  2 compound_B    partX partY partZ
3  3 compound_C    onlyone  <NA>  <NA>
```

See what I mean so the `-` delimiter is splitting on part1 etc and those also can have the `_` delimiter and that's what `separate` can do for you quite nicely

The most basic use case looks like this

```r
library(tidyverse)

my_data <- tibble(
  id = 1:3,
  compound = c("compound_A-part1_part2", "compound_B-partX_partY_partZ", "compound_C-onlyone")
)


my_data_separated <- my_data %>%
  separate(
    col = compound,
    into = c("compound", "part1", "part2", "part3"),
    sep = "-"
  )

print(my_data_separated)

```

Here `col = compound` specifies which column to split `into` is an argument containing a character vector telling the names of the new columns and `sep = "-"` is the separator. Notice how I also used a `tibble` for data so it's more reproducible because people tend to use `data.frames` which is  but `tibbles` are slightly more refined to be used with `tidyverse` functions

Now you mentioned “as many columns” this is where it gets interesting and can be a pain if you do not think it through carefully `separate` can handle cases with a variable number of split parts it will just create `NA` in the columns if they do not exist so in this case the column parts need to be the same

```r
library(tidyverse)

my_data <- tibble(
  id = 1:3,
  compound = c("compound_A-part1_part2", "compound_B-partX_partY_partZ", "compound_C-onlyone")
)


my_data_separated <- my_data %>%
  separate(
    col = compound,
    into = c("compound", paste0("part", 1:3)),
    sep = "-",
    fill = "right"
  )
print(my_data_separated)
```

I just generated the column names dynamically using `paste0` and a sequence of numbers instead of explicitly typing them out that is generally a good approach when you are unsure how many parts there might be. Now this will work with the above example and split to what you need.

But what if you had something more complex lets say your delimiter within the parts is `_` well that is where using a secondary separator can really help

```r
library(tidyverse)

my_data <- tibble(
  id = 1:3,
  compound = c("compound_A-part1_part2", "compound_B-partX_partY_partZ", "compound_C-onlyone")
)


my_data_separated <- my_data %>%
  separate(
    col = compound,
    into = c("compound", "parts"),
    sep = "-",
    fill = "right"
  ) %>% separate(
      col = parts,
      into = c("part1", "part2", "part3"),
      sep = "_",
      fill = "right"
    )

print(my_data_separated)
```

So that will first split the compound and parts with `-` and then it will split the part's column into the final parts as in part1 part 2 and part 3 with `_` as the separator.

Now if your data has inconsistencies with delimiters like in a situation where the `-` might be missing in some places or the underscores are not consistent `separate` will be able to help but it will create `NA` so it's always a good idea to look at the results carefully and check those `NA`s to know what has happened.

One thing to keep in mind is that `separate` can be a bit verbose and it's often the case that there are other methods to do this for example if it is an edge case where you have some weird or extremely nested situations with several delimiters you might want to use `stringr::str_split` then you could add multiple columns using `dplyr::mutate` to help if `separate` is becoming too complicated. But generally, `separate` is straightforward when you have a single column that you wish to split with clear delimiters.

Now a little cautionary note if the number of parts on the split varies a lot and you need to perform operations on each part it could be a sign that your data might benefit from a long format data structure instead of the wide format this will mean a lot of reshaping and restructuring using `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider` but that might be a discussion for another time.

Resources wise for learning more about `tidyr` and data manipulation in general you cannot go wrong with Hadley Wickham’s *R for Data Science* book it is pretty much the bible for data wrangling in R and is available online freely although it’s good to have a hard copy for quick references or you can find several courses on platforms such as Coursera or Datacamp but I am not allowed to give the links here sorry. For a deep dive into string manipulation in R specifically I also would recommend *Hands-On Programming with R* by Garrett Grolemund which has a solid chapter on strings and the `stringr` package. Oh yeah and of course the online documentation for `tidyr` is very comprehensive and usually answers most of the questions.

And a quick joke for your troubles why did the R programmer quit his job Because he didn't get arrays haha I know it's terrible but I had to anyway.

So yeah hope this helps you out with your data splitting endeavors and happy coding.
