Alright, let's unpack this peculiar situation. It's not uncommon, and I recall encountering this exact issue during a particularly frustrating project involving containerizing a .net core application a few years back. It led me down several rabbit holes, eventually highlighting some key networking and configuration aspects often overlooked when spinning up docker containers. The question of why Docker, specifically, fails to resolve 'api.nuget.org' often points not to a docker issue per se, but rather to problems within the container's networking setup, the underlying host system, or sometimes even misconfigured DNS settings. It's rarely a 'docker is broken' scenario but rather an interplay of several things, which we will dissect.

First, understand that docker containers by default operate within their own isolated network namespace. This isolation is a cornerstone of docker's utility, allowing for repeatable environments. But this means that a container cannot simply inherit the host machine's network configuration. While docker containers do default to leveraging the host machine's dns resolver, this isn't always the case, and misconfigurations or custom setups can easily deviate from this default behavior.

One of the first suspects, when resolution fails, is the container's dns configuration. Docker utilizes a dns server to translate domain names into ip addresses. By default, it will often forward requests to the host machine’s dns configuration, which is great when all goes to plan. However, a common problem happens when this forwarding is unsuccessful, either due to an incorrect network setup within docker, firewall interference, or even an inconsistent resolv.conf file inside the container. You'll often see errors in container builds like “could not resolve host api.nuget.org” during `dotnet restore`, indicating a name resolution failure.

Another common gotcha is network driver selection. Docker utilizes different network drivers, and the default ‘bridge’ driver might not always work as expected, especially in intricate networking setups. You might find that switching to the ‘host’ network driver, which directly uses the host's network stack, resolves the name resolution issue but at the cost of isolation. Alternatively, creating a custom network with a specified DNS server using flags like `--dns` on the `docker run` command might be required. However, a better approach is usually to understand why the default behavior is not working as intended.

Firewall configurations on the host are another point of failure. If the host machine's firewall blocks connections from the docker subnet or the docker daemon itself, name resolution, or any external traffic, will fail. The firewall rules must be configured to allow traffic on the specific ports and protocols the containers use.

To illustrate these points, let's consider a few scenarios with accompanying code snippets. Note these are simple examples to demonstrate specific situations, not production ready code:

**Scenario 1: Default Bridge Network Failure with DNS Issues**

Suppose you try to run a simple alpine based container, and `ping api.nuget.org` fails. Here's what that might look like and how you might start investigating it.

```bash
# try running a container and pinging api.nuget.org
docker run --rm alpine:latest sh -c "ping api.nuget.org"

# You might get output like:
# ping: bad address 'api.nuget.org'

# then try to peek at the resolv.conf inside the container
docker run --rm alpine:latest cat /etc/resolv.conf

# which could give you something like this:
# nameserver 127.0.0.11
# options ndots:0

```

This indicates the container is using docker's internal dns resolver, not the host machine's. If the container’s internal dns server cannot reach the host’s configuration, or the host's resolver itself has issues, you’ll have the problem.

To temporarily fix this, you could explicitly provide a public dns server like google's to the container during runtime using the `--dns` flag like so:

```bash
docker run --rm --dns 8.8.8.8 alpine:latest sh -c "ping api.nuget.org"

# this should now resolve successfully
```

**Scenario 2: Inconsistent Host resolv.conf**

Another potential issue is an improperly configured `resolv.conf` file on the host machine. This file defines the dns resolvers that the host (and by default, the containers) use. If it points to non-functional or unreachable servers, this will cascade down to docker.

To illustrate, let’s say we modify `/etc/resolv.conf` on our host (do *not* do this in a production environment, it's strictly for educational purposes). Let's pretend it only has a non-functional DNS resolver.
```bash
# let's pretend this is our host's resolv.conf
# nameserver 192.168.1.100  (this is non-functional, let's assume)

# Now, even if the container tries to forward to host dns, it will fail.
# Run the default container ping
docker run --rm alpine:latest sh -c "ping api.nuget.org"

# which will fail as described above.
```

A proper fix would involve correcting the `resolv.conf` file on the host system to point to valid dns resolvers, which is a system-specific operation.

**Scenario 3: Firewall Blocking Docker Network**

Finally, let’s consider the firewall scenario. Assume that the host firewall is blocking outgoing traffic from docker's subnet (usually something like 172.17.0.0/16). In this case, name resolution *and* general traffic will likely be impacted.

```bash
# first let's show the docker network information
docker network inspect bridge

# you might see something like:
# "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16"
# which implies that the container traffic comes from addresses within 172.17.0.0/16 range

# If your firewall blocks the 172.17.0.0/16 range, containers cannot connect to anything externally
# Even if the DNS is working, data transfer won't complete.
# docker run --rm alpine:latest sh -c "wget api.nuget.org"
#  ... will result in a network timeout, not a DNS resolution error, but it's related to the broader network issue.

```

The solution here involves modifying the host's firewall rules to allow outgoing traffic from the docker's subnet (172.17.0.0/16 in this case). The specific commands for this are dependent on the firewall software you are using (e.g., `iptables`, `ufw`).

For further in-depth study, I would highly recommend reading "Docker in Action" by Jeff Nickoloff and "Linux System Administration" by Vicki Stanfield. They provide an excellent grounding in networking concepts and the underlying mechanics of how Docker handles these situations. Also, examining the Docker documentation on container networking is essential; it breaks down the various drivers and their usage in far more detail than i can here. Specifically, focus on the "container networking" section within the official docs. Finally, become familiar with the `resolv.conf` file specification; it is a foundational part of any Linux system's networking. Debugging these kinds of issues requires an understanding of this fundamental layer, so research on the "resolv.conf(5)" man page and related tutorials online is essential. Remember, these situations are rarely black and white, but rather involve subtle interplay between configurations. Careful examination of the container, host, and networking environment is almost always the key to resolving the matter.
