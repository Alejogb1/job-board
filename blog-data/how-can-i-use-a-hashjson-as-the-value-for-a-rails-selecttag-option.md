Right, let's unpack this. I've seen this pattern crop up a fair bit over the years, particularly when dealing with complex form interactions in rails applications. It’s a legitimate requirement when you need to transmit more than just a simple id or a string via a form select, and it’s one of those seemingly simple tasks that can quickly lead you down a rabbit hole if not handled carefully. The key here is understanding how HTML form data is submitted and how Rails processes it, and then crafting a solution that plays nicely with those mechanics.

The core challenge is that HTML `<select>` tags are designed to submit string values, not complex data structures like hashes or json objects. Rails, being a server-side framework, expects data from the form submission to be structured as key-value pairs. So, when we want to pass something more intricate, we need a strategy for encoding that data into a string format that can be transmitted, and then decode it back to its original structure on the server side.

My initial approach usually involves leveraging a clever combination of string serialization, and more specifically, stringification that allows us to represent the hash as a compact text format. Then, we use javascript on the client-side to encode and decode this value, and Rails on the server-side to handle it on the backend.

Here's how it typically plays out, using an example where each option in a select tag represents a user with multiple attributes:

```ruby
  # app/helpers/application_helper.rb
  module ApplicationHelper
    def user_options_with_details(users)
      options_for_select(users.map { |user|
        [
          user.name,
          { id: user.id, email: user.email, role: user.role }.to_json
        ]
      })
    end
  end
```

In this snippet, I'm using the `options_for_select` method which is designed for use in `select_tag` helpers. Note that the values for each option are being created with the `.to_json` method. This converts the ruby hash into a json string, preserving the structured data.

Now, in your view, you’d use this helper as follows:

```erb
  <%= select_tag :selected_user, user_options_with_details(@users), id: 'user-select' %>

  <script>
    document.getElementById('user-select').addEventListener('change', function(event) {
      const selectedValue = event.target.value;
      if (selectedValue) {
        try {
          const userData = JSON.parse(selectedValue);
          console.log("Selected User Data:", userData);
          // you can now access userData.id, userData.email, etc., for further processing
          // For example, set hidden input field
          document.getElementById('hidden_user_id').value = userData.id;

        } catch (e) {
          console.error("Error parsing JSON:", e);
          //handle the error, for example, reset or throw
        }
      }
    });
  </script>

  <%= hidden_field_tag :user_id, '', id: 'hidden_user_id' %>

```

Here, the ruby logic generates the options as JSON strings. In the `<script>` block, we attach an event listener to the `select` element. When the user selects an option, the javascript retrieves the selected value (the JSON string), and uses `JSON.parse` to convert it back into a javascript object. From there, you can access the properties in the javascript object such as `userData.id`. Here I've added an example of how you might use a hidden field to send the `id` to the backend.

On the Rails side, the controller receiving the form data would see a parameter called `user_id`, with the value that has been assigned through javascript. If we were handling more than just the `id`, we could have directly passed the encoded json string and then use JSON.parse on the backend, for example:

```ruby
  # app/controllers/your_controller.rb
  def create
      selected_user_data = params[:selected_user]
      if selected_user_data.present?
        begin
            user_data = JSON.parse(selected_user_data)
             # Now user_data is hash, for example  { "id" => 1, "email" => "example@example.com", "role" => "admin" }
             # Do something with user_data, for example find a user
             @user = User.find(user_data["id"])
           rescue JSON::ParserError => e
            # handle json parsing error
             puts "JSON parsing error: #{e.message}"
          end
       else
         #handle no user data
       end
       #Rest of your logic
    end

```

This code snippet on the controller side parses the JSON string sent from the form and uses it, in this case finding a user using `User.find`. The example also shows how to handle errors caused by parsing invalid JSON.

This technique is versatile. It's not just for users; it can be applied to any scenario where you need to represent complex structured data within a select tag.

It's crucial to consider the scale of your data when using this approach. While it's acceptable for smaller sets of data, serializing and parsing larger json strings on a server side can impact performance, especially for large selects. For substantial datasets, consider loading data asynchronously with an ajax call to populate the select, or if possible, only send the id back to the server.

For more details, you’ll find ‘Programming Ruby’ by Dave Thomas and others to be a superb resource for understanding how ruby treats objects and how you can work with those. The official Rails documentation, available at guides.rubyonrails.org, offers the clearest guidance on form helpers and handling request parameters. Finally, “JavaScript: The Good Parts” by Douglas Crockford is absolutely essential for understanding JSON parsing and manipulation within javascript.

In summary, using json for select tag values, while not a native HTML feature, is a practical solution when dealing with structured data. You can use this technique to greatly enhance the capabilities of your web forms in Rails applications and is one of those useful skills that any experienced developer should keep handy. By encoding the data on the front end, and decoding it again on the back end, we bridge the gap between HTML form expectations and the needs of complex web application requirements.
