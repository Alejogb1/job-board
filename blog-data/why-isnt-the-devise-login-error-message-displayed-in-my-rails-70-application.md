,  It's a classic issue, actually, and I've seen it more than a few times over the years. You've got a Rails 7.0 app using Devise, and for some reason, the login error messages aren't showing up. It's frustrating, because Devise *should* handle this out of the box, but sometimes the defaults aren't quite what you expect. From what I've observed, there are a few common culprits, and we can dive into them with a bit of code analysis.

The usual suspect is usually related to how you're handling form rendering and error display within your views. Devise controllers handle authentication and set errors in flash messages, specifically `flash[:alert]`. The view, however, needs to actively check for and then display that message, and it's very easy for that part to go amiss, especially after you've customized the view.

First, let’s ensure Devise is correctly set up. You've mentioned Rails 7.0, so the configuration should be standard, but it's always good to check the basics: ensure you have devise in your `Gemfile`, and your user model has `devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable` at least, which depends on the functionalities you’re using. This is usually done via the generator `rails g devise:install` and `rails g devise user`.

Now, assuming that’s done, let's break down the view-related parts. Specifically, we need to address three main reasons I've frequently observed as the root causes of the error message not displaying:

**1. Missing Flash Message Rendering in the Layout**

This is the most frequent reason. Devise stores error messages in the `flash[:alert]`, but if your application layout does not actively render that flash message, then it will not be visible to the user. Your `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` (or equivalent layout) must have code that specifically looks for and displays the error messages.

Here’s a typical example of how to handle flash messages:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Your App Name</title>
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%= csp_meta_tag %>

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
    <%= javascript_importmap_tags %>
  </head>

  <body>
    <main class="container">
      <% if flash[:notice] %>
        <div class="alert alert-success"><%= flash[:notice] %></div>
      <% end %>
      <% if flash[:alert] %>
        <div class="alert alert-danger"><%= flash[:alert] %></div>
      <% end %>

      <%= yield %>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```
In this snippet, the `if flash[:alert]` conditional checks for the presence of a flash message in the `alert` key, and if found, it displays that message wrapped within a `div` of class `alert alert-danger` which can be customized according to your styling preferences. This rendering logic ensures that flash messages passed by Devise are displayed. Without a block like this, the messages silently disappear. I've worked on quite a few projects where that particular block had been overlooked.

**2. Incorrect Form Rendering or Customization**

Sometimes, the issue isn't the layout itself but the form you're using to sign in. If you've manually created or highly modified the sign-in form, it's possible that the default Devise form error handling has been disrupted.

Let’s say your `app/views/devise/sessions/new.html.erb` looks like this:

```erb
<h2>Log in</h2>

<%= form_for(resource, as: resource_name, url: session_path(resource_name)) do |f| %>
  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :email %><br />
    <%= f.email_field :email, autofocus: true, autocomplete: "email" %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :password %><br />
    <%= f.password_field :password, autocomplete: "current-password" %>
  </div>

  <% if devise_mapping.rememberable? %>
    <div class="field">
      <%= f.check_box :remember_me %>
      <%= f.label :remember_me %>
    </div>
  <% end %>

  <div class="actions">
    <%= f.submit "Log in" %>
  </div>
<% end %>

<%= render "devise/shared/links" %>
```

This example is pretty standard. However, it’s critical that the form is constructed using `form_for` in combination with `resource` and `resource_name` as provided by Devise. If you bypass these helpers, you might inadvertently lose the error-handling hooks that Devise has in place. Modifying the form too much can sometimes lead to the Devise helpers not being able to properly interact with the form. While the above example itself doesn't cause problems, it serves as a solid starting point for understanding where customizations could introduce issues. It also illustrates that you must be careful about what to remove or add.

**3. Interferences with Other Javascript or Third-Party Libraries**

Lastly, although less frequent, interactions with other javascript libraries or custom javascript codes can interfere with flash messages and their display. This can be as simple as a conflicting CSS selector that hides the alert message, or, more commonly, javascript that alters the DOM after an initial page load that removes the message or prevents it from being rendered.

Here is a rather illustrative example showing how a rogue piece of javascript can affect the message display. Suppose you have some javascript that, after loading the page, cleans certain divs.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const elements = document.querySelectorAll('div.container > div');
  elements.forEach(function(element) {
      element.remove();
    });
});
```

This code, upon page loading, grabs all direct descendants of `div.container` and removes them. While this may seem nonsensical by itself, in a complex application, some unexpected code may be present which removes the DOM elements that were supposed to display the flash message. This is why debugging requires understanding every piece of code that is affecting the view rendering.

**Debugging Strategy**

When confronted with this problem, the approach I recommend, and what I've used in past, is as follows:

1.  **Verify the layout:** Begin by ensuring your layout is properly rendering flash messages. Start simple, use a `puts` statement or Ruby's `byebug` to inspect the contents of the `flash` hash during the authentication process. If you see messages present in `flash[:alert]` and they are not being displayed, it is a view issue.

2.  **Examine your forms:** Ensure your Devise login forms utilize the form helpers provided by Devise. Avoid manually constructing forms that deviate from the expected conventions. Make sure you have the required hidden fields required by rails to handle authentication correctly, such as the `csrf` token.

3.  **Javascript interference:** Use the browser developer tools to check if javascript is inadvertently removing the elements. Start with a very basic html display to ensure there are no css or javascript interactions. Comment the relevant javascript section of your code and refresh the page to check if it now works. Then, progressively isolate which parts of the Javascript are causing the conflict.

**Further Resources**

For more in-depth information on authentication, I'd suggest these resources:

*   **"Crafting Rails 4 Applications" by José Valim:** While it's based on an older version of Rails, the concepts it teaches regarding authentication and authorization are foundational.

*   **The Official Devise Gem Documentation:** Devise's official documentation is comprehensive and well-maintained. It is a great reference guide, and I often consult it for details that I might overlook.

*   **"Rails Security" by Adam Baldwin:** This is a fantastic resource for security best practices in Rails, including authentication and authorization. Although not specific to Devise, it gives you a broader picture of the security of your application.

By following these steps and referencing the recommended materials, you should be able to pinpoint and resolve why your Devise login error messages aren't displaying. Remember to always verify each component in the chain, from the controller setting the flash messages to the view properly rendering them. Sometimes the problem is something minor, but with the right steps, it is solvable.
