Okay, let's tackle this. Redirecting users based on their selected role is a very common requirement, and I've implemented this countless times over my career. I recall a specific project early on, a large e-learning platform, where we had students, instructors, and administrators, each needing a distinct initial landing experience upon login. The challenge wasn’t just about getting the redirects to work; it was about doing it efficiently and securely. Let's break down how you can achieve this, focusing on clarity and practicality, not convoluted theoretical constructs.

The core idea revolves around identifying the user's role *after* successful authentication, and then using that role information to direct them to the appropriate page. This involves a few key steps: authentication, role retrieval, and finally, the redirection logic. I've found that layering this approach makes the system more robust and easier to maintain.

First, authentication needs to be solid. Your authentication mechanism (be it OAuth2, JWT, or something else) should verify the user's credentials. Once that's done, you'll need to *reliably* obtain the user's role. I strongly advise storing user roles either directly in your user database table or, preferably, in a separate table specifically designed for roles and permissions. Avoid baking roles directly into the authentication tokens unless the system is exceedingly simple. Storing this information directly ensures you have a source of truth, and makes it far easier to adjust role assignments in the future.

After retrieving the role, we move to redirection. This is usually done server-side, but it can also be handled client-side with more effort. I’ll show server-side examples here as they offer a greater degree of security and control. It’s crucial to think in terms of request-response cycles when constructing the logic for your redirects. The user requests a protected page; your server authenticates, retrieves the user’s role, then *responds* with a redirect to the correct location.

Here’s how I've approached it in different contexts, and how you can do it as well:

**Example 1: Python (Flask) Implementation**

Let's begin with a basic Flask application demonstrating the approach. This is a skeletal version, of course, but it should get the core idea across:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, session, request
from functools import wraps

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key' #In real life, generate this from os.urandom(24)

def get_user_role(user_id):
    """Replace with real database lookup logic."""
    if user_id == 1:
        return "admin"
    elif user_id == 2:
        return "student"
    else:
      return None

def login_required(role=None):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
            if 'user_id' not in session or not session['user_id']:
                return redirect('/login')

            user_role = get_user_role(session['user_id'])
            if role and user_role != role:
              return "Unauthorized for this route.", 403 # Or redirect somewhere else
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated_function
    return decorator

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
  if request.method == 'POST':
      #In real apps, actually authenticate, get the user_id.
      user_id = int(request.form['user_id']) #Dummy user_id
      session['user_id'] = user_id
      return redirect('/')
  return """<form method="post">
  <input type="text" name="user_id">
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
  </form>"""


@app.route('/')
@login_required()
def home():
  user_role = get_user_role(session['user_id'])
  if user_role == 'admin':
      return redirect('/admin_dashboard')
  elif user_role == 'student':
      return redirect('/student_dashboard')
  else:
      return "Unknown Role"

@app.route('/admin_dashboard')
@login_required(role="admin")
def admin_dashboard():
    return 'Admin Dashboard'

@app.route('/student_dashboard')
@login_required(role="student")
def student_dashboard():
    return "Student Dashboard"

if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, the `get_user_role` function (which, in a production app, would fetch data from a database) retrieves the role based on a placeholder `user_id`. The `login_required` decorator handles authentication and role-based authorization, and the `/` route does the redirect logic based on the role. Crucially, individual routes can also use the login_required decorator to control which role has access to what.

**Example 2: Node.js (Express) Implementation**

Here's an analogous example using Node.js with Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');
const app = express();

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // for parsing form data
app.use(session({
  secret: 'your_secret_key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
}));

function getUserRole(userId) {
    //In real life, fetch from db.
    if(userId == 1){
      return "admin";
    } else if(userId == 2){
      return "student";
    } else{
      return null;
    }

}

function loginRequired(role = null) {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        if (!req.session.userId) {
            return res.redirect('/login');
        }
        const userRole = getUserRole(req.session.userId);
        if (role && userRole !== role) {
            return res.status(403).send("Unauthorized for this route."); //Or redirect.
        }
        next();
    };
}

app.get('/login', (req, res) => {
    res.send(`
        <form method="post">
          <input type="text" name="user_id">
          <button type="submit">Login</button>
        </form>`);
});

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    //In real life, auth. Get user id.
    const userId = parseInt(req.body.user_id);
    req.session.userId = userId;
    res.redirect('/');
});


app.get('/', loginRequired(), (req, res) => {
    const userRole = getUserRole(req.session.userId);
    if (userRole === 'admin') {
        res.redirect('/admin_dashboard');
    } else if (userRole === 'student') {
        res.redirect('/student_dashboard');
    }
    else {
      res.send("Unknown Role");
    }

});


app.get('/admin_dashboard', loginRequired('admin'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Admin Dashboard');
});

app.get('/student_dashboard', loginRequired('student'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Student Dashboard');
});


app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

This example closely mirrors the Python/Flask version, using express-session for session management and the `loginRequired` middleware to handle authentication and authorization. It highlights that the logic remains consistent regardless of the server-side language.

**Example 3: PHP Implementation**

Finally, here's a simple PHP example. While PHP often has some quirks to work around, the core remains consistent:

```php
<?php
session_start();

function getUserRole($userId) {
    // Real world database lookup here
  if($userId == 1){
    return "admin";
  } elseif($userId == 2){
    return "student";
  } else{
    return null;
  }
}

function loginRequired($role = null) {
    if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
        header('Location: /login.php');
        exit();
    }

    $userRole = getUserRole($_SESSION['user_id']);
    if ($role && $userRole !== $role) {
        http_response_code(403);
        echo "Unauthorized for this route.";
        exit();
    }
}

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] === '/login.php') {
    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
      //In real apps, authenticate. Get the user_id.
        $_SESSION['user_id'] = $_POST['user_id'];
        header('Location: /');
        exit();
    }
    echo '<form method="post">
        <input type="text" name="user_id">
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>';
    exit();
}

loginRequired();

$userRole = getUserRole($_SESSION['user_id']);
if ($userRole === 'admin') {
    header('Location: /admin_dashboard.php');
    exit();
} elseif ($userRole === 'student') {
    header('Location: /student_dashboard.php');
    exit();
} else{
  echo "Unknown Role";
  exit();
}

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] === '/admin_dashboard.php') {
    loginRequired("admin");
    echo "Admin Dashboard";
    exit();
}

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] === '/student_dashboard.php') {
    loginRequired("student");
    echo "Student Dashboard";
    exit();
}

?>
```

Here, PHP's header function redirects users, and we directly handle authentication in the script. While more verbose than the previous two examples, the logic and principles are the same.

For deeper understanding of authentication and authorization I highly recommend "OAuth 2 in Action" by Justin Richer and Antonio Sanso as well as "Web Security for Developers" by Malcolm McDonald. Additionally, for a solid grasp of designing role based access control (RBAC) I suggest examining papers by David Ferraiolo, particularly those published in the NIST series on RBAC models. Lastly, always prioritize security in your implementation by rigorously validating all data and utilizing robust hashing and encryption algorithms.

Remember that, beyond simple redirects, you might consider showing a 'default' page for users with no assigned roles or presenting a configurable role selection screen as an alternative. The choice depends on the specifics of your project. These examples provide a foundational structure you can then adapt and extend based on the specifics of your needs.
