Okay, let's tackle this one. It's a question I've seen pop up in various forms over the years, and it’s one that often trips up developers new to gradle's intricacies. The challenge with setting an environment variable for a static method *during* the gradle evaluation phase stems from the lifecycle of a gradle build and the way static initializers and environment variables interact.

In essence, when gradle evaluates your build script, it executes all the top-level groovy code. This includes defining tasks, configuring dependencies, and, crucially for our case, *executing static initializers of classes*. These static blocks are executed *before* most of gradle’s build configuration is finalized. Environment variables, on the other hand, are typically accessed during build execution, not during the evaluation phase unless you take a few specific steps. Accessing an environment variable directly within a class’s static initializer won't usually behave the way you expect because the system environment isn’t yet fully available or reliable in this pre-configuration stage.

Here’s how I've personally handled this in the past, focusing on the gradle environment and its lifecycle. I remember a particularly sticky situation where I needed to pull a dynamically generated build number from the operating system during evaluation, and it was not easily achievable using system properties. We needed to set this build number as a static variable in a class that was referenced from our main build script. This was before gradle provided direct access to environment variables at evaluation phase. Here’s the solution I found effective, focusing on the process rather than just a single line of code:

**The Problem: Order of Operations**

The core of the issue lies in the order things are happening. Class loading happens early, and static initializers are part of that loading process. Before gradle has even finished reading your build file, static blocks are potentially executed. At this point, we cannot guarantee environment variables are readily available the way they are during task execution. Thus, directly trying something like `System.getenv("MY_ENV_VAR")` inside a static initializer may lead to `null` or unexpected behavior if the environment variable is not set at the time the gradle process is launched.

**Solution: Deferred Execution with Gradle Properties**

The best approach is to defer the resolution of the environment variable until the gradle project is fully configured. We're going to accomplish this using gradle properties. We leverage gradle's `gradle.properties` files or command-line parameters to essentially store the environment variable’s value temporarily and retrieve it after gradle has evaluated the project.

Here's the approach explained with example:

*   **Step 1: Read Environment Variable into Gradle Property:** We define a gradle property, which is a variable local to the gradle build, and initialize it to the environment variable's value inside `settings.gradle` or inside a configuration block in `build.gradle`.
*   **Step 2: Access the gradle property in a static variable**: Access this gradle property during the evaluation phase, to set our static variable.

Here is the first example with `settings.gradle`:

```groovy
// settings.gradle
def myEnvVar = System.getenv("MY_ENV_VAR") ?: "default_value" // optional default

rootProject.ext.myEnvVarValue = myEnvVar
```

In this code, the environment variable "MY_ENV_VAR" is read. If it doesn't exist, a default value is used instead. This read happens during settings configuration, a step before the main project build. The obtained value is then stored in a project extension variable so that other modules can access it. This setting file is loaded before the evaluation phase starts, and we use a default value to prevent any build failure.

Here's the second example illustrating how to use a gradle property from `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
// build.gradle
import org.mycompany.MyStaticClass

def envVarValue = System.getenv("MY_ENV_VAR") ?: "default_value"

project.ext.myEnvVarValue = envVarValue

println "setting env var ${project.ext.myEnvVarValue}"

// This simulates your static variable being set.
project.afterEvaluate {
    MyStaticClass.staticVar = project.ext.myEnvVarValue
    println "static var set to ${MyStaticClass.staticVar}"
}


```

Here we demonstrate how to get the env variable and then access the static variable *after* the evaluation phase. The `afterEvaluate` block ensures that the assignment to the static variable happens after the gradle project has been fully evaluated, which avoids the early initialization problem we described above. We are also using a project extension property to get the value at different phases of our build.

Here is the third example using `gradle.properties`

```properties
# gradle.properties
myEnvVarFromProps=MY_DEFAULT_VALUE
```

```groovy
// build.gradle
import org.mycompany.MyStaticClass

def envVarValue = System.getenv("MY_ENV_VAR") ?: project.myEnvVarFromProps

println "setting env var: ${envVarValue}"

project.ext.myEnvVarValue = envVarValue

// This simulates your static variable being set.
project.afterEvaluate {
    MyStaticClass.staticVar = project.ext.myEnvVarValue
     println "static var set to ${MyStaticClass.staticVar}"
}
```

In this third example, we demonstrate how to read the environment variable or a default value from `gradle.properties` if the env var is not set. This adds an extra layer of flexibility in setting up default configurations for your builds. This `myEnvVarFromProps` can be overridden during the evaluation phase or even at command-line.

**Caveats and Best Practices**

*   **Avoid Over-Reliance on Environment Variables:** Environment variables are great for runtime configuration but are not ideal for critical build dependencies. Consider using more robust mechanisms like version control or configuration files for those use cases.
*   **Default Values:** Always provide a default value for your environment variables. This prevents unexpected build failures if the variable isn't present. This default can be hardcoded, configured in `gradle.properties`, or even derived from git.
*   **Configuration Flexibility:** Using gradle project extension properties makes your configuration more flexible. We are demonstrating that you can set this property within `settings.gradle` or `build.gradle` based on your needs.
*   **Security:** Be mindful when using environment variables in a build environment that could be shared, as they might contain sensitive information.
*   **gradle.properties:** Consider configuring default values in `gradle.properties` for more maintainable projects. This enables easier management of global settings.

**Further Reading**

For a deeper dive into gradle's lifecycle and configuration, I highly recommend:

*   **"Gradle in Action" by Benjamin Muschko:** This book provides a thorough understanding of gradle's core concepts, including its build phases and configuration. It’s a must-read for any serious gradle user.
*   **The official Gradle Documentation:** Specifically, refer to the sections on the build lifecycle, gradle properties, and project configuration. This is the most authoritative resource and it is essential to understand how Gradle works.
*   **The Groovy Documentation:** Understanding Groovy's syntax is essential for effective gradle scripting.

By following the pattern of deferred evaluation using gradle properties, you can safely and reliably set static variables in a controlled manner, even when those variables depend on environment settings. It’s all about understanding the order of operations and utilizing gradle’s built-in mechanisms effectively. This method provides a robust, flexible, and maintainable solution. Remember that while environment variables have their place, they shouldn’t be the sole source of critical build data. Consider more robust alternatives for sensitive or essential information.
