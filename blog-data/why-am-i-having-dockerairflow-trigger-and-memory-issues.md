Let’s talk about this Docker/Airflow trigger and memory situation; it's something I’ve certainly dealt with in the trenches more than a few times. Over the years, I’ve noticed these issues often stem from a confluence of factors, rather than a single smoking gun. When Airflow tasks struggle to trigger reliably or exhibit memory bloat, it’s critical to analyze various points in your architecture. A systematic approach is the key here.

First off, let’s consider the triggers. In Airflow, these are typically handled by the scheduler component. When things go sideways here, it generally boils down to a few culprits. The scheduler might be under-resourced, struggling with the number of tasks, or perhaps the database backing Airflow is slow, creating bottlenecks. I recall once, while working at a company dealing with massive data pipelines, we saw these issues arise dramatically during peak hours. We traced it back to the scheduler container; it simply couldn't keep up with the sheer volume of DAGs being processed. It wasn't a code error, per se, but rather a matter of inadequate resources allocated to the docker container. This manifested as intermittent trigger failures and delayed task executions, making it seem like the whole system was erratic.

Another contributing factor can be how your DAGs are designed. For instance, overly complex DAGs with many dependencies or those which call sub-dags unnecessarily create heavy load on the scheduler. It keeps the scheduling logic running which can lead to bottlenecks. Remember that the scheduler parses your DAG files at frequent intervals, typically configured in `airflow.cfg`, which also includes parsing python code if you write it with your airflow dags, so excessive complexity and poorly written python can cause delays here. It’s imperative to keep DAG structures concise and optimized for efficient processing. I also recall a time when a team inadvertently introduced an infinite loop into a custom operator, this one operator was consuming cpu and memory and was creating thousands of tasks at once that was only visible from the task state section in airflow UI. That had cascading impact on the whole cluster, showing the scheduler struggling to keep pace.

Moving onto memory issues, this is a particularly thorny problem. Docker containers, by nature, are resource-isolated. When an Airflow task exceeds its memory limit, it can crash or be terminated by the container runtime. This often occurs with data-intensive tasks, especially those dealing with large datasets. You may also notice that some workers use more memory because of the type of worker you are using, for example a Celery executor can consume more memory than a Local or Kubernetes executor depending on the type of task. Furthermore, task design also plays a vital role in memory usage. If a task loads large datasets into memory all at once instead of streaming data or processing it in chunks, you’re practically inviting memory issues. Also, how the actual underlying code is written is critical, as it is where most of the processing takes place.

Here's a practical example, in python, of a very common issue I’ve seen with data processing:

```python
import pandas as pd

def process_large_data_bad(file_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path) # Loads all data into memory
    # Process data on a single dataframe that is in memory
    df['new_column'] = df['existing_column'] * 2
    return df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)

# This code will fail on very large files
```

The `process_large_data_bad` function is quite common, however, if your file is large enough, this will result in out of memory errors. Pandas will keep the entire dataset in memory at once which is highly inefficient and can easily exhaust memory in a container. To solve this, we need to break the processing into chunks.

Here’s how you can fix that and load data in chunks:

```python
import pandas as pd

def process_large_data_good(file_path, output_path, chunksize=10000):
    for chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunksize):
        # Process each chunk
        chunk['new_column'] = chunk['existing_column'] * 2
        chunk.to_csv(output_path, mode='a', header=False, index=False)

    # This code will handle large files without eating up all the memory, by writing out to disk
    # or to another destination, and not keep the entire dataset in memory
```

The `process_large_data_good` function reads in the csv in batches of `chunksize` then writes out the result. It does not keep the entire dataset in memory and it is way more efficient.

Finally, let's take a look at python memory leaks and how you can catch those before pushing to production. This isn't strictly Airflow related, but it’s a common culprit when memory issues are present in the system. Improper memory management within your code, specifically python code that is called by your airflow operators, can lead to gradual memory leaks. Objects or resources are created during task execution, but are not released back, eventually exhausting available memory. Using memory profiling tools such as `memory-profiler` can be very helpful for this:

```python
from memory_profiler import profile

@profile
def leaky_function():
  my_list = []
  for i in range(1000000):
      my_list.append(i) # List keeps growing

  #The memory consumed by my_list is not freed after the function is called.
  return

#This is a common mistake that results in memory leaks in production.
# This should be avoided

leaky_function()
```

Running this using `mprof run <your_python_file.py>` will show the memory profile of this function, and you will see the memory keeps increasing. The solution is to use local variables when possible, and avoid creating very large global lists or objects, that keep growing in memory.

For deeper understanding, I’d suggest delving into *“Operating System Concepts”* by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne to better grasp how operating systems manage resources and how Docker containers are isolated. For specific knowledge related to Airflow, *“Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow”* by Bas Harenslak and Julian Rutger, is an essential resource that can help you dive deep into the architecture and best practices for workflow orchestration. Also, for more information on handling python memory issues, the official python documentation offers great tips regarding `garbage collection`. Furthermore, learning more about the `psutil` library will allow you to create custom metrics and monitoring of your memory consumption at runtime.

In summary, Docker/Airflow trigger and memory problems usually result from a combination of resource constraints, inefficient DAG designs, inefficient memory usage in code, or memory leaks within the worker processes. Addressing these issues involves a multi-faceted approach. Start by analyzing your scheduler resources, refine DAG designs, use chunking techniques for data processing, monitor and fix any memory leaks in your code. Regularly monitoring your system with tools like prometheus/grafana is also critical. It is never a single issue, but several different components interacting and causing problems. Only with a methodical approach can you improve the reliability and performance of your Airflow pipelines.
