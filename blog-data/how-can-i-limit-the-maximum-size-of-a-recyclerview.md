Alright, let's tackle this. I've actually run into this exact scenario multiple times, particularly when dealing with dynamically generated lists that could potentially overwhelm the UI if left unchecked. The core problem, as you've posed, is limiting the maximum size of a `recyclerview`. It's less about restricting the *data source* and more about ensuring the recyclerview doesn’t render an endless scroll of elements, which can become a performance nightmare very quickly. I've seen apps grind to a halt because they tried to render thousands of items simultaneously.

When we talk about limiting the 'size' of a `recyclerview`, we typically mean limiting the number of *visible items*, not necessarily the *data source* that's feeding it. The recyclerview itself is designed to be efficient; it recycles views as they scroll off-screen. However, rendering a vast number of them initially can still create lag and slow down user interactions. We can mitigate this in several ways, mostly by controlling the initial data we feed the adapter or by imposing constraints on the adapter itself.

Now, before we dive into the code, let's establish a few key principles I’ve found useful from years of similar problems. First, it's almost always a good idea to paginate your data. Instead of trying to load everything at once, fetch it in chunks, updating the `recyclerview` as needed. This technique alone can address a large portion of potential performance issues. Second, remember that the `recyclerview` is a sophisticated view, and its capabilities are deeply coupled with the adapter we use. Therefore, the solution often resides within our adapter implementation.

**Approaches to Limit RecyclerView Size:**

I’ve successfully used three different methods in the past, depending on the specific scenario. Let's delve into each, complete with code examples.

**1. Limiting Data Source at the Adapter Level**

One common approach is to simply provide the adapter with a truncated or limited version of the data source. This is suitable when you have the complete dataset available but only wish to display a portion of it.

```kotlin
class MyAdapter(private var items: List<String>, private val maxItems: Int) :
    RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder>() {

    private val displayList: List<String>
        get() = items.take(maxItems)

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ViewHolder {
        val view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context)
            .inflate(android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, parent, false)
        return ViewHolder(view)
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        holder.textView.text = displayList[position]
    }

    override fun getItemCount(): Int {
      return displayList.size
    }

    fun updateData(newItems: List<String>) {
        items = newItems
        notifyDataSetChanged() // Or use DiffUtil
    }

    class ViewHolder(itemView: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView) {
        val textView: TextView = itemView.findViewById(android.R.id.text1)
    }
}
```

In this example, `maxItems` is the imposed limit. `displayList` only provides a subset of the available data. The key thing is that `getItemCount` returns `displayList.size`, ensuring the recycler view doesn't try to render beyond the limit. You can easily load more data and update the adapter later. This approach works well when you control how the adapter is initially populated.

**2. Enforcing a Size Constraint within the Adapter**

Another strategy is to enforce a maximum size within the adapter itself. This can be useful if you need to dynamically load data and you want to ensure the `recyclerview` never exceeds a certain length. It also means we can easily update the data and stay within the size limit.

```kotlin
class MyLimitingAdapter(private var items: MutableList<String>, private val maxItems: Int) :
    RecyclerView.Adapter<MyLimitingAdapter.ViewHolder>() {

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ViewHolder {
        val view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context)
            .inflate(android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, parent, false)
        return ViewHolder(view)
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        holder.textView.text = items[position]
    }

    override fun getItemCount(): Int {
        return minOf(items.size, maxItems)
    }

    fun addMoreItems(newItems: List<String>) {
        items.addAll(newItems)

      val clampedSize = minOf(items.size, maxItems)
      val oldSize = itemCount
      if(clampedSize > oldSize) {
          notifyItemRangeInserted(oldSize, clampedSize- oldSize)
      }
        
    }


    class ViewHolder(itemView: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView) {
        val textView: TextView = itemView.findViewById(android.R.id.text1)
    }
}
```

Here, `getItemCount` uses `minOf` to ensure it never returns a value greater than `maxItems`, even if the underlying list is larger. We are using `notifyItemRangeInserted`, which should be used for a more targeted update compared to `notifyDataSetChanged`. This approach offers more control on updates.

**3. Utilizing a Specific LayoutManager (For fixed row/column scenarios)**

While not a direct limit on the *number* of items, using a `GridLayoutManager` or `LinearLayoutManager` with a fixed number of spans or rows/columns can indirectly control the display area and thus limit the maximum visible area occupied by the `recyclerview`. This technique combined with a maximum height constraint on the recyclerview view itself can create a fixed view with a vertical scroll if there is more data available than what fits the defined area.

```kotlin
import androidx.recyclerview.widget.GridLayoutManager
import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView

fun setupRecyclerView(recyclerView: RecyclerView, adapter: RecyclerView.Adapter<*>) {
    val gridLayoutManager = GridLayoutManager(recyclerView.context, 3) // 3 Columns
    recyclerView.layoutManager = gridLayoutManager
    recyclerView.adapter = adapter
}
```

This snippet demonstrates setting up a `recyclerview` with a `GridLayoutManager` which effectively controls the layout and indirectly limits the view area based on how many grid columns are displayed at once and the size constraints given to the recyclerview itself.

**Important Considerations & Further Reading**

Remember, in real-world scenarios, you'll likely combine these methods based on your app's needs. For instance, you might use pagination to fetch data in small batches, apply the `maxItems` constraint at the adapter level to keep it manageable and use a specific LayoutManager to control the size of the view.

Furthermore, it's crucial to handle changes to the underlying dataset intelligently. Instead of calling `notifyDataSetChanged()`, which can trigger unnecessary redraws, consider using `DiffUtil` (as mentioned in previous snippet) to calculate the changes between the old and new list, applying precise updates to the `recyclerview`. This enhances performance significantly.

To deepen your understanding, I'd recommend reading "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch, which, while not directly about android development, provides incredible insights into efficient and scalable system design principles. In addition, you should also look at Android developer documentation concerning `recyclerview`, `DiffUtil` and LayoutManagers. Understanding the inner working of these components will help you make correct decisions on how to approach this problem. Also, if you plan on dealing with more advanced use cases, you should be familiar with the internals of android UI framework to fully understand how it is drawing content in the screen. The source code for this framework is open source.

These methods combined with intelligent data handling should allow you to effectively control the maximum size of your `recyclerview` and ensure a smooth user experience, especially when dealing with large or dynamic datasets. Remember, performance in mobile apps is paramount, and it's often about proactive design choices, not reactive fixes. I hope these practical insights, gleaned from my experiences, are helpful in your own development journey.
