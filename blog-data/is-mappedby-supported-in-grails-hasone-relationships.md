Let’s get down to brass tacks. The question of `mappedBy` support in Grails `hasOne` relationships is something I’ve actually encountered firsthand, and it's a nuanced area. It’s not a simple yes or no. Fundamentally, the answer lies in understanding how Grails leverages Hibernate for its object-relational mapping (ORM), and how it defines its domain relationships.

I recall a project several years ago involving a user profile and an address. Initially, we’d tried modeling it with what seemed like an intuitive `hasOne` on the user to point to a specific address. The initial mapping attempt looked something like this:

```groovy
// User.groovy
class User {
   static hasOne = [address: Address]
   String username
   String email
}

// Address.groovy
class Address {
  String street
  String city
  String state
}

```

This approach resulted in the creation of an `address_id` column on the `user` table. From a conceptual standpoint, this seemed correct: a user *has one* address. However, the issue arose when we needed to reverse the query—accessing the user from an address instance. We'd end up needing a non-trivial query to find the user associated with an address, which felt like fighting the ORM. The typical inverse association query wasn't natively available or easily performant. This led us down the path to investigating `mappedBy`.

Here’s the crucial part: `mappedBy` is indeed used in Grails, but specifically in the context of *bidirectional* associations. In simpler terms, it’s most relevant in `hasMany` or `belongsTo` relationships where you need to indicate which side of the relationship owns the foreign key. The `hasOne` relationship in Grails, by its very nature, implies a unidirectional relationship where the owning side (the entity with the foreign key) is explicit. Because `hasOne` generally defaults to holding the foreign key, explicitly adding a `mappedBy` isn't directly supported. Grails’ implementation via Hibernate handles this scenario by adding the foreign key to the owner, much like an explicit `belongsTo`.

The misconception, and what we stumbled on initially, is attempting to apply the concepts of `mappedBy` from bidirectional `hasMany` and `belongsTo` relationships onto a `hasOne` scenario. If you attempt to use `mappedBy` with a `hasOne`, grails/hibernate will essentially ignore it.

So, how do you achieve the “reverse lookup” – finding the associated user from an address efficiently? The solution doesn't lie in attempting to force `mappedBy` on `hasOne`, but rather, by changing the relational definition itself to introduce a `belongsTo` relationship and modifying `hasOne` to reference that.

Here’s how we eventually restructured things to allow for efficient bi-directional association:

```groovy
// User.groovy
class User {
  String username
  String email

  static hasOne = [address: Address] // Now a *reference* to the address
}

// Address.groovy
class Address {
  static belongsTo = [user: User]  // Establishes ownership and relationship
  String street
  String city
  String state
}
```

In this revised model, the `Address` now explicitly *belongs to* a `User`. This relationship is now bidirectional because we are defining `hasOne` on `User` *and* `belongsTo` on `Address`. This approach creates the `user_id` foreign key on the `address` table. With this, finding the user given an address becomes seamless, and the reverse, finding the address of a given user, is equally straightforward.

It’s important to understand that the `hasOne` here acts more as a "convenience" mapping; it does *not* create a foreign key on the `user` table as it did before. We still need the `belongsTo` on `Address` for the actual foreign key and association to exist. If we want to, and in many cases, if we are concerned about performance, we might add a `index` column to `user_id` in our `Address` to help the db when looking up addresses of a given user.

Let's look at another scenario, illustrating a possible use-case that could cause problems if we misunderstand these underlying concepts. Consider a situation with a `Blog` and `BlogSettings`:

```groovy
// Blog.groovy
class Blog {
   String title
   String author
   static hasOne = [settings: BlogSettings]
}

//BlogSettings.groovy
class BlogSettings {
  String theme
  Boolean commentsEnabled
}
```

Here, similar to the initial user/address case, we’ve made the error of creating a relationship with a foreign key in the `blog` table; `settings_id`. It might be more sensible to have a foreign key on the `BlogSettings` table, in a `blog_id` column, to match a `belongsTo` relationship there.

The correct modeling would look like this:
```groovy
// Blog.groovy
class Blog {
   String title
   String author
   static hasOne = [settings: BlogSettings]
}

//BlogSettings.groovy
class BlogSettings {
   static belongsTo = [blog:Blog]
   String theme
   Boolean commentsEnabled
}
```

With this setup, we can now access the blog from the settings object through a typical `.blog` property.

In summary, `mappedBy` isn't directly applicable to `hasOne` in the sense it's used with bidirectional `hasMany` or `belongsTo` relationships. Instead, the pattern we need to follow is to utilize a `belongsTo` on the ‘single' side of the relationship and keep the `hasOne` on the ‘parent’ side to create a proper bidirectional association if one is needed. The key takeaway here is to understand where the foreign key resides. For a truly bidirectional relationship with `hasOne`, consider coupling it with a corresponding `belongsTo` on the associated entity. This grants you efficient navigation in both directions.

For deeper dives, I highly recommend the "Hibernate in Action" book by Christian Bauer and Gavin King, and also reviewing the official Hibernate documentation, specifically the sections detailing bidirectional associations. The "Effective Java" book by Joshua Bloch, while not directly ORM focused, gives excellent advice on how to think about object composition, which will help in designing relationships between objects. Additionally, Grails' own documentation and examples for domain relationships are essential resources. These resources provide the theoretical foundations and practical examples to solidify your understanding of ORM relationships and their implementation in Grails.
