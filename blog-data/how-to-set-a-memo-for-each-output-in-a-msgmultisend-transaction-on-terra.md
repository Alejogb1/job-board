Okay, let’s tackle this. I remember spending a rather frustrating week back in the 2022 Terra days, wrestling with the specifics of `MsgMultiSend` and how to get granular memo control for each individual transfer within it. It's not immediately obvious, and it's something that the documentation, at least at the time, glossed over. The core issue revolves around the fact that the `MsgMultiSend` structure itself doesn't inherently provide for individual memos per output; it has a single `memo` field at the top level for the entire transaction. This means the standard approach of adding a memo field when building the transaction, well, it doesn't work for our specific case. We need to delve a bit deeper to accomplish what you're aiming for – attaching a specific memo to each output in a multisend transaction.

Here’s how it's done, and what I’ve found works best in practice. The trick here is not to try and shoehorn memos into the `MsgMultiSend` structure directly, but rather to leverage the existing functionality, specifically the `MsgSend` functionality, and construct what is effectively a sequence of single send operations bundled into the larger multi-send framework. It's less about overriding the core structure and more about employing the underlying atomic building blocks.

Fundamentally, a multi-send transaction is essentially a compressed way to execute multiple single send operations. Each single send (`MsgSend`) transaction *does* have its own memo field. We can exploit that fact. The idea is to construct individual `MsgSend` structures, each with its dedicated memo, and then submit these bundled transactions as a multi-send. In practice, this involves wrapping each individual send operation within a multi-send transaction, where every `input` and `output` of that multi-send effectively performs one transaction from one account to another, with the memo included in that operation.

Let’s examine some code to make this more concrete. Let’s assume we are working in a language that interacts with the Terra SDK, perhaps something akin to a Python-based script that builds protobuf-encoded messages which can then be signed and broadcast. I will provide three examples, each with an increasing degree of sophistication, to demonstrate various approaches. The first will showcase a basic, almost naive, version; the second, a slightly more refined iteration; and the third, a production-ready implementation incorporating error checking and more robust data handling.

**Example 1: Basic Implementation**

This example illustrates the core principle using a simplified pseudo-code representation of how you might construct such a multi-send using python. It is intentionally kept as simple as possible, focusing on the mechanics.

```python
def create_multisend_with_memos_basic(from_address, transfers):
    """
    Creates a multisend transaction with individual memos, using a naive approach.

    Args:
        from_address: The sender address string.
        transfers: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a transfer
                   and includes 'to_address', 'amount' (as integer), and 'memo' (string).

    Returns:
      A ready-to-sign protobuf transaction object. (Simulated)
    """
    inputs = []
    outputs = []
    total_input_amount = 0

    for transfer in transfers:
      amount = int(transfer['amount'])  # Convert amount to integer
      inputs.append({
          "address": from_address,
          "coins": [
                {
                  "denom": "uluna", # Simulating LUNA denomination, adjust to your needs.
                  "amount": str(amount)
                }
           ]
      })
      outputs.append({
          "address": transfer['to_address'],
          "coins": [
                {
                  "denom": "uluna",
                  "amount": str(amount)
                }
          ]
      })

      # NOTE: memo is being ignored in this naive approach

    multisend = {
       "inputs": inputs,
       "outputs": outputs
    }

    return multisend # Simulating protobuf structure
```

This approach, while demonstrating the structure of a multi-send, falls drastically short because it doesn't use individual memos at all. It merely lays out a multi-send structure without considering the memo requirements for each individual transaction.

**Example 2: Refined Implementation with Individual Memos**

Here, we'll improve the implementation to add in those important memos by actually building `MsgSend` objects.

```python
def create_multisend_with_memos_refined(from_address, transfers):
    """
    Creates a multisend transaction with individual memos.

    Args:
        from_address: The sender address string.
        transfers: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a transfer
                   and includes 'to_address', 'amount' (as integer), and 'memo' (string).

    Returns:
      A ready-to-sign protobuf transaction object. (Simulated)
    """
    tx_messages = []

    for transfer in transfers:
      amount = int(transfer['amount']) # Convert amount to integer
      msg_send = {
        "from_address": from_address,
        "to_address": transfer['to_address'],
        "amount": [{
            "denom": "uluna",  # Simulating LUNA denomination, adjust as needed.
            "amount": str(amount)
          }],
        "memo": transfer['memo']
      }
      tx_messages.append(msg_send)

    multisend = {
        "messages" : tx_messages
    } # Mimicking a basic Tx with array of individual message sends

    return multisend # Simulating protobuf structure
```

In this version, we construct individual `msg_send` objects, each having its distinct memo. Note that this is not actually a standard `MsgMultiSend`, instead, this example would be a simplified and illustrative model of what a system utilizing `MsgSend` would look like and this is key to understanding the overall logic we are trying to achieve. In practical terms, the system would take these messages, format them as required by the SDK, pack them into a multi-send-like structure, and prepare them for broadcast.

**Example 3: Production-Ready Implementation with Robust Data Handling and Error Checking**

Now, let's move to a more production-ready example. This one introduces simple error checking and verifies data types are in order, all while still using the core method of crafting multiple `MsgSend` transactions.

```python
def create_multisend_with_memos_production(from_address, transfers):
    """
    Creates a multisend transaction with individual memos. Includes basic data validation.

    Args:
        from_address: The sender address string.
        transfers: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a transfer
                   and includes 'to_address' (string), 'amount' (can be int or string), and 'memo' (string).

    Returns:
      A ready-to-sign protobuf transaction object or raises exception. (Simulated)
    """
    if not isinstance(from_address, str):
      raise ValueError("From address must be a string.")
    if not isinstance(transfers, list):
        raise ValueError("Transfers must be a list.")

    tx_messages = []
    for transfer in transfers:
      if not isinstance(transfer, dict):
          raise ValueError("Transfer entry must be a dictionary.")
      if 'to_address' not in transfer or not isinstance(transfer['to_address'], str):
        raise ValueError("Invalid or missing 'to_address' in transfer.")
      if 'amount' not in transfer:
          raise ValueError("Missing 'amount' in transfer.")
      if 'memo' not in transfer or not isinstance(transfer['memo'], str):
          raise ValueError("Invalid or missing 'memo' in transfer.")

      try:
          amount = int(transfer['amount']) if isinstance(transfer['amount'], (int, str)) else None
          if amount is None:
             raise ValueError("Invalid 'amount' format.")
      except ValueError as e:
          raise ValueError(f"Invalid amount format: {e}")

      msg_send = {
          "from_address": from_address,
          "to_address": transfer['to_address'],
          "amount": [{
            "denom": "uluna",  # Simulating LUNA denomination, adjust as needed.
            "amount": str(amount)
          }],
          "memo": transfer['memo']
      }
      tx_messages.append(msg_send)

    multisend = {
      "messages" : tx_messages
    } # Mimicking Tx with individual send messages


    return multisend # Simulating protobuf structure

```

This example is a significant improvement. It validates the inputs and it converts amounts into integers and strings correctly. This version more closely reflects the realities of real-world data handling within a system interacting with the SDKs and transaction flows. In practice, you would often see this type of validation and data transformation before actually submitting transactions.

To summarize, while `MsgMultiSend` itself doesn't offer individual memo fields, you can construct a series of `MsgSend` operations, each with its specific memo, and then wrap them as a combined transaction, achieving the desired result. The key lies in understanding that a `MsgMultiSend` is in essence, simply a way to batch these individual sends together, and your approach to achieving granular memos should align with the individual message structures and how they are assembled into multi-transaction operations.

For further reading and a more in-depth understanding of the Terra SDKs, I strongly recommend reviewing the official Terra documentation, which you can find by searching on their website. Specifically, focus on the sections detailing the `MsgSend` and transaction construction, as well as examples of building and submitting transactions through their SDKs. Additionally, the Cosmos SDK documentation, on which Terra was built, is also invaluable, particularly the sections covering protobuf message definitions. The book "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopoulos is great for foundational blockchain concepts, while "Programming Blockchain" by Jimmy Song is good for a practical deep dive. These resources will help solidify your understanding of not just the how, but the why behind these mechanisms.
