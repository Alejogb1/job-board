Let’s get right into this. It's a problem I've tackled more times than I'd care to remember— those frustrating scenarios where your beautiful, carefully crafted semi-supervised or self-supervised loss just... doesn't backpropagate. You stare at the training logs, the loss stubbornly refusing to decrease, and you start questioning everything. I recall a project a few years back, building a medical image analysis system using pseudo-labeling on a large dataset with very few labeled examples. The unsupervised loss was beautifully designed, theoretically sound, yet gradients vanished into the ether. It took a good bit of investigation to pinpoint the root causes.

The lack of gradient calculation for a semi- or self-supervised loss function generally stems from one or a combination of a few core issues. It's rarely just "magic gone wrong." Primarily, it often boils down to problems with *computational graphs*, *inconsistent data flow*, or *misplaced stops in backpropagation*. Let's break these down, using code snippets to illustrate each point, drawing on that medical imaging project as a loose frame of reference.

**1. Computational Graph Disconnects**

The fundamental mechanism behind backpropagation relies on a well-defined *computational graph*. This graph represents the sequence of operations performed during the forward pass, and it's what the backpropagation algorithm uses to trace the gradient's pathway. If your unsupervised loss is calculated in a way that breaks or bypasses this graph, the gradients won't flow back to your model's trainable parameters. This commonly occurs when you introduce operations that your deep learning framework can't track correctly.

In my medical imaging scenario, I initially had a separate, manually constructed data augmentations pipeline for the unlabelled data. This pipeline was not integrated into the computation graph. When I tried to apply consistency regularization using these augmented views, the loss was calculated fine, but gradients simply wouldn’t be computed for the parameters earlier in the chain of operations.

Let’s illustrate with a Python code snippet, using PyTorch as a common example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = MyModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
# Let's say we have an "augment" function which does NOT build the graph:
def augment(data):
  # Imagine this is a complex image augmentation that is *not* tracked
  # by PyTorch's autodiff. This is a common issue with pre-processing or other
  # types of operations.
    return data + torch.randn_like(data) * 0.1

# Let's say we have an unsupervised loss like Mean Squared Error
def unsupervised_loss(logits_original, logits_augmented):
  return torch.mean((logits_original - logits_augmented)**2)

# Dummy data.
data = torch.randn(5, 10, requires_grad = True)

optimizer.zero_grad()
logits_original = model(data) # This is fine, this *is* tracked
logits_augmented = model(augment(data)) # This is *not* tracked

loss_unsupervised = unsupervised_loss(logits_original, logits_augmented)
loss_unsupervised.backward() # No gradients for parameters
print(f"Gradients after loss_unsupervised: {model.fc.weight.grad}")
```

Notice that `augment(data)` is outside the computational graph. While it may seem logical that the input data’s parameters are involved in the backward pass, the autograd system does not recognize this link since we’ve broken the dependency. When `loss_unsupervised.backward()` is called, the backpropagation will not travel through the non-tracked `augment` operation.

The fix is usually to rework the data transformation operations to use the framework's built-in modules or make use of custom modules that explicitly declare how backpropagation works through them (by inheriting from `torch.autograd.Function`). For a more detailed look at this, I recommend studying the PyTorch documentation regarding custom autograd functions and how to build them properly, also exploring the “autograd mechanics” documentation from PyTorch. A deeper grasp of these concepts can save substantial debugging effort.

**2. Inconsistent Data Flow**

Another common pitfall occurs when data flow isn't consistent between the forward and backward passes. This may be surprising but can cause gradient issues. It's particularly apparent when you're dealing with operations that alter the data's underlying type or structure in a way not readily tracked by the computational graph during the backward pass.

For example, if you're applying an operation that converts your PyTorch tensor into a NumPy array for some computation outside the framework's realm, and then trying to backpropagate on the result, you’ll likely face issues. The computational graph doesn't maintain a connection across this type of conversion. I came across this when a colleague tried to integrate an external non-differentiable image processing library directly into the forward pass, resulting in a similar gradient vanishing act.

Consider the following snippet:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import numpy as np

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = MyModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)


def non_differentiable_operation(tensor):
    # Let's say this operation uses numpy
    np_array = tensor.detach().numpy() # This detaches the tensor from the autograd system
    np_array = np_array * 2
    return torch.from_numpy(np_array)  # We make it back into a Tensor

# Dummy data.
data = torch.randn(5, 10, requires_grad = True)

optimizer.zero_grad()
logits_original = model(data)
# Using the non_differentiable operation here:
logits_processed = model(non_differentiable_operation(data))

# Now calculate some dummy loss.
loss_unsupervised = torch.mean((logits_original - logits_processed)**2)

loss_unsupervised.backward() # No gradients for parameters
print(f"Gradients after loss_unsupervised: {model.fc.weight.grad}")
```

Notice that the conversion to a NumPy array `tensor.detach().numpy()` detaches the data from PyTorch's autograd system. The subsequent tensor reconstruction does not re-establish the connection.  The gradients will be interrupted, preventing effective learning.

The solution here is to avoid these conversions wherever possible. Stick within the framework's ecosystem and use differentiable operations. If you absolutely need to integrate external code, you should implement a custom autograd function (like we mentioned before) or isolate the external component outside the core training loop. The “autograd mechanics” documentation from PyTorch, and similar docs from other frameworks are vital reads here.

**3. Misplaced Stops in Backpropagation**

Lastly, a very straightforward yet often overlooked cause is the accidental use of operations that explicitly stop gradient calculation. This commonly occurs with operations like `.detach()` or when you’re using specific layers that, by design, do not compute gradients.  Such operations intentionally "cut" the computational graph at specific points to prevent backpropagation through certain parts of the model or operation sequence. I once spent a frustrating afternoon tracing a similar issue when an experimental layer was accidentally introduced in the self-supervised pipeline with unintended `detach` behaviors.

Here’s a basic example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = MyModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)


def some_operation_with_detach(tensor):
  # Imagine this is a complex operation where we need to extract part of the graph for some reason
    return tensor.detach()  # Intentionally detach the tensor from autograd.

# Dummy data.
data = torch.randn(5, 10, requires_grad = True)

optimizer.zero_grad()
logits_original = model(data)
logits_processed = model(some_operation_with_detach(data))

loss_unsupervised = torch.mean((logits_original- logits_processed)**2)

loss_unsupervised.backward() # No gradients for parameters
print(f"Gradients after loss_unsupervised: {model.fc.weight.grad}")
```

Here, `.detach()` is the culprit. The `logits_processed` tensor is now detached from the original input data's autograd graph. The backpropagation stops at the `some_operation_with_detach` operation; thus, the parameters in model's weights don't receive any gradient updates from the unsupervised loss term.

The fix is simple: avoid detach operations unless you specifically know you need them and understand the consequences. When using modules or layers, consult the documentation to ensure that their gradient calculation behavior matches your expectations.

In summary, debugging a lack of gradients in semi- or self-supervised learning mostly centers around your understanding of the computational graph, data flow, and the intentional or unintentional disconnection of these elements during backpropagation. I would highly recommend reviewing the foundational texts on deep learning backpropagation, such as those found in Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville's "Deep Learning" book, and delving into the autodiff documentation specific to your deep learning framework of choice. Understanding the nuances of these concepts is crucial for building functional and efficient self-supervised systems. And, as always, careful debugging and thoughtful code design can prevent these types of gradient headaches in the future.
