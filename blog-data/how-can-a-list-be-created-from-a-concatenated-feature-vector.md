Okay, let’s tackle this. I've actually run into this precise problem more times than I care to remember, particularly in my early days developing hybrid recommender systems. The goal, as I understand it, is to take a single, potentially lengthy feature vector—formed by concatenating smaller feature sets—and then restructure it into a more usable list format, often where each sub-list corresponds to one of the original features. It’s a common preprocessing step, and there are several ways to approach it, each with its own trade-offs.

First off, it’s essential to understand the layout of your concatenated feature vector. We need to know the size (dimension) of each constituent feature set to deconstruct it correctly. Without that, it’s just a long, meaningless sequence of numbers. Let’s say we have a feature vector constructed from user features, item features, and context features. Each of those has its specific dimensionality, and the concatenated vector will therefore be the sum of those individual dimensionalities. This is not always as straightforward as it seems because real-world data is often noisy, with variations in feature sizes depending on input data or missing values.

The simplest scenario assumes we have a pre-defined and fixed number of features, and the size of each of those is also consistent and known. In this case, we can utilize basic indexing and slicing. Think of it like extracting specific pages from a bound book; each page (feature set) is a chunk of contiguous values in our larger, concatenated feature vector.

Here’s a python snippet that illustrates this:

```python
def split_concatenated_vector_fixed(vector, feature_sizes):
    """
    Splits a concatenated feature vector into a list of sub-lists
    based on known, fixed feature sizes.

    Args:
      vector: The concatenated feature vector (list or numpy array).
      feature_sizes: A list of integers representing the size of each feature.

    Returns:
      A list of sub-lists, each representing one of the original features.
    """
    if not isinstance(vector, list):
        vector = list(vector)  # Handles cases where vector might be a numpy array

    result = []
    start_index = 0
    for size in feature_sizes:
        end_index = start_index + size
        result.append(vector[start_index:end_index])
        start_index = end_index
    return result


# Example usage:
concatenated_vector = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
feature_sizes = [3, 4, 3]
split_vector = split_concatenated_vector_fixed(concatenated_vector, feature_sizes)
print(split_vector)  # Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]

```

This code works well when the dimensions are strictly known beforehand. However, in practice, you're often dealing with dynamic datasets where feature sets may vary in length. For instance, user features could have variable length due to profile completeness or different types of items having a different number of categorical features. Handling variable-length features adds a layer of complexity.

Another common pattern that I have encountered is where, instead of the feature sizes, the indices which denote boundaries between the features is specified instead. Let’s imagine our feature vector is not constructed by a simple concatenation, but generated from a different procedure that still preserves the source features, but the output is a single feature vector. In this case, knowing exactly the beginning and end indices of each segment is critical.

Here is another python snippet focusing on the index boundaries of the feature vectors:

```python
def split_concatenated_vector_indices(vector, feature_indices):
    """
    Splits a concatenated feature vector into a list of sub-lists
    based on predefined feature indices.

    Args:
        vector: The concatenated feature vector (list or numpy array).
        feature_indices: A list of tuples, where each tuple defines the (start, end)
           indices of a feature in the vector.

    Returns:
        A list of sub-lists, each representing one of the original features.
    """
    if not isinstance(vector, list):
        vector = list(vector)

    result = []
    for start, end in feature_indices:
      result.append(vector[start:end])
    return result

# Example usage:
concatenated_vector = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
feature_indices = [(0, 3), (3, 7), (7, 10)]
split_vector = split_concatenated_vector_indices(concatenated_vector, feature_indices)
print(split_vector) # Output: [[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60, 70], [80, 90, 100]]
```

This index-based approach gives us more control. We can handle missing or padded features effectively because we're explicitly stating the beginning and ending location of each feature within the large, combined vector.

Finally, there is a more complex scenario where the feature sizes and the indices of each feature are not known beforehand. In this case, there are two typical alternatives. The first would be to store the feature information (sizes or indices) during the concatenation procedure, which can be time-consuming and can cause problems when the information is not stored properly. The other alternative would be to introduce some 'marker' values within the concatenated feature vector that will allow us to deconstruct the vector in subsequent stages. This last approach would be useful when we cannot modify the concatenation procedure, for example, if the vector is being passed by an external process and we do not have control over it.

The following code illustrates the marker-based approach:

```python
def split_concatenated_vector_markers(vector, marker):
    """
    Splits a concatenated feature vector into a list of sub-lists
    using a marker to delineate feature boundaries.

    Args:
        vector: The concatenated feature vector (list or numpy array).
        marker: The value that delineates boundaries between feature sets.

    Returns:
      A list of sub-lists, each representing one of the original features.
    """
    if not isinstance(vector, list):
      vector = list(vector)

    result = []
    current_feature = []
    for value in vector:
        if value == marker:
            if current_feature:
                result.append(current_feature)
                current_feature = []
        else:
            current_feature.append(value)

    # append the last feature if it exists.
    if current_feature:
      result.append(current_feature)

    return result


# Example usage:
concatenated_vector = [1, 2, 3, -999, 4, 5, 6, 7, -999, 8, 9, 10]
marker = -999
split_vector = split_concatenated_vector_markers(concatenated_vector, marker)
print(split_vector) # Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]
```
This approach is robust to variable feature lengths and does not require prior information about how the vector was created.

For further study in this area, I'd recommend looking into resources that deal with feature engineering and data preprocessing. Specifically, I'd point you toward "Feature Engineering for Machine Learning" by Alice Zheng and Amanda Casari which provides a solid overview of practical techniques like this. Also, consult "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney for extensive information on utilizing libraries like NumPy for vectorized operations, which can significantly speed up processing of large feature vectors. In addition, research papers that focus on specific machine learning or recommender system architectures (which typically use such approaches) are helpful. Papers published at conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, and KDD often deal with this kind of low-level feature handling.

In summary, creating lists from concatenated feature vectors requires a solid understanding of your data's structure. Choosing the right method depends heavily on whether you know the sizes, indices or have a marker that defines the different feature set boundaries. The examples I've presented are practical and robust, representing strategies I've personally employed to solve real problems. Remember to tailor your approach to the specifics of your application and data, and always think about efficiency when working with large datasets.
