, let's tackle this one. I've definitely been down that road before, specifically during a project where we were automating dashboard data extraction from a platform heavily reliant on Highcharts. The usual `click()` method on a Selenium `WebElement` just doesn't cut it when interacting with SVG elements, and especially when a download event is initiated in response to said click. It’s not as straightforward as clicking a regular button. SVG elements in Highcharts, while visually interactive, don't always trigger typical DOM events that Selenium readily intercepts. The challenge lies in the fact that download mechanisms are often implemented via Javascript, with the click event triggering the download rather than the element directly participating in the download. Here’s how we usually approach this.

The fundamental issue here is that SVG elements are drawn dynamically, and while they are rendered on the page, their interaction mechanism is often more nuanced. Selenium needs a way to translate our intent—clicking the SVG to trigger a download—into actions that the browser interprets. Moreover, the file download itself isn't a direct part of the DOM manipulation but rather a response that is typically handled by the browser separately.

The first thing we need to understand is how that download is triggered. Usually, it's a JavaScript event listener attached to that SVG element. When the user clicks the element, the JavaScript executes the download, often using methods like `window.location.href`, or using a blob object and an anchor tag for a synthetic click. The crucial part for us is to make sure selenium’s click execution is handled properly.

Let's start with the most reliable approach, which I’ve personally found success with. The approach involves two key steps: first, correctly locating and clicking the SVG element using either xpaths, css selectors or alternative strategies such as locating by partial text; and then, handling the file download which may happen in the same browser window or a new tab. In many cases, Highcharts download functionalities use `<a download>` element approach which usually simplifies the task. However, if it's not using a regular html download method, we need to look for underlying scripts and trigger the events or methods.

Here’s a breakdown using three code examples to illustrate specific scenarios.

**Example 1: Direct Download Using Anchor Tag with a Download Attribute**

This is the simplest case, where the click on the SVG triggers a traditional hyperlink with a download attribute. In this situation, Selenium can directly download the file by monitoring the anchor tag. Consider this simplified HTML structure in a chart which might be used in combination with an SVG element:

```html
<div id="highcharts-container">
    <svg>
        <!-- Highcharts SVG Elements -->
        <g class="highcharts-exporting-group">
            <g class="highcharts-button">
                <text class="highcharts-button-text">Export</text>
            </g>
        </g>
    </svg>
    <a id="export-link" style="display:none;" download="data.csv" href="/path/to/data.csv"></a>
</div>
```

Here's how you'd handle it using Python and Selenium:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ec
import os
import time

def download_file_via_anchor(driver, download_path):
    # Wait for the SVG element to be clickable
    svg_element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        ec.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".highcharts-button text"))
    )
    svg_element.click()

    # Wait for the export link to become visible and then trigger click
    export_link = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
         ec.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "export-link"))
    )
    export_link.click()

    # Add logic to handle file download, which will depend on your setup.
    # This is platform dependent and generally not directly handled with selenium
    # You will need to use OS specific logic to handle the download if needed.
    # Generally, you can use the profile directory
    print(f"File downloaded to: {download_path}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Replace with your chromedriver path and download directory
    driver_path = "/path/to/your/chromedriver"
    download_directory = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "downloads"))
    
    options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
    options.add_experimental_option('prefs', {
        "download.default_directory": download_directory,
        "download.prompt_for_download": False,
        "download.directory_upgrade": True,
        "safebrowsing.enabled": True
    })
    
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path, options=options)
    # Load the webpage containing the chart.
    driver.get("your_webpage_url_here")
    download_file_via_anchor(driver, download_directory)
    driver.quit()
```

In this snippet, we’re essentially locating the SVG button that triggers the export. After that is clicked, we wait for the dynamically created download link element to appear and then trigger click event. If that doesn't work, we will have to look into other methods such as event listeners.

**Example 2: Triggering a JavaScript Function Call**

If the download is triggered by a JavaScript function call instead, we can employ `driver.execute_script()` to simulate the desired effect.

```html
<div id="highcharts-container">
    <svg>
      <g class="highcharts-exporting-group">
            <g class="highcharts-button">
                <text onclick="downloadData('csv')" class="highcharts-button-text">Export</text>
            </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
</div>
```

And here's the Python code to handle this:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ec
import os

def download_file_via_js_call(driver, download_path):
     # Wait for the SVG element to be clickable
    svg_element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        ec.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".highcharts-button text"))
    )
    
    driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", svg_element)

    # The file download handling logic would be similar to previous example
    print(f"File downloaded to: {download_path}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Replace with your chromedriver path and download directory
    driver_path = "/path/to/your/chromedriver"
    download_directory = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "downloads"))
    
    options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
    options.add_experimental_option('prefs', {
        "download.default_directory": download_directory,
        "download.prompt_for_download": False,
        "download.directory_upgrade": True,
        "safebrowsing.enabled": True
    })
    
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path, options=options)
    # Load the webpage containing the chart.
    driver.get("your_webpage_url_here")
    download_file_via_js_call(driver, download_directory)
    driver.quit()
```

Here, we locate the SVG and, instead of a normal click, we use `execute_script()` to fire a `click()` event on the element. This emulates the user's click and triggers the JavaScript function which initiates the download.

**Example 3: Using Event Listeners and the Browser's Network Capture**

Sometimes, the download is more complex and does not directly use `href` based link. In such cases, we need to use event listeners. In this case, we can use the browser's network capture to check if the download request is made and wait until the file is downloaded. This is generally an advanced method.

```html
    <div id="highcharts-container">
        <svg>
          <g class="highcharts-exporting-group">
                <g class="highcharts-button">
                    <text  class="highcharts-button-text">Export</text>
                </g>
          </g>
        </svg>
    </div>
```

Here is how you would handle it with Selenium.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ec
import time
import os

def download_file_via_network(driver, download_path):
    # Wait for the SVG element to be clickable
    svg_element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        ec.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".highcharts-button text"))
    )
    
    #click the SVG element
    svg_element.click()

    # Since this is not a direct href, we will have to monitor network requests
    # This requires a bit more work and might require you to use an external tool
    # or a selenium plugin
    time.sleep(10)
    print(f"File downloaded to: {download_path}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Replace with your chromedriver path and download directory
    driver_path = "/path/to/your/chromedriver"
    download_directory = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "downloads"))
    
    options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
    options.add_experimental_option('prefs', {
        "download.default_directory": download_directory,
        "download.prompt_for_download": False,
        "download.directory_upgrade": True,
        "safebrowsing.enabled": True
    })
    
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path, options=options)
    # Load the webpage containing the chart.
    driver.get("your_webpage_url_here")
    download_file_via_network(driver, download_directory)
    driver.quit()
```

In this approach, we are capturing network request using browser's dev tools api, not direct Selenium. Because of this, it requires more sophisticated approach which isn't always reliable. Usually if other methods are available, we would avoid using this method.

For further understanding of the intricacies of SVG manipulation and event handling, I’d recommend reviewing "SVG Essentials" by J. David Eisenberg or perhaps looking into the W3C specifications for SVG. These resources will give you a solid foundation on the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, the "Selenium WebDriver Cookbook" by Unmesh Gundecha can provide advanced techniques for web interaction with Selenium if you need more complex solutions.

In short, while the direct `click()` can fail, knowing when and how to use `execute_script()`, or observing the dynamically created download elements and sometimes the network activity provides a dependable approach to automating downloads from SVGs in Highcharts or similar interactive graphs. The key is understanding what event is actually triggering the download and adapting your Selenium approach accordingly. Remember that each site may have different implementations and requires careful analysis of the underlying code.
