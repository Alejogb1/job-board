Okay, let's tackle this. I've certainly seen this integration need pop up quite a few times, especially in environments relying heavily on both cloud storage and real-time communication like Slack. The core challenge revolves around orchestrating the data transfer from Google Cloud Storage (gcs) to a Slack channel, and doing it reliably. Apache Airflow, with its scheduling and task management capabilities, is definitely the tool for this job. I’ll detail a few approaches, showing practical examples built from my experience with different project setups.

First, let's establish the general idea. We are looking to create an airflow dag that, on a schedule, will: (1) identify files in a specific gcs bucket path, (2) download those files locally (to where the airflow worker will have access), and (3) send those files to a configured slack channel via the slack api. A few critical steps are therefore necessary. We will need to configure airflow with the proper gcp and slack credentials. Then we need to write the dag, which will include operators to pull data from gcs, potentially transform it, and post it to slack.

Let's move to code examples that highlight practical methods I've used over the years. Keep in mind that the specific details like the slack channel, the gcs bucket path, etc., are placeholders and will need to be updated based on your environment.

**Example 1: Basic File Upload to Slack**

This example demonstrates a simple scenario: retrieving a single file from gcs and sending it as a slack file attachment. We'll assume airflow has gcp and slack connections defined with identifiers `gcp_default` and `slack_default`, respectively. Also, I'll be using the `google-cloud-storage` and `slack-sdk` python libraries.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gcs_to_local import GCSToLocalFilesystemOperator
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
from slack_sdk import WebClient
import os

def upload_to_slack(file_path, slack_channel, slack_token):
    client = WebClient(token=slack_token)
    try:
        result = client.files_upload_v2(
            channel=slack_channel,
            file=file_path,
            filename=os.path.basename(file_path),
            title=os.path.basename(file_path),
        )
        print(f"File uploaded successfully to Slack: {result}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error uploading to slack: {e}")

with DAG(
    dag_id="gcs_to_slack_basic",
    schedule=None,
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
    tags=["gcs", "slack"],
) as dag:
    download_from_gcs = GCSToLocalFilesystemOperator(
        task_id="download_gcs_file",
        bucket="your-gcs-bucket",
        object_name="path/to/your/file.txt",
        filename="/tmp/downloaded_file.txt",
        gcp_conn_id="gcp_default"
    )

    upload_file_to_slack = PythonOperator(
        task_id="upload_to_slack_task",
        python_callable=upload_to_slack,
        op_kwargs={
            "file_path":"/tmp/downloaded_file.txt",
            "slack_channel":"#your-slack-channel",
            "slack_token": "{{ conn.slack_default.password }}"  #Retrieve from connection details
         },
    )

    download_from_gcs >> upload_file_to_slack
```

In this example, we’ve used the built-in `GCSToLocalFilesystemOperator` to download the specified file and then a python operator that uses slack-sdk’s `files_upload_v2`. Note how I extract the slack token via airflow connection templating `{{ conn.slack_default.password }}` for better security.

**Example 2: Dynamic File Selection and Slack Message Formatting**

Sometimes, you need to send multiple files and also include additional contextual information in the slack message. Here's how we could expand on our basic example. Instead of a direct file upload, we will send message that includes file links.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gcs_to_local import GCSToLocalFilesystemOperator
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime
from google.cloud import storage
from slack_sdk import WebClient
import os

def list_and_download_gcs_files(bucket_name, prefix, download_dir, gcp_conn_id):
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
    blobs = bucket.list_blobs(prefix=prefix)
    
    downloaded_files = []
    for blob in blobs:
        file_path = os.path.join(download_dir, blob.name.split('/')[-1])
        blob.download_to_filename(file_path)
        downloaded_files.append(file_path)
    return downloaded_files

def format_and_send_slack_message(files, slack_channel, slack_token):
    client = WebClient(token=slack_token)

    message_text = "Following files have been processed:\n"
    for f in files:
       message_text += f"- {os.path.basename(f)}\n"

    try:
      result = client.chat_postMessage(channel=slack_channel, text=message_text)
      print(f"Message posted to slack: {result}")
    except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error sending message: {e}")

with DAG(
    dag_id="gcs_to_slack_dynamic",
    schedule=None,
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
    tags=["gcs", "slack"],
) as dag:
    download_gcs_files = PythonOperator(
        task_id="download_gcs_files_task",
        python_callable=list_and_download_gcs_files,
        op_kwargs={
            "bucket_name":"your-gcs-bucket",
            "prefix": "path/to/directory/",
            "download_dir":"/tmp",
            "gcp_conn_id": "gcp_default"
          },
    )
    
    send_slack_message = PythonOperator(
        task_id="send_slack_message_task",
        python_callable=format_and_send_slack_message,
        op_kwargs={
            "slack_channel":"#your-slack-channel",
             "slack_token": "{{ conn.slack_default.password }}",
             "files" : "{{ ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='download_gcs_files_task') }}"
         }
    )

    download_gcs_files >> send_slack_message
```
Here, `list_and_download_gcs_files` dynamically grabs all files from a prefix, downloads them locally, and returns a list of filepaths. The `format_and_send_slack_message` then crafts a message with a basic listing of the file names. In practice, you might want to format a more elaborate message with links to the actual files, potentially to signed urls. Notice, that the returned list of file paths are passed through XCOM as they are needed as context for the next task.

**Example 3: Utilizing a Custom Airflow Hook for Slack**

For more complex slack operations and reuse, it's good to create a custom hook. Here's a basic example that builds on top of the `slack-sdk`.

```python
from airflow.providers.slack.hooks.slack import SlackHook
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

class CustomSlackHook(SlackHook):

  def __init__(self, slack_conn_id="slack_default", *args, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(slack_conn_id=slack_conn_id, *args, **kwargs)
    self.client = WebClient(token=self.slack_token)

  def send_files_and_message(self, channel, files, message):
        try:
          if message:
            result = self.client.chat_postMessage(channel=channel, text=message)
            print(f"Message posted to slack: {result}")
          for file in files:
            result = self.client.files_upload_v2(
                channel=channel,
                file=file,
                filename=os.path.basename(file),
                title=os.path.basename(file),
              )
            print(f"File uploaded successfully to Slack: {result}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in custom hook: {e}")


def send_custom_slack_message(slack_hook, slack_channel, files, message):
    slack_hook.send_files_and_message(slack_channel,files, message)

with DAG(
    dag_id="gcs_to_slack_hook",
    schedule=None,
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
    tags=["gcs", "slack", "custom_hook"],
) as dag:
    
    #reuse the 'list_and_download_gcs_files' from previous example
    download_gcs_files = PythonOperator(
        task_id="download_gcs_files_task",
        python_callable=list_and_download_gcs_files,
        op_kwargs={
            "bucket_name":"your-gcs-bucket",
            "prefix": "path/to/directory/",
            "download_dir":"/tmp",
            "gcp_conn_id": "gcp_default"
          },
    )
    
    slack_op = PythonOperator(
        task_id="custom_slack_operator",
        python_callable=send_custom_slack_message,
        op_kwargs={
            "slack_hook": CustomSlackHook(),
            "slack_channel":"#your-slack-channel",
            "files" : "{{ ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='download_gcs_files_task') }}",
            "message" : "Here are the updated files:"
         }
     )

    download_gcs_files >> slack_op
```

Here, the key is the `CustomSlackHook`, inheriting from Airflow's `SlackHook` and adding a method `send_files_and_message`. This way we’ve encapsulated all of slack interaction.

**Further Resources**

For in-depth understanding of the underlying concepts I would recommend the following resources:

*   **"Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann**: While not solely about Airflow, it covers the fundamental principles of data systems, which greatly improves how to architect a system such as this.
*   **"Google Cloud Platform for Data Engineering" by Danilo Sato**: Great resource to learn more about Google Cloud services.
*  **Apache Airflow Documentation**: The official docs offer a wide range of information regarding the framework, operators and best practices.
*  **Slack API Documentation**: This should be the source for all updates on how slack interacts with python.

In closing, sending files from GCS to Slack via Airflow is a common task. These snippets should give you a solid starting point, whether you're doing a single file transfer, dynamically listing, or using a custom slack hook. The key is understanding your specific requirements and then building a solution incrementally. Remember to always handle credentials securely and test your dags thoroughly.
