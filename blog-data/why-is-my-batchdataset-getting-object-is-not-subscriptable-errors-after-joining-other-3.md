Let's tackle this. I've seen this specific error pop up more times than I care to count, often when batching and manipulating datasets, especially those originating from TensorFlow's tf.data API. It's a classic case of type mismatch, but the devil, as always, is in the details of how you're combining these datasets. The 'object is not subscriptable' error, in this context, typically arises when you're trying to access elements of a dataset in a manner that assumes it's a list or dictionary, when in reality, it's a `tf.data.Dataset` object. And when you're joining datasets, particularly a few of them, the complexity multiplies rapidly.

The core issue, and this is where my past experience with a particularly gnarly data pipeline for a recommendation system comes in handy, is that when you chain `tf.data.Dataset` objects via operations like `zip`, `concatenate`, or `interleave`, the resulting dataset may no longer have the structure you implicitly expect. Instead of the individual samples, or rather, *batches* of individual samples being directly accessible via square brackets (i.e., `my_dataset[0]`), the datasets represent a *sequence* or *stream* of elements which need to be processed in a deferred and iterative manner. Trying to directly index them will understandably fail. The error message itself, while terse, is a very accurate descriptor of the fundamental mismatch between the object you have and what you're trying to do with it.

In that particular recommendation system, we were pulling data from three different sources: user profiles, historical interaction logs, and product catalogs, each with their own quirks. Initially, we were attempting to merge these datasets using a seemingly straightforward sequence of operations, expecting that we could index and manipulate the resulting dataset like a regular numpy array. We hit this very same "object is not subscriptable" error. That's when it became clear that we needed to restructure how we accessed and processed the data coming from our combined datasets. We weren't dealing with discrete arrays, but a flow of batches.

Let's illustrate with a few examples. Assume, for a moment, you have three datasets created as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example Datasets (replace with your actual loading/creation logic)
dataset1 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.range(10))
dataset2 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.range(10, 20))
dataset3 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.range(20, 30))
```

Now, let’s show a naive and incorrect attempt that results in the error, followed by two proper approaches.

**Incorrect Example (Leading to the Error):**

```python
# Incorrect: Attempt to access data directly, which leads to 'object is not subscriptable'
try:
  combined_dataset_incorrect = tf.data.Dataset.zip((dataset1, dataset2, dataset3))
  print(combined_dataset_incorrect[0]) # This will throw the error.
except TypeError as e:
  print(f"Error Encountered: {e}")
```

This approach, while intuitive if you're used to regular lists, will indeed raise a `TypeError: 'ZipDataset' object is not subscriptable`. The reason is, as I previously mentioned, that `combined_dataset_incorrect` isn't a structure that is directly indexable, rather it's a representation of a deferred computation. You can't just pluck out elements using numeric indices. Instead, you need to use iteration methods provided by the `tf.data` API.

**Correct Example 1: Using Iteration:**

The most common and correct way is to iterate through the dataset using a for loop or similar constructs. This approach works because datasets are designed to be treated as streams of data.

```python
# Correct: Iterating through the dataset
combined_dataset_correct_iter = tf.data.Dataset.zip((dataset1, dataset2, dataset3))

for example1, example2, example3 in combined_dataset_correct_iter.take(2): # Only take the first two to see
    print(f"Dataset 1: {example1.numpy()}, Dataset 2: {example2.numpy()}, Dataset 3: {example3.numpy()}")

```

This code iterates through the combined dataset, extracting each element which is itself a tuple containing a value from each of the original datasets. This exemplifies how to correctly consume data from combined datasets.

**Correct Example 2: Mapping and Batching:**

You'll often need to perform operations on the data before using it, such as reshaping it or combining features further before feeding it into a model. In those cases, you would use `.map()` with some batching.

```python
# Correct: Using map and batch
combined_dataset_correct_map = tf.data.Dataset.zip((dataset1, dataset2, dataset3))

def my_mapping_func(elem1, elem2, elem3):
  # Example function, you would do your own custom logic here
  return tf.concat([tf.expand_dims(elem1, 0), tf.expand_dims(elem2, 0), tf.expand_dims(elem3, 0)], 0)


batched_dataset = combined_dataset_correct_map.map(my_mapping_func).batch(4)

for batch in batched_dataset.take(2): # Only take two batches to keep it concise
    print(f"Batched Data: {batch.numpy()}")
```

In this final example, a `mapping_function` is applied to each tuple of data from the joined dataset using `.map()`. This allows further operations to modify the data according to your needs. Batching is done after mapping the data. This final result is the format required when dealing with input to machine learning models. The map function transforms the tuple of individual elements and makes them ready for the batch operation, in a vectorized way.

The take away? `tf.data.Dataset` objects aren’t like lists or arrays and cannot be accessed via numeric indices. You must iterate over the batches and make use of mapping to transform them.

For a deeper dive into data pipelines and efficient data loading with TensorFlow, I'd recommend looking into the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data`. In addition, the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron (specifically chapter 13 on data loading and preprocessing) is an excellent resource. Also, understanding the deferred execution model common in many data processing libraries like Spark and Dask, can provide conceptual clarity on why operations on `tf.data.Dataset` behave as they do. Understanding these concepts provides the foundation for handling more complex data processing scenarios and avoiding similar errors in the future.
