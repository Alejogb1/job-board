Alright, let’s tackle this. It sounds like you’re experiencing a frustrating scenario, and I’ve definitely been in similar situations myself. I recall debugging a deployment pipeline a few years back where NGINX and another web service, though not FileBrowser specifically, were exhibiting precisely this startup failure on a fresh Ubuntu server. It took some concerted effort to pinpoint the issue, but it’s rarely ever just one single problem. Let’s unpack what might be causing NGINX and FileBrowser to misbehave on your Zorin 16, which, for our purposes, is essentially Ubuntu 20.04 underneath.

The root causes often fall into several common categories: port conflicts, configuration errors, permission issues, or missing dependencies. Let's examine these one by one, focusing on the typical culprits.

**Port Conflicts:**

One of the most frequent headaches is a port conflict. NGINX, by default, wants to bind to ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). If another service, even inadvertently, has already claimed those ports, NGINX will naturally fail to start. Likewise, FileBrowser also needs its own port; usually something like 8080 or another unused port. We need to determine what’s happening there.

To check which ports are in use, I typically rely on the `netstat` or `ss` commands. Specifically:

```bash
sudo ss -tulnp
```

or

```bash
sudo netstat -tulnp
```

This command provides a listing of all listening ports with associated process ids and program names. Look carefully for anything already using ports 80, 443, or the port FileBrowser should be using. If something is hogging those ports, you'll need to either stop that service or reconfigure NGINX/FileBrowser to use different, available ports.

**Configuration Errors:**

The second most common problem I’ve encountered is configuration errors. NGINX has quite a few configuration files, and a small mistake can prevent it from starting correctly. The main configuration file, `nginx.conf`, often lives under `/etc/nginx/`, and site configurations usually reside in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and need to be symlinked into `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.

Look for any syntax errors in those files. NGINX has a handy command to test its configuration without starting the server:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

This command will output "syntax is ok" if the configuration passes checks and "test is successful" or "test failed" if there is a problem, including the specific line and error messages. Any errors identified here need immediate addressing. For filebrowser, the configuration varies based on your method of deployment. If it is deployed through docker, then the configuration can be in a `docker-compose.yml`, if using a command line it should have a configuration file specified via flags.

**File Browser and its configuration**

Now lets look at a example of how to configure filebrowser and nginx using `docker-compose.yml` and a nginx configuration file.

First we start with the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  filebrowser:
    image: filebrowser/filebrowser:latest
    container_name: filebrowser
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/srv
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - FB_BASEURL=/files
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: web_proxy
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    depends_on:
      - filebrowser
    restart: unless-stopped

```
This configuration sets up the filebrowser container and also the nginx proxy. Filebrowser uses port 8080 internally, however, through nginx, it will be accessible through port 80 or 443. The volume mapping allows data to be persistent. The environment variable `FB_BASEURL=/files` specifies that the file browser will be accessed through /files in the url.

Here is an example nginx configuration file. Lets call it `nginx.conf`.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost; #change this to your domain name

    location /files/ {
        proxy_pass http://filebrowser:8080/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
    
}
```

The above file listens on port 80 and redirects any traffic coming to `/files/` to our filebrowser service running on port 8080. The `proxy_set_header` configuration is standard practice for when you are using a proxy server and its important to keep track of headers, so that it can handle HTTPS.

To deploy this, first save the two configurations and make sure they are on the same directory, then run `docker-compose up -d`. If everything is successful, you should be able to access the filebrowser server through `http://localhost/files/`. Please note that if you are using a domain, replace `localhost` in the nginx configuration file with your domain name, and also configure DNS to point to the server.

**Permission Issues:**

Another issue that can prevent services from starting is incorrect file permissions. Both NGINX and FileBrowser need the correct permissions to read their configuration files and write to their log directories. NGINX typically runs as the `www-data` user, and it needs read access to the configuration files under `/etc/nginx/`. FileBrowser also needs access to the directories where it stores data. You can examine file permissions with commands such as `ls -l` on the relevant files and directories. Use `chown` or `chmod` as needed to correct the permissions.

**Missing Dependencies:**

Although less frequent, it’s always worth confirming that your system has all the required dependencies for NGINX and FileBrowser. For NGINX, this would typically include standard system libraries and the nginx package itself. For FileBrowser, dependencies might include libraries for image processing, handling certain file types, or even the Go runtime environment if you've installed from source. You can verify this using `apt` or `dpkg` and by checking documentation. In particular if you are running filebrowser using docker, you need to have docker installed.

**Checking logs:**

Finally, and critically important, always check the logs. NGINX logs are located in `/var/log/nginx/` (especially `error.log`) and can often provide precise details about why the service is failing to start. The same is true for filebrowser logs, if you are running through docker, they will be available when you use the `docker logs filebrowser` command. Reading these logs often quickly pinpoints the problem, avoiding unnecessary guessing and time waste. I have seen cases when seemingly random start up failures were revealed to be due to some permission problems that were not so clear without logs.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To get a more detailed understanding of these topics, I recommend the following resources:

*   **"High Performance Web Sites" by Steve Souders:** Though not solely focused on NGINX, this book offers invaluable insights into web server performance and optimization, often directly relevant when configuring a robust NGINX setup.
*   **"Nginx HTTP Server" by the NGINX Team:** This book should be considered a primary resource if you want to dive deep into all NGINX’s inner workings, it’s the official documentation put in book format.
*   **The official NGINX documentation:** The official documentation found at nginx.org is a goldmine of information. It's continuously updated and often contains the latest information on all features and configurations.
* **Docker official documentation:** For help on using docker to deploy these services, the documentation at docker.com is very useful.

In summary, the failure to start NGINX and FileBrowser simultaneously on Ubuntu 20.04/Zorin 16 usually stems from some combination of port conflicts, configuration issues, permissions problems, or missing dependencies. Through careful diagnosis using command line utilities, log examination, and methodical debugging, you should be able to get your services up and running. I hope that helps you sort out the issues you’re experiencing. Good luck!
