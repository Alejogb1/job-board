, let’s tackle this. I remember facing a similar challenge a few years back when I was working on a large-scale social media sentiment analysis project. We had thousands of text comments, and extracting the most relevant keyword from each was crucial for our topic modeling. The problem wasn't just about finding the "most frequent" word; it was about finding the *most meaningful* one. Let's explore how to approach this using pandas, which, as we all know, is often our data manipulation workhorse.

Firstly, when we talk about "relevant" words, we need to define it rigorously. We can't just grab the first non-stop word that comes along. Generally, what constitutes a relevant word depends heavily on the context, but a good starting point involves understanding two things: stop words and word frequencies, but crucially *also* incorporating some measure of importance.

Let's assume you've got your data in a pandas DataFrame, something like this:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'comment': [
    "This product is amazing, I love it!",
    "The customer service was very poor and slow.",
    "I am extremely happy with my purchase.",
    "This is not at all what I expected."
]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

The first step, usually, involves cleaning up the text. This often means lowercasing, removing punctuation, and handling contractions. However, since we're focusing on the core concept here, I’ll skip those for brevity and assume your text is reasonably clean. Now, let's discuss stop words. These are common words like "the," "is," and "a" that typically don’t carry much semantic weight. We can leverage a pre-built list of stop words; libraries like `nltk` provide them, or you can build your own tailored list if needed. We will use nltk in the first example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

def find_relevant_word_nltk(comment):
    words = word_tokenize(comment.lower())
    filtered_words = [w for w in words if not w in stop_words and w.isalnum()] # isalnum() removes punctuation remnants
    if not filtered_words:
        return None # Return None if no relevant words
    return max(set(filtered_words), key = filtered_words.count)

df['relevant_word_nltk'] = df['comment'].apply(find_relevant_word_nltk)
print(df)
```
This example employs the `nltk` library for stop word removal and tokenization. The `find_relevant_word_nltk` function tokenizes each comment, filters out stop words and punctuation, and then returns the most frequent word from the remaining words. If no relevant words exist, it returns `None`. The pandas `apply` function neatly integrates this function and creates a new column called `relevant_word_nltk`.

In that sentiment analysis project, however, frequency alone wasn't always enough. Sometimes a word appearing less often could be more significant in the context of the discussion. To address this, I frequently resorted to using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). TF-IDF emphasizes words that are frequent in a document but not necessarily across all documents. It’s a nice middle ground between focusing on globally common words and focusing purely on local frequency. For that, I'd utilize `scikit-learn`. Here is a snippet implementing that:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

data = {'comment': [
    "This product is amazing, I love it!",
    "The customer service was very poor and slow.",
    "I am extremely happy with my purchase.",
    "This is not at all what I expected."
]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)


def find_relevant_word_tfidf(comment, vectorizer):
    vectorized_comment = vectorizer.transform([comment])
    feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
    if vectorized_comment.nnz == 0:  # Check if vectorization resulted in any tokens
        return None
    dense = vectorized_comment.todense().tolist()[0]
    phrase_scores = [pair for pair in zip(range(0, len(dense)), dense) if pair[1] > 0]
    sorted_phrase_scores = sorted(phrase_scores, key=lambda t: t[1] * -1)
    if not sorted_phrase_scores:  # Check if phrase scores exist
      return None
    best_index = sorted_phrase_scores[0][0]
    return feature_names[best_index]

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
vectorizer.fit(df['comment'])
df['relevant_word_tfidf'] = df['comment'].apply(lambda x: find_relevant_word_tfidf(x, vectorizer))
print(df)
```
In this example, we instantiate a `TfidfVectorizer` with english stop words and fit it on the corpus of comments in the dataframe. We use its transform method to generate the TF-IDF vectors and look for the best token. We create a new 'relevant_word_tfidf' column using this function. It's worth noting that TF-IDF tends to perform well when the document set isn't excessively diverse. The benefit is that it down-weights words that are commonly used in all documents, giving relevance to words that are important for the *specific* text being analyzed.

Now, let's consider a scenario where we need a more sophisticated approach because both of the previous examples were looking only at single words. What if your significant content was expressed in terms of multi-word phrases? This requires us to handle n-grams, where 'n' can represent bi-grams (two words), tri-grams (three words) or larger sequences of words. It also adds a new layer of difficulty because n-grams can have varying lengths, which is challenging with our approach, so we will generate ngrams of all possible sizes from 1 to 3 and then apply TF-IDF as before.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

data = {'comment': [
    "This product is amazing, I love it!",
    "The customer service was very poor and slow.",
    "I am extremely happy with my purchase.",
    "This is not at all what I expected."
]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def find_relevant_ngram_tfidf(comment, vectorizer):
    vectorized_comment = vectorizer.transform([comment])
    feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
    if vectorized_comment.nnz == 0:
        return None
    dense = vectorized_comment.todense().tolist()[0]
    phrase_scores = [pair for pair in zip(range(0, len(dense)), dense) if pair[1] > 0]
    sorted_phrase_scores = sorted(phrase_scores, key=lambda t: t[1] * -1)
    if not sorted_phrase_scores:
        return None
    best_index = sorted_phrase_scores[0][0]
    return feature_names[best_index]

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', ngram_range=(1,3))
vectorizer.fit(df['comment'])
df['relevant_ngram_tfidf'] = df['comment'].apply(lambda x: find_relevant_ngram_tfidf(x, vectorizer))
print(df)
```
Here, the only change is the addition of the `ngram_range=(1,3)` parameter when we instantiate our vectorizer. Now it generates uni-grams, bi-grams, and tri-grams. The rest is the same as the previous example, so the code generates the same output, but in terms of ngrams this time.

These examples provide three different approaches, each with its own trade-offs. For simple cases, just identifying the most frequent word with stop word removal might be adequate. However, if you are working with complex text you'll likely get better results using TF-IDF, especially when dealing with larger corpuses. If key phrases are your target, ngrams are invaluable, but note that these come with an increase in computational cost.

For further learning, I'd strongly recommend looking into "Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin; it's a cornerstone for anyone in NLP. "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing" by Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Schütze is also an excellent resource for gaining a deeper understanding of the statistical methods often employed in text analysis. And, of course, scikit-learn’s documentation for `TfidfVectorizer` is crucial to explore its full capabilities and parameters. It's also worth exploring some more advanced topic modelling approaches, such as those detailed in "Probabilistic Topic Models" by David M. Blei, as they often offer another angle on identifying relevance.
Remember, the 'best' approach is entirely dependent on your specific data, objectives, and computational resources. Experimentation and a sound understanding of the underlying methods are key.
