Let's get straight into it; this question about the consistency of word2vec embeddings across retrains is actually quite nuanced and, based on some past projects, not as straightforward as one might initially expect. I recall a particular natural language processing system I worked on a few years back where we had to grapple directly with this issue. We were continuously updating the training corpus, which meant we had to retrain our word embeddings periodically. Initially, we assumed that retraining on the exact same corpus would produce identical embeddings, but that assumption was, shall we say, quickly challenged.

The short answer is: no, word2vec embeddings will almost never be exactly identical after retraining, even when using the same corpus. There's a confluence of factors at play that introduce a degree of stochasticity. Primarily, the algorithm is based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a technique that inherently has a degree of randomness in how it moves toward the optimum during training. Let's break that down a bit further.

The core of word2vec, whether we're talking about the skip-gram or continuous bag-of-words (cbow) variant, involves initializing word vectors with random values. This randomness isn't just a quirk; it's fundamental to breaking symmetry and allowing the model to learn distinct relationships between words. When training starts, the SGD algorithm iteratively adjusts these vectors based on the prediction error for the words it examines. The order in which training data is presented to the model, the learning rate, and the specific initialization – all of these contribute to a different training path, and therefore to slightly different final vector representations. The inherent noise in this process prevents word vectors from converging at the exact same point each training run.

Moreover, the impact of random seed initialization isn’t the only thing to consider. The way we define the training epochs – how many times the entire dataset is passed through the network – also has a bearing. Even with identical settings, different initial states can lead to varied minima being discovered. Essentially, the objective function, in the context of word2vec’s negative sampling, isn't a perfect, smooth bowl, but a complex, multi-dimensional surface with numerous local minima, each representing a slightly different, yet often functionally equivalent, embedding space.

Now, what does this look like in practice? I’ll give you three examples using python and the gensim library, a popular choice for word vector modeling.

**Example 1: Basic retraining, demonstrating slight variations.**

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import numpy as np
import random

sentences = [["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"], ["jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]]

# Function to train and return model and embedding for word "the"
def train_and_get_embedding(seed=None):
    if seed:
        random.seed(seed)
        np.random.seed(seed)
    model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=10, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4, seed=seed)
    return model, model.wv["the"]

# Train two models
model1, embedding1 = train_and_get_embedding(seed=42)
model2, embedding2 = train_and_get_embedding(seed=42)

# compare cosine similarity
similarity = np.dot(embedding1, embedding2) / (np.linalg.norm(embedding1) * np.linalg.norm(embedding2))
print(f"Similarity with same seed: {similarity}")
model3, embedding3 = train_and_get_embedding(seed=100)

similarity2 = np.dot(embedding1, embedding3) / (np.linalg.norm(embedding1) * np.linalg.norm(embedding3))
print(f"Similarity with different seed: {similarity2}")

```

In this first example, using a pre-defined seed should allow for repeatable results when the seeds are the same and show a different outcome with another seed. The cosine similarity should show a very high similarity in the first case, which means the vectors remain very similar even if not exactly identical. In the second case, the similarity should be lower, but likely remain high, as the relationships learned are mostly the same, and the same word still sits in similar positions.

**Example 2: Quantifying the variation, measuring the euclidean distance.**

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import numpy as np
import random
sentences = [["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"], ["jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]]

def train_and_get_embedding():
    model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=10, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)
    return model.wv["the"]

# Train multiple models and collect embeddings
embeddings = [train_and_get_embedding() for _ in range(5)]

#calculate the distance between the embeddings
distances = []
for i in range(len(embeddings)):
  for j in range(i + 1, len(embeddings)):
    distance = np.linalg.norm(embeddings[i] - embeddings[j])
    distances.append(distance)

print(f"Euclidean distance between embeddings: {distances}")
print(f"Average distance between embeddings: {np.mean(distances)}")
```

This second code example demonstrates how, by training several word2vec models with the same data but different random initializations (as no seed was defined), we can calculate the euclidean distance between the learned embedding vectors. This allows us to see the deviation between different embeddings. The distance is not high, but it is present.

**Example 3: The impact of training data size.**

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import numpy as np
import random

sentences = [["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"], ["jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]] * 100 #small dataset
sentences_large = [["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"], ["jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]] * 10000 #larger dataset

# Function to train and return model and embedding for word "the"
def train_and_get_embedding(sentences):
    model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=10, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)
    return model.wv["the"]

# Train two models with different sizes
embedding1 = train_and_get_embedding(sentences)
embedding2 = train_and_get_embedding(sentences)
embedding3 = train_and_get_embedding(sentences_large)
embedding4 = train_and_get_embedding(sentences_large)

# compare cosine similarity for both sets
similarity_small = np.dot(embedding1, embedding2) / (np.linalg.norm(embedding1) * np.linalg.norm(embedding2))
print(f"Similarity with small dataset: {similarity_small}")
similarity_large = np.dot(embedding3, embedding4) / (np.linalg.norm(embedding3) * np.linalg.norm(embedding4))
print(f"Similarity with large dataset: {similarity_large}")
```

This third example shows that the size of the training dataset can impact the consistency of embeddings. The larger the training set the more similar the embeddings are between separate trainings, because the space learned becomes more stable.

In my previous project, these discrepancies, while seemingly small at times, had considerable impact in downstream tasks where the system was very sensitive to vector distances and angles. It's crucial to understand that while semantic similarity tends to be preserved across retrains, minute variations in the embedding space can affect the model's behavior.

So, what should you do to mitigate these variations? First and foremost, it’s essential to establish a clear process for training your embeddings. This means locking in all the hyperparameters and setting a consistent random seed. If consistency is absolutely paramount, and you're not changing your vocabulary or corpus, then freezing embeddings from an initial training might be preferable. However, this will not allow your model to learn from new data in the corpus.

For anyone looking to delve deeper into this, I'd highly recommend exploring two areas: First, the original word2vec paper by Mikolov et al., “Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space,” provides the foundational understanding, which can be further expanded on by consulting papers on stochastic gradient descent and its variations. Secondly, a thorough read-through of the Gensim library documentation, particularly the Word2Vec implementation, is invaluable. Finally, texts on numerical optimization techniques will help to fully understand the nature of local minima and the stochasticity within models such as word2vec.

In conclusion, while retraining word2vec embeddings on the same data will result in similar outcomes, it won’t result in identical embeddings. Understanding the underlying randomness, the nature of the optimization, and the sensitivity of these models is critical for achieving stable and robust results in NLP applications.
