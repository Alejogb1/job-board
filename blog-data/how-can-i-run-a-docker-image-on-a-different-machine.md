Alright, let's tackle this. It's a problem I've navigated countless times, especially back in the days of infrastructure scaling projects, which invariably involved container deployments across a multitude of servers. Running a docker image on a different machine isn't some arcane art; it's a fundamental aspect of docker's utility. The core issue boils down to transferring the image and instructing another docker daemon to instantiate it. Let's explore several common methods, focusing on practicality.

Essentially, you need to get your image from point a (where it currently resides) to point b (the target machine). The first method, and frankly the most straightforward for most situations, is to push the image to a registry. A registry acts as a central repository for your docker images. Docker Hub is the most prevalent public option, but you might be using private registries like Amazon ECR, Google Artifact Registry, or your own self-hosted solution.

The workflow here is quite simple: you build your image locally on your development machine, tag it with the registry and image name, and then push it up. On your target machine, you simply pull the image using the same tag and then use the docker run command as you normally would.

Let’s see how this manifests in practice, with some fictitious project code. Say we’ve got a basic python web application image we need to deploy.

**Example 1: Pushing to a registry and pulling on another machine**

```bash
# Assume your image is named 'my-web-app:v1' locally.

# Step 1: Tag the image for your registry.
# Replace 'your-dockerhub-username' with your actual Docker Hub username.
# If using a private registry, adjust the prefix accordingly
docker tag my-web-app:v1 your-dockerhub-username/my-web-app:v1

# Step 2: Login to docker registry
docker login

# Step 3: Push the image to the registry.
docker push your-dockerhub-username/my-web-app:v1

# Now, on the target machine:

# Step 4: Login to docker registry
docker login

# Step 5: Pull the image from the registry.
docker pull your-dockerhub-username/my-web-app:v1

# Step 6: Run the image
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 your-dockerhub-username/my-web-app:v1
```

This approach works beautifully for collaborative projects and when deploying to servers that aren’t directly accessible over a local network. The key here is the `docker tag` command where we essentially provide a location for docker to find it. And `docker login` before pushing or pulling is necessary. The `docker push` and `docker pull` do the heavy lifting, and the final run is as expected.

However, what happens when a registry isn’t available or you’re just quickly testing things locally? This brings us to a second method: saving the image to a tar archive. This can be useful for transferring the image via a file transfer mechanism like `scp` or a simple network share.

**Example 2: Saving and loading an image as a tar archive**

```bash
# On your machine where the image exists
# Save the image to a tar archive

docker save my-web-app:v1 -o my-web-app.tar

# Then transfer this `my-web-app.tar` file to your target machine via scp, usb drive, etc
# Assuming you’ve moved `my-web-app.tar` to the target machine:

# On your target machine:

# Load the image from the archive
docker load -i my-web-app.tar

# Run the image
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 my-web-app:v1
```

The `docker save` command creates a tar archive containing all the layers of your image. You then transfer this single file to the other machine. The `docker load` command reverses the process, extracting the image layers from the archive and making it available to the docker daemon. It’s pretty much a copy and paste operation for docker images. It is important to note that this method preserves image tags, which helps when running the container.

Finally, if both machines happen to be on the same local network, and you want to avoid dealing with files or registries directly, there's a third option: directly exporting and importing a container's layers, essentially using docker's built in export and import capabilities.

**Example 3: Exporting and importing container layers on the same network**

```bash
# On the source machine (where the container is already running, not just the image):
# Assuming your container is running as 'my-running-container'
# Export the layers of the running container to a tar archive
docker export my-running-container > my-container-export.tar

# Transfer the 'my-container-export.tar' to the target machine via scp, shared network drive, etc

# On the target machine:

# Import the tar archive as an image
cat my-container-export.tar | docker import - my-imported-container:latest

# Run the newly imported container
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 my-imported-container:latest
```
This method differs from `save/load` because `export/import` works on an already instantiated container, meaning changes done within the container will be reflected. `save/load` operates directly on the image, regardless of whether it's running or not. This approach also doesn’t preserve the image tags, so you must specify a tag when importing using the docker import command. Moreover, this process does not include the image’s history. It creates a new image with all layers squashed together. This can be desirable for some cases. However, most of the time, `save/load` is the preferred approach.

When deciding which path to use, it really comes down to the use case. For most production deployments, relying on a docker registry is essential. This approach offers centralized management, version control, and facilitates CI/CD pipelines. The tar archive method is useful for local development, quick testing, or when dealing with air-gapped networks or a lack of registry infrastructure. Finally, the container export/import technique has a niche use case for very specific workflows or when dealing with modifications on running containers.

For deeper dives into the workings of Docker image layers and registry management, I recommend reviewing *Docker Deep Dive* by Nigel Poulton for a strong theoretical understanding. Also, consider the official Docker documentation, which is well-written and incredibly detailed. Additionally, the OCI (Open Container Initiative) specifications document how container images are formatted and stored, and they are worth reviewing for a deeper insight into the subject. Finally, an exploration of CI/CD best practices documents for Docker would be useful for understanding how organizations should distribute images.

Having worked with docker extensively, I can attest to the fact that container distribution becomes incredibly simple once you grasp the fundamentals of image pushing/pulling, archiving and direct transfer. These three strategies, properly applied, should give you the flexibility to run your docker images wherever you need. I hope this helps.
