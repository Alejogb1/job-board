Okay so you’re asking about user I/O wait events specifically those "cell single block physical read" and "cell multiblock physical read" ones right I’ve been there seen that many times its a pretty common pain point especially when you're diving deep into Oracle database performance tuning

First off lets get this straight user I/O wait events are basically the times your database sessions are chilling waiting for something usually data I/O like reading from disk but it’s not always as simple as disk i/o directly It's a signal from the kernel to oracle its telling oracle that this session is stuck doing something related to I/O not actually doing calculations or other CPU stuff

Now those "cell single block physical read" and "cell multiblock physical read" events are specific to Oracle's Exadata environments Exadata is basically a specialized appliance that integrates database server with high-performance storage servers and storage cells

Let's break them down

**Cell Single Block Physical Read**

This event occurs when your database session is waiting for a single block of data to be read from a storage cell on the Exadata system Think of it like requesting one small specific piece of information directly from the storage server The database session sends a request to the storage cell the storage cell retrieves the single block the storage cell sends the data back and finally the session continues its work

This typically happens when a process needs a specific row of a table or index and the block containing that row isn’t already in the database buffer cache (that memory buffer where the database stores data)

The word “physical” in the name means that its a physical read from disk on the cell server not read from memory cache of the cell server that means its actually read from disk media

Now that you have an idea of what it means here’s a common pattern where you’d see this in your queries

```sql
SELECT  column1
FROM   table1
WHERE  primary_key_column = :bind_variable;
```

The query is retrieving one row based on a primary key or unique index access this usually will cause single block physical reads if not cached in the database and/or the cell server level.

Now **Cell Multiblock Physical Read**

Okay so this one means your database session is waiting for a bunch of blocks to be read from a storage cell Usually because of a table scan or a full index scan the session is requesting multiple blocks from disk and reading them consecutively not skipping any block it can be many blocks at a time not just few

This is usually much less efficient than single block reads since its usually not targeted or selective its just sequentially reads data from disk

This usually happens when you are reading large tables or indexes and the data is not in memory

Here is a query that will trigger a cell multiblock read

```sql
SELECT column1 , column2
FROM   table1
WHERE  column3 LIKE '%some_pattern%';
```

This query is not using a targeted where clause so its likely to trigger a full table scan that in turn is a multiblock physical read

Now a key detail why “cell” is in the name is that the data is read from the storage cell not from the database server directly Exadata's storage cells are intelligent and they can offload some tasks from the database servers like filtering column values and that will also help performance but the waits are still counted under the same wait events as it is related to cell reads

So Why Does This Matter?

These waits tell you a lot about your I/O patterns If you see a lot of “cell single block physical read” events it might mean your indexes are not being used properly or the database buffer cache is not big enough maybe you are missing some indexes or maybe your queries should be optimized to read less data that means you are causing a lot of single row lookups from disk it can also be because the data is very fragmented in disk

And if you see a lot of “cell multiblock physical read” events means you have queries performing full scans too often meaning you dont have indexes or its not using them correctly or that the query should be rewritten it can also mean that you are not applying filters in your queries so you end up reading the whole table even if you want some rows

**How do I fix this?**

Well this is a never ending journey for a database professional

1.  **Indexes**: Look at your query plans do you have indexes? and are you using them correctly? if a column that should be indexed is not it will cause table scans and multiblock reads
2.  **Query optimization**: Rewrite those queries look into using the execution plan to see where the bottlenecks are can you do filtering early in your process avoid using LIKE in filters especially at the beginning it will cause table scans
3.  **Database buffer cache**: Is your database buffer cache big enough? are the critical table segments in memory? if not increase the buffer cache if you have enough memory or try to read less data
4.  **Exadata Storage Indexes**: Exadata storage indexes can filter data at the storage cell level before being sent to the database reducing the amount of data read. You have to be smart on how you structure your table segments to be optimal for those features
5.  **Statistics**: Keep the statistics updated for your database tables if they are stale or not updated they will cause bad execution plans and more disk access
6.  **Storage Level Tuning**: The data distribution on the cell servers is important so if a table has all the data concentrated in one storage server that server will be the hotspot for the table its better if the data is spread evenly so if you are a DBA ask your storage team to check the server distribution
7.  **SQL Plan Management (SPM)**: Force the database to use the correct execution plan for your queries with SPM which will make sure your query always runs with the most efficient plan

Here is a code snippet that demonstrates how to query the wait events to understand how much time your sessions are spending on different wait events

```sql
SELECT   event,
         time_waited_micro / 1000000 AS seconds_waited,
         total_waits
FROM   v$session_event
WHERE  event LIKE '%cell%'
ORDER BY seconds_waited DESC;
```

Here is another useful snippet to analyze top sql that spend most of the time in I/O wait events

```sql
SELECT   s.sid,
         s.serial#,
         s.username,
         sq.sql_text,
         se.event,
         se.time_waited_micro / 1000000 AS seconds_waited
FROM   v$session s
JOIN   v$session_event se
       ON s.sid = se.sid
JOIN   v$sql sq
       ON s.sql_id = sq.sql_id
WHERE  se.event LIKE '%cell%'
ORDER BY se.time_waited_micro DESC;
```

It helps you identify the queries that are causing the I/O wait bottleneck

Now a random joke... why was the database server bad at poker? Because it always had too many blocks.

**Where can I learn more?**

*   **Oracle Documentation:** Always the first place to go The official Oracle documentation for Exadata is your bible for understanding the platform including wait events.
*   **"Oracle Performance Tuning" by Donald K. Burleson**: This classic book covers all aspects of Oracle performance tuning including I/O. I have read it twice.
*   **Jonathan Lewis' Blog**: Jonathan Lewis is a guru on Oracle internals. His blog is a treasure trove of information about wait events and performance analysis.

Okay this should give you a good start to dive into the issue Remember that database performance is a journey not a destination and these wait events are just one piece of the puzzle good luck debugging!
