Okay, let's tackle this. It’s a situation I've certainly encountered before, especially back when I was setting up various demo applications on Heroku, and it often boils down to a crucial misunderstanding about how web applications and network protocols function, particularly DNS and http(s). I remember one particularly frustrating day trying to troubleshoot a basic api endpoint. I could get a perfect response in the browser, but `curl` and `ping` from my terminal were just dead ends. It was a head scratcher until I really drilled into what was happening under the hood.

The core issue is that a ping, which relies on the internet control message protocol (icmp), and a standard web browser request, using http or https, are fundamentally different network operations. When you type a url into your browser – let’s say `your-app.herokuapp.com` – the browser initiates a series of steps that ultimately result in a request for web content. It starts by asking a dns server for the ip address corresponding to `your-app.herokuapp.com`. Once it has the ip address, it opens a tcp connection, establishes an http(s) session, and requests the content via the appropriate protocol.

`Ping`, on the other hand, uses icmp, a very lightweight protocol designed for network diagnostic purposes, like determining if a host is reachable, and doesn’t operate at the same level as http or https. This protocol is explicitly blocked by the vast majority of web servers for security and efficiency reasons. Allowing icmp traffic indiscriminately can open a system to various types of denial-of-service attacks, among other potential vulnerabilities. Heroku, as a service provider, enforces this practice, and does not typically respond to icmp echo requests directed at the application’s exposed host names.

Think of it like this: you can knock on a front door (http/https) and the house may open and respond, but trying to send a secret knock only understood by an electrician (icmp) won't get any response if the house doesn't use that type of communication.

Therefore, that’s why you can access your application in a browser, which uses tcp to transport http and https, but cannot receive a response with the `ping` command, which uses icmp. The two protocols target entirely different communication endpoints.

Let's illustrate with some basic examples.

**Example 1: The Browser’s HTTP Request (Conceptual)**

While we can’t *see* the direct network traffic using a simple text snippet, this pseudo-code represents what the browser does conceptually:

```python
# Python pseudo-code
import socket

def browser_request(hostname, path="/", port=443, protocol="https"):
    try:
        # DNS lookup
        ip_address = get_ip_from_hostname(hostname)  # Simplified, actual DNS resolution is complex

        # Establish TCP connection
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        s.connect((ip_address, port))

        # construct the http request
        request_header = f"GET {path} HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: {hostname}\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n"
        if protocol == "https":
           # Perform SSL handshake (omitted for clarity)
           # ...
            s.sendall(request_header.encode())
        else:
            s.sendall(request_header.encode())

        # Receive and parse the response
        response = b""
        while True:
            chunk = s.recv(4096)
            if not chunk:
                break
            response += chunk
        s.close()
        return response
    except socket.error as e:
        print(f"Socket error: {e}")
        return None


# This is a call that simulates the browser making an HTTP request (not actual execution)
# result = browser_request("your-app.herokuapp.com")
# if result:
#    print("got response")

```

Here, the code demonstrates that the browser resolves the host name to an ip address, opens a tcp connection on port 80 or 443 (http or https), constructs a formatted http request, sends it, and gets back a response. This is a key distinction.

**Example 2: Ping from the terminal (Conceptual and usually fails)**

Now, let’s contrast this with the ‘ping’ command. It's different:

```python
# Python pseudo-code (simplified and conceptual) for icmp

import socket

def icmp_ping(hostname):
    try:
      ip_address = get_ip_from_hostname(hostname) # simplified dns
      # create icmp socket (requires elevated privileges on many systems)
      icmp_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_RAW, socket.getprotobyname("icmp"))
      # construct the icmp packet (again, simplified)
      icmp_packet =  b"\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"
      icmp_socket.sendto(icmp_packet, (ip_address, 0))
      # attempt to receive icmp response
      try:
        icmp_response, addr = icmp_socket.recvfrom(1024)
        print("Received response")
      except socket.timeout:
        print("No response")
      finally:
        icmp_socket.close()

    except socket.error as e:
      print(f"Socket error: {e}")

# This is a call that simulates a ping operation (usually fails for web servers)
# icmp_ping("your-app.herokuapp.com")
```

This snippet illustrates that the ping command sends an icmp echo request to a host, expecting an icmp echo reply in return. As we discussed, heroku servers do not respond to these requests.

**Example 3: Telnet to Test TCP Port (Sometimes Useful)**

While you can’t ping, you *can* verify if a port on a given host is open by using telnet, although it’s not a method that allows you to see web content. Telnet can connect to the tcp port and confirm that communication on that port is possible. Here is a simplified version:

```python
import socket

def check_port(hostname, port):
  try:
    ip_address = get_ip_from_hostname(hostname)
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.settimeout(2)
    s.connect((ip_address, port))
    print(f"Port {port} is open")
    s.close()
  except socket.error as e:
      print(f"Port {port} is likely closed or unreachable, error: {e}")


# example usage to test if port 443 or port 80 are open
# check_port("your-app.herokuapp.com", 443)
# check_port("your-app.herokuapp.com", 80)


```

This demonstrates that tcp communication is possible, though not icmp, which further confirms the root cause.

So, in conclusion, your inability to ping your heroku app is *not* a sign of a problem with your app, but a deliberate design choice. Web servers are configured not to respond to icmp requests, instead relying on tcp-based protocols like http and https. If you want to confirm server reachability from the command line, tools like `curl` are your go-to as they engage on ports that will return meaningful server responses, rather than relying on icmp packets.

For further study, I strongly recommend delving into the classics. “Computer Networks” by Andrew S. Tanenbaum provides a comprehensive understanding of networking fundamentals, covering protocols like tcp/ip and icmp in great detail. Also, the ‘tcp/ip illustrated’ series by W. Richard Stevens is a phenomenal, deeply technical resource that breaks down exactly what happens during network communications. Knowing these fundamental concepts well is essential for anyone dealing with web development and network troubleshooting.
