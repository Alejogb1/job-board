Alright,  It’s a question I've actually grappled with firsthand, specifically back when I was optimizing data ingestion for a large-scale analytics platform. We were routinely dealing with files that had tens of millions of lines, and the initial sorting implementation was… let’s just say ‘less than ideal.’ Performance was suffering, and it was impacting downstream processes quite significantly. So, the efficiency of sorting containers and algorithms was definitely top of mind.

The quick answer, of course, is that there isn’t one single ‘most efficient’ solution that works universally. The best choice depends heavily on the characteristics of your dataset, primarily its size, distribution, and whether or not the data fits into memory. And in our specific case back then, we had to contend with the fact that data did *not* always fit within the available ram.

When we’re talking millions of lines, we’re moving out of the comfort zone of simple `std::vector` sorting with `std::sort`. While `std::sort`, often implemented as a quicksort or an introsort (a hybrid algorithm), performs reasonably well, it’s an in-place algorithm. This means it modifies the original data structure directly, and needs the entire dataset to fit in memory. This is simply not feasible for very large datasets. When memory becomes a bottleneck, disk-based sorting methods must be considered.

So, let’s break this down into a few important areas, focusing on the C++ landscape:

**1. The Container:**

For in-memory sorting, the `std::vector` is still often the starting point because of its contiguous memory layout, which allows good cache utilization and efficient access. For large data sets in a distributed environment, a container might mean a system like a distributed file system or database. However, when looking at a single-machine context with a significant volume, the container might not be a single class instance, but rather a series of memory buffers and possibly temporary files.
We will look at this from a single machine scope for the most part.

**2. The Algorithm and its Implications:**

* **In-Memory Sorting:** For datasets that do comfortably fit within memory, and depending on data distribution, `std::sort`, is usually a good start. It has an average time complexity of *O(n log n)*, which is quite good. However, consider the nature of your data; if you have a large number of identical keys, other algorithms like Counting sort might be worth examining (but only useful when keys are integers and their range is relatively small)

* **External Sorting:** When data exceeds available memory, you must use external sorting methods. Merge sort is particularly popular here, as it’s stable and lends itself well to a divide-and-conquer strategy. A typical external merge sort uses a multi-way merge. This involves:

   1. **Breaking the data into chunks:** Each chunk fits within available memory.
   2. **Sorting each chunk:** Using in-memory sort (e.g., std::sort).
   3. **Merging sorted chunks:** Reading from sorted chunks, and write to output using multiple input buffers and one output buffer.

**3. Code Examples and Practical Considerations:**

Let's look at some code snippets to concretize some of these concepts. First, we'll look at standard in-memory sorting, and its limitations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>

int main() {
    size_t dataSize = 10000000; // 10 million elements
    std::vector<int> data(dataSize);
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen(rd());
    std::uniform_int_distribution<> distrib(1, 1000000);

    for(size_t i = 0; i < dataSize; ++i) {
        data[i] = distrib(gen);
    }


    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::sort(data.begin(), data.end());
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end - start);

    std::cout << "Sorted " << dataSize << " integers in " << duration.count() << " milliseconds." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code shows the typical in-memory sorting approach with `std::sort`. On my machine, for 10 million integers it completes in a few seconds. However, if I increase `dataSize`, we'll see a massive performance degradation as the memory footprint becomes an issue. More importantly, beyond a certain size, this will lead to an application crash.

Now, let’s look at a simplified example of an *external* merge sort. This version is a very basic implementation that assumes data is in files, and is for illustrative purposes. A complete version would involve managing multiple temporary files and might be complex, so I’m keeping it simple:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

void externalMergeSort(const std::string& inputFile, const std::string& outputFile) {
    const size_t chunkSize = 100000; // Example chunk size, adjust based on available memory

    std::ifstream input(inputFile);
    std::ofstream output(outputFile);

    std::vector<int> chunk;
    int num;
    int chunkCount = 0;
    std::vector<std::string> tempFiles;

    while(input >> num) {
        chunk.push_back(num);

        if(chunk.size() >= chunkSize) {
           std::sort(chunk.begin(), chunk.end());
           std::string tempFileName = "temp_" + std::to_string(chunkCount++) + ".txt";
           std::ofstream tempFile(tempFileName);
           for(int val : chunk) {
               tempFile << val << "\n";
           }
           tempFile.close();
           tempFiles.push_back(tempFileName);
           chunk.clear();
       }
    }

    if(!chunk.empty()) {
        std::sort(chunk.begin(), chunk.end());
        std::string tempFileName = "temp_" + std::to_string(chunkCount++) + ".txt";
        std::ofstream tempFile(tempFileName);
         for(int val : chunk) {
               tempFile << val << "\n";
           }
           tempFile.close();
           tempFiles.push_back(tempFileName);
    }

    //Simplified single-pass merge (more passes would be needed for more than few chunks):
    std::vector<std::ifstream> chunkStreams(tempFiles.size());
    for(size_t i = 0; i < tempFiles.size(); ++i) {
       chunkStreams[i].open(tempFiles[i]);
    }


    std::vector<int> nextValue(tempFiles.size());
    std::vector<bool> streamDone(tempFiles.size(), false);

    for (size_t i = 0; i < tempFiles.size(); ++i) {
        if(chunkStreams[i] >> nextValue[i]){} else {streamDone[i] = true;}
    }

    while(true) {
       int minIndex = -1;
       int minValue = INT_MAX;
       bool allDone = true;
       for(size_t i = 0; i < tempFiles.size(); ++i) {
           if(!streamDone[i]){
                allDone = false;
                if (nextValue[i] < minValue) {
                    minValue = nextValue[i];
                    minIndex = i;
               }
           }
       }
       if(allDone) break;


       output << minValue << "\n";
       if(chunkStreams[minIndex] >> nextValue[minIndex]) {} else {streamDone[minIndex] = true;}

    }

    for(const auto& tempFile : tempFiles){
        std::remove(tempFile.c_str());
    }
}


int main() {
    // Create sample input file
    std::ofstream inputFile("input.txt");
    for (int i = 1000000; i > 0; --i) {
        inputFile << i << "\n";
    }
    inputFile.close();
    externalMergeSort("input.txt", "output.txt");
    std::cout << "External merge sort completed. Check output.txt" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This example demonstrates the basic concept of splitting the input file into chunks, sorting these individually, and then merging them. This is a greatly simplified implementation and lacks proper handling of large number of chunks, but it conveys the principle. In a real-world application, you'd need much more sophisticated strategies to make this work efficiently and manage multiple passes.

And, as a last small illustration, let us examine multi-threading to make std::sort work faster. As mentioned earlier, std::sort performs quite well. The limiting factor in its performance is that, by default, it does not use multiple cores of the CPU. In a simple application this is quite easy to achieve.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <execution>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>

int main() {
    size_t dataSize = 10000000; // 10 million elements
    std::vector<int> data(dataSize);
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen(rd());
    std::uniform_int_distribution<> distrib(1, 1000000);

    for(size_t i = 0; i < dataSize; ++i) {
        data[i] = distrib(gen);
    }

    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::sort(std::execution::par, data.begin(), data.end());
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end - start);

    std::cout << "Sorted " << dataSize << " integers with parallel execution in " << duration.count() << " milliseconds." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this last example, we have modified the previous `std::sort` implementation by simply specifying that we will sort using parallel execution. The `std::execution::par` execution policy instructs the C++ runtime to potentially use multiple threads for sorting. The execution overhead might be negligible for larger workloads compared to the speedup of dividing the sorting problem among multiple CPU cores.

**4. Resources:**

For a comprehensive understanding of algorithms, I highly recommend "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. That's practically the Bible for algorithm design and analysis. For details on external sorting techniques, look into papers on multi-way merge sorting in the field of database systems and storage algorithms. You could also look into documentation about distributed data processing, as some external sorting problems can be tackled by distributing data across machines.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, choosing the right sorting strategy for millions of lines of data depends on your specific environment. If the dataset comfortably fits in RAM, start with `std::sort`, and explore parallelization if performance is a concern. If memory is a limitation, external merge sort, potentially with multi-way merging, and techniques such as multi-threading are unavoidable. The key is to carefully assess the constraints and characteristics of your data and select the approach that best suits those requirements. It's rarely a one-size-fits-all answer. You may even find that multiple stages involving in-memory and external techniques combined with other optimization methods are the most appropriate approach, and that may require continuous experimentation and tweaking. The journey is often just as valuable as the destination.
