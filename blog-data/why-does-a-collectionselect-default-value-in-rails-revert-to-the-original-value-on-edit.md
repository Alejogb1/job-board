Let's tackle this one. I’ve seen this particular head-scratcher pop up more than a few times, and it always boils down to a few common misunderstandings regarding how rails handles form data and model associations, specifically within the context of `collection_select`. The issue, as you're experiencing, is that when editing a record, the `collection_select` dropdown seems to disregard the currently associated value and defaults back to the first option in the list, or perhaps the placeholder. Let me break it down for you.

Essentially, when you use `collection_select`, rails is doing a bit of behind-the-scenes magic involving the `select` tag itself and your model's relationship. Let's consider a scenario I dealt with several years ago: we had a system where users could assign tasks to different teams. We had a `Task` model and a `Team` model, with a simple `belongs_to :team` association on the `Task` side. The form for editing a `Task` utilized `collection_select` to choose the associated team.

The problem we initially faced mirrored yours: when a task was loaded for editing, the `collection_select` would reset to the first team in the list rather than displaying the team that was already assigned to the task. It appeared the current value wasn't being respected, and that's often how it seems when you encounter this issue.

The root of the problem lies in how rails expects to see the *selected* value. The `collection_select` helper is expecting the value of the option that should be selected to match the currently assigned value of the associated attribute. In the case of my `Task` model, it's expecting a `task.team_id` to correspond to one of the ids in the `@teams` collection passed into the helper. If the model attribute isn't explicitly present or if the attribute is `nil`, the selection will revert to the default option.

The issue commonly occurs because you're loading your collection (e.g. `@teams`) correctly but not always ensuring the associated attribute (`task.team_id`) is properly set on the model you're trying to edit. Here are a few common scenarios and solutions:

**Scenario 1: The attribute is `nil` during edit.**

This is often the first thing to check. If you're creating a new record, this isn’t a problem because the initial value for the associated attribute is likely `nil`. But when *editing* a record, you need to ensure that the `task.team_id` is populated with the correct value when your controller fetches the task. Let's look at some code to make it concrete.

```ruby
# tasks_controller.rb

def edit
  @task = Task.find(params[:id])
  @teams = Team.all
  # important note: if @task.team_id is nil, the select will revert on the form.
end

def update
  @task = Task.find(params[:id])
  if @task.update(task_params)
    redirect_to @task, notice: 'Task updated.'
  else
    @teams = Team.all
    render :edit
  end
end

private

def task_params
  params.require(:task).permit(:name, :team_id)
end
```

And here’s a typical form snippet:

```erb
# _form.html.erb
<%= form_with(model: @task) do |form| %>
    <%= form.label :name %>
    <%= form.text_field :name %>

    <%= form.label :team_id %>
    <%= form.collection_select :team_id, @teams, :id, :name %>

    <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
```

If `@task.team_id` is nil when the form loads (due to a bug in your data retrieval or initial model state), the `collection_select` will default to either the placeholder option or the very first option in the collection. This is exactly the issue that we saw in my past project, and it highlights how important proper model loading and associations management is.

**Scenario 2: Incorrect attribute names.**

Sometimes, you might have a mismatch between what `collection_select` expects and the actual foreign key column name in your model. While convention is to follow `association_name_id` for foreign key columns, deviations do occur, and it's crucial to make sure your `collection_select` is referencing the correct column name.

```ruby
# Consider a Task model that calls the team ID something other than "team_id"
# task.rb

class Task < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :assigned_team, class_name: "Team", foreign_key: "assigned_team_identifier"
end

# And your controller
def edit
  @task = Task.find(params[:id])
  @teams = Team.all
end

# Now your form would look like this:
<%= form.collection_select :assigned_team_identifier, @teams, :id, :name %> # Using the foreign key, which is crucial
```

Here, if you used `:team_id` in your form instead of `:assigned_team_identifier`, you'd see the same reversion issue because the foreign key is different from the default.

**Scenario 3: Type mismatch with the id**

In my experience, I've seen very occasional instances where the foreign key in your database is stored as a string rather than an integer. When that happens, and you use `collection_select`, Rails is performing an equivalence check, e.g. `selected_value == option.id` and the type mismatch may cause this comparison to evaluate to false.

```ruby
# task.rb (Database column 'team_id' is a string)
class Task < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :team
end

# controller remains mostly the same
def edit
    @task = Task.find(params[:id])
    @teams = Team.all
end

# form remains the same:
<%= form.collection_select :team_id, @teams, :id, :name %>

# However, if team.id returns an integer, the comparison above will fail.
# the solution would be to either coerce the types before comparison, or store the correct types in the first place.
```

The simple fix here would be to ensure your foreign keys are properly stored as integers, as is the standard practice. If that is not possible, a more complex approach would be necessary.

**Resolution and Best Practices**

The solution in all these cases involves ensuring the model being edited has the correct foreign key attribute set before the form is rendered and that it's the exact name that the foreign key is defined as in the database model. Double-check your database schema, your models, and how the associated attributes are loaded in your controller. Use a debugger or `byebug` in your controller to inspect the attributes of your `@task` object before rendering the form and make sure the `team_id` (or whatever your foreign key column is) is set correctly.

To delve deeper into this, I'd strongly recommend reading through the Rails documentation on form helpers, specifically the `collection_select` documentation, available in the Rails Guides section of the official website. For a more comprehensive overview of database schema and ActiveRecord associations, consider reading “Agile Web Development with Rails” by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson. This will deepen your understanding of how all these aspects of rails interact. Understanding these basics will let you resolve this type of issue confidently and improve your overall proficiency with Rails.
