Alright, let’s talk about patching resources in rails – a topic that's more nuanced than it first appears. I’ve spent a good few years dealing with this, and it's one of those things where getting it *just* right can significantly impact your API's robustness and user experience. It’s certainly not a black box, but you do need to understand the mechanisms involved to make sure you are not only updating your data, but also doing it in an elegant, secure, and maintainable way. Let's break it down.

First off, we're talking about http's `patch` verb, specifically as it applies to rest api endpoints. `patch` is designed for partial updates. Think of it like sending only the changed fields to the server, rather than the entire object, which is what `put` would generally do. This is vital for efficiency, especially when dealing with larger data structures. In rails, this translates to an action in your controller, typically one of the resourceful routes like `update`. The key, as with any http request, is how you transmit the parameters that specify *what* you're updating and *how* you're updating it.

Parameters in a patch request are usually encoded in the request body. The way they’re structured depends on the content type you use. For web applications and often restful apis, `application/json` is the most common. Rails will handle json payloads via the action controller and automatically make those parameters available to you in the `params` hash. This is where a lot of developers new to rails, or even more experienced devs moving across frameworks, sometimes get tripped up. It’s not that you can’t also send `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data (like a regular html form), it’s just less prevalent for apis. For `patch`, stick with `json` unless you have very specific, well-understood reasons not to.

Let's illustrate this with some hypothetical code. Imagine we have a `user` model and we want to update their `email` and `status` fields. Here’s how that might look in a rails controller, and then, what the corresponding request structure might resemble:

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_user, only: [:update]

  def update
    if @user.update(user_params)
      render json: @user, status: :ok
    else
      render json: @user.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def set_user
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
  end

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:email, :status)
  end
end
```

This rails controller code snippet takes a look at a patch action in the context of updating user information. The `before_action` `:set_user` is what pre-loads the record to be updated. The `user_params` method is critical - it’s where you define the permitted parameters. This prevents mass assignment vulnerabilities; you explicitly specify which fields can be updated via user input. The `update` action attempts to update the current user record with the permitted params, and sends back a response with the updated record, or errors if there were any. The status codes, `:ok` (200) and `:unprocessable_entity` (422), are standard http codes that help clients interpret the result of the request.

Now, let’s examine what a typical patch request might look like from the client’s perspective. It has to send data as `json`:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "updated_email@example.com",
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```

This JSON payload would be sent to the `/users/1` endpoint (assuming user with id 1 exists), using a `patch` verb. Notice how the params are nested under a `user` key, and correspond directly to what is permitted in the `user_params` method in the controller. This encapsulation is important.

A pitfall I see commonly in less seasoned code is forgetting that the actual json data needs to be placed in the body of the request, not in the query string. It sounds obvious written out like this, but it can be a mistake that is very hard to diagnose, especially with client-side code performing the request.

It’s equally important to consider parameter validation. We've only touched upon the permit method so far, but more complex scenarios will likely require more robust validation. If you need to enforce specific data formats, lengths, or conditional validations, consider leveraging the model’s validations or custom validators. Let's enhance our previous example to illustrate that:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email, presence: true, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
  validates :status, inclusion: { in: %w(active inactive pending) }
end

# app/controllers/users_controller.rb - changes applied
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_user, only: [:update]

  def update
    if @user.update(user_params)
      render json: @user, status: :ok
    else
      render json: @user.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def set_user
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
  end

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:email, :status)
  end
end
```

Here we've introduced validations to our `User` model. The `email` must be a valid email format and `status` can only be one of the three defined values. Now, if the parameters in a patch request fail these validations, the `update` action will fail, and `render json: @user.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity` will output the precise validation errors in json format back to the user in a 422 response.

The `params` object in rails is fairly powerful and also includes the ability to nest params, and even send arrays in the request body. The principle is the same: include the parameters, in json format in your `patch` request body. In the controller’s action, use `params.require(:your_root_param_name).permit(:your, :nested, :params)` or, if the request contains an array, `params.require(:your_root_param_name).permit(your_array_param_name: [])`

To go deep into understanding params in rails and what they can do, check out *Agile Web Development with Rails 7* by Sam Ruby, David Bryant, and David Thomas for a comprehensive overview of rails request handling. For more information on http semantics and request methods like `patch`, I'd recommend *Restful Web Services* by Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby. It's a classic for anyone serious about api design.

In short, passing parameters to a rails patch action is all about constructing a proper `json` object in the request body and then handling those parameters appropriately in your rails controller by utilizing methods like `permit` to sanitize data, and leveraging models for data validation. It's a fairly straightforward process once you understand how rails handles the request cycle. I hope this breakdown helps. If there is one thing I've learned over the years, it’s that solid understanding of the fundamentals really does go a long way when it comes to building robust and maintainable software.
