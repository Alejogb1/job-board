,  It's a query I've definitely encountered before, often under the guise of "but it worked with sklearn!"—which, in fairness, is a common starting point for many of us. The issue of `feature_engine` sometimes misbehaving during feature selection with pandas dataframes actually stems from several key areas. It’s not typically an issue with `feature_engine` itself being broken, but rather a subtle mismatch in how it anticipates the data structure and the intricacies of pandas dataframes. Let's break it down into common culprits.

First, and probably most frequent in my experience, is the presence of non-numeric columns when `feature_engine`’s transformers expect a numerical input. Unlike scikit-learn, which can sometimes silently convert or handle mixed types during certain preprocessing steps, `feature_engine` transformers—especially those involved in selection (like `DropConstantFeatures` or `SelectByShuffling`)—generally expect a dataframe containing only numeric columns, or at least those that can be coerced into numeric values without error. If you pass a dataframe that has categorical or object-type columns mixed in, it's quite common for them to throw an error or behave unexpectedly. This isn’t a bug as such, but a difference in design philosophy where `feature_engine` prioritizes explicit type handling and, frankly, correct preprocessing before feature selection occurs. My workaround for this, when I stumbled upon it the first time, was to first identify those columns not directly usable, then apply separate encoding mechanisms for them, followed by integrating all the numeric versions back together.

Secondly, the dataframe's column indexing can occasionally cause friction. If the dataframe's column names are not entirely unique or if there is unexpected use of multi-indexing, it can throw off `feature_engine`'s internal workings. For example, if you have duplicate column names (not generally advised in pandas, but sometimes inadvertently created) or column names that get truncated due to specific loading functions, `feature_engine` might not be able to correctly identify or manipulate those features during selection. I once spent hours debugging this particular issue and realised a data-loading step was silently truncating certain column names, and `feature_engine` was then failing, seemingly out of the blue.

Finally, a less frequent but notable source of issues arises from dataframe mutations performed outside the pipeline in which `feature_engine` lives. Consider, for instance, that you prepare a dataframe, apply some transformations *outside* of the `feature_engine` pipeline (e.g., manual column drops, additions, type changes), and then pass it to the `feature_engine` transformer. This mismatch between the initial state used for fitting and the modified state used for transformation can result in errors. `feature_engine` is designed around a principle of ‘pipeline aware’ transformations where all of those transformations should be happening together and not piecemeal. This approach is generally helpful for reproducibility, but requires understanding and a little adjustment.

Let's illustrate these issues with some code.

**Example 1: Handling Non-Numeric Columns**

The code snippet below demonstrates the error and then a suitable solution using `sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder` to handle a categorical column prior to selection using `feature_engine`:

```python
import pandas as pd
from feature_engine.selection import DropConstantFeatures
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder

# Example dataframe with a non-numeric column
data = {'feature1': [1, 2, 1, 2], 'feature2': ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b'], 'feature3': [3, 3, 3, 3]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# First, this would throw an error in Feature-Engine, as DropConstantFeatures is not meant to take non-numeric values.
try:
    sel = DropConstantFeatures()
    sel.fit(df)
    df_transformed = sel.transform(df)
    print("Transformation failed as expected.")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected ValueError: {e}")

# The Solution - Encoding
encoder = OrdinalEncoder()
df[['feature2']] = encoder.fit_transform(df[['feature2']])
sel = DropConstantFeatures()
sel.fit(df)
df_transformed = sel.transform(df)
print("Transformed dataframe:")
print(df_transformed)
```

Here, the initial attempt to use `DropConstantFeatures` on the dataframe directly fails because `feature2` is of type object (i.e. string). After applying the `OrdinalEncoder` to that specific column, thus turning it numeric, `DropConstantFeatures` can proceed without any issue. This pattern is crucial for using `feature_engine` successfully with real-world datasets that often contain non-numeric features.

**Example 2: Column Indexing Issues**

The next example shows how duplicated column names create problems with the same drop constant feature selector.

```python
import pandas as pd
from feature_engine.selection import DropConstantFeatures

# Example dataframe with duplicate column names - this is not a best practice, but can happen.
data = {'feature1': [1, 2, 1, 2], 'feature2': [3, 4, 5, 6], 'feature1': [3, 3, 3, 3]} # Repeated column names!
df = pd.DataFrame(data)


try:
    sel = DropConstantFeatures()
    sel.fit(df)
    df_transformed = sel.transform(df)
    print("Transformation failed as expected.")
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected KeyError: {e}")

# The solution - fix the column names
df.columns = ['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']
sel = DropConstantFeatures()
sel.fit(df)
df_transformed = sel.transform(df)
print("Transformed dataframe:")
print(df_transformed)
```
In this scenario, the duplicated column names cause the `DropConstantFeatures` to fail initially due to its dependence on unique column identifiers. By simply renaming one of the columns using a more explicit naming convention, the code now executes as expected. This emphasizes the importance of clean, consistent column names for working with `feature_engine`.

**Example 3: Dataframe Mutations Outside the Pipeline**

This example demonstrates the problems arising from modifying the data before applying the transformer function.

```python
import pandas as pd
from feature_engine.selection import SelectByShuffling
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Example dataframe
data = {'feature1': [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], 'feature2': [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'feature3': [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], 'target': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create the transformer
sel = SelectByShuffling(variables=['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3'], estimator=LogisticRegression(), scoring="roc_auc")

# Fit the transformer with data
sel.fit(df.drop(columns=['target']), df['target'])

# Transform the data by dropping one feature beforehand (This is incorrect use and will fail!)
try:
    df_modified = df.drop(columns=['feature1'])
    df_transformed = sel.transform(df_modified) # Error as it has been mutated outside the selector.
    print("Transformation failed as expected.")
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected KeyError: {e}")


# Correct Usage - transform on the original fitted data
df_transformed = sel.transform(df.drop(columns=['target']))
print("Transformed dataframe:")
print(df_transformed)

```

Here, the modification of the dataframe prior to applying the `transform` step on the fitted transformer causes a failure due to a missing feature. `feature_engine` expects the transform to occur on the same features the model was originally trained with, or at least on a dataframe containing the same features. The subsequent transform step using the unmutated dataframe is successful. This illustrates the importance of consistent dataframe shapes throughout the entire selection process.

In summary, `feature_engine`'s behavior during feature selection issues primarily stem from three things: mismatches in data types, inconsistent column indexing, and alterations to the dataframe outside the transformer’s operational pipeline. Understanding these potential causes and proactively addressing them, often via pre-processing like ordinal encoding, ensures a much smoother experience when leveraging `feature_engine` with pandas dataframes.

For further reading, I'd recommend studying 'Feature Engineering for Machine Learning' by Alice Zheng and Amanda Casari and 'Python Data Science Handbook' by Jake VanderPlas for a comprehensive understanding of both pandas dataframe manipulation and feature engineering techniques. Also, the official `feature_engine` documentation is quite thorough and worth checking out.
