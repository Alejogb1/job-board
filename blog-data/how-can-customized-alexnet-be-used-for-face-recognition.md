Okay, let's tackle this. It's a topic I've spent a fair amount of time with, particularly back when I was working on a biometric authentication system for a secure access project a few years ago. We started with AlexNet as a base because of its proven architecture, and modified it to suit our specific needs. Face recognition, of course, isn't a one-size-fits-all problem, so you absolutely have to adapt these models. Let’s break down how that's done, and why.

The core idea here is that AlexNet, as a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), provides a fantastic feature extraction backbone. What AlexNet is originally trained on (typically ImageNet) isn’t face data, of course. It's adept at recognizing various generic objects – cats, dogs, cars – the usual suspects. These learned features are surprisingly effective for a broad range of computer vision tasks, face recognition included. Think of it like this: it's good at picking out edges, textures, and shapes – things that are fundamentally useful when identifying any object.

However, we need to steer AlexNet's learned features toward identifying faces specifically. This involves several key steps. We won't train from scratch, that's almost always impractical with deep models. Instead, we’ll be using a transfer learning approach.

Firstly, we'll typically remove the final classification layer of AlexNet, the one that predicts the ImageNet categories. This is our starting point for customization. We then introduce new layers, specifically crafted for the face recognition task, right after the feature extraction layers we retain. This generally involves a fully connected layer or two, often followed by a softmax layer if you want to predict a class, or an embedding layer if you’re generating feature vectors for similarity matching.

Secondly, the training process itself changes. Rather than the ImageNet classification dataset, we feed the model with a large dataset of faces, often with each face belonging to a known identity. These datasets need to be meticulously curated and cleaned. Consider resources such as the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset (LFW), though you might need even larger, more diverse datasets depending on your specific requirements. This training is where we actually teach the model to discriminate between individuals.

Crucially, the loss function isn't the standard cross-entropy anymore. Here, we often employ loss functions suited to face recognition, like triplet loss or contrastive loss. These functions train the network to map faces from the same person closer together in the embedding space and to push faces from different people further apart. The specific choice will depend on the application’s requirements. For instance, triplet loss requires an anchor face, a positive face from the same identity, and a negative face from a different identity.

Let’s illustrate with some conceptual code snippets using Python and assuming we're working with PyTorch. Keep in mind, these snippets are simplified for clarity and don’t cover complete training loops or data loading.

**Snippet 1: Model Modification**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

class FaceRecognitionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=None, embedding_size=128):
        super(FaceRecognitionModel, self).__init__()
        # Load pre-trained AlexNet
        self.alexnet = models.alexnet(pretrained=True)

        # Remove the classification layer
        self.alexnet.classifier = nn.Sequential(*list(self.alexnet.classifier.children())[:-1])

        # Add new layers for face recognition
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(9216, 512) # Adjust based on your Alexnet feature map size
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        if num_classes is not None:
          self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, num_classes)
        else:
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, embedding_size)



    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.alexnet(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu1(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Example usage
model = FaceRecognitionModel(num_classes=100) # Example for classifying 100 identities
embedding_model = FaceRecognitionModel(embedding_size=128) # Example for generating 128-dim embeddings
```

This snippet shows how we load the pretrained AlexNet, remove the last layer, and add our customized layers for the specific task. The `num_classes` parameter allows the model to classify identities. If not provided, the model will instead provide embeddings of the face into a specific size vector using the `embedding_size` parameter.

**Snippet 2: Contrastive Loss (Conceptual)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ContrastiveLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, margin=1.0):
        super(ContrastiveLoss, self).__init__()
        self.margin = margin

    def forward(self, output1, output2, label):
        distance = F.pairwise_distance(output1, output2)
        loss = torch.mean((1 - label) * 0.5 * torch.pow(distance, 2) +
                          (label) * 0.5 * torch.pow(torch.clamp(self.margin - distance, min=0.0), 2))
        return loss
```

This represents a simplified contrastive loss implementation. This loss function encourages similar face embeddings to be close and dissimilar ones to be far apart. 'Label' would be 0 for similar faces, 1 for different faces.

**Snippet 3: Triplet Loss (Conceptual)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class TripletLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, margin=1.0):
        super(TripletLoss, self).__init__()
        self.margin = margin

    def forward(self, anchor, positive, negative):
      pos_dist = F.pairwise_distance(anchor, positive)
      neg_dist = F.pairwise_distance(anchor, negative)

      loss = torch.mean(torch.relu(pos_dist - neg_dist + self.margin))

      return loss

```
This snippet illustrates a simplified triplet loss implementation. This loss calculates the distance between anchor-positive and anchor-negative examples to drive the embedding space to a form where same-identity embeddings are close, and different-identity embeddings are far away.

Beyond code, the practical challenges revolve around data preprocessing (aligning faces, handling variations in lighting and pose), and rigorous evaluation metrics. Standard accuracy can be misleading with face recognition; metrics like precision, recall, and especially receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are vital. Furthermore, the choice of similarity metric between embeddings (cosine similarity is common) significantly affects performance.

The research paper “Deep Face Recognition” by Yaniv Taigman et al. (2014) offers a strong foundation for understanding the theoretical underpinnings of face recognition with deep learning. For a more practical guide, the book "Deep Learning for Vision Systems" by Mohamed Elgendy provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning techniques for various computer vision tasks, including face recognition, and covers model training and evaluation. Additionally, for further exploration on various loss functions and their impact on face recognition you should check “FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering” by Florian Schroff et al. (2015).

In my experience, careful iterative refinement is necessary. You don't get ideal results with the first training run. It often involves experimentation with different architectures, learning rates, data augmentation techniques, and loss functions, along with a thorough analysis of error cases to understand where the model falls short. The field is constantly evolving so keeping updated with latest research is absolutely essential. Hopefully, these insights and examples help you get started on your face recognition journey using AlexNet as a backbone. It's a fascinating and complex area of machine learning.
