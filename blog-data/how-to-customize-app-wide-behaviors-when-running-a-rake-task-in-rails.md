alright, so you're looking at customizing app-wide behaviors when running rake tasks in rails. i've been there, done that, got the t-shirt – and probably a few scars from debugging. let's break it down.

the core issue you're hitting is that rake tasks often operate outside the normal rails application lifecycle. you're not dealing with a typical web request where the full stack is loaded and initialized. this means things like your app's configuration, active record connections, and even some initializers might not be behaving as you’d expect. sometimes, they're not even loaded at all.

i've had this bite me in production more than once, typically when i've forgotten to properly bootstrap the environment for a complex task that needed to interact heavily with the database. once, i had a scheduled rake task responsible for sending out daily reports that kept failing randomly. turns out, the database connection pool wasn't being correctly established because i was relying on the web application's middleware to handle that and the rake task was running in isolation, using a configuration that was not exactly the one i had in my deployment environment. learned that lesson the hard way after being woken up at 3 am to fix a critical issue that took an hour to identify.

anyway, there are a few common ways to approach this. let's explore them:

**1. environment setup in your rake tasks:**

the simplest approach is to explicitly load your rails environment within your rake task. rails provides a convenient helper for this: `environment`. by putting this line at the top of your task definition, you load the entire rails environment before the task's logic is executed. this means your initializers, database connections, and configuration should all be ready.

```ruby
# lib/tasks/my_custom_tasks.rake
namespace :my_tasks do
  desc "my custom task description"
  task :my_custom_task => :environment do
    puts "running my custom task with rails environment"
    # your task's code goes here
    # example:
    User.all.each do |user|
        puts user.email
    end
  end
end
```

this is usually the first thing i try and the one that resolves most simpler cases where missing configurations are the issue. if you encounter issues where models or configurations are not found, make sure you have the `:environment` task as a dependency. that's like the magic word that usually fixes this common "not loaded" problem.

**2. selective loading with initializers:**

sometimes you might not need the whole shebang. perhaps you only want a subset of initializers or specific configurations active. in these cases, you can selectively load the relevant configuration files or modules. this involves a little more manual control, but offers more flexibility if you have a very complex app with lots of custom initializers.

for instance if you have a custom logger initialized in a specific initializer, this one will not be available if you just depend on the `environment` task.

```ruby
# config/initializers/custom_logger.rb
module CustomLogger
  def self.log(message)
    puts "[CUSTOM LOG]: #{message}"
  end
end

# lib/tasks/my_selective_tasks.rake
namespace :my_tasks do
  desc "task description with selective initializers"
  task :my_selective_task do
      # load app configuration
      Rails.application.load_configuration
      # load specific initializer
      require Rails.root.join('config', 'initializers', 'custom_logger').to_s
      CustomLogger.log "starting task with custom logger"
      # your task's code goes here,
      # example:
      puts Rails.application.config.my_custom_config_value
      CustomLogger.log "task finished"
  end
end

```

here, instead of relying on the `:environment` task, we're explicitly loading the application configuration using `Rails.application.load_configuration` and the custom logger by requiring its file path directly. note that the config value shown in the example is just an example, you may have your specific values there. be careful to properly load all the necessary configurations this way, as you may end up with missing resources if you don't do it correctly. i have seen colleagues debugging issues related to this approach for hours.

**3. using a dedicated configuration block:**

if you need specific configurations that only apply to rake tasks, you can introduce a dedicated configuration block within your `application.rb` or an environment specific file. you can then check if you are running within a rake task and load configurations or override the ones you need.

this approach is very useful if you need to have slightly different behavior when your code runs under a rake environment, for example if you need to have a specific database pool, or a different logger.

```ruby
# config/application.rb
module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application

    config.my_custom_config_value = "default_value"

    if defined?(Rake)
        config.my_custom_config_value = "rake_value"
    end
  end
end

# lib/tasks/my_config_tasks.rake
namespace :my_tasks do
  desc "task description using dedicated config block"
  task :my_config_task => :environment do
    puts "running task with dedicated configuration"
    puts "my custom config value is: #{Rails.application.config.my_custom_config_value}"
    # your task's code goes here
    # example:
     User.all.each do |user|
        puts user.name
     end
  end
end
```

in this setup, we use `defined?(Rake)` to determine if the application is being initialized within the context of a rake task. if it is, we set the value to `rake_value`, otherwise it takes the default value. this is very helpful to have slightly different behaviors on code that will be used in rake tasks vs normal web requests.

now, some general tips from experience:

* **start simple:** always begin with loading the full rails environment unless you have a compelling reason not to. it's the easiest way to avoid most common configuration loading issues.
* **debug carefully:** when you encounter issues, use `puts` statements to print the values of important variables and configurations. `binding.pry` is also helpful if you use `pry-rails` gem, so you can inspect your configurations in more depth.
* **be aware of side effects:** loading the environment might trigger things you don’t intend. always review your initializers to make sure there are no unintended side-effects when running outside the normal web application context.
* **consider environment variables:** sometimes rake tasks need to have different behaviors depending on deployment environments. you can leverage environment variables to customize behavior inside your rake tasks or to configure the task behavior depending on the env.
* **test your tasks:** please, for the love of all that's holy, test your rake tasks. writing unit tests around your rake tasks can seem daunting at first, but it will save you countless hours of debugging. i've seen a team of developers ship a task that wiped out important data because no one bothered to test it. they spent the whole weekend recovering the info from backups, and learned the value of testing the hard way. i heard them complaining that this kind of situation was even worse than spending time debugging javascript on internet explorer 7.

finally for resources that helped me understand this a bit better, i can recommend two: the official rails documentation, and the book "eloquent ruby" it's a great reference for deeper understanding the inner workings of ruby and how rails leverages them. the book is a bit old, but the core principles still stand, and understanding the underlying mechanics is critical to writing solid rails code.
