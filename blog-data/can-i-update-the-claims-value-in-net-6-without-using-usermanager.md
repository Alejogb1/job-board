Alright, let’s talk about updating claims in .net 6, particularly when you want to bypass `userManager`. It’s a situation I’ve found myself in more than once, especially when dealing with microservices architectures or legacy systems where the user model doesn’t perfectly align with asp.net core identity. Essentially, you are looking to manipulate the identity claims directly, and while `userManager` offers a convenient abstraction, it's not always the most performant or suitable route.

The short answer? Yes, absolutely you can. The critical thing to remember is that claims are typically associated with a `ClaimsPrincipal`, which represents the user’s identity. In .net 6, the current user’s principal is usually accessible through the `HttpContext.User` property within controllers, or via dependency injection if needed elsewhere. The key is understanding how to manipulate the `ClaimsIdentity` within that principal. `ClaimsIdentity` is the specific object holding the collection of claims.

In my experience, one particular scenario comes to mind where we had a complex claims authorization scheme, completely detached from the user store managed by identity. We needed to update claims dynamically based on events happening within the application, and going through the `userManager` felt like a needless layer of indirection and incurred unnecessary database access. We chose to directly modify claims within the user principal’s identity at the request level.

So, how does one do this? Here’s the breakdown: You're not necessarily *changing* the user data, as those are handled externally (like a database, external authorization service, or a claims store). You’re modifying a *representation* of the user for the current request, which then influences authorization within your .net application.

The fundamental strategy involves these steps: First, access the current user’s `ClaimsPrincipal`. Second, obtain the relevant `ClaimsIdentity`. Third, manipulate the claims collection within the `ClaimsIdentity`. Because this is done on a per-request basis, changes made to claims persist only for the duration of that request.

Let’s illustrate this with code. I’ll start with a basic example of adding a new claim:

```csharp
using System.Security.Claims;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

public static class ClaimsHelper
{
    public static void AddOrUpdateClaim(HttpContext context, string claimType, string claimValue)
    {
       var claimsPrincipal = context.User;

        if (claimsPrincipal is null)
        {
            // Handle case where no principal is present, perhaps log or return gracefully
             return;
        }

        var claimsIdentity = (ClaimsIdentity?)claimsPrincipal.Identity;

        if(claimsIdentity == null)
        {
             //Handle case where no claims identity exists, also log.
             return;
        }

       var existingClaim = claimsIdentity.FindFirst(claimType);

        if (existingClaim != null)
        {
             claimsIdentity.RemoveClaim(existingClaim); //Remove the existing claim before adding a new one.
        }


        claimsIdentity.AddClaim(new Claim(claimType, claimValue));
    }
}

// usage example within a controller action or filter
// example usage in a middleware
public class MyMiddleware
{
     private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

     public MyMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
         _next = next;
     }

     public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
          // Example: adding/updating a claim dynamically based on some event
        string eventId = context.Request.Headers["X-Event-ID"];
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(eventId))
        {
           ClaimsHelper.AddOrUpdateClaim(context, "eventid", eventId);
        }

        await _next(context);
     }
}

```

In this snippet, we’re creating a helper method that takes the `HttpContext`, claim type, and value as arguments. We then access the current `ClaimsPrincipal`, verify it exists and is of a valid type (ClaimsIdentity). We check to see if a claim with the provided type already exists. If it does, we remove the old claim, to prevent duplicates, before adding a new one.

Let’s consider a more nuanced situation involving multiple claims of the same type and you wish to replace all of them. For instance, updating a user's role-based claims:

```csharp
using System.Security.Claims;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public static class ClaimsHelper
{
    public static void ReplaceClaims(HttpContext context, string claimType, IEnumerable<string> newClaimValues)
    {
       var claimsPrincipal = context.User;

        if (claimsPrincipal is null)
        {
            // Handle null principal
            return;
        }

        var claimsIdentity = (ClaimsIdentity?)claimsPrincipal.Identity;

         if (claimsIdentity == null)
        {
             //Handle null identity
            return;
        }

       // Remove all old claims of type claimType
        var claimsToRemove = claimsIdentity.FindAll(claimType).ToList();
        foreach (var claim in claimsToRemove)
        {
             claimsIdentity.RemoveClaim(claim);
        }


       // Add the new claims.
        foreach (var claimValue in newClaimValues)
        {
             claimsIdentity.AddClaim(new Claim(claimType, claimValue));
        }

    }
}

// Usage example within a controller
// Example Controller Action
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class ClaimsController : ControllerBase
{
      [HttpGet("update-user-roles")]
       public IActionResult UpdateUserRoles()
        {
           var newRoles = new List<string> { "editor", "contributor"};
           ClaimsHelper.ReplaceClaims(HttpContext, ClaimTypes.Role, newRoles);
           return Ok("User roles updated.");
        }
}
```

Here, we're first removing all existing claims with the specified `claimType` to ensure no old claims are hanging around, and then we add all the new values. This provides a clean replacement.

Lastly, consider a scenario where you have claim data in the user's session. You may have retrieved this previously. You can directly update claims based on this data, without involving a database for every request.

```csharp
using System.Security.Claims;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

public static class ClaimsHelper
{
    public static void UpdateClaimsFromSession(HttpContext context)
    {
       var claimsPrincipal = context.User;

        if (claimsPrincipal is null)
        {
            // Handle null principal
             return;
        }

        var claimsIdentity = (ClaimsIdentity?)claimsPrincipal.Identity;

         if (claimsIdentity == null)
         {
              //Handle null identity.
              return;
         }


       // Simulate session data (replace with real session retrieval)
       var sessionData = new Dictionary<string, string>
       {
              { "department", "engineering" },
              { "location", "remote" }
        };
       foreach(var entry in sessionData)
       {
           var existingClaim = claimsIdentity.FindFirst(entry.Key);
            if(existingClaim != null)
           {
                claimsIdentity.RemoveClaim(existingClaim);
           }
           claimsIdentity.AddClaim(new Claim(entry.Key, entry.Value));
       }

    }
}

// Usage within a controller

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class SessionController : ControllerBase
{

    [HttpGet("update-claims-from-session")]
    public IActionResult UpdateClaimsFromSession()
    {
       ClaimsHelper.UpdateClaimsFromSession(HttpContext);
       return Ok("Claims updated from session data.");
    }
}


```

In this example, we simulate pulling information from session data and then applying it to the user's claims, again, removing any existing claims first to ensure we have the latest data.

It's important to emphasize that this approach works on the *current request* level and it does not alter the user’s stored data directly. The changes are transient. It modifies the way your application behaves in terms of authorization, based on the modified claims principal.

For further learning, consider these resources:

*   **"Programming ASP.NET Core" by Dino Esposito** - Provides a deep dive into asp.net core concepts and how claims-based identity work, which helps understanding underlying mechanisms.
*   **"Security Patterns" by Markus Schumacher, Eduardo Fernandez-Buglioni, Michael Schumacher, and Duane Hybertson** - A more general text, but contains invaluable insights into security patterns including claims-based authentication.
*   **Official Microsoft ASP.NET Core documentation** - The most up to date, comprehensive material available on Microsoft’s platform, specifically search for sections on authentication and authorization, focusing on claims.

By taking a direct approach, as demonstrated, you can maintain full control and optimize for performance when working with claims in .net 6, without relying exclusively on the `userManager` for every manipulation. This allows flexibility, efficiency and better suitability for scenarios where the user model does not align precisely with default Identity setups.
