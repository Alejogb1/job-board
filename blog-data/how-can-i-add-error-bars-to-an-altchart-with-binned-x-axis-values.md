Let's tackle this. It's a frequent requirement when visualizing aggregated data, and while `altair` provides excellent tools, working with binned data for error bar representation needs a specific approach. I've personally encountered this many times, typically when dealing with sensor data or simulation results, where you're often summarizing distributions within discrete intervals. We’re essentially looking to show the uncertainty or variability of a dataset within these pre-defined bins, and Altair, being a declarative library, handles this via transformation and layering.

The crux of it lies in two parts: first, preprocessing the data to compute the necessary statistics (mean, standard deviation, or whatever error metric you choose), and second, utilizing Altair’s `mark_errorbar` functionality correctly, layering it onto the base chart. Let's break down the process.

Before we even get to the charts, the data needs to be prepared. Altair doesn't calculate error statistics on the fly in this context, so we need to generate these using pandas or other libraries. I often use pandas groupby operations for this. Let’s assume we have a dataframe structured with a value column that we want to bin, and then a column representing the data itself from which to calculate our error metrics. Something like:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import altair as alt

# Sample Data (replace with your actual data)
np.random.seed(42) # for reproducibility
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'value': np.random.rand(100) * 100,
    'measurement': np.random.normal(loc=50, scale=15, size=100)
})
```

Now, we create the bins, calculate our descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation are most common). For this example, we'll use `pd.cut` to categorize the 'value' column and then group by these new bins to compute the statistics, and then reset the index to make our dataframe usable for Altair:

```python
bins = [0, 25, 50, 75, 100]
data['value_binned'] = pd.cut(data['value'], bins=bins, labels=[f'{bins[i]}-{bins[i+1]}' for i in range(len(bins)-1)], include_lowest=True)

binned_data = data.groupby('value_binned')['measurement'].agg(['mean', 'std']).reset_index()
```

With the binned data ready, we can construct our chart. Here, we'll use a bar chart for the mean and error bars representing ±1 standard deviation. Altair's layering capabilities are key here. Here's the first example of chart generation:

```python
base_chart = alt.Chart(binned_data).encode(
    alt.X('value_binned:N', title='Value Bins'),
    alt.Y('mean:Q', title='Mean Measurement')
)

bars = base_chart.mark_bar(opacity=0.7)

error_bars = base_chart.mark_errorbar(extent='stdev').encode(
    alt.Y('mean:Q', title='Mean Measurement', scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),
    alt.YError('std:Q')
)

chart = bars + error_bars
chart.display()
```

Notice that we defined the main bar chart and the error bars using the *same base chart*. This allows Altair to align them on the same x-axis seamlessly. The `mark_errorbar` uses `extent='stdev'` which specifies that the upper and lower bounds will be calculated as ±1 standard deviation from the mean, based on the `std` column. `alt.YError('std:Q')` tells the error bar to use this computed standard deviation as the length of the error bars.

Sometimes, you might want to visualize confidence intervals instead of standard deviation. This requires a slightly different statistical calculation. If, for instance, you wanted to represent 95% confidence intervals, you would compute the standard error and the margin of error:

```python
from scipy.stats import t

def calculate_confidence_interval(series):
  n = series.size
  mean = series.mean()
  std_err = series.std() / np.sqrt(n)
  confidence = 0.95
  df = n - 1 #degrees of freedom
  t_value = t.ppf((1 + confidence) / 2, df) #two tailed t-distribution
  margin_of_error = t_value * std_err
  return pd.Series({'mean': mean, 'lower_bound': mean - margin_of_error, 'upper_bound': mean + margin_of_error})

confidence_data = data.groupby('value_binned')['measurement'].apply(calculate_confidence_interval).unstack().reset_index()
```

The function `calculate_confidence_interval` computes the mean, standard error, margin of error and returns the mean, lower, and upper bound. Then, using the `apply` and `unstack` combination we process the entire data frame in one go. We’ll then plot it:

```python
base_chart2 = alt.Chart(confidence_data).encode(
    alt.X('value_binned:N', title='Value Bins'),
    alt.Y('mean:Q', title='Mean Measurement')
)

bars2 = base_chart2.mark_bar(opacity=0.7)

error_bars2 = base_chart2.mark_errorbar().encode(
    alt.Y('mean:Q', title='Mean Measurement', scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),
    alt.YError('lower_bound:Q', axis=None),
    alt.Y2('upper_bound:Q', axis=None)
)

chart2 = bars2 + error_bars2
chart2.display()
```

Here, the standard `extent='stdev'` isn’t used; instead we specify the upper and lower bounds using `alt.YError()` and `alt.Y2`. The axis suppression `axis=None` avoids repetition of the title for the error bounds.

Lastly, a slightly different approach is to use a box plot. This represents the full distribution including the interquartile range, medians and potential outliers:

```python
box_plot = alt.Chart(data).mark_boxplot().encode(
    alt.X('value_binned:N', title='Value Bins'),
    alt.Y('measurement:Q', title='Measurement')
)

box_plot.display()
```

This example, uses the original dataframe with the binned column added. `mark_boxplot` will calculate all the necessary elements, and these can be customized further with color and other visual elements.

When working on these kinds of visualizations, I find it helpful to review statistical visualization textbooks, particularly those focusing on data presentation. "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" by Edward Tufte is a classic for understanding the fundamentals, and "Fundamentals of Data Visualization" by Claus Wilke provides a more modern perspective. The Altair documentation itself is crucial, especially its section on layering and mark properties, and can be found on their website. A quick study of pandas' documentation, especially around `groupby` and aggregations would also prove useful. These resources offer a comprehensive base to handle similar scenarios.

The key takeaway here is that Altair requires data preprocessing for error calculations, but it gives great flexibility through layering. There isn't a magic one-liner for error bars on binned data, but a methodical approach of preparing your dataset, and then using layering, will get the job done reliably and maintain a clear and expressive result. I've found these patterns to be extremely robust across countless projects, and with proper care, they’ll also serve you well.
