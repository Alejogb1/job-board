Alright, let's tackle this. I remember a project back in my early days, a content analysis tool for a now-defunct blog network. We needed accurate word counts, but the raw text was a mess, punctuation everywhere and no consistency. Figuring out how to do this efficiently with NLTK became crucial, and it's a common task even now.

The core problem lies in preprocessing text before you can reliably count words. Raw input often includes punctuation marks, which should not be counted as words. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) offers tools to help, but a direct word count isn't always the best approach. We need to tokenize the text into words, which includes handling these extraneous characters, or ensuring they are removed.

Here's the general process, broken down for clarity:

1.  **Lowercasing:** First, convert the entire string to lowercase. This ensures "Word" and "word" are counted as the same word. It's a simple step, but essential for consistency.
2.  **Tokenization:** The core of the problem; we need to break the sentence into individual words. The `nltk.word_tokenize` function is a good starting point, but it typically doesn't ignore punctuation by default.
3.  **Punctuation Removal (or Specific Tokenization):** This is where the "without punctuation" part comes in. We can use different methods here, either by filtering the tokens or choosing a tokenizer that handles it directly.
4.  **Counting:** Finally, count the resulting words.

Now, let's get to some code examples. I'll show you three approaches, each with its nuances, reflecting how I've handled this situation in the past.

**Example 1: Filtering Tokens**

This approach first tokenizes the text and then filters out any token that consists only of punctuation. We utilize a predefined set of punctuation from the `string` library.

```python
import nltk
import string

def count_words_filtered(sentence):
    sentence = sentence.lower()
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
    punctuation = set(string.punctuation)
    filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in punctuation]
    return len(filtered_tokens)

example_sentence = "This sentence, has, quite a few! punctuation marks."
word_count = count_words_filtered(example_sentence)
print(f"Word count (filtered): {word_count}") # Output: Word count (filtered): 7
```

In this example, we explicitly remove punctuation. The `string.punctuation` provides a ready-made set of common punctuation characters. The list comprehension efficiently creates a new list of tokens, filtering out those that are just punctuation. This is a very readable and easy-to-understand method.

**Example 2: Regular Expression-Based Tokenization**

This technique uses regular expressions within the tokenization process itself to capture only sequences of alphabetic characters. This avoids the explicit filtering step.

```python
import nltk
import re

def count_words_regex(sentence):
    sentence = sentence.lower()
    tokenizer = nltk.RegexpTokenizer(r'\w+') # Tokenize on words (sequence of alphanumeric)
    tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(sentence)
    return len(tokens)

example_sentence = "Another sentence. With some! other, punctuation!"
word_count = count_words_regex(example_sentence)
print(f"Word count (regex): {word_count}") # Output: Word count (regex): 6
```

Here, the `RegexpTokenizer` from NLTK allows us to define a regular expression `\w+` which matches one or more alphanumeric characters (which implicitly omits punctuation). This can be more efficient than filtering, especially with larger datasets. Also, you can tailor the regex to different definitions of 'words', including hyphenated terms or numbers, for example, `[a-zA-Z0-9]+`.

**Example 3: Using NLTK's String-Based Tokenizer with Custom Settings**

This utilizes a NLTK's string tokenizer, which by default assumes tokens are separated by space, along with specific settings to handle punctuation.

```python
import nltk

def count_words_string(sentence):
    sentence = sentence.lower()
    tokens = nltk.tokenize.wordpunct_tokenize(sentence)
    filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalnum()]
    return len(filtered_tokens)

example_sentence = "Yet another, sentence! (with) more; punctuation..."
word_count = count_words_string(example_sentence)
print(f"Word count (string token): {word_count}") # Output: Word count (string token): 5
```
The `wordpunct_tokenize` splits the sentence into tokens based on whitespaces and punctuation, and then we use `isalnum()` to filter to keep only alphanumeric characters, giving us the words without punctuation. This method offers flexibility.

**Choosing the Right Approach:**

Each approach has its trade-offs.

*   **Filtering (Example 1):** Simpler, very readable. Might be slightly slower for large text because it needs to iterate through a full list of tokens, once for the filtering step.
*   **Regular Expression (Example 2):** Potentially faster, especially on large datasets. Requires knowledge of regular expressions. More concise when dealing with specific tokenization requirements.
*   **NLTK String-Based with `isalnum()` (Example 3):** A middle ground, provides more explicit control when you want to use NLTK tokenizer with string based features.

For smaller projects or simple analyses, the filtering method is often sufficient. For high-volume text analysis, the regular expression-based method might prove more efficient. The last option allows for fine grained control and can be customized as needed.

**Further Reading:**

If you're serious about text processing with NLTK, I highly recommend diving into the NLTK book ( *Natural Language Processing with Python* by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper). It's freely available online and provides a comprehensive guide to all NLTK's features. Also, for a deeper understanding of regular expressions, *Mastering Regular Expressions* by Jeffrey Friedl is an excellent choice. It will enhance your ability to work with text manipulation. Understanding tokenization and text processing techniques is crucial for any NLP based project and those are excellent resources for that.

Remember, the "best" way to do this often depends on the specific needs of your project and the characteristics of your data. These examples should give you a solid start, though. I hope this detailed explanation helps you move forward. Let me know if you have other questions, always happy to share my experience.
