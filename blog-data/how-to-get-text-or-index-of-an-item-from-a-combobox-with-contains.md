alright, so you're looking to pluck out either the text or the index of a combobox item, not by exact match, but by checking if the text *contains* a specific string. yeah, been there. that’s one of those things that sounds simpler than it actually is at first glance, especially when you start with visual basic 6 like i did back in the day, and the libraries don't just hand it to you on a silver platter.

i've spent a few nights debugging this kind of thing, especially when the client insisted on a “search as you type” feature in some old winforms application. it was brutal. the thing is, comboboxes are usually about selecting the *whole* item, not pieces of it. so, when you try to find something that "contains" instead of "equals", it needs a different approach.

basically, you have to iterate through the items and perform the check yourself. not the end of the world, but it's an extra step, especially if you’re trying to squeeze every millisecond of performance out of a clunky old system like i was. remember that time when my boss asked me to make that application run faster and i jokingly said “sure, i’ll just install a flux capacitor”? he did not laugh.

anyway, lets look at how this is done. let's start with getting the text of the item that contains your specific string.

here’s a basic approach using c#:

```csharp
  string searchString = "yourPartialString";
    string foundText = null;

    foreach(var item in comboBox1.Items) {
        if (item != null && item.ToString().Contains(searchString, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {
            foundText = item.ToString();
            break; // stop searching when you find it
        }
    }
    if(foundText != null){
      MessageBox.Show("found item: "+ foundText);
    }
    else {
      MessageBox.Show("item not found");
    }
```

this snippet goes through each item in your combobox, turns it into a string, and checks if that string contains your substring, ignoring case. i used `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase` because that's generally the most robust for text matching in a ui, but you can change to a specific culture comparison if you need to handle things like accents and other locale specific rules. once it finds an item that fits, it saves the text and pops out of the loop. i added a null check to be on the safe side, even though it shouldn't normally happen in a populated combobox, you never know what crazy data someone might try to throw at your application.

now, what if you also need the index of the matching item? easy peasy. just tweak the code a bit:

```csharp
 string searchString = "yourPartialString";
 int foundIndex = -1; // default to not found
 for (int i=0; i<comboBox1.Items.Count; i++) {
      var item = comboBox1.Items[i];
        if (item != null && item.ToString().Contains(searchString, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {
          foundIndex = i;
          break;
        }
 }

 if (foundIndex != -1) {
        MessageBox.Show("found item at index: " + foundIndex);
 } else {
        MessageBox.Show("item not found");
 }
```

the key change here is that we’re iterating through a for loop using the index, and if a match is found we just set the `foundIndex` variable to that index. i’m using the value of `-1` as a kind of "not found" flag. it's a fairly common pattern, and makes the intent clear. again, i do a null check in the items, because it's good practice. the error checking i added is very basic here because is just for demonstration. you should do this in a real application.

one more thing. if you want to search and extract multiple items that contains the same substring, you can use linq, here is a way:

```csharp
string searchString = "yourPartialString";

    var items = comboBox1.Items
                  .Cast<object>() //cast items to object
                  .Where(item => item != null && item.ToString().Contains(searchString, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
                  .ToList();

    if (items.Count > 0)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("found " + items.Count + " items.");
         foreach (var item in items)
        {
             MessageBox.Show("found item: "+ item.ToString());
        }
    }
    else
    {
        MessageBox.Show("no items found");
    }

```

this last code snippet demonstrates how you can use linq to filter all the elements in the combobox that contains the substring, it can make the code more declarative, it is not faster than the previous code, it may be even slower because of the overhead that linq introduces, but is a good way to do it. you can choose what is best for you.

a few things to keep in mind.  first, performance can be a concern, especially if your combobox has a huge number of items. for that, you might want to look into methods like using binary search if the data is sorted, but since this is a combo box this may not apply.  second, always think about edge cases, like what happens if your string is empty or if there are no matching items. the code needs to handle these situations gracefully, which the examples above address in a rudimentary way. you should add proper error handling to your code. third, the `contains` method can also use the ordinal comparison for speed, depending on your needs you can also set the culture information. you can always read about the string comparison enumeration in the microsoft documentation.

lastly, the more you get into this kind of thing, the more you'll realize that good coding is about managing complexity, not just writing code that works. you will need to learn about data structures and algorithms, it's a fundamental skill for any developer, but i would say it is even more crucial if you have a software that has to deal with ui events and is constantly reacting to user interaction. i'd recommend the "introduction to algorithms" book by thomas h. cormen et al as a good starting point, and if you are really interested in algorithms applied to gui i would check any specific paper in this area. they are not difficult to find in academic search engines or websites like acm dl. reading more general papers about user interfaces is a great practice as well, this way you can have a better understanding on how to create user interfaces from an academic point of view.

so, there you go. a couple of ways to get that text or index from your combobox. it may look simple now but every problem you have is a step in your learning process. keep coding, and good luck.
