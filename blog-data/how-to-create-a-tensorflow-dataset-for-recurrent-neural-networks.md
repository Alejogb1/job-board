Alright, let's delve into crafting TensorFlow Datasets specifically tailored for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). It's a topic I've navigated quite a bit, particularly when working on time series forecasting projects back in my days at [fictional tech company name]. The core challenge often lies not in the RNN architecture itself, but in efficiently feeding it the data it needs. A poorly prepared dataset can become a bottleneck, significantly impacting training speed and model performance.

The key lies in understanding that RNNs, unlike feedforward networks, process sequential data. Consequently, our dataset needs to reflect this characteristic. We’re dealing with sequences of inputs, not just independent data points. Therefore, our TensorFlow dataset construction will revolve around generating appropriate sequences for training.

First, let's consider the fundamental components we'll be managing: the input sequences, target sequences, and often padding to handle variable length sequences. The `tf.data.Dataset` api offers a robust suite of operations to achieve this. I find the most effective approach usually begins by organizing the raw data, often in the form of a list or array, and transforming that data into a dataset object.

For illustration, imagine a scenario where we’re dealing with text data, say a collection of sentences. Let's think through the steps and write some example code.

**Code Example 1: Creating a Simple Sequence Dataset**

Suppose our raw data is represented as a list of integers, each integer corresponding to a tokenized word.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Fictional example raw data.
raw_data = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
    [15,16]
]

def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
  """Creates input/target sequences with a specified sequence length."""
  input_sequences = []
  target_sequences = []
  for seq in data:
      if len(seq) > seq_length:
        for i in range(len(seq) - seq_length):
          input_sequences.append(seq[i:i+seq_length])
          target_sequences.append(seq[i+1:i+seq_length+1])  # Target is the next step
      elif len(seq) == seq_length:
          input_sequences.append(seq)
          target_sequences.append(seq[1:] + [0]) # zero padding for last element
  return input_sequences, target_sequences


seq_length = 4
input_seqs, target_seqs = create_sequences(raw_data, seq_length)


dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((input_seqs, target_seqs))

for inputs, targets in dataset.take(3):
  print("Input:", inputs.numpy())
  print("Target:", targets.numpy())


# Adding padding here as we are dealing with sequences and RNN
padded_dataset = dataset.padded_batch(
    batch_size=2,
    padding_values=(0,0),
    padded_shapes=([seq_length],[seq_length])
).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)


for inputs, targets in padded_dataset.take(2):
    print("\n Padded Input batch:", inputs.numpy())
    print("Padded Target batch:", targets.numpy())

```

In this first example, the `create_sequences` function forms input and target pairs. Notice that the target is simply the input shifted by one position, which is common in many sequence-to-sequence tasks, and how we handle cases where the sequence length is shorter than `seq_length`. Then, we turn this data into a `tf.data.Dataset` using `from_tensor_slices` and introduce padding using padded_batch and finally, we `prefetch` the data.

This demonstrates the basic data transformation process. In practice, you’ll need to tailor your sequence generation logic based on the specific requirements of your model and data.

Now, let’s step up the complexity a bit. Consider a scenario where we also have some features associated with each time step within the sequence.

**Code Example 2: Dataset with Input Features**

Let's assume that, in addition to the token ids (like before), we also have numeric features for each word like part-of-speech tags or frequency values.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


# Example raw data, including numeric features.
raw_data_features = [
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8], [0.9, 1.0]]),
    ([6, 7, 8], [[1.1, 1.2], [1.3, 1.4], [1.5, 1.6]]),
    ([9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [[1.7, 1.8], [1.9, 2.0], [2.1, 2.2], [2.3, 2.4], [2.5, 2.6], [2.7,2.8]]),
    ([15,16], [[2.9,3.0],[3.1,3.2]])
]


def create_feature_sequences(data, seq_length):
  input_sequences = []
  target_sequences = []
  feature_sequences = []

  for seq_data, features in data:
    if len(seq_data) > seq_length:
      for i in range(len(seq_data) - seq_length):
          input_sequences.append(seq_data[i:i+seq_length])
          target_sequences.append(seq_data[i+1:i+seq_length+1])
          feature_sequences.append(features[i:i+seq_length])

    elif len(seq_data) == seq_length:
          input_sequences.append(seq_data)
          target_sequences.append(seq_data[1:] + [0]) # Padding
          feature_sequences.append(features)


  return input_sequences, target_sequences, feature_sequences


seq_length = 4
input_seqs, target_seqs, feature_seqs = create_feature_sequences(raw_data_features, seq_length)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(((input_seqs, feature_seqs), target_seqs))

for (inputs, features), targets in dataset.take(2):
  print("Input:", inputs.numpy())
  print("Features:", features.numpy())
  print("Target:", targets.numpy())

padded_dataset = dataset.padded_batch(
    batch_size=2,
    padding_values=((0,np.array([0.0,0.0])),0),
    padded_shapes=(([seq_length],[seq_length,2]),[seq_length])
).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)


for (inputs, features), targets in padded_dataset.take(2):
    print("\n Padded Input batch:", inputs.numpy())
    print("Padded Feature batch:", features.numpy())
    print("Padded Target batch:", targets.numpy())

```

Here, the core modification involves creating sequences for our features alongside the input and target sequences. We're now creating nested tensors in the dataset as we have separate tensors for inputs and their features. When padding is applied we take care to pad input sequences and features differently and also the padding value for the features is no longer a single scalar, but a vector as well.

Finally, let's consider a more complex, though common, use case involving sequence-to-sequence models like an encoder-decoder for machine translation.

**Code Example 3: Sequence-to-Sequence Dataset**

In sequence-to-sequence models, we have an input sequence and a target sequence that are usually not shifted versions of one another. The target sequence may have a different length.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


# Example raw data, different input and target lengths.
raw_data_seq2seq = [
    ([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]),
    ([8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14]),
    ([15, 16, 17, 18, 19], [20, 21]),
     ([22,23], [24,25,26,27,28])
]

def create_seq2seq_dataset(data):
    input_sequences = [inputs for inputs, _ in data]
    target_sequences = [targets for _, targets in data]

    return input_sequences, target_sequences

input_seqs, target_seqs = create_seq2seq_dataset(raw_data_seq2seq)


dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((input_seqs, target_seqs))

for inputs, targets in dataset.take(2):
  print("Input:", inputs.numpy())
  print("Target:", targets.numpy())


padded_dataset = dataset.padded_batch(
    batch_size=2,
    padding_values=(0,0),
    padded_shapes=([None],[None])
).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)



for inputs, targets in padded_dataset.take(2):
    print("\n Padded Input batch:", inputs.numpy())
    print("Padded Target batch:", targets.numpy())
```
Here, the key distinction is in how we're handling the input and output sequences. They don't have a one-to-one correspondence as we saw in the previous examples. Consequently, the padding process requires understanding the maximum length for each type of sequence and specifying this in padded shapes as `[None]` during `padded_batch`.

The examples highlight the essential steps in creating TensorFlow datasets for RNNs: sequence generation, and if needed, padding and incorporating additional features. Remember, there isn't a single “correct” way to construct these datasets; the optimal method depends heavily on the specific task and data characteristics.

For further study, I would recommend diving deep into "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, specifically the chapters on recurrent networks and sequence modeling. Also, the official TensorFlow documentation, in particular the sections regarding `tf.data.Dataset` and padding, is invaluable. Papers on specific applications of recurrent networks, such as sequence-to-sequence models in machine translation or time series analysis, are also very instructive. Be sure to explore research papers from conferences like NeurIPS or ICML for cutting-edge ideas.
