Alright, let's talk about asynchronous iterations within node.js lambda functions, specifically the scenario you've presented with a `for` loop and `await`. It’s a topic that’s tripped up many developers, and I remember a particularly challenging case back in '18 while building an event processing service. We were dealing with a massive influx of data from IoT sensors, and the processing pipeline required fetching related data from a database for each sensor reading. We originally went down a synchronous route, and it was… well, a disaster. Lambda timeouts were the norm, not the exception. That experience certainly hammered home the critical need for understanding asynchronous control flow.

The short answer is yes, a `for` loop containing `await` can absolutely be used within a node.js lambda function. However, the key word here is *can*, not *should*. Using it effectively requires careful understanding of how javascript’s asynchronous nature, especially Promises, interacts with loop constructs. Blindly slapping an `await` inside a `for` loop without considering the implications can lead to performance bottlenecks and, as we experienced firsthand, increased lambda invocation durations and subsequent timeouts.

The crux of the issue lies in how `for` loops work synchronously. When you introduce `await` inside it, you're essentially pausing the loop iteration until the promise that’s being awaited resolves. This, in its basic form, turns what could be parallelizable operations into a strictly sequential process. If you have, let's say, 100 items to iterate over and each `await` takes 50ms, that loop alone is going to consume at least 5 seconds of your lambda’s precious execution time.

Let’s illustrate with some code examples.

First, here's a basic scenario where we'll simulate asynchronous operations with promises using `setTimeout`:

```javascript
async function processItem(item) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Processed item: ${item}`);
      resolve(`Result from ${item}`);
    }, 50);
  });
}

async function handler(event) {
  const items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const results = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
      const item = items[i];
    const result = await processItem(item);
    results.push(result);
  }

  console.log("All processing finished.");
  return results;
}

// Example call
(async () => {
  const results = await handler({});
  console.log(results)
})();
```

This first snippet shows the basic case. Each call to `processItem` waits for 50ms before moving to the next one. If we had a large number of items, this sequential processing would become a major problem. This `for` loop with `await` works, but its performance is poor when handling asynchronous tasks that could otherwise execute in parallel.

Now, let’s contrast that with a far more effective method, using `Promise.all`:

```javascript
async function processItem(item) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Processed item: ${item}`);
      resolve(`Result from ${item}`);
    }, 50);
  });
}

async function handler(event) {
  const items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const promises = items.map(item => processItem(item));
  const results = await Promise.all(promises);

  console.log("All processing finished.");
  return results;
}

// Example call
(async () => {
    const results = await handler({});
    console.log(results)
  })();
```

In this second example, we use `map` to create an array of promises, then utilize `Promise.all` to concurrently process them. This doesn't mean they *truly* happen at the exact same moment due to javascript’s single-threaded nature, but it means the asynchronous tasks are started as quickly as possible without waiting for each one to finish before the next begins. This results in significant performance gains when dealing with numerous asynchronous operations that aren't dependent on each other. Note that `Promise.all` will resolve only when *all* the promises resolve or will reject if one fails, so you need to ensure all the operations have proper error handling.

Finally, let’s examine a scenario where we might need to do things in batches, limiting concurrent executions. This is particularly relevant when dealing with resource limits or API rate limits. Let's say we want to process batches of 2:

```javascript
async function processItem(item) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Processed item: ${item}`);
      resolve(`Result from ${item}`);
    }, 50);
  });
}

async function processInBatches(items, batchSize) {
  const results = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i += batchSize) {
    const batch = items.slice(i, i + batchSize);
    const batchPromises = batch.map(item => processItem(item));
    const batchResults = await Promise.all(batchPromises);
    results.push(...batchResults);
  }
  return results;
}

async function handler(event) {
  const items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
  const batchSize = 2;
  const results = await processInBatches(items, batchSize);
  console.log("All processing finished.");
  return results;
}


(async () => {
    const results = await handler({});
    console.log(results)
  })();
```
Here, we've introduced a `processInBatches` function that breaks the input array into batches and uses `Promise.all` on each batch, limiting the maximum concurrency to the defined batch size. This allows you to strike a balance between performance and resource utilization, something I’ve found incredibly valuable for production systems.

To further understand these concepts, I'd recommend diving deep into asynchronous JavaScript. The following resources are particularly helpful:

1.  *“Effective JavaScript”* by David Herman: This book provides a fantastic foundation on JavaScript’s nuances, including asynchronous programming, and highlights best practices when working with promises.

2.  The *“You Don't Know JS”* series by Kyle Simpson, particularly the “*Async & Performance*” volume. This provides in-depth knowledge of asynchronous javascript, offering detailed insights into promises and async/await which goes beyond the surface level explanations.

3.  *“Node.js Design Patterns, 3rd Edition”* by Mario Casciaro and Luciano Mammino. This resource provides practical advice and patterns for building high-performing Node.js applications, with specific sections on asynchronous patterns and working with lambda functions.

Remember, while using a `for` loop with `await` is possible, it’s not always the optimal approach. Analyzing the specific requirements of your problem and understanding the potential bottlenecks will help you write more efficient and scalable lambda functions. Choosing between sequential `for...await` loops, `Promise.all`, or a batched approach like the last example really depends on the nature of the asynchronous operations and your application’s limits. It’s a balancing act, but mastering it significantly improves performance, especially when dealing with lambda functions in serverless environments.
