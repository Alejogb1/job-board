Alright, let’s tackle this. It’s a common question, and understanding the nuances between dense and conv2d layers in Keras is crucial for effectively building neural networks. I’ve spent a fair amount of time debugging models where these layers weren’t used optimally, so let's break down how they operate and impact data.

The core difference lies in their processing methodology. A `Dense` layer, which you might also hear referred to as a fully connected layer, treats the input data as a single vector. It essentially performs a matrix multiplication, followed by the addition of a bias term and usually a non-linear activation function. Consider it this way: every input node is connected to every output node in this layer. This means that spatial relationships between input values are largely ignored, which can be both a benefit and a drawback, depending on your data.

On the other hand, `Conv2D` layers, or convolutional layers, are designed specifically to work with grid-like data, such as images. They leverage the concept of a *kernel*, a small matrix that slides across the input, performing element-wise multiplication with the input values within its receptive field, followed by summation. This process is called convolution. The kernel essentially extracts local patterns from the input. Crucially, spatial relationships between nearby data points are preserved and are actually the focus of the operation. Think of it like a magnifying glass running across the input—it detects features by scanning local regions rather than considering the input as one long, undifferentiated list of numbers.

Now, how does this affect values practically? In a `Dense` layer, each output is a weighted sum of *all* inputs, plus a bias. The magnitude of each weight determines how much influence a particular input value has on a particular output value. When you're training a model, the goal is to adjust these weights such that specific patterns in the input lead to specific outputs. These weights are typically initialized randomly and are refined through backpropagation. If you are working with normalized data, you'll often see that the weights remain relatively small, usually in the range of -1 to 1, or slightly higher depending on the learning rate and specific optimizer. The bias term, in comparison, will shift all output values equally.

With `Conv2D`, each output pixel of a feature map results from the convolution operation within a specified region of the input image. A large kernel means that a wider area of input is considered when calculating the output pixel. This allows for the detection of bigger or more complex features within the image. Smaller kernels focus on finer details. Weights in a `Conv2D` layer are associated with their kernel, effectively creating a ‘filter’ that searches for a particular pattern or feature. These filter values also change through backpropagation to emphasize features that lead to correct classification or regression. The bias term functions similarly to that in `Dense` layers, shifting the overall value of the feature map produced.

Let’s illustrate with code snippets. First, a `Dense` layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate some input data
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 10) #Batch size 1, 10 features

# Create the dense layer
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=5, activation='relu', use_bias=True)

# Pass the data through the layer
output_dense = dense_layer(input_data)

print("Dense Layer Output:", output_dense)
print("Dense Layer Weights:", dense_layer.get_weights()[0])
print("Dense Layer Bias:", dense_layer.get_weights()[1])

```

In this snippet, the output values reflect the sum of each input multiplied by a unique weight, and adding the bias. The weight array and bias will be modified through gradient descent during training, so they adapt to the task.

Next, a simple example using a `Conv2D` layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulating image data
input_image = np.random.rand(1, 32, 32, 3)  #Batch size 1, image 32x32 with 3 channels

# Creating a 2D convolutional layer with a 3x3 kernel and 16 output filters
conv2d_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', use_bias=True, padding='same')

# Passing the data through the convolutional layer
output_conv = conv2d_layer(input_image)

print("Conv2D Layer Output Shape:", output_conv.shape)
print("Conv2D Kernel Weights:", conv2d_layer.get_weights()[0].shape)
print("Conv2D Bias:", conv2d_layer.get_weights()[1].shape)
```

Here, the output shape of the conv layer will be (1, 32, 32, 16) because we used ‘same’ padding, and 16 filters. Each filter looks for specific spatial features and outputs its own activation map, hence 16 different channels in the result. The kernel weights represent a small 3x3 filter that is convolved across the input image.

Let's illustrate one last point. If we apply a `Dense` layer on an image-like output of `Conv2D`, it will flatten the output and completely disregard the 2d spatial arrangements:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulating image data, using output from the previous Conv2D layer
input_conv = np.random.rand(1, 32, 32, 16)

# Flattening the input for dense layer
flatten_layer = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
flatten_output = flatten_layer(input_conv)

# Creating a dense layer that acts upon flattened output
dense_layer_flat = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu', use_bias=True)
output_dense_flat = dense_layer_flat(flatten_output)

print("Flatten Output Shape:", flatten_output.shape)
print("Dense Layer Output (from flattened input):", output_dense_flat.shape)
```

In this case, `flatten_output` shape is (1, 16384), where 16384 = 32\*32\*16, meaning all those 2D filters of conv layers are now squashed into a single vector, effectively losing all the positional information. `dense_layer_flat` then acts on this vector as before, computing outputs as a weighted sum of every flattened input.

In practical model design, I've found that appropriate use of these layers significantly impacts performance. For image processing tasks, convolutional layers are almost always the better choice for the initial stages, as they preserve and learn from spatial patterns. You typically use dense layers towards the end of a network, often after the input is flattened, to make high-level decisions based on the extracted features. I recall one particularly tricky case involving satellite imagery where improper layer arrangement meant that the model was effectively trying to learn an almost impossible task. After restructuring the network with a proper usage of `Conv2D` followed by `Dense` layers, the accuracy jumped dramatically.

For a deeper theoretical understanding, I recommend looking at the original papers by Yann LeCun on convolutional networks. The book "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville is also a staple, providing a rigorous treatment of these and related concepts. These sources should provide the needed foundation for you to build and debug your networks effectively. Remember that practice is crucial, so start experimenting with these layers yourself to truly get the feel for them. It’s the only way it really clicks.
