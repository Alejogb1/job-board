Alright,  You're running into a classic problem with IntelliJ plugin development, specifically, misbehaving file paths at runtime. It's a pain point I've encountered more than once, especially when dealing with custom file system access or resource loading. It usually manifests itself as your plugin throwing `filenotfoundexception` or failing to properly interact with project files, and the root cause is often an incorrect path being constructed or used within the plugin's execution context. Here's how I've typically approached this problem, drawing from my experience building several IntelliJ plugins.

The key issue arises from the difference between the development environment and the runtime environment within the IDE. During development, resources are typically accessed relative to the project’s source structure. However, when a plugin is packaged and deployed within IntelliJ, its resources and files are handled differently. The plugin is essentially a jar file, and its contents are accessible through class loaders and various IntelliJ APIs. This often leads to hardcoded file paths breaking down at runtime. It's not enough to just use `new File("myfile.txt")` or a similarly relative approach; we need to be more deliberate about how we resolve resource locations.

The first step is to diagnose where the incorrect path is coming from. Start with thorough logging—every place you're constructing or using a file path should log the path being used. Use `logger.info("File path being used: " + path);`, using your appropriate logger object, of course. This alone often reveals the problem. It may be that the path is being created relative to the plugin’s install directory instead of within the project space, or perhaps a resource you're loading is using an absolute path from your development environment.

Secondly, avoid using absolute paths. Always strive for paths relative to the project, or, for resources bundled within your plugin, load them via the classloader. This is especially important for shared configuration files or template files that your plugin might use. IntelliJ's API provides several utilities to navigate the project structure. Specifically, the `virtualfile` API is your friend here; it gives you access to virtual representations of files that IntelliJ manages, allowing you to construct paths relative to project context, and handle file system abstractions more uniformly.

Now, let's get to the code. Here are three illustrative snippets demonstrating different approaches:

**Example 1: Accessing Project Files**

Let's say you're trying to read a configuration file within the project's `.idea` directory. Directly constructing a file path might work in your development environment but will likely fail at runtime. Here's a better approach:

```java
import com.intellij.openapi.project.Project;
import com.intellij.openapi.vfs.VirtualFile;
import com.intellij.openapi.vfs.VirtualFileManager;

public class ConfigLoader {

    public String loadConfig(Project project) {
        if (project == null) {
           return null;
        }

        VirtualFile projectDir = project.getBaseDir();
        if (projectDir == null) {
           return null;
        }


        VirtualFile ideaDir = projectDir.findChild(".idea");
         if (ideaDir == null) {
           return null;
        }

        VirtualFile configFile = ideaDir.findChild("myplugin.config");
        if (configFile == null) {
             return null;
        }
        

        try {
            // You could also do something else instead of this; it reads the content of the file
            return new String(configFile.contentsToByteArray());
        } catch (java.io.IOException e) {
            //Handle the io exception appropriately, logging it is a good idea
            return null;
        }

    }
}
```

In this example, we're using `project.getBaseDir()` to get the project's root directory as a `VirtualFile`. Then we're using its `findChild()` method to traverse to the .idea directory and then to a configuration file. This way you're working with project structure understood by IntelliJ, and are avoiding direct file path construction.

**Example 2: Accessing Plugin Resources**

If you have resources packaged within your plugin jar, use `classloader.getresourceasstream` to load them:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;


public class ResourceLoader {


     public String loadResourceAsString(String resourcePath) {
          InputStream inputStream =  this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(resourcePath);

        if (inputStream == null) {
          return null;
        }


        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream))) {
            return reader.lines().collect(Collectors.joining(System.lineSeparator()));
        }
       catch (java.io.IOException e) {
            //Handle the IO exception appropriately
            return null;
        }
     }
}

```

Here, we use the class loader associated with the `ResourceLoader` class to get an input stream to the resource. The `resourcePath` should be relative to the package structure of your plugin, for example,  `"META-INF/templates/my_template.txt"`. Notice I'm using try-with-resources to handle closing of resources.

**Example 3: File Operations Within the Plugin's Context**

Sometimes, plugins need to create or modify temporary files within a managed directory. Relying on user directories isn’t reliable. IntelliJ provides a dedicated location for this purpose.

```java
import com.intellij.openapi.application.PathManager;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileHandler {
    public boolean writeToFile(String fileName, String content) {
       File pluginDataDir = new File(PathManager.getPluginTempPath(), "myplugin");
       if (!pluginDataDir.exists()) {
           pluginDataDir.mkdirs();
       }

      File tempFile = new File(pluginDataDir, fileName);


       try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(tempFile))) {
            writer.write(content);
            return true;
        } catch (IOException e) {
            return false; // handle it appropriately as needed
        }
    }
}

```
This uses `PathManager.getPluginTempPath()` to obtain a reliable path for plugin-specific temporary files. The subsequent directory construction and file creation ensures the file is created predictably within the plugins execution context.

For further in-depth study, I recommend consulting the following resources:

1.  **"Developing IntelliJ IDEA Plugins" by Kirill Skrygan**: This book offers a comprehensive overview of plugin development, covering file system access, resource loading, and other pertinent topics. It’s an excellent practical guide with numerous examples.
2.  **The IntelliJ Platform SDK Documentation**: IntelliJ’s official documentation is crucial. Specifically, sections on the `com.intellij.openapi.vfs` and `com.intellij.openapi.application` packages are relevant to managing files and resources correctly. Dive deep into the `VirtualFile` and `PathManager` APIs.
3. **Java's Classloader Documentation**: Understanding how the classloader works is essential for resource loading. The Oracle Java documentation explains this thoroughly.

The most critical aspect of addressing incorrect file paths is to move away from hardcoded paths, use the provided APIs, and be conscious of the plugin's runtime environment. Be sure to log and inspect your paths during development, to catch such issues early. These techniques and knowledge points I've described should put you on the path to resolving this issue effectively. Good luck!
