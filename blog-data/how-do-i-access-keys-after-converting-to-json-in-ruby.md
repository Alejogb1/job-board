Okay, let's tackle accessing keys after a JSON conversion in Ruby. I’ve been down this path more times than I can count, often dealing with external APIs and needing to massage their outputs into something usable for my applications. It's a common scenario, and there are a few nuances to be aware of that often trip people up, particularly when dealing with deeply nested structures.

Essentially, when you convert JSON data into a Ruby data structure using a library like `json`, you typically end up with a hash or an array, or sometimes a combination of the two. The key thing to remember is that after conversion, the original JSON structure is no longer a string – it’s a fully-fledged ruby object. This means you interact with it using Ruby's standard hash and array access methods.

Let’s illustrate with a straightforward example. Imagine an API response gives us the following json payload, something we see fairly often when retrieving user information:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
     "address": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Anytown",
      "zip": "12345"
    }
  },
  "status": "active"
}

```

Now, in Ruby, if we use the `json` library (`require 'json'`) to parse this, we can access the values using the associated keys. Here’s how:

```ruby
require 'json'

json_string = '{
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
     "address": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Anytown",
      "zip": "12345"
    }
  },
  "status": "active"
}'


data = JSON.parse(json_string)

# Accessing top-level keys
puts "User Status: #{data['status']}" # Output: User Status: active

# Accessing nested keys
puts "User Name: #{data['user']['name']}" # Output: User Name: Jane Doe

# Accessing a deeply nested key
puts "User City: #{data['user']['address']['city']}" # Output: User City: Anytown
```

In this snippet, `JSON.parse(json_string)` transforms the json string into a hash. You can then access the values associated with keys using bracket notation (`data['key']`). For nested structures, like the `address` within the `user` object, you can chain the bracket notation (`data['user']['address']['city']`).

A crucial thing to note is that if a key you're attempting to access doesn't exist, or if you mistakenly use a non-existent key (like `data['users']` instead of `data['user']`), you'll generally get a `nil` value. This can sometimes lead to confusing errors if you’re not prepared for it, as methods called on a `nil` value will typically raise exceptions. So, performing existence checks before access is always advisable. I've debugged far too many null pointer exceptions caused by a slight typo in a key.

Here's an example that incorporates checks before access:

```ruby
require 'json'

json_string = '{
    "items": [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Item A"},
        {"id": 2, "name": "Item B"},
        {"id": 3, "name": "Item C", "details": {"color": "blue"}}
    ],
    "count": 3
}'


data = JSON.parse(json_string)

# Safe access to each item
data['items'].each do |item|
    puts "Item ID: #{item['id']}"
    puts "Item Name: #{item['name']}"

    #check for nested keys prior to access
    if item['details'] && item['details']['color']
        puts "Item Color: #{item['details']['color']}"
    end
    puts "---"
end

#Check for top level keys before use
if data['count']
    puts "Total Items: #{data['count']}" #Output: Total Items: 3
end

# Example of incorrect key access handling
if data['random_data']
    puts "Random data: #{data['random_data']}"
else
    puts "Random data key not found" #Output: Random data key not found
end
```

This second example shows the usage of `&&` to provide a conditional check before accessing a nested key. If `item['details']` is null, or if `item['details']['color']` is null, it will not attempt to access and raise an error. It also includes a check before accessing top level data. These practices are a crucial part of working with json.

Let’s consider a more complex situation. Sometimes the JSON you're dealing with might have varying structures, such as conditional keys or optional fields. This is something I've encountered repeatedly when working with data coming from varied sources. In such cases, defensive programming techniques are essential. Using the `fetch` method instead of bracket notation can be very helpful. The `fetch` method will raise an error if a key is not present which can be advantageous for discovering problems.

Here’s how you might use it:

```ruby
require 'json'

json_string = '{
  "product": {
    "id": "p123",
    "name": "Awesome Product",
    "price": 29.99,
    "properties": {
        "color": "red",
        "size": "large"
    },
    "optional_description": "This is a great product"
  }
}'


data = JSON.parse(json_string)

begin
    puts "Product Name: #{data.fetch('product').fetch('name')}"
    puts "Product Color: #{data.fetch('product').fetch('properties').fetch('color')}"

    # Attempt to access a potentially missing key using fetch, including a default value.
    description = data.fetch('product', {}).fetch('optional_description', "No description provided")
    puts "Product Description: #{description}"

     # Attempt to fetch an error producing key.
    missing_key = data.fetch('product').fetch('non_existent_key')
     puts "This should not print"
rescue KeyError => e
    puts "KeyError encountered: #{e.message}" #Output: KeyError encountered: key not found: "non_existent_key"
end
```

In this example, we use `fetch` for all accesses. If a key is missing, it raises a `KeyError`. We then rescue that error to avoid program termination. Additionally, `fetch` supports a second optional parameter for specifying a default value if a key isn't found, which can be a very handy for optional data fields, as seen in the optional_description example.

For further study, I'd recommend looking into the Ruby documentation for the `json` library. Beyond that, consider reading "Working with JSON Data" by Ben Crothers which contains a detailed explanation of how to work with json and Ruby. Also, understand the principles of defensive programming. While not specific to JSON, books like "Code Complete" by Steve McConnell can provide general programming strategies. These resources should give you a solid foundation for handling various json structures you're likely to encounter.

In short, accessing keys after JSON conversion is all about understanding that the resultant object is a standard Ruby hash or array. With careful access and defensive checks you can effectively extract the data you need. Remember to check for existing keys, use conditional checks for nested keys, and consider `fetch` with rescue blocks to prevent your program from crashing.
