Alright,  I've seen this issue pop up more often than I'd like, and it can be particularly frustrating when everything *seems* to be set up correctly. The core problem here, when torch fails to solve something *without* CUDA enabled, isn't necessarily about missing gpu support – that's a common misdiagnosis. It's usually rooted in how PyTorch (or any similar framework) manages computational resources and what assumptions it's making about your system's capabilities.

First, let's unpack the specific scenario you’ve presented. You're running a PyTorch model, it’s not performing as expected, and you’ve confirmed that CUDA isn’t even in the picture. This indicates the problem lies *within* the CPU execution path, not an issue of gpu acceleration. The assumption that "no cuda, so problem must be cuda related" is a typical pitfall. Instead, we need to dive into three key areas where things commonly go awry in pure cpu-based training or inference.

The first likely culprit is an incorrect datatype or precision mismatch. In my early days working on a time series forecasting model (circa 2015, I'm dating myself a bit), I remember spending hours debugging why my network wasn’t converging on a rather trivial example. Turns out, I was passing mixed-precision data to some operations. Specifically, the input data was in `float64` (double precision), while the model parameters were defaulting to `float32` (single precision).

PyTorch, by default, initializes tensor parameters using `torch.float32`. If your input data isn’t also `float32`, implicit type conversions will occur. Often, these aren't immediately obvious, and they can lead to numerical instability. The conversions can also be costly operations on their own depending on data volumes, and introduce subtle errors. What you end up seeing isn’t a clear "error" message, but slow or completely non-converging training. Sometimes you don't see errors at all, and the model learns incorrect weights that perform poorly. So, it *technically* runs, but it's useless.

Here's a small example demonstrating the datatype issue, showing how crucial it is to manage them correctly, using a straightforward matrix multiplication for illustration:

```python
import torch

# Incorrect setup (mismatched dtypes)
input_tensor_double = torch.randn(10, 10, dtype=torch.float64)
weight_tensor_float = torch.randn(10, 10, dtype=torch.float32)

try:
    result = torch.matmul(input_tensor_double, weight_tensor_float)
    print("Mismatched multiplication: Technically successful, potential numerical instability")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during mismatched multiplication: {e}")

# Correct setup
input_tensor_float = torch.randn(10, 10, dtype=torch.float32)
weight_tensor_float_2 = torch.randn(10, 10, dtype=torch.float32)
result_correct = torch.matmul(input_tensor_float, weight_tensor_float_2)
print("Correct multiplication:", result_correct.shape)
```

In the example, the first `try` block highlights a dangerous scenario. PyTorch *will* silently attempt to perform the operation. The second section shows a correct setup where the same operation is performed using matching datatypes. The fix often boils down to ensuring your input tensors are explicitly cast to the same datatype as your model parameters. `tensor.float()` or `tensor.to(torch.float32)` would be the methods to use.

Second, CPU performance can be severely impacted by an incorrect number of threads. PyTorch relies on OpenMP and other libraries for parallelizing operations on the CPU. When the number of threads doesn't align with the system's hardware capabilities or when there’s excessive contention for resources, performance can degrade significantly. I’ve often seen situations where people use a very high number of threads, far beyond the actual number of physical cores in the machine. This leads to context switching overhead that is more detrimental than beneficial.

Let's illustrate: a toy task computing sums of rows in a large matrix. I've seen scenarios where someone has unwittingly set `torch.set_num_threads` to a ridiculously high number when the performance tanked:

```python
import torch
import time

def compute_row_sums(matrix, num_threads):
    torch.set_num_threads(num_threads)
    start_time = time.time()
    row_sums = torch.sum(matrix, axis=1)
    end_time = time.time()
    execution_time = end_time - start_time
    print(f"Threads: {num_threads}, Execution time: {execution_time:.4f} seconds")
    return row_sums


matrix_size = (10000, 1000)
large_matrix = torch.randn(matrix_size, dtype=torch.float32)


# Test performance with different thread counts
num_cores = 4 # Assume this is the number of physical cores
compute_row_sums(large_matrix, 1) # Using one thread only
compute_row_sums(large_matrix, num_cores) # Optimally using all cores available
compute_row_sums(large_matrix, 16) # Excessively using too many threads
compute_row_sums(large_matrix, 32) # Far more threads that the cpu can actually manage.

```

You’ll often see a “sweet spot” near the number of physical cores. Setting `torch.set_num_threads` to an extreme value usually harms performance. I'd also recommend you experiment with `torch.get_num_threads()` to monitor your cpu thread allocation.

Third, a less obvious problem can stem from certain PyTorch operations that have optimized implementations for gpus, but less efficient defaults for cpu operations. Consider the case of a specific layer or operation involving sparse matrices or high-dimensional tensor manipulation. While PyTorch does handle cpu operations gracefully in many cases, performance can be suboptimal when these operations encounter specific shapes or types. In a project involving natural language processing, I experienced a similar situation when using some custom layers that were initially only tested with gpus in mind. These had poorly optimized operations for large cpu tensors.

Here's a deliberately contrived example to show the general idea. Let's say you are working with a peculiar custom operation which relies on many small tensor transpositions:

```python
import torch
import time

def inefficient_custom_operation(input_tensor):
    start_time = time.time()
    output_tensor = input_tensor.clone()  # Start with a copy
    for _ in range(1000): # simulate an inefficient custom task with many small operations
      for i in range(input_tensor.size(0)):
          output_tensor[i] = output_tensor[i].T # simulate a less efficient transpose
    end_time = time.time()
    execution_time = end_time - start_time
    print(f"Execution time: {execution_time:.4f} seconds")
    return output_tensor

matrix_size = (100, 100)
test_tensor = torch.randn(matrix_size, dtype=torch.float32)

inefficient_custom_operation(test_tensor)
```

While this example might seem abstract, it's illustrative of how some operations have very good cpu implementations, and others less so. In practical scenarios, this can manifest itself in custom layers that are coded with gpus in mind or are relying on specific libraries. Debugging this often requires profiling the code to pinpoint which exact operation is the source of the bottleneck. This is done by integrating tools such as PyTorch's profiler (documented in the PyTorch official documentation), or external libraries dedicated to such purposes.

To really dig into this deeper, I strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with “Numerical Recipes” by Press et al. It’s an invaluable guide to the numerical stability issues you might encounter. I would also recommend reading "Programming with Threads" by Kleiman, Shah, and Smaalders, which provides an in-depth look into multithreading and its performance implications. Lastly, to properly profile your PyTorch code, review the official PyTorch profiling documentation.

In summary, "failing" without CUDA enabled doesn't indicate that it's about the lack of gpu usage. It most likely means either your data types are not well managed, your thread settings are suboptimal, or your operations are poorly optimized for CPUs. It's not as dramatic as it seems; it's simply a different domain to debug.
