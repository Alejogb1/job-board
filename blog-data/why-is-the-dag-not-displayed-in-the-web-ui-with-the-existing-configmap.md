Alright, let's tackle this. I've seen this particular issue pop up a few times throughout my years—and it’s almost always down to a handful of common culprits when a dag isn't showing up in the web ui, despite what appears to be a correctly configured configmap. I distinctly remember one project where we spent a frustrating afternoon tracking down the root cause, and it turned out to be an innocuous-looking configuration oversight. It’s usually not a single dramatic failure, but rather a combination of factors. Let’s get into the specifics.

First off, remember that the web ui essentially ‘discovers’ dags through the airflow scheduler which, in turn, reads configuration data. If the scheduler isn’t picking up changes from the configmap, or is misinterpreting the configurations, no dags will appear in the user interface.

The primary cause often revolves around how airflow is configured to find your dag files. While you might have meticulously set up a configmap with what *should* be the correct path, it’s crucial to verify the underlying environment variables airflow uses. Specifically, `airflow.cfg` (often mapped through configmaps), dictates the `dags_folder` location. This setting tells the scheduler where to look for dag definitions. A frequent pitfall is inconsistency. For example, the configmap may specify `/opt/airflow/dags`, but the docker container airflow is running in might be configured to look in `/usr/local/airflow/dags`, especially when running on Kubernetes. They need to align precisely.

Let's look at a code example. Assume that we have a standard airflow setup, with dags deployed via a kubernetes environment. Here's a snippet showing how a common *incorrect* mapping might look in a kubernetes configmap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: airflow-config
data:
  airflow.cfg: |
    [core]
    dags_folder = /opt/airflow/dags  #Incorrect path
    executor = KubernetesExecutor
    sql_alchemy_conn = postgres://airflow:airflow@airflow-postgres/airflow
    
```

And here's how the airflow deployment might be configured, specifically for our scheduler:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: airflow-scheduler
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: airflow-scheduler
        image: apache/airflow:2.8.1
        env:
          - name: AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR
            value: KubernetesExecutor
        volumeMounts:
        - name: airflow-config
          mountPath: /opt/airflow/airflow.cfg #Mounted, but ignored if set by configmap
          subPath: airflow.cfg
        - name: dags-volume
          mountPath: /usr/local/airflow/dags # Correct path for container
      volumes:
      - name: airflow-config
        configMap:
          name: airflow-config
      - name: dags-volume
        emptyDir: {}
```

Notice how the *configmap specifies* `/opt/airflow/dags`, while our scheduler container's volume mount is targeting `/usr/local/airflow/dags`. If you've populated your DAGs in `/usr/local/airflow/dags`, the scheduler will never find them, since it's looking in the incorrect path as configured in the configmap. A common fix?

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: airflow-config
data:
  airflow.cfg: |
    [core]
    dags_folder = /usr/local/airflow/dags  #Corrected path
    executor = KubernetesExecutor
    sql_alchemy_conn = postgres://airflow:airflow@airflow-postgres/airflow
```

This adjustment ensures the `dags_folder` matches the *actual* location where DAG files reside inside the container. It seems basic, but you’d be surprised how often this mismatch is the culprit.

Another key point is file format and syntax. Airflow expects DAG definitions to be valid python files with a `.py` extension. Any other file extensions or syntax errors within these files can cause the scheduler to fail to load dags properly. These issues often manifest as cryptic errors in the scheduler logs. If even one dag fails to load, Airflow, by default, will not display any dags, even valid ones. So, checking the logs for "Failed to import dag" type messages is crucial. Ensure you're running `python -m compileall` on your dag directory.

Here's an example of a common syntax error within a DAG file. This dag definition is valid, but it has an indentation error in the task definition:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
  dag_id='my_broken_dag',
  schedule=None,
  start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26),
  catchup=False
) as dag:
  task_1 = BashOperator(
    task_id='task_1',
      bash_command='echo "hello"' #notice the syntax error here
  )
```

This indentation error will cause the scheduler to fail to load the dag, and since, the default behaviour is to suppress the visibility of all dags in such a circumstance, the web UI will be blank. A correct version:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
  dag_id='my_working_dag',
  schedule=None,
  start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26),
  catchup=False
) as dag:
  task_1 = BashOperator(
    task_id='task_1',
    bash_command='echo "hello"'
  )
```

It’s also worth checking if your DAGs have explicit `dag_id` values declared. Although you might think airflow would use filename as the dag_id, it will only do so if a dag_id is not explicitly declared. When deploying and troubleshooting this it's better to explicitly set the `dag_id` to avoid this kind of ambiguity, especially in scenarios where you might rename or reorganize file structures.

Finally, if using a `KubernetesExecutor`, ensure the necessary permissions are granted for the scheduler pod to access the dag files, particularly if you're using persistent volumes. In Kubernetes, the `dags-volume` above would normally be backed by a `PersistentVolumeClaim` that references a `PersistentVolume`, and this PV and PVC would require suitable permissions depending on your storage provider. Often this can be related to a subtle configuration issue in the deployment where the scheduler might not have the access rights to the dags on the configured volume, thereby not being able to load them at all. While this doesn’t directly relate to configmap issues, it's a crucial aspect in a Kubernetes environment that can cause the same symptom – an empty dag list in the web interface.

For a more thorough understanding of Airflow configuration, I strongly recommend reviewing the official Airflow documentation. The "Configuration Reference" section (available on the Apache Airflow website) provides a deep dive into each setting. Also, the "Running Airflow in Kubernetes" guide is invaluable if your setup involves Kubernetes. For a broader understanding of configuration management on Kubernetes, "Kubernetes in Action" by Marko Lukša provides a detailed, well-organized approach. Specifically, chapters relating to volume management and resource configuration are very relevant. Finally, delving into the source code itself (available on GitHub) can often uncover nuanced behaviour that might not be immediately apparent in the documentation.

In summary, when a dag doesn't show up despite a seemingly correct configmap, it’s often a case of one or more of these issues coming together: incorrect `dags_folder` mapping, syntax errors in dag files, lack of `dag_id` declaration, or permissions issues in the Kubernetes environment. Debugging usually involves systematically checking the scheduler logs, verifying your configuration maps, and ensuring dag file integrity. Don't forget the basics, the devil is often in the details.
