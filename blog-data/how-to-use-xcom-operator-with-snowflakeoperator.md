Alright, let's talk about orchestrating tasks between Apache Airflow, specifically using the `SnowflakeOperator`, and how to effectively leverage XCOM (cross-communication) to pass data between them. This is a pattern I’ve seen repeatedly, and getting it smooth really unlocks some complex workflows. I've had my fair share of headaches debugging poorly implemented pipelines, so I'm happy to share the solutions that have consistently worked.

The core issue here is often about passing information between task instances within an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). The `SnowflakeOperator`, after it executes a query, produces results which, more often than not, you need in subsequent tasks. This is where XCOM comes into play, allowing you to exchange small amounts of data—think strings, numbers, small lists, and dictionaries—between tasks.

The default behavior of the `SnowflakeOperator` doesn’t automatically push its query results to XCOM. It mainly returns execution metadata. To capture the actual query results, you need a specific setup within your operator and subsequent tasks. Here's how we typically approach this. First, we modify the `SnowflakeOperator` to return a specific value—often a JSON representation of the result—that we can later fetch using XCOM.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.snowflake.operators.snowflake import SnowflakeOperator
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import json

def extract_data_from_snowflake(**kwargs):
    ti = kwargs['ti']
    query_results = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='snowflake_task', key='return_value')
    if query_results:
        # Process the results further
        # For instance, print some extracted data for verification
        first_row = query_results[0]
        print(f"First row data extracted: {first_row}")
        # Further manipulation of the results can happen here.
        # Return the modified results if needed for downstream tasks
        return query_results
    else:
        print("No data returned from SnowflakeOperator.")
        return None

with DAG(
    dag_id='snowflake_xcom_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    snowflake_task = SnowflakeOperator(
        task_id='snowflake_task',
        snowflake_conn_id='snowflake_default', # Replace with your actual connection id
        sql="SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 123 as my_number;",
        do_xcom_push=True
    )

    process_data_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='process_data',
        python_callable=extract_data_from_snowflake
    )

    snowflake_task >> process_data_task
```
In this example, the critical part is `do_xcom_push=True` in the `SnowflakeOperator`. When set to true, the `SnowflakeOperator` will automatically push its query results to xcom under the default key of `return_value`, or a custom key if defined in `xcom_push_key`. The `extract_data_from_snowflake` python operator function then pulls this information by accessing the Task Instance (ti) and using `ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='snowflake_task', key='return_value')`..
This `return_value` is crucial. Without it, you’d be pulling metadata, not the results themselves.

Let’s build upon that. Suppose you need to pass multiple result sets or complex data from your Snowflake query. The `do_xcom_push=True` setting on its own won’t be enough as it handles pushing a single returned value in default `return_value` XCOM key. You can achieve more control by crafting a custom python callable function to execute your snowflake query and prepare your data for xcom. This is extremely useful for extracting different data sets from multiple queries and passing to different downstream tasks:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.snowflake.hooks.snowflake import SnowflakeHook
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import json


def execute_and_extract_snowflake_data(**kwargs):
    snowflake_hook = SnowflakeHook(snowflake_conn_id='snowflake_default') # Replace with your actual connection id

    query_1 = "SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 123 as my_number;"
    query_2 = "SELECT 'test' as my_text, 456 as my_other_number;"

    query_1_results = snowflake_hook.get_records(query_1)
    query_2_results = snowflake_hook.get_records(query_2)

    ti = kwargs['ti']
    ti.xcom_push(key='query_1_data', value=query_1_results)
    ti.xcom_push(key='query_2_data', value=query_2_results)

def consume_query_1_data(**kwargs):
    ti = kwargs['ti']
    query_1_data = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='snowflake_query_task', key='query_1_data')
    if query_1_data:
        print(f"Query 1 results: {query_1_data}")
    else:
         print("Query 1 data not found")
def consume_query_2_data(**kwargs):
    ti = kwargs['ti']
    query_2_data = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='snowflake_query_task', key='query_2_data')
    if query_2_data:
        print(f"Query 2 results: {query_2_data}")
    else:
         print("Query 2 data not found")

with DAG(
    dag_id='snowflake_xcom_custom_push',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:

    snowflake_query_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='snowflake_query_task',
        python_callable=execute_and_extract_snowflake_data
    )

    consume_query_1_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='consume_query_1_task',
        python_callable=consume_query_1_data
    )

    consume_query_2_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='consume_query_2_task',
        python_callable=consume_query_2_data
    )


    snowflake_query_task >> [consume_query_1_task, consume_query_2_task]

```

Here, instead of using `SnowflakeOperator`, we use a `SnowflakeHook`, which is what `SnowflakeOperator` uses internally to connect to Snowflake. In `execute_and_extract_snowflake_data`, we execute multiple queries and then use `ti.xcom_push()` multiple times, with each `key` having a different data set associated to it. Now downstream tasks can access each specific data set using specific keys. This approach grants far more granular control over what data is made available via XCOM. It's particularly useful when different subsequent tasks need different parts of the data.

Lastly, consider the situation where your Snowflake query returns a large result set. Pushing very large datasets into XCOM can impact performance and is generally not recommended. XCOM is more suited to passing small amounts of metadata or identifiers. For extensive data volumes, it’s wiser to use external storage options like S3 or Azure Blob Storage and pass the storage path via XCOM. Then, downstream tasks can access the data from the respective storage. Let's illustrate this:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.snowflake.operators.snowflake import SnowflakeOperator
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import json
import pandas as pd
import boto3
from io import StringIO

def snowflake_to_s3(**kwargs):
    ti = kwargs['ti']
    snowflake_hook = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='snowflake_to_dataframe', key='return_value')
    # Assume we have snowflake cursor as dataframe
    df = pd.DataFrame(snowflake_hook)
    # save to s3
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    csv_buffer = StringIO()
    df.to_csv(csv_buffer, index=False)
    bucket_name = 'your-s3-bucket-name' # Replace with your actual bucket name
    file_name = f'snowflake_data/snowflake_output_{datetime.now()}.csv'
    s3_client.put_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_name, Body=csv_buffer.getvalue())
    ti.xcom_push(key='s3_file_path', value=f's3://{bucket_name}/{file_name}')
def s3_to_process(**kwargs):
    ti = kwargs['ti']
    file_path = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='snowflake_to_s3_task',key='s3_file_path')
    print(f"Processing file {file_path}")
    # Download file from s3 and process data.

with DAG(
    dag_id='snowflake_xcom_s3_example',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:

    snowflake_to_dataframe = SnowflakeOperator(
    task_id='snowflake_to_dataframe',
    snowflake_conn_id='snowflake_default', # Replace with your actual connection id
    sql="SELECT * FROM your_large_snowflake_table", # Replace with your actual query
    do_xcom_push=True
)
    snowflake_to_s3_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='snowflake_to_s3_task',
        python_callable=snowflake_to_s3
    )
    s3_to_process_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='s3_to_process_task',
        python_callable=s3_to_process
    )


    snowflake_to_dataframe >> snowflake_to_s3_task >> s3_to_process_task
```
Here, the `SnowflakeOperator` pushes data as dataframe into XCOM by using `do_xcom_push=True`, then the `snowflake_to_s3` PythonOperator function converts data into csv, saves data to s3 bucket and pushes the s3 path into xcom. The subsequent task `s3_to_process_task` simply grabs this file path from xcom and can process the data in place using boto library. This keeps the load off XCOM and maintains the efficiency of your pipeline.

For further depth on these topics, I recommend exploring the Apache Airflow documentation, particularly the sections on operators, hooks, and XCOM. Specifically, the documentation relating to the `providers.snowflake` package will be helpful for the `SnowflakeOperator`. For a more theoretical perspective on data workflows, "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann provides an excellent foundation. Finally, for in-depth guidance on building robust, scalable systems, look into resources on distributed system architectures.

In summary, effective use of XCOM with the `SnowflakeOperator` is about understanding the operator's behavior and choosing the right strategy for passing data based on volume and context. Simple queries? `do_xcom_push=True` might be sufficient. Need more control or multiple data sets? Use a Python callable with `ti.xcom_push()`. Large data sets? Use external storage and pass file paths. These are the core techniques that have helped me build resilient and effective workflows.
