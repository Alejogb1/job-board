Alright, let’s tackle this. It's a question that's certainly tripped up a few people, and I recall encountering it firsthand during a particularly complex text analysis project a couple of years back. I was working on a large corpus of legal documents, and seeing those seemingly impossible relative frequencies pop up from `dfm_weight()` in `quanteda` threw me for a loop initially. Let's break down why this happens, avoiding some of the common misinterpretations, and get to the core mechanisms of how the weighting works.

The core confusion, as I’ve often seen, stems from a misunderstanding of how `dfm_weight()` with the `scheme = "relfreq"` parameter actually computes relative frequencies. People often assume it’s simply term frequency divided by the total number of *terms* in the document. This is not quite accurate. Instead, what `quanteda` does, is calculate term frequency divided by the *maximum* term frequency within that document. It's subtle but makes a critical difference. Let's clarify this with examples.

First, consider that `dfm_weight(x, scheme = "relfreq")` is fundamentally designed to normalize the term frequencies within a document, making terms that appear more frequently within a specific document more prominent, but not directly making documents comparable. This normalization aims to counteract variations in document length, which can unduly influence term frequency counts. Let's dive into the mechanics with some code.

**Example 1: Basic relative frequency calculation**

Let’s create a simple document-term matrix (dfm) and apply the relative frequency scheme. I'll use `quanteda` functions for demonstration. Assume we have two short documents.

```r
library(quanteda)

text_data <- c("apple banana apple", "banana cherry banana")

# Create a dfm
dfm_matrix <- dfm(text_data)
print(dfm_matrix)

# Apply relative frequency weighting
relfreq_matrix <- dfm_weight(dfm_matrix, scheme = "relfreq")
print(relfreq_matrix)
```
In this case, ‘banana’ in the second document, which appears twice while other terms appear once, will be weighted at 1, while ‘cherry’ will have a weight of 0.5. Similarly, ‘apple’ in the first document will have a weight of 1. This occurs because in each document, the term with the highest frequency is set as the basis for normalization. When there are ties in max frequencies, each corresponding term receives a 1.

**Why not just divide by document length?**

Dividing by the total terms in a document *would* give you the true relative frequency if the goal is to understand term proportion within a document. However, `dfm_weight(scheme = "relfreq")` is designed differently, and this approach emphasizes relative term importance within each document, by how prominent they are, rather than proportions. Consider, for example, two documents, one 1000 words long and another 10. A term occurring 10 times in the 1000-word document might have a low 'true' relative frequency (0.01), even if it's a crucial term within that document. The chosen approach by quanteda makes that term, despite a low absolute proportional frequency, have a significant relative weight (normalized to a max of 1 within that document). I've found this particularly useful when analysing texts with great length differences.

**Example 2: The impact of different term frequencies**

Now let's introduce slightly more complexity to emphasize my earlier point regarding emphasis:

```r
text_data2 <- c("apple banana apple apple apple", "banana cherry banana banana")
dfm_matrix2 <- dfm(text_data2)
print(dfm_matrix2)

relfreq_matrix2 <- dfm_weight(dfm_matrix2, scheme = "relfreq")
print(relfreq_matrix2)
```

Here, ‘apple’ in the first document, appearing four times (the maximum within the document), gets a weight of 1, as does 'banana' in the second document, appearing thrice (its maximum). 'Banana' in the first document will have the relative frequency, 1/4, or 0.25. 'Cherry', in the second, will be 1/3, or ~0.333. The relative frequencies are all scaled based on the max within the corresponding document.

**The crux of exceeding 1**

Now, the reason why you see values exceeding 1 is, well… you don't. The maximum value for "relfreq" weighting will always be 1. A common confusion arises when the `tf-idf` weighting scheme is applied after the relative frequency weighting. The "tf-idf" scheme (term frequency-inverse document frequency), when applied to a dfm that's already been weighted with relative frequency, can lead to values larger than 1. This isn't an issue with the "relfreq" scheme itself but is a consequence of how `tf-idf` combines within-document frequency with across-document inverse frequency. The term frequency component is based on the result of the relfreq step, while the inverse document frequency is calculated for each term as a result of its prevalence over the whole collection. This second component of the equation is not necessarily bounded by 1 and will often result in high values.

**Example 3: The impact of `tf-idf` weighting combined with relative frequency.**

Let's illustrate that process, building upon the previous examples.

```r
text_data3 <- c("apple banana apple apple apple", "banana cherry banana banana", "apple banana")

dfm_matrix3 <- dfm(text_data3)
print(dfm_matrix3)

relfreq_matrix3 <- dfm_weight(dfm_matrix3, scheme = "relfreq")
print(relfreq_matrix3)


tfidf_matrix3 <- dfm_weight(relfreq_matrix3, scheme = "tfidf")
print(tfidf_matrix3)
```

Notice how, after applying `scheme = "tfidf"`, the values are no longer bounded by 1. In this example, terms that are relatively common within a document but not across documents (high within-document frequency and low across-document frequency), such as ‘apple’ in the first document, will receive a higher weight compared to terms appearing more evenly across documents. This is the typical effect of `tf-idf`, and as such the relative frequencies are just the base for its computation.

**Recommendations and further study**

To delve deeper into these concepts, I’d strongly recommend looking into “Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing” by Manning and Schütze. It provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding term weighting schemes. Also, for practical implementation and examples, look at the `quanteda` package documentation directly on the CRAN archive, and for more information on tf-idf, see the paper, "A vector space model for automatic indexing" by Salton, G., Wong, A., & Yang, C. S. These resources should offer a comprehensive understanding and help clear up any further confusion.

In summary, the `relfreq` weighting scheme in `quanteda` computes term frequency divided by the maximum term frequency within a document, normalizing it between 0 and 1 and highlighting the relative importance of terms within that document. Values above 1 only occur after subsequent weighting schemes like `tf-idf` are applied and are a result of that scheme combining the relative frequency with a measure of cross-document term prevalence.
