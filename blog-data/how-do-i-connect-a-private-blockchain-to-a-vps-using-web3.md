Let's tackle this directly, shall we? I've seen this scenario play out more times than I can easily recall, often during the initial phases of proof-of-concept builds. Connecting a private blockchain to a virtual private server (vps) using web3 isn't fundamentally complex, but a few nuances can definitely trip you up. It's about understanding the network configurations, establishing the correct rpc endpoint communication, and properly configuring your web3 client. Let me walk you through it, as I've done countless times before with various projects.

The first crucial step revolves around the network accessibility of your private blockchain. Typically, these blockchains don't automatically open themselves to the public internet. They're often firewalled off or running on a local network. Think of a proof-of-authority network built for internal process management – you don't want external access to it, and it’s a common use case for this kind of work. Your vps needs a clear path to communicate with the blockchain's nodes, typically through a designated rpc endpoint.

Now, before you even start coding, be sure your vps's network settings are correctly configured. If your private blockchain is hosted on a separate machine in the same local network, ensure both the vps and the blockchain node share the same subnet and have network visibility. If the private blockchain is on a separate, more isolated network, you’ll need a secure mechanism like a vpn to establish connectivity. This is not something that happens through web3 directly; it's a prerequisite. This isn't a web3 problem; it's a network setup issue, and it's essential that it's correct before you get into the coding.

Once network connectivity is established, it’s all about configuring the web3 library. Regardless of whether you're using python, javascript, or another language, the basic principle remains the same. You initialize the web3 provider with the rpc endpoint of your blockchain node. This endpoint is the address and port through which you will send requests to the blockchain. It's usually something like `http://<blockchain_node_ip>:<port>`.

Let's explore how this unfolds in a few practical examples, using python, javascript, and go to illustrate.

**Example 1: Python using Web3.py**

```python
from web3 import Web3

# Replace with your blockchain node's RPC endpoint
rpc_endpoint = "http://192.168.1.100:8545" # Example IP and port

# Connect to the blockchain
try:
    w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(rpc_endpoint))
    if w3.is_connected():
        print("Connected to blockchain!")
        print(f"Latest block number: {w3.eth.block_number}")
    else:
        print("Failed to connect to blockchain.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Perform blockchain interactions (example)
if w3.is_connected():
    latest_block = w3.eth.get_block('latest')
    print(f"Latest block hash: {latest_block['hash'].hex()}")
```

Here, you're using the `Web3.HTTPProvider` to establish a connection to your node, and then using the `web3` object to perform tasks such as checking for connection, retrieving the latest block, and printing the block's hash. Before running, remember to install the `web3` library using `pip install web3`.

**Example 2: Javascript using web3.js**

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');

// Replace with your blockchain node's RPC endpoint
const rpc_endpoint = "http://192.168.1.100:8545"; // Example IP and port

// Connect to the blockchain
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(rpc_endpoint));

web3.eth.getBlockNumber()
  .then(blockNumber => {
    console.log("Connected to blockchain!");
    console.log("Latest block number:", blockNumber);
    return web3.eth.getBlock('latest');
  })
  .then(latestBlock => {
      console.log("Latest block hash:", latestBlock.hash);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
  });
```

This JavaScript example, using Node.js, utilizes `web3.js` to perform similar operations, making use of promises to handle asynchronous operations gracefully. To run this, you will need to install web3 using `npm install web3`.

**Example 3: Go using go-ethereum/ethclient**

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"math/big"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
)

func main() {
    // Replace with your blockchain node's RPC endpoint
    rpc_endpoint := "http://192.168.1.100:8545" // Example IP and port

	// Connect to the blockchain
    client, err := ethclient.Dial(rpc_endpoint)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Failed to connect to the blockchain:", err)
	}
    fmt.Println("Connected to blockchain!")

	// Retrieve the latest block number
    blockNumber, err := client.BlockNumber(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("Failed to get latest block number:", err)
    }
	fmt.Printf("Latest block number: %d\n", blockNumber)
    
	// Retrieve the latest block
	block, err := client.BlockByNumber(context.Background(), nil) // nil means latest
	if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("Failed to get the latest block:", err)
    }

	fmt.Printf("Latest block hash: %x\n", block.Hash())
	

    // Example: Get balance
    accountAddress := common.HexToAddress("0xYourAccountAddress") // Replace with actual address
    balance, err := client.BalanceAt(context.Background(), accountAddress, nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to get balance: %v", err)
    }
	
	fmt.Printf("Balance of address %s: %d wei\n", accountAddress.Hex(), balance)
}
```

This Go example uses the `go-ethereum` client library to connect to the blockchain. It demonstrates connecting, retrieving the latest block, and showing how you can retrieve account balances, in contrast with just the block details in the prior examples. You'll need to have Go installed and the `go-ethereum` package downloaded (`go get github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum`).

Each of these examples illustrates the same fundamental concept: providing the correct rpc endpoint to your web3 library. It’s worth mentioning here that while these are functional examples, production code would need more robust error handling, security considerations, and potentially the use of secure protocols like wss for sensitive data transmission. The endpoint, for instance, should probably use https if possible when dealing with publicly accessible nodes. This becomes essential when you move beyond development and start handling real transactions.

For more in-depth knowledge, I would strongly recommend looking at the documentation for `web3.py`, `web3.js` and `go-ethereum/ethclient` depending on your chosen language. These resources are invaluable for understanding each library's capabilities and configuration options. For a more general understanding of blockchain networks, "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopoulos and "Programming Ethereum" by Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood offer foundational knowledge that is extremely relevant when you are trying to integrate with a private blockchain environment. Moreover, research papers on rpc standards in blockchains will help deepen your grasp on the communication protocols being used. Remember that there is no "one-size-fits-all" approach. Always adapt the method that fits your particular setup.

The key takeaway from all of this is that the "how" isn't too different from connecting to public networks, what differs is the "where," i.e. the necessity of correct network connectivity and the corresponding endpoint. Your vps needs to be on speaking terms with your blockchain node. Once you nail the network configuration and get the proper web3 client setup with your rpc endpoint, it's just a matter of working through the specific interactions with your blockchain using the standard web3 apis.
