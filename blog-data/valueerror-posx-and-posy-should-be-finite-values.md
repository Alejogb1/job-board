Alright listen up I've seen this `ValueError posx and posy should be finite values` more times than I care to admit It's a classic and it usually means you've messed up somewhere with your coordinate calculations or data handling It always comes back to those sneaky infinite or NaN values that can creep into your code.

So yeah it throws when you are expecting numerical coordinates to be finite but you pass in infinity or NaN values its common particularly when using libraries that deal with geometric figures or any operations that may divide by zero or use some function of a log where log zero can happen

I'm talking from experience here back in the day when I was working on a simulation for particle movement in a fluid I remember spending a whole day debugging something like this. We had a super complicated fluid dynamics code it was a mess of nested loops and array manipulations. The issue was somewhere inside the viscous force calculation there was a division by a variable which sometimes went to zero boom bam endless headaches and the same value error showed up in the debug logs. I finally tracked it down by putting a bunch of `assert` statements after any potential calculation that could yield infinite or NaN results it was painful but it fixed it. I still have nightmares thinking about those calculations.

The core problem with this `ValueError` is that those coordinates need to be a real number. The library function you are calling expects coordinates to be valid numbers so it can do its stuff like rendering them on a screen or calculating the distances. It throws an error because it is saying hey I do not have any mechanism to handle infinite and NaN values the coordinates given are not real numbers.

Usually the problem stems from one or more of these reasons

1 Data loading problems. The data file you are loading might have corrupted data or non-numerical values in the coordinate columns it is more common when loading data from CSV or other text files.

2 Mathematical error during a computation a division by zero or the log of zero or a square root of negative numbers can introduce the non finite numbers. Also some calculations may result in floating point overflow or underflow which can create infinities.

3 Data preprocessing errors maybe you have a bug in a cleaning or scaling step that turns a numerical data into a NaN for example if you have zero variance and you divide by it in scaling operations you will see that.

4 Incorrect library usage for example some libraries when setting parameters do some sanity checks on the inputs if those inputs are not correct the library can fail with such errors.

Here is a small example where we create an infinite value and see the exception

```python
import math

def bad_coordinate_calculation():
  x = 10 / 0  # Division by zero produces infinity
  return x, 5

try:
    x, y = bad_coordinate_calculation()
    print(f"Coordinate x:{x}, y:{y}")
    #Assume some code that fails like drawing it or passing it to a library
    #that needs finite numbers.
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"ValueError caught: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

This first code snippet shows how a simple division by zero can result in that pesky infinite number. And you also see how to catch the errors for debugging purpose this is a simple example but it gets the point across.

Here is another one this time lets show a more subtle error with the `math` library.

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def another_bad_coordinate():
    x = math.log(0) # Log of 0 is negative infinity
    y = math.sqrt(-1) # Square root of negative 1 gives NaN
    return x, y

try:
  x, y = another_bad_coordinate()
  print(f"Coordinate x:{x}, y:{y}")
  #Assume some code that fails like drawing it or passing it to a library
  #that needs finite numbers.
  print(np.isfinite(x), np.isnan(y))
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"ValueError caught: {e}")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

In the second code we are demonstrating that `math.log(0)` gives negative infinity which is not a valid number same goes for `math.sqrt(-1)` which will yield a `NaN` or not a number value. This kind of errors are harder to track because it is not a division by zero error you need to think carefully about what kind of edge cases your math operations might produce. Also we added a test for `isfinite` and `isnan` using numpy which is helpful to find these bad numbers.

And the final snippet lets show how a bad data can be the source of the issue.

```python
import numpy as np

def process_coordinates(data):
    x_values = data[:, 0]
    y_values = data[:, 1]
    x_values = x_values.astype(float)
    y_values = y_values.astype(float)
    return x_values, y_values

try:
    bad_data = np.array([['10','1'],['20','bad'],['30','3'] ])
    x_values,y_values = process_coordinates(bad_data)
    print(x_values, y_values)
    #Assume some code that fails like drawing it or passing it to a library
    #that needs finite numbers.
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"ValueError caught: {e}")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

Here we can see that the error occurs when we try to convert the `bad_data` to float the 'bad' string cannot be converted which will return NaN and also a ValueError. These can cause the problem since we expect all values to be numerical.

So how do we deal with this the best way to deal with these errors is to prevent them in the first place. Add a ton of assertions after any operation that you think it can result in NaN or infinity values that is the best way. Like I did back in my particle simulation days. Also log everything to a file that way when an error happens you have more data to analyze.

Here are some strategies I recommend

1 **Data validation** Check your data for NaN and infinite values before you use it. You can use numpy `np.isnan()` and `np.isinf()` to identify these values.

2 **Handle potential errors** Use try-except blocks to catch `ZeroDivisionError` or other math related errors that might produce NaNs or infinities. Then you can decide to skip the data point or assign some default or zero value.

3 **Check inputs** Some libraries have input validations. You need to carefully read the library documentation and input types. Also some libraries have some parameter that controls if some data is allowed to be processed or not.

4 **Data cleaning** Check the input file and use pandas or other tools to clean the data before it enters the core calculation this is a more robust solution.

5 **Use proper math libraries** Use libraries like NumPy when dealing with numerical data they are optimized for this type of calculations and have build in error checking mechanisms. This kind of math libraries are far better at handling numerical data and edge cases that the pure python math functions.

6 **Use more debug logs** logging every calculation is essential for complex calculations when you do not know where the problems are. Log the intermediate values that way it becomes easy to track where the errors appear.

And one thing that I always say if your code is not failing is because you did not test it enough so write more tests that include edge cases and boundary conditions.

Here are some suggested resources instead of a bunch of links.

*   **"Numerical Recipes"** by Press et al. It is a classic for numerical algorithms and discusses many issues with precision and error handling.
*   **"Python Data Science Handbook"** by Jake VanderPlas. This is an essential resource for data handling and cleaning with Python and its common libraries. It has sections dedicated to working with `NaN`s and infinities.
*   **The IEEE 754 standard** You should also familiarize yourself with the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic. Understanding how computers represent real numbers can really help you debug these types of numerical problems.
* **The Numerical Python book by Travis Oliphant** a great book to learn how to use the numerical side of python.

I know that the problem is pretty simple but the solution is not. This is just one of those things you learn by doing and making all the possible mistakes. Now I think the best option is to go through your code with a fine comb. Maybe have a co-worker check it out too just to have another pair of eyes looking. You'd be surprised how often a fresh perspective can spot a subtle bug and hey I wish you good luck because debugging those type of errors is never fun.

And let's end this with a very bad programming joke

Why did the programmer quit his job because he didn't get arrays (a raise) * I know sorry not a good one.

Good luck debugging.
