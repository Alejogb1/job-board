Let’s tackle this. I’ve certainly been down this road a few times, and it’s a nuanced area where seemingly unrelated components can significantly impact performance. The short answer is: yes, whether or not TensorFlow Lite (tflite) successfully skips buffer deduplication absolutely depends on the proper loading and functioning of the flatbuffers library. But let’s get into the ‘why’ and ‘how’ because it’s not always immediately apparent.

I recall a specific project back in my embedded days. We were attempting to deploy a complex object detection model onto resource-constrained devices, and our initial benchmarks were… discouraging, to put it mildly. Profiling revealed a significant bottleneck during tflite model initialization, specifically in memory allocation. We later pinpointed buffer deduplication as the culprit, or rather, the lack of it. We hadn't realized that issues with the flatbuffers dependency were preventing the optimization from taking place.

Now, to unpack the issue. Tflite models are essentially flatbuffer representations of computation graphs and their associated weights and biases. When you load a tflite model, the internal machinery (within the tflite interpreter) has a mechanism to identify and deduplicate buffers that are referenced multiple times within the model. This is a huge win, especially for large models. The idea is, if a constant array of weights is shared across multiple layers, you don't need separate copies of that array in memory; instead, they all point to the same memory location, drastically reducing memory footprint.

The flatbuffers library itself is responsible for deserializing the tflite model's flatbuffer data structure, interpreting the pointers, and making the underlying data accessible to the tflite runtime. If the flatbuffers library isn’t correctly loaded, or if it's a version mismatch with what tflite is expecting, several things can happen. The most relevant for us here is that tflite might fail to correctly parse the flatbuffer metadata that marks which buffers can be deduplicated. When this metadata isn’t accessible, the deduplication process fails and the system resorts to allocating separate copies of each buffer, leading to a massive inflation of memory usage and, consequently, performance hits.

Let's illustrate with some (conceptual) code. Imagine a simplified scenario where the flatbuffer representation points to two instances of the same weight matrix. First, a scenario where flatbuffers and deduplication function as expected:

```python
# Scenario 1: Successful Deduplication (Conceptual)

class Buffer:
    def __init__(self, data, shared=False):
        self.data = data
        self.shared = shared

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Buffer: shared={self.shared}, data={self.data[0:5]}...>"


class FlatbufferModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # Pretend this comes from flatbuffer deserialization
        self.weight_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
        self.weights_buffer_1 = Buffer(self.weight_data, shared=True)
        self.weights_buffer_2 = Buffer(self.weight_data, shared=True)  # Same data, different pointer initially
        self.all_buffers = [self.weights_buffer_1, self.weights_buffer_2]


class TFLiteInterpreter:
   def __init__(self):
      self.buffers = []
      self.model = FlatbufferModel()

   def load_model(self):
      for buff in self.model.all_buffers:
        if buff.shared:
            # Deduplication logic: find existing buffer and reuse it. Here simplified
            found_buffer = next((b for b in self.buffers if b.data == buff.data), None)
            if found_buffer:
                # point to existing instead of creating new
                buff.data = found_buffer.data
            else:
                self.buffers.append(buff) # No existing
        else:
              self.buffers.append(buff)  # Not shared data, so unique buffer
      print(f"Loaded buffers: {self.buffers}")


interpreter = TFLiteInterpreter()
interpreter.load_model()
# Even though they came from the model as two buffers, they all point to the same physical buffer.
print(interpreter.buffers[0] is interpreter.buffers[1])
```

In this simplified example, the tflite interpreter identifies the shared buffers using the flatbuffers information, avoids redundant allocation, and they end up referencing the same data. The output indicates the same underlying memory is used for both weight buffers.

Now, let's consider a scenario where the flatbuffers library fails to provide correct metadata, causing the deduplication to fail, even though the *data* is the same:

```python
# Scenario 2: Failed Deduplication (Conceptual)

class Buffer:
    def __init__(self, data, shared=False):
        self.data = data
        self.shared = shared

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Buffer: shared={self.shared}, data={self.data[0:5]}...>"

class FlatbufferModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # Pretend this comes from flatbuffer deserialization
        self.weight_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
        self.weights_buffer_1 = Buffer(self.weight_data, shared=False) # No dedupe info from Flatbuffer
        self.weights_buffer_2 = Buffer(self.weight_data, shared=False)  # No dedupe info from Flatbuffer
        self.all_buffers = [self.weights_buffer_1, self.weights_buffer_2]


class TFLiteInterpreter:
   def __init__(self):
      self.buffers = []
      self.model = FlatbufferModel()

   def load_model(self):
      for buff in self.model.all_buffers:
           #No deduplication logic due to missing info from flatbuffer
           self.buffers.append(buff)
      print(f"Loaded buffers: {self.buffers}")

interpreter = TFLiteInterpreter()
interpreter.load_model()
print(interpreter.buffers[0] is interpreter.buffers[1]) # This will now be false
```

In this modified scenario, the flatbuffer deserialization *pretends* to not inform TFLite that the buffers are shareable. The interpreter then allocates separate memory for each of the buffers, thus negating the effects of deduplication and creating excess memory usage. This code clearly shows how a flatbuffers failure can be detrimental.

Finally, just to reinforce, let's illustrate a scenario where a corrupted flatbuffer structure (due to a loading error or version mismatch) directly prevents TFLite from even accessing the buffer metadata:

```python
# Scenario 3: Corrupted Flatbuffer Metadata (Conceptual)

class Buffer:
    def __init__(self, data, shared=False):
        self.data = data
        self.shared = shared

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Buffer: shared={self.shared}, data={self.data[0:5]}...>"

class FlatbufferModel:
    def __init__(self):
         # Pretend this comes from corrupted flatbuffer deserialization, unable to get buffer info
        self.weights_buffer_1 = None
        self.weights_buffer_2 = None
        self.all_buffers = []


class TFLiteInterpreter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.buffers = []
        self.model = FlatbufferModel()


    def load_model(self):
        # Unable to get buffer data
        print("Failed to load model due to corrupted flatbuffer data")

interpreter = TFLiteInterpreter()
interpreter.load_model()

```
Here, because of the flatbuffer issues, tflite is unable to parse any of the buffers, demonstrating the critical nature of a properly loaded flatbuffer library.

In practice, you won't see these conceptual classes directly, but the underlying mechanism is accurately represented. The core takeaway is that if flatbuffers isn't playing its role correctly, deduplication doesn't occur.

So, how do you prevent this in real scenarios? Firstly, ensure your flatbuffers library version is compatible with the version of TensorFlow Lite you are using. These dependencies are typically outlined in the TensorFlow documentation. Second, ensure your flatbuffers library is properly loaded and accessible by tflite, especially in embedded deployments where dependency resolution can be more error-prone. If problems persist, you’ll have to revert to meticulous debugging.

For a deeper dive, I recommend looking at the official TensorFlow Lite documentation, especially the sections on optimization and model deployment. Also, "FlatBuffers: Efficient cross platform serialization" by W. Mulder and R. van Rooij provides a great foundation on the details of flatbuffers themselves. Finally, studying the open-source TensorFlow Lite interpreter source code on github can provide invaluable understanding of how buffer deduplication is implemented.

In summary, the efficient working of buffer deduplication in tflite is not an isolated process; it is highly dependent on the correctness and successful operation of the underlying flatbuffers library. A failure at this level can introduce severe performance penalties, underscoring the importance of dependency management and thorough testing.
