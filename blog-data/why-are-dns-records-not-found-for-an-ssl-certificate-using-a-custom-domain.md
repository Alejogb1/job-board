, let's tackle this one. I've seen this particular headache pop up more times than I care to count, usually when someone's trying to get a custom domain humming with https, and it can be a real head-scratcher if you're not intimately familiar with the intricacies involved. The issue of a DNS record seemingly going missing when associated with an ssl certificate and a custom domain often boils down to a few key points, usually related to misconfiguration or a misunderstanding of how these pieces actually interact.

First, let's dispel a common misconception: dns records and ssl certificates are not directly bound to each other in the way some might initially assume. A dns record, specifically an a or cname record, maps a domain name to an ip address or another domain name, respectively. An ssl certificate, on the other hand, is a digital document that verifies the identity of a website and enables encrypted communication over https. When we talk about "not finding dns records for an ssl certificate," what we usually mean is that the configuration is such that either the certificate authority (ca) can't verify control over the domain or a client can't reach the server at the domain using https because of dns issues.

Now, the core of this problem stems from the fact that a ca, before issuing an ssl certificate, must verify that the entity requesting the certificate actually controls the domain name. The most common methods are domain validation (dv), which is usually through dns or http challenges. In the dns validation method, the ca will give a specific dns record that you must add to your domain’s configuration. The ca will query for this record and, upon finding it and verifying that it is correct, will issue the certificate. If this record is absent, not precisely matching, or not properly propagated, the ca can't verify ownership, and you're stuck.

Let's illustrate this with a scenario. A few years back, I worked on migrating a legacy application to a cloud platform. We were setting up custom domains and trying to use let's encrypt for ssl certificates. It seemed pretty straightforward: update the dns, request the certificate. But the process kept failing. Turns out, the platform's dns manager, while functional, had a slight propagation delay that we hadn't accounted for. The let's encrypt servers were trying to find the txt record we added for validation *before* the record had actually propagated across the global dns system. This led to verification failures and a lot of frustrating troubleshooting until we realized what was happening. We started using a dns lookup tool to verify the propagation instead of just assuming it would appear instantly.

Here’s a code example of how a dns record might look and be tested using python:

```python
import dns.resolver

def check_dns_record(domain, record_type, expected_value):
    try:
        resolver = dns.resolver.Resolver()
        answers = resolver.resolve(domain, record_type)
        for rdata in answers:
            if rdata.to_text() == expected_value:
                return True
        return False
    except dns.resolver.NXDOMAIN:
        return False
    except dns.resolver.NoAnswer:
       return False
    except dns.exception.Timeout:
        return False

# Example Usage
domain_to_check = "example.com"
txt_record_value = "some_verification_string"  # actual string supplied by the CA

if check_dns_record(domain_to_check, 'TXT', txt_record_value):
   print(f"txt record found: {txt_record_value}")
else:
   print(f"txt record not found for {domain_to_check}")


```

This snippet uses the `dnspython` library to perform a basic dns lookup. It checks for a txt record, which is commonly used in domain validation. This code demonstrates a practical method for programmatically verifying that a needed dns record exists, helping to catch errors caused by propagation delays or misconfigurations early. You can install the library using `pip install dnspython`.

Another common reason why records aren't "found" is human error. Typos in the domain name while configuring dns records or in the record's value are unfortunately common. There was another project I recall where the txt record for validation had a subtle difference from what was supplied by the certificate authority; it was a single character typo. I found it using meticulous debugging using the command line and `dig` command. We’ve now added very strict copy/paste rules when dealing with dns entries to avoid such issues.

Furthermore, the issue might not even be related to the validation step but rather how the dns is configured for the end user trying to connect over https. If the ‘a’ or ‘cname’ record for the domain is not properly configured, the client's dns resolver won't be able to find an ip address to connect to, and even with a valid certificate, they won't be able to access your website.

Here's an example of what a properly configured zone file might look like:

```
; Example DNS zone file
$TTL    300     ; Time to live for records
@       IN      SOA     ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                            2024072601 ; Serial number
                            10800      ; Refresh time
                            3600       ; Retry time
                            604800     ; Expire time
                            300        ; Minimum TTL
                        )

        IN      NS      ns1.example.com.
        IN      NS      ns2.example.com.

example.com.        IN      A       203.0.113.5
www     IN      CNAME   example.com.

_acme-challenge.example.com. IN TXT "some_verification_string_here"

```

This is a simplified example but highlights some key parts. The `a` record directly associates ‘example.com’ with the ip address ‘203.0.113.5’. The ‘cname’ record maps ‘www.example.com’ to ‘example.com’, and the ‘txt’ record contains the string for validation. Incorrect zone file configurations can cause connection issues and make it appear as if there's a problem with the certificate when it's really the dns that’s at fault.

Finally, consider the possibility of network issues between you, the authoritative dns servers, and the certificate authority or the clients. It’s rare, but sometimes network instability or firewall rules can block the communication needed to access or resolve dns records. So, it's worth considering as well.

Here is another snippet to showcase that dns information resolution is a multi-step process:

```python
import dns.resolver

def resolve_dns_chain(domain):
    try:
        resolver = dns.resolver.Resolver()
        answers = resolver.resolve(domain, 'A')
        print(f"A record for {domain}:")
        for rdata in answers:
            print(rdata.to_text())

        nameservers = resolver.resolve(domain, 'NS')
        print(f"\nNameservers for {domain}:")
        for ns in nameservers:
             print(ns.to_text())
        
        cnames = resolver.resolve(domain, 'CNAME')
        print(f"\nCNAME for {domain}:")
        for cname in cnames:
          print(cname.to_text())


    except dns.resolver.NXDOMAIN:
         print(f"{domain}: no such domain")
    except dns.resolver.NoAnswer:
       print(f"{domain}: no answer for requested type")
    except dns.exception.Timeout:
        print(f"{domain}: timeout during resolution")

domain_to_test = 'www.example.com'
resolve_dns_chain(domain_to_test)

```

This example code will fetch the ‘a’, ‘cname’, and ‘ns’ records for a given domain, allowing you to follow the full chain of resolution from your initial request to the target domain. This helps to diagnose issues at any level of the dns resolution process.

For diving deeper into dns and network fundamentals, I recommend checking out "tcp/ip illustrated, volume 1: the protocols" by w. richard stevens. For more specific information on dns, “dns and bind” by paul albitz and cricket liu is also an excellent resource. For practical coding exercises, you could also explore the `dnspython` documentation and implement your own dns tools.

In summary, when ssl certificate issues seem to be caused by missing dns records, the problem is rarely a lack of a dns record itself but rather a failure in the configuration, propagation, or resolution of those records. Careful attention to detail, proper tooling, and a deep understanding of how the dns system functions are crucial for resolving these issues. It's a multi-faceted issue, and it’s useful to methodically work your way down the chain of possible failure points.
