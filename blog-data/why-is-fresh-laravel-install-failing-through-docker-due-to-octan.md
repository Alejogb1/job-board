,  I've seen this particular problem surface more than a few times, especially in projects adopting the newer Laravel ecosystem features, and it’s almost always down to a few key configuration mismatches between the expected environment by Octane and what's actually being provided by the docker setup. It's definitely not a ‘one size fits all’ diagnosis, but we can generally trace it back to issues with file permissions, shared memory, and specifically, the specific way Octane expects to interact with the underlying server.

The core of the problem usually boils down to the fact that Octane relies heavily on shared memory and file system access optimizations to achieve its performance gains. Docker containers, by their nature, are isolated environments, and sometimes the configurations required for Octane to function correctly aren't readily available out-of-the-box. Specifically, when you're seeing a failure right after a fresh Laravel install, it indicates a pretty fundamental incompatibility. Let's unpack this a little further.

Firstly, you’ll want to check your `docker-compose.yml` file, particularly the `php` service definition. There's a solid chance you're not correctly exposing the shared memory space that Octane utilizes. It's less about the php-fpm configuration at this point, more about the underlying container environment. Octane isn’t a standard php request-response lifecycle; it requires shared memory for faster processing. The `shm_size` parameter is crucial for this, and neglecting it results in failures. This manifests typically as errors during the startup process of Octane, sometimes even silent failures, depending on the logging verbosity.

Here's a basic example of a `docker-compose.yml` snippet you might be using, which is probably missing the crucial `shm_size`:

```yaml
services:
  php:
    build:
      context: ./docker
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html
```

And here's a revised version with the required shared memory configuration:

```yaml
services:
  php:
    build:
      context: ./docker
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html
    shm_size: '256m' # Crucial addition
```

The `shm_size: '256m'` line is absolutely vital. You may need to adjust the size based on the specifics of your application load, but 256MB is a decent starting point. If you skip this, Octane will stumble, especially on initial startup because of failing to allocate the necessary shared resources. Note, this assumes you're using a standard `docker-compose` configuration. If you're using Kubernetes or another orchestration platform, the shared memory configuration will be different but the underlying principle remains the same.

Next, file permissions within the container are a common suspect. Octane, especially when running in Swoole mode, often needs to write to specific locations on the file system. These may not be owned by the correct user or group when your application is being started within the Docker container. When your initial installation steps are done outside the docker container (or done in a different context), sometimes you'll have permission issues when the app is launched through docker. This may not manifest with a standard php-fpm server, but Octane’s need for persistent processes exposes these deficiencies. This can result in files being created with wrong permissions within your project directories leading to inability of the application to create cache, sessions and so on when Octane launches. Usually, a simple chown to match the user inside the container fixes this.

Here is an example of how you might handle permissions within your dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM php:8.2-fpm-alpine

WORKDIR /var/www/html

RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps $PHPIZE_DEPS
RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo pdo_mysql
RUN apk del .build-deps
RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

COPY . .

RUN composer install --no-scripts --no-autoloader

# Crucially, set permissions for user inside the container (usually www-data)
RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html

USER www-data

CMD ["php", "artisan", "octane:start", "--server=swoole", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=8000"]
```

The line `RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html` ensures the application code is accessible for the user that is running php within the container, and that will most likely fix this specific symptom of an Octane failure post install. Without this command, Octane might fail as it lacks sufficient write access to certain files and directories it utilizes, notably the `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` directories.

Finally, a subtle point, but also critical, is the configuration of your `.env` file. Specifically, ensure the `SERVER` variable is correctly set for Octane. Sometimes, if you’re moving between different environments, this configuration can be overlooked. If this variable is not properly set or there is no `SERVER` variable at all, Octane might not be able to launch with the expected settings. Ensure that the server configuration matches the setup inside your docker environment.

Here is an example of a correct way to define `SERVER` within your `.env` file.
```env
APP_NAME=Laravel
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=base64:your_app_key
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

LOG_CHANNEL=stack
LOG_LEVEL=debug

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
CACHE_DRIVER=file
FILESYSTEM_DISK=local
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
SESSION_DRIVER=file
SESSION_LIFETIME=120

MEMCACHED_HOST=127.0.0.1

REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379

MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mailhog
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="example@example.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"


# Specific to octan
SERVER=swoole
```
Here, `SERVER=swoole` or `SERVER=roadrunner` would be a correct configuration. If `SERVER` was set to `fpm` or not defined at all, Octane may misbehave and not start properly.

To deepen your understanding, I recommend delving into a few key resources. First, consult the official Laravel documentation, particularly the section on Octane. It details the specific configuration requirements. For a more in-depth view of docker networking, read "Docker in Practice" by Ian Miell and Aidan Hobson Sayers. It provides a more thorough understanding of the underlying networking implications of running containerized applications. Lastly, to get a good understanding of how file permissions work, especially in a linux environment, "How Linux Works" by Brian Ward provides excellent insights.

These three points (shared memory configuration, file system permissions, and `.env` file configuration, primarily the `SERVER` variable), are the most common culprits I've seen cause an Octane failure during a fresh Laravel install. Addressing them will likely bring your Laravel/Octane setup to life within your docker environment. It’s a complex interplay of different technologies, but systematically addressing the configuration based on the specific needs of Octane and the isolation paradigm of docker usually solves the issue.
