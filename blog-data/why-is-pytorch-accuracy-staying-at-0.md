Let's tackle this. I’ve certainly been down that particular rabbit hole, seeing a PyTorch model stubbornly refuse to learn, the accuracy flatlining at zero. It’s frustrating, to say the least, but often indicative of specific issues that, once identified, are usually straightforward to resolve. There isn't a single magic bullet here, but a systematic approach focusing on common culprits usually does the trick.

First, let’s acknowledge that an accuracy of zero in most classification scenarios (and often regression scenarios, when using metrics meant for classification) typically signifies that your model is outputting predictions that are, for all intents and purposes, random or always the same – certainly not aligning with any ground truth. This usually doesn't happen by accident; it almost always points to a fundamental problem in your setup.

The first area I always investigate is the **data preprocessing pipeline**. In my experience, it’s where many issues originate. Consider this: your training data might be severely imbalanced. If the overwhelming majority of your training samples belong to one class, a model can get 'stuck' predicting that dominant class to optimize its initial loss. To the model, this strategy can initially appear less costly (it’s 'right' a lot of the time), so it gets complacent, leading to near-zero performance, especially in multi-class scenarios.

To identify this, inspect your data distribution carefully, specifically the frequency of each class, and if necessary, use techniques such as oversampling the minority classes, undersampling the majority classes, or utilizing weighted loss functions. Libraries like scikit-learn have utilities (`sklearn.utils.class_weight`) for automatically calculating class weights based on frequencies which can be helpful.

Another crucial aspect is data normalization. If features are on vastly different scales, optimization can become significantly more difficult. Unnormalized data can lead to exploding or vanishing gradients, preventing learning. Always ensure that your input features are scaled to a reasonable range, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1], typically using standardization (mean 0, variance 1) or min-max scaling. This often involves applying a `torchvision.transforms` pipeline if dealing with image data. If you’re working with tabular data, look at the `sklearn.preprocessing` module.

Here's a small example, showcasing normalization with `torchvision`'s transformation utilities:

```python
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torchvision.datasets import MNIST

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),  # Convert to tensor
    transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,)) # Normalize to [-1, 1] assuming grayscale images
])

train_dataset = MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

# Example usage in training loop:
for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
    # Now 'data' is preprocessed, ready for model
    # ... training code ...
    pass
```

Secondly, let's address **model architecture and initialization**. It's surprisingly easy to accidentally construct a network that is either too small or too complex for the task at hand. Too few layers or nodes can lead to underfitting, where the model simply lacks the capacity to capture complex patterns. Conversely, overly deep networks, especially without proper regularization, can suffer from vanishing gradients and make training unstable. Using good initialization methods for the weights in your model is also crucial. Pytorch provides several initializers (e.g., kaiming_uniform_, xavier_normal_). When I suspect that the architecture might be an issue I start with very simple model, to verify the process and then gradually increasing the complexity.

Also, verify if you have any accidental 'dead' neurons during training. If an activation function, such as ReLU, is producing zero outputs consistently, that can hinder training because there's no gradient flowing through those weights, and the relevant neuron essentially becomes useless. This situation can be more difficult to diagnose. There are techniques (like more complex activation functions with built-in leakage, or methods using batch normalization) that can assist in avoiding this and could be worth exploring, if applicable.

Thirdly, consider the **loss function and optimization parameters**. Choosing an inappropriate loss function for your problem can directly result in poor learning. For example, using cross-entropy for a regression task is incorrect and could lead to unstable results. Ensure the loss function aligns with the task (e.g., `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` for classification, `nn.MSELoss` or `nn.L1Loss` for regression). Similarly, if the learning rate is too high, the optimization process might become unstable, overshooting the minima. If it’s too low, the model might take an unacceptably long time to train or stagnate and never reach useful parameter values. You might experiment with learning rate schedulers (like `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau`) to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training.

Here’s an example of how to set up a training loop including the optimizer and loss function:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Assume a simple model with cross-entropy loss
model = nn.Linear(784, 10) # Example for MNIST input of 28*28 flattened images and 10 classes
loss_function = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)


# Assume 'train_loader' is a dataloader created as in previous snippet
for epoch in range(5):
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        data = data.view(data.size(0), -1) # Flatten images
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(data)
        loss = loss_function(outputs, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print(f"Epoch {epoch} loss: {loss.item()}")
```
Also, check that you are calling `.backward()` and `optimizer.step()` correctly within your training loop. If the gradients are not calculated and applied to the model's parameters, training won't happen. Similarly `optimizer.zero_grad()` must be called before the backpropagation, or else it will accumulate gradients from multiple batches which will give you incorrect results.

Finally, verify your **evaluation process**. Are you evaluating the model using an appropriate metric? Are you correctly loading the validation dataset? Are you using the same preprocessing steps for validation and testing as you are in training? It is crucial that you check your validation or test code, and how you’re loading the data that you are evaluating with. There have been numerous instances where the issue was as simple as accidentally evaluating on the training dataset, or incorrectly loading validation/test data.

Here's a simple evaluation loop using a similar setup to above:

```python
# Assume model and a test_loader with test dataset (test_dataset as MNIST in train example)

correct = 0
total = 0
with torch.no_grad(): # Disable gradient calculation during evaluation
    for data, target in test_loader:
        data = data.view(data.size(0), -1) # Flatten
        outputs = model(data)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1) # Get predicted class
        total += target.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == target).sum().item()

accuracy = 100 * correct / total
print(f"Accuracy of the model on test images: {accuracy}%")

```

To truly diagnose the problem effectively, you often need to combine these strategies. Start by thoroughly examining your data. Then, simplify the model, ensuring that it can be optimized with your specified loss function and optimizer, before slowly adding complexity back into it.

For further detailed guidance, I highly recommend referring to “Deep Learning” by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville for fundamental understanding of neural networks, and “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron which covers a number of practical techniques. The Pytorch official documentation and tutorials themselves are also invaluable and should be treated as a primary reference. Don't underestimate the power of methodical debugging and careful checks. And, of course, don't hesitate to consult the community; often the collective wisdom of seasoned practitioners on platforms like Stack Overflow provides specific solutions that you would not come across in literature. With careful examination of your data, architecture, and training setup, you will almost certainly identify the cause of your zero-accuracy problem.
