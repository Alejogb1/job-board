Let's tackle this – optimizing for recall using `GridSearchCV`, a scenario I've encountered countless times, particularly in contexts like anomaly detection and medical diagnostics, where the cost of a false negative is substantially higher than a false positive. It's not just about getting the model "right," it's about getting it *strategically* right for your specific needs.

The core idea is that `GridSearchCV` by default optimizes for the estimator's `score` method, which is usually accuracy for classifiers. However, we want to maximize the ability to identify positive cases, and recall is the metric that directly addresses that. We can't just tell `GridSearchCV` to use recall without some setup; we need to carefully define the metric and tell it which class we are targeting.

First, it's crucial to understand that recall, or sensitivity, is defined as `TP / (TP + FN)`, where TP is the number of true positives, and FN is the number of false negatives. A high recall means our model does an excellent job of finding all the positives that exist. So, instead of relying on default performance metrics, we configure `GridSearchCV` to use a custom scoring function that focuses on the positive class's recall.

Let me share a scenario from a project a few years back, dealing with fraud detection in financial transactions. We were receiving highly imbalanced data, with legitimate transactions vastly outnumbering fraudulent ones. Optimizing for accuracy would have been a bad idea - a model could have achieved high accuracy by simply classifying everything as legitimate. However, missing a fraudulent transaction carried a heavy cost. We needed to prioritize recall for the 'fraudulent' (positive) class.

The key is using scikit-learn's `make_scorer` function, coupled with `recall_score`. This allows us to define a custom scorer that explicitly calculates recall for a specific class. This custom scorer is then passed to the `scoring` parameter of `GridSearchCV`.

Here's a practical demonstration with a synthetic dataset and logistic regression:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, recall_score
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Create a synthetic imbalanced dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=2,
                           n_redundant=0, n_classes=2, n_clusters_per_class=1,
                           weights=[0.9, 0.1], random_state=42)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


# Custom scorer for recall of the positive class (class 1)
recall_positive = make_scorer(recall_score, pos_label=1)

# Define parameter grid
param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'penalty': ['l1', 'l2'], 'solver':['liblinear']}

# Initialize the model
model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)

# Initialize GridSearchCV with the custom scorer
grid = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, scoring=recall_positive, cv=5)

# Fit the grid
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print results
print(f"Best parameters: {grid.best_params_}")
print(f"Best recall score: {grid.best_score_}")

# Evaluate on the test set
best_model = grid.best_estimator_
test_recall = recall_score(y_test, best_model.predict(X_test), pos_label=1)
print(f"Recall on test set: {test_recall}")

```

In this example, `make_scorer` creates a scoring function tailored to calculate recall specifically for the positive class (labeled as 1 here using `pos_label=1`). When `GridSearchCV` explores the hyperparameter space using `param_grid`, it does so based on maximizing the recall of class 1, as specified. It’s no longer looking at accuracy; it is focusing on how good the model is at finding the positive instances.

Now let's consider a more complex case. I once worked on a project where we were using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify images for a medical imaging application. The 'positive' class was indicative of a potentially serious condition, and missing these cases was unacceptable. Simply relying on the `score` of the classifier would not have been suitable. We needed granular control over the balance between precision and recall, especially because the datasets were notoriously imbalanced. We also required flexibility in defining the threshold, a component not easily addressed by `GridSearchCV` alone.

Here, we employed a custom scoring function alongside probability calibration before applying a custom threshold. Calibrated probabilities offer a more refined base for adjusting the operating threshold.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, recall_score
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV

# Create a synthetic imbalanced dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=2,
                           n_redundant=0, n_classes=2, n_clusters_per_class=1,
                           weights=[0.9, 0.1], random_state=42)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Custom scorer that calibrates and uses a threshold
def custom_recall_with_calibration(y_true, y_pred_proba, threshold=0.3):
    calibrator = CalibratedClassifierCV(base_estimator=SVC(probability=True, random_state=42), method='isotonic', cv=3)
    calibrator.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_prob_calibrated = calibrator.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

    y_pred_threshold = (y_prob_calibrated >= threshold).astype(int)
    return recall_score(y_true, y_pred_threshold, pos_label=1)


# create a scorer
recall_positive_custom = make_scorer(custom_recall_with_calibration)

# Define parameter grid
param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['rbf', 'linear'], 'gamma':['scale', 'auto']}

# Initialize the model
model = SVC(probability=True, random_state=42)

# Initialize GridSearchCV with the custom scorer
grid = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, scoring=recall_positive_custom, cv=3)

# Fit the grid
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print results
print(f"Best parameters: {grid.best_params_}")
print(f"Best recall score: {grid.best_score_}")

# Evaluate on the test set (using calibrated probabilities)
calibrator = CalibratedClassifierCV(base_estimator=SVC(**grid.best_params_, probability=True, random_state=42), method='isotonic', cv=3)
calibrator.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_prob_calibrated = calibrator.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
y_pred_threshold = (y_prob_calibrated >= 0.3).astype(int) # Threshold of 0.3 for demo
test_recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred_threshold, pos_label=1)

print(f"Recall on test set (with threshold 0.3): {test_recall}")
```

In this more intricate setup, I've incorporated probability calibration within the scoring function. This ensures our predicted probabilities are properly aligned before the threshold is applied.

Finally, let’s touch upon a common hurdle – computationally expensive models. A project involving large, complex neural networks demanded careful optimization of recall within a reasonable time frame. Here we needed to be more strategic with sampling.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, train_test_split, StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, recall_score
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Create a synthetic imbalanced dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=2,
                           n_redundant=0, n_classes=2, n_clusters_per_class=1,
                           weights=[0.9, 0.1], random_state=42)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Custom scorer for recall of the positive class (class 1)
recall_positive = make_scorer(recall_score, pos_label=1)


# Define parameter grid
param_grid = {'hidden_layer_sizes': [(50,), (100,), (50, 50)], 'alpha': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1], 'solver': ['adam', 'lbfgs']}


# Initialize the model
model = MLPClassifier(random_state=42, max_iter=500)

# Initialize GridSearchCV with the custom scorer. Using StratifiedKFold to help with imbalanced data
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
grid = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, scoring=recall_positive, cv=cv, n_jobs=-1, verbose=1) #n_jobs = -1 to use all cores

# Fit the grid
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print results
print(f"Best parameters: {grid.best_params_}")
print(f"Best recall score: {grid.best_score_}")

# Evaluate on the test set
best_model = grid.best_estimator_
test_recall = recall_score(y_test, best_model.predict(X_test), pos_label=1)
print(f"Recall on test set: {test_recall}")
```

Here, besides using our custom recall scorer, we have also introduced `n_jobs=-1` to parallelize training (if your computational resources allow) and `StratifiedKFold` for a better cross-validation strategy with imbalanced data. Remember that each fold should maintain the class distribution of the original data.

For further in-depth study on model evaluation and optimization in classification tasks, I recommend looking into the works of Provost & Fawcett, specifically "Data Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking" for a practical grounding, and Hastie, Tibshirani, & Friedman’s "The Elements of Statistical Learning" for more rigorous mathematical treatment. For an even more specific look at imbalanced data, look at *Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets*, edited by He & Garcia. These resources should give you a solid foundation.

In essence, optimizing for recall with `GridSearchCV` is a matter of telling it what, *specifically*, you want to optimize. It's not just about throwing parameters at the wall, but carefully tailoring the evaluation to your business problem’s requirements. This approach, informed by practical experience, allows for robust and contextually relevant models.
