Alright, let's tackle this. I’ve actually faced this particular challenge a few times, notably during a compliance audit where we needed extremely granular control over who's actions were logged in CloudTrail. The standard approach of just turning on CloudTrail globally simply wouldn't cut it; we needed to filter, and filter carefully. The key thing to understand is that CloudTrail itself doesn’t directly offer user-level filtering based on, say, IAM user names. Instead, you accomplish this restriction using what's called 'data events' and 'management events', along with judicious application of AWS Organizations if you're dealing with a multi-account setup. I'll break this down.

First, a conceptual clarification is in order: there are two fundamental event types in CloudTrail: management events and data events. Management events concern changes to resource configurations (like creating an ec2 instance, updating a security group). Data events record interactions *within* the resources themselves (like getting an object from S3, or running a Lambda function). While filtering management events based on users is not directly supported, you have quite flexible control over data events, and with careful planning, you can accomplish effective user-specific logging restriction indirectly.

The primary method for filtering down on data events is by using selectors. Data events can be logged based on resource type (S3 bucket, Lambda function, etc.), and, crucially, based on *specific resource instances* via ARNs (Amazon Resource Names). This allows us to specify exactly *which* resources’ data plane activities we wish to log, which, combined with a carefully thought out IAM policy structure and, possibly, some serverless automation, will get you where you want to go.

For instance, you might configure separate data events trails, each targeted at logging different sets of S3 buckets. If you then limit access to those particular S3 buckets to distinct IAM users, the trail itself becomes effectively restricted to those users' activities without directly filtering based on their identity in the trail’s definition itself. The user who makes API calls to those specific buckets will be the one whose actions are logged in the respective trail. The "who" is derived indirectly by "what" resources are being accessed, not by directly inspecting IAM user identities.

Let's illustrate with some code examples. Remember these are snippets – they might need adjusting for your environment:

**Example 1: Filtering S3 Data Events via CLI**

This example demonstrates how to create a CloudTrail trail to capture data events for a specific S3 bucket and its objects.

```bash
aws cloudtrail create-trail \
    --name "s3-data-trail-specific-bucket" \
    --s3-bucket-name "your-logging-bucket" \
    --include-global-service-events \
    --is-logging

aws cloudtrail put-event-selectors \
    --trail-name "s3-data-trail-specific-bucket" \
    --event-selectors \
        '[
            {
                "ReadWriteType": "All",
                "IncludeManagementEvents": false,
                "DataResources": [
                    {
                        "Type": "AWS::S3::Object",
                         "Values": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-target-bucket"]
                    }
               ]
            }
        ]'
```

Here, we first create a trail named 's3-data-trail-specific-bucket', set its logging target to an S3 bucket, and enable logging. Then, using `put-event-selectors`, we configure the trail to only record data events on S3 objects in the bucket specified in the “Values” array. All other resources and management events are excluded. If you then restrict access to “your-target-bucket” to a particular set of IAM users, this effectively achieves the objective.

**Example 2: Filtering Lambda Data Events via CloudFormation**

CloudFormation is another excellent tool for this. Here's an excerpt of a template snippet that illustrates how you can create an individual trail focusing on data events for one specific lambda function:

```yaml
Resources:
  LambdaDataTrail:
    Type: AWS::CloudTrail::Trail
    Properties:
      TrailName: "lambda-data-trail-specific-function"
      S3BucketName: "your-logging-bucket"
      IsLogging: true
      IncludeGlobalServiceEvents: true
  LambdaDataEventSelector:
    Type: AWS::CloudTrail::EventSelector
    Properties:
      TrailName: !Ref LambdaDataTrail
      EventSelectors:
        -
          ReadWriteType: "All"
          IncludeManagementEvents: false
          DataResources:
            -
              Type: "AWS::Lambda::Function"
              Values:
                 - "arn:aws:lambda:your-region:your-account-id:function:your-target-function"
```

This CloudFormation snippet defines both the CloudTrail resource itself (LambdaDataTrail) and the corresponding event selector (LambdaDataEventSelector).  The event selector is configured to log events related to the specific Lambda function indicated in the "Values" array in a similar manner as above, excluding management events and all other lambda functions.

**Example 3: Leveraging AWS Organizations for Multi-Account Environments**

In a multi-account environment, AWS Organizations makes life easier. You can configure trails in your management account to log events from multiple member accounts. The key is to use the `--organization-id` flag during trail creation (using the CLI), or, if using the console, enable organization-level logging when creating or updating your trail. While that approach logs events for everyone within the organization by default, it then can be combined with the techniques demonstrated in examples 1 and 2. Each member account can then have very specific resources being logged based on a similar strategy, effectively grouping resources and their logs together by access permissions and responsibilities. In conjunction with IAM policies restricting resource access to specific users or roles within their respective accounts, we achieve user-specific filtering indirectly through a combination of resource selection and access control.

```bash
aws cloudtrail create-trail \
  --name "org-wide-trail" \
  --s3-bucket-name "your-logging-bucket" \
  --is-logging \
  --is-organization-trail \
  --organization-id "o-xxxxxxxxxx"
```

After you create the organization trail, you can then use the `put-event-selectors` call as demonstrated above in example 1, within each of the member accounts, further limiting logs from resources only accessible by specific users in that account.

Important points to remember:

*   **Cost Considerations**: Creating many specific trails increases log storage and processing costs. Carefully plan your trails and assess the need for granularity versus cost.
*   **Data Security:** The logging buckets themselves should have very restrictive policies. Encrypt your logs using KMS.
*   **IAM is Key:** Your IAM policies must align with your trail configuration. Restricting access to specific resources is how you will implicitly restrict which users generate log events in those specific trails.
*   **Trail Updates**: Modifying an active trail might cause a slight delay in logging. Apply any changes cautiously during non-critical periods.
*   **Logs Analysis**:  Effectively querying these filtered logs will depend on how you've organized them. Tools such as Athena or CloudWatch Logs Insights can be helpful for analyzing the log data.

For further detailed information, I recommend reading the AWS documentation on CloudTrail, specifically the sections about “Working with Event Selectors,” "Understanding CloudTrail Log File Structure," and the “AWS CloudTrail API Reference.” The AWS Well-Architected Framework also contains excellent best practice guidance on logging and auditing. In addition, you may find “Cloud Security: A Comprehensive Guide to Securing Your Infrastructure and Data in the Cloud” by Ben Smith a useful resource. Finally, make sure you become well acquainted with the AWS CLI’s command-line parameters related to `create-trail` and `put-event-selectors` – that’s where you’ll be doing the heavy lifting to customize your setup to fit your needs. There is no magical button for user-based filtering. The power lies in a thoughtful implementation of resource-based data event selection and tight IAM policies. This combination will give you granular control over exactly which actions from exactly which users are recorded. Remember:  The "who" is defined through restricting what "what" can access.
