well, let's break this down. you're hitting a snag with your transformer decoder when trying to go from english to spanish, which, i gotta say, is a fairly common pain point. i've personally spent way too many late nights staring at loss curves that just wouldn't go down, or even worse, oscillating like a kid on a sugar rush, so i feel you. it’s almost always a collection of seemingly small things that add up to a big, frustrating issue.

first off, let's talk about the data. i've seen it time and time again, data quality can make or break your model. are your english and spanish sentence pairs truly aligned? i once had a translation project where i thought the data was perfect, turns out some of the pairs were shifted, like, sentence 1 english matched with sentence 2 spanish. the model was trying to translate the word "hello" into the spanish equivalent of "goodbye", and needless to say, it was a garbage-in, garbage-out situation. you need to make absolutely sure that your source and target sentences are truly corresponding. any noise in your training data will simply confuse the model and it wont learn the correct translations. its good to preprocess your data, removing noise like random symbols, characters, etc, and doing a careful tokenization.

then there’s the tokenization itself. are you using the same vocabulary and tokenization method for both english and spanish? if not, your model is essentially trying to learn translations with two different instruction manuals. this often results in the decoder not knowing how to even begin to generate the proper target sequence. for example, i’ve seen people use word-level tokenization for english and byte pair encoding for spanish which leads to a lot of confusion. i highly recommend using something like sentencepiece for both, which treats tokenization as a learning problem in itself, this will help to create a coherent token space for the model.

now, let's delve a bit into the transformer architecture itself. the decoder in the transformer uses masked self-attention to predict the next token, given the previous tokens in the target sequence. are you sure this mask is being applied correctly? i had one instance where i messed up the mask implementation and the decoder was essentially peeking ahead into the future tokens. this obviously allowed the model to cheat and during inference it was very useless and completely broken. you have to make sure you are only attending to previous tokens in the target sequence otherwise, the target token becomes independent of the prediction task and the model wont learn anything.

also, how deep is your model? and how many attention heads are you using? sometimes you might be tempted to go for a smaller model to train faster or a big one that seems the way to go, but it needs to be right. a very shallow model might not be able to capture the intricate complexities of language, and a massive one might overfit your limited dataset like a tailor on steroids. it is important to find the right size for the transformer, using the lowest number of parameters and achieving the lowest validation loss. similarly, having a very few attention heads will limit the model's capacity to learn relationships between words. and too many can make the model very slow. it is an art to find the balance, but it is extremely important.

now, here is a snippet of how you could create a simple transformer decoder in pytorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as f
import math

class decoderlayer(nn.module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, nhead, d_ff, dropout):
        super().__init__()
        self.self_attn = nn.multiheadattention(d_model, nhead, dropout=dropout, batch_first=true)
        self.enc_dec_attn = nn.multiheadattention(d_model, nhead, dropout=dropout, batch_first=true)
        self.ff = nn.sequential(
            nn.linear(d_model, d_ff),
            nn.relu(),
            nn.linear(d_ff, d_model),
        )
        self.norm1 = nn.layernorm(d_model)
        self.norm2 = nn.layernorm(d_model)
        self.norm3 = nn.layernorm(d_model)
        self.dropout = nn.dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, x, enc_out, tgt_mask, src_mask):
        attn_output, _ = self.self_attn(x, x, x, attn_mask=tgt_mask)
        x = self.norm1(x + self.dropout(attn_output))

        attn_output, _ = self.enc_dec_attn(x, enc_out, enc_out, attn_mask=src_mask)
        x = self.norm2(x + self.dropout(attn_output))

        ff_output = self.ff(x)
        x = self.norm3(x + self.dropout(ff_output))
        return x

class transformerdecoder(nn.module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, d_model, nhead, num_layers, d_ff, dropout, max_seq_len):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.embedding(vocab_size, d_model)
        self.pos_enc = nn.parameter(torch.zeros(1, max_seq_len, d_model))
        self.layers = nn.modulelist([decoderlayer(d_model, nhead, d_ff, dropout) for _ in range(num_layers)])
        self.fc = nn.linear(d_model, vocab_size)
        self.dropout = nn.dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, tgt, enc_out, tgt_mask, src_mask):
        x = self.embedding(tgt)
        x = x + self.pos_enc[:, :x.size(1), :]
        x = self.dropout(x)
        for layer in self.layers:
           x = layer(x, enc_out, tgt_mask, src_mask)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

def create_masks(tgt_seq, src_seq):
    seq_len_tgt = tgt_seq.shape[1]
    seq_len_src = src_seq.shape[1]
    tgt_mask = torch.triu(torch.ones((seq_len_tgt, seq_len_tgt)), diagonal=1).bool()
    src_mask = (src_seq == 0).unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(2)
    return tgt_mask, src_mask

if __name__ == '__main__':
    vocab_size = 10000
    d_model = 512
    nhead = 8
    num_layers = 6
    d_ff = 2048
    dropout = 0.1
    max_seq_len = 100
    batch_size = 64
    seq_len = 30
    
    decoder = transformerdecoder(vocab_size, d_model, nhead, num_layers, d_ff, dropout, max_seq_len)
    
    tgt_seq = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (batch_size, seq_len))
    src_seq = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (batch_size, seq_len))
    enc_out = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, d_model)
    tgt_mask, src_mask = create_masks(tgt_seq, src_seq)

    output = decoder(tgt_seq, enc_out, tgt_mask, src_mask)
    print("output shape:", output.shape)
```

remember, this is a simplified decoder; a full transformer involves the encoder, attention mechanisms, and a lot more fine tuning.

now, regarding the training process itself, you might be using the wrong loss function or optimizer. i remember i once made the stupid mistake of using cross entropy loss directly on the output of my decoder which outputs logit scores, instead of applying a softmax first, my loss was a nonsensical number during the first epoch and never improved. this is obviously a very silly error but the point is, tiny errors can have very big impacts in the learning of the model, its important to check.

i've had my fair share of debugging neural networks with gradient explosion or vanishing gradients, so make sure your gradients are not going crazy. use gradient clipping if you observe large gradients. your model weights are being updated properly? learning rate, weight decay and all those hyperparameters are important to be configured correctly. it’s easy to overlook things when dealing with multiple parameters. check your optimizer, sometimes i’ve noticed people use adam with learning rates that are way too high and the model never converges and sometimes the opposite, a too low learning rate takes ages to converge. also consider experimenting with different optimizers as well.

another common issue is batch size. a too small batch size might be too noisy and give a bad gradient estimate and a too big batch size might result in not learning the finer details of the data. this is usually a function of your gpu memory capabilities but its also important to be aware of this.

and here's another very simplified code of how you can calculate cross-entropy loss function, which is the go-to loss function for text generation:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as f

def compute_loss(logits, targets, mask, smoothing = 0.1):
  '''
  logits: (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size)
  targets: (batch_size, seq_len)
  mask: (batch_size, seq_len)
  '''
  vocab_size = logits.shape[-1]
  confidence = 1.0 - smoothing
  true_dist = torch.full_like(logits, smoothing / (vocab_size -1) )
  true_dist.scatter_(2, targets.unsqueeze(-1), confidence)
  
  log_probs = f.log_softmax(logits, dim=-1)
  loss = (- true_dist * log_probs).sum(dim=-1)
  mask = mask.float()
  loss = (loss * mask).sum() / mask.sum()
  return loss

if __name__ == "__main__":
    batch_size = 64
    seq_len = 30
    vocab_size = 10000

    logits = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size)
    targets = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (batch_size, seq_len))
    mask = torch.ones((batch_size, seq_len))
    
    loss = compute_loss(logits, targets, mask)
    print("loss:", loss)
```

and of course, i shouldn't forget about the importance of monitoring your training process closely. i like to monitor the learning curves, see how the training and validation losses evolve and check the metrics, like bleu score for machine translation, if you are not doing this, you are essentially flying blind. early stopping is very useful and is always better to stop before overfitting.

another thing you might want to check is the beam size if you are doing beam search. in a project i had i made the mistake of setting beam size to 1 during inference. it wasn’t a deterministic model because of the dropout but it was effectively running the translation as greedy decoding. increasing the beam size resulted in more natural translations as the beam search algorithm is actually finding the most likely sequence of words instead of choosing the highest probable at each time step.

the last thing you might want to check is your learning rate scheduler. during one of the projects, i didn't realize the model was converging because of the learning rate scheduler i had which basically reduced the learning rate to 0 before it could properly train. there was no error, it simply wasn’t training because it was not updating its weights.

here's an example how you can create a scheduler that can be used during training:

```python
import torch
from torch.optim import adamw
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import lambaLR

def get_lr_scheduler(optimizer, warmup_steps, d_model, factor):

    def lamba_function(step):
       if step < warmup_steps:
           return factor * (step / float(max(1,warmup_steps)))
       else:
           return factor * d_model**(-0.5) * (step)**(-0.5)
    return lambaLR(optimizer, lr_lambda = lamba_function)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    model_params = 10000
    d_model = 512
    factor = 1.0
    warmup_steps = 4000
    
    model = torch.nn.Linear(model_params, 100)
    optimizer = adamw(model.parameters(), lr=1.0)
    lr_scheduler = get_lr_scheduler(optimizer, warmup_steps, d_model, factor)
    
    for epoch in range(10):
      for step in range(10000):
        lr_scheduler.step()
        current_lr = optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']
        if step%2000 == 0:
           print("step:", step, ", current lr:", current_lr)
```

now, instead of just linking a bunch of random articles, i would suggest some serious material for deep understanding, like the original "attention is all you need" paper by vaswani et al. for the theory and the book "natural language processing with transformers" for more practical approaches. these would definitely help you troubleshoot your issues.

and remember, debugging deep learning models can feel like walking through a minefield but it is always better to take a step back and re-check all your steps instead of just hoping that it will magically start working.
and hey, at least it's not quantum physics, the errors are not observable until the very end of the training process.
