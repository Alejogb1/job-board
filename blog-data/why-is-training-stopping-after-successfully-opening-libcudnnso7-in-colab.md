alright, so you're hitting a wall with your colab training, right? specifically, it seems like the process stalls right after libcudnn.so.7 loads successfully. i've been there, trust me. seeing that "libcudnn.so.7" confirmation message feels like a small victory, only to be followed by... nothing. it's infuriating, i get it. let's break this down because there is no single 'it's always this' answer, but more of a process of elimination.

first off, the fact that libcudnn is loading points us away from a basic setup issue with cuda or driver incompatibilities. if that was the case, you'd probably see errors before that point. think of it like this: the libraries are the foundation, and we've laid a solid foundation now. we're not arguing about the cement mix anymore. the problem likely lies in what we’re trying to build on that foundation.

most of the time when i've had this issue it was memory or more specifically lack thereof. colab offers decent gpu memory, but it isn't infinite. and, importantly, the gpu memory isn’t always readily available for the process. what happens is, we allocate the memory for the training, then, the process starts, and the libraries load and then boom… because the process is too aggressive with memory the system crashes. sometimes, colab’s process manager isn’t super verbose with its errors when it hits this point, leading to the "stall" we are seeing.

it's common to overestimate how much your model needs. i've been guilty of it. i remember this time when i was doing image segmentation on some medical data, i created a beast of a network, thinking more is always better. let's just say that the model was too large for the available resources. my memory was constantly hitting the roof, and it was doing all sort of weird stuff, like stopping at points it was supposedly “okay” with, or the error messages would be all over the place. i learnt from that experience to be more mindful of the memory. the funny thing is, it did not occur to me that the model was too big for the ram, i was just checking for errors in my code.

so, first, let's think about your model architecture. a large batch size or complex layers can eat into memory very fast. a good practice is starting small, even if it sounds counterintuitive. if you have a monster batch size of 256 reduce it to 32 or 16. even 8 if you are feeling brave. if your model has a lot of layers, start with a simpler structure for debugging purposes, perhaps a small number of convolutional layers and a couple of fully connected ones. once your training is working then you can start pushing it to the limit.

secondly, are you doing any data augmentation? transformations can be helpful but can also increase memory demands. if you're scaling images or doing crazy rotations, then the data is taking a lot of space in memory and that's the reason your process is freezing.

here's some code to help you narrow it down. i’m a big believer in sanity checks:

```python
import torch

def check_gpu_memory():
    """checks if there's enough memory."""
    if not torch.cuda.is_available():
        print("cuda not available.")
        return False
    gpu_id = torch.cuda.current_device()
    total_memory = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(gpu_id).total_memory / 1024**3
    memory_allocated = torch.cuda.memory_allocated(gpu_id) / 1024**3
    memory_cached = torch.cuda.memory_cached(gpu_id) / 1024**3
    print(f"gpu: {gpu_id}")
    print(f"total gpu memory: {total_memory:.2f} gb")
    print(f"allocated memory: {memory_allocated:.2f} gb")
    print(f"cached memory: {memory_cached:.2f} gb")
    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
  check_gpu_memory()
```
this snippet gives you the current state of your gpu's memory. run this before you even start training. this can help you understand how much you’re actually using and if you're close to the limit from the beginning. i typically run this at the beginning of all my scripts. its a simple habit.

another critical thing, make sure you are cleaning up allocated tensors after each epoch. if you are training on a loop and not cleaning the gpu memory this can also lead to memory fragmentation over time, even if your batch size is small, and consequently it can make your training process crash.

you can do that explicitly with pytorch. in the snippet below, i'm cleaning the memory after each epoch.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.utils.data as data

# create a dummy dataset
class SimpleDataset(data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
    def __len__(self):
        return self.size
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return torch.rand(10), torch.randint(0, 2, (1, )) # dummy input, dummy label

# hyperparameters
batch_size = 16
epochs = 3
learning_rate = 0.001

# create a dummy model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 100)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(100, 2)
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# device setup
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# model, loss, optimizer and data loading
model = SimpleModel().to(device)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
dataset = SimpleDataset(size=1000)
dataloader = data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)


# training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(dataloader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs.to(device))
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels.to(device).squeeze())
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    # memory cleanup
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
    print(f"epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs} done...")

```

in this example i am explicitly emptying the memory cache using `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` after each epoch, it's also important to call `optimizer.zero_grad()` at the beginning of each iteration, as you may have different batches on different iterations that are not being cleaned properly. the `squeeze` operation is just removing the extra dimension in the labels for pytorch compatibility.

the most important resource in cases like this are profilers. using tools like nsys (nvidia systems profiler) can help you pinpoint exactly where the bottleneck lies and what is consuming memory at each stage of the process. if you get into serious gpu work, you must study these kinds of tools. if you are doing pytorch, the pytorch profiler can be a great starting point to see bottlenecks. this can be a bit much to get started with, but there are a ton of good introductory papers on how to use profilers. the "nvidia system profiler users guide" is a classic if you are serious about this.

also, look for potential issues outside of your model and data loaders. sometimes colab can struggle with large pre-processing tasks that run on the cpu. if your code is pre-processing and then moving to the gpu it may be that the cpu is reaching its limit while not displaying proper errors. if you're doing anything intense on the cpu before the training loop, consider moving that to the gpu or optimizing it to be more memory efficient. pre-fetching data in pytorch can also improve performance by making sure the gpu is not waiting for data.

here is an example with some prefetching:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.utils.data as data
import time

# create a dummy dataset
class SimpleDataset(data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
    def __len__(self):
        return self.size
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        time.sleep(0.01) # simulate time taken to load data
        return torch.rand(10), torch.randint(0, 2, (1, )) # dummy input, dummy label

# hyperparameters
batch_size = 16
epochs = 3
learning_rate = 0.001

# create a dummy model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 100)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(100, 2)
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# device setup
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# model, loss, optimizer and data loading
model = SimpleModel().to(device)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
dataset = SimpleDataset(size=1000)
dataloader = data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, num_workers=4, pin_memory=True) # added prefetching using num_workers and pin_memory


# training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(dataloader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs.to(device))
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels.to(device).squeeze())
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    # memory cleanup
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
    print(f"epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs} done...")

```

in this snippet we have enabled prefetching through `num_workers` and `pin_memory`, the dummy dataset has also a sleep function to show how to simulate data loading delays.

finally, sometimes, it's just a weird interaction with colab's environment. restarting the runtime, and running just your training portion again can sometimes "fix" it by clearing any residual memory or configurations. it’s annoying, but sometimes it’s the easiest way.

in summary, don't panic. this situation is super common. work through it systematically: check your memory usage, simplify your model, make sure you're cleaning memory, pay attention to your pre-processing, and leverage profilers to see where the bottlenecks really are. good luck, and if you still struggle you can always come back with more details.
