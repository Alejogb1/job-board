Let's tackle this directly, shall we? The question of whether contract ownership can restrict access to specific structure fields is nuanced and touches upon core principles in smart contract development, particularly within the context of solidity. It’s not a simple yes or no answer. My experience with developing decentralized applications, especially in environments requiring strict permissioning, has taught me the critical importance of managing data visibility. In short, contract ownership *itself* doesn't directly restrict access at the storage level to specific fields. However, you absolutely use contract ownership, along with carefully designed access control mechanisms, to enforce restrictions *logically*. Let’s break that down, going a bit deeper than surface-level understanding.

The fundamental aspect here revolves around the concept of visibility modifiers and modifier functions in solidity. These are tools you wield to determine if a particular function or a state variable can be accessed and modified by different callers. When we say a variable is private, internal, or public, we're defining these access boundaries. When we talk about ownership, we’re usually referring to a specific address, typically the one that deployed the contract. This address gains privileged abilities, like calling functions only designated for the owner.

Now, let's clarify: even if a field is *private*, it doesn’t inherently mean it's cryptographically invisible or impossible to access. It means solidity’s compiler will prevent *direct* access through normal contract function calls, outside of the contract's own functions. With sufficiently advanced techniques, such as accessing raw storage using tools like `web3.eth.getStorageAt` (which is not recommended in typical use cases), one could potentially inspect storage locations and their values. This is where the logical restrictions become crucial.

The way I've consistently and effectively implemented field access restriction is by leveraging modifier functions that check ownership *before* performing certain actions. Let's look at three example scenarios, coded in solidity to illustrate this:

**Example 1: Restricted Modification of User Data**

Suppose you have a smart contract that stores user information, including a user's name, but only the contract owner should have the ability to modify the name. Here's how you can structure it:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UserData {
    address public owner;
    struct User {
        string name;
        uint256 id;
    }
    mapping(address => User) public users;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }

    function createUser(address userAddress, string memory _name, uint256 _id) public {
        users[userAddress] = User(_name, _id);
    }

    function modifyUserName(address userAddress, string memory _newName) public onlyOwner {
        users[userAddress].name = _newName;
    }

    function getUserName(address userAddress) public view returns (string memory) {
        return users[userAddress].name;
    }
}
```

In this example, `modifyUserName` is decorated with `onlyOwner`. This modifier ensures that only the contract owner can alter a user’s name. Any non-owner attempting this will trigger a revert. The contract owner has *logical* ownership privileges. The `users` mapping, although publicly viewable via the `getUserName` function, can only be *modified* via `modifyUserName` which is gated by the ownership check.

**Example 2: Controlled Access to Configuration Parameters**

Imagine a scenario where the contract holds critical configuration parameters that only the owner should be able to adjust.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ConfigManager {
    address public owner;
    uint256 internal _maxUsers; // internal access, can be read inside this contract

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        _maxUsers = 100;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }

     function setMaxUsers(uint256 newMax) public onlyOwner {
        _maxUsers = newMax;
    }

    function getMaxUsers() public view returns (uint256) {
       return _maxUsers;
    }
}
```

Here, `_maxUsers` is internal, which is relevant within the contract itself, but only the `setMaxUsers` function can modify it and it is gated by `onlyOwner`. The internal modifier doesn't block access to getter functions, but it hides the variable from outside the contract code itself.

**Example 3: Time-Locked Data with Ownership Control**

Let's consider a more elaborate case where the data should be modifiable only by the owner but with an additional time restriction.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TimelockedData {
    address public owner;
    uint256 public unlockTime;
    string private _secretData; // can be read through function here, not outside.

    constructor(uint256 _lockDuration) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        unlockTime = block.timestamp + _lockDuration;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }

    modifier afterUnlock() {
        require(block.timestamp >= unlockTime, "Data is still locked.");
        _;
    }

    function setSecretData(string memory secretData) public onlyOwner afterUnlock {
      _secretData = secretData;
    }

    function getSecretData() public view returns (string memory) {
        return _secretData;
    }

    function extendLock(uint256 _additionalTime) public onlyOwner {
       unlockTime += _additionalTime;
    }
}
```
In this example, modifying `_secretData` through the `setSecretData` function requires both ownership (onlyOwner) and the time lock to be open (afterUnlock). The owner can extend the lock time. Even though the secret data is marked as private, it can be accessed through the view function `getSecretData` which demonstrates the limitation of privacy modifier on its own.

These examples demonstrate that the real control over data visibility lies in a combination of modifiers and proper access control checks, not solely on storage modifiers. Contract ownership acts as the backbone of permissioning within these structures, but it's the solidity language features and your use of modifiers that determine actual access.

For a more in-depth dive into these topics, I’d recommend reading “Mastering Ethereum” by Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood. This book covers these core concepts with practical explanations. Additionally, for a more formal treatment of security concepts in solidity, the Consensys Smart Contract Best Practices documentation is a great resource, outlining secure coding patterns and common pitfalls. Understanding the EVM and the storage layout is also crucial, the yellow paper provides these underpinnings and is highly recommended. These resources will arm you with a strong foundation for building secure and robust decentralized applications. Keep in mind that direct manipulation of storage outside the contract is usually not something you want to allow, so it’s essential to understand and implement proper visibility checks. I hope this detailed explanation helps clarify your understanding and points you toward helpful resources.
