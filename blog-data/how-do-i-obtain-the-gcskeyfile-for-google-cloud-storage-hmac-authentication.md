Alright, let’s tackle this. The question of how to obtain the `gcs.keyfile` for Google Cloud Storage HMAC authentication has come up a few times in my experience, and it’s a pertinent one. It often arises when transitioning from service account based authentication to a more nuanced approach, particularly when dealing with applications that handle sensitive data or require granular access controls beyond service accounts.

The crucial point to understand is that `gcs.keyfile` isn’t a file in the way a service account JSON key file is. Instead, it's a placeholder for two distinct pieces of information: an *access id* and a *secret key*. These are obtained by creating a dedicated HMAC key specifically for a given service account or user within your Google Cloud project. Essentially, you're not downloading a file; you're generating credentials.

Here’s how it unfolded in one project I managed, where we were processing sensitive image data uploaded by external clients. Initially, we used service account keys, but that exposed more permissions than we wanted, and rotating them frequently was a hassle. The shift to HMAC keys allowed us to lock down access to only the bucket used for external uploads and also provided a way to revoke the access quickly, if ever needed.

The process is fairly straightforward once you understand the mechanics. First, you will need the google cloud cli (gcloud). If you don't have this already, install it first according to the official google documentation. Once you've done that, you can use gcloud commands to generate your HMAC keys.

Let's illustrate with some code snippets.

**Snippet 1: Generating an HMAC Key using gcloud**

This command initiates the generation of the HMAC key for a specific service account. Note, you need to have appropriate permissions to manage keys. Replace 'my-service-account@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com' with the appropriate email address of your service account and 'project-id' with your google cloud project id.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create hmac-key.json \
    --iam-account=my-service-account@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --project=project-id
```

Running the above command will output a JSON file (`hmac-key.json` in this case). Note that this is different than a traditional service account key file. The most relevant information you'll find inside is, typically:

```json
{
  "accessId": "GOOG....",
  "secret": "0/abcdefghijkl....."
}
```

Here, the `accessId` is what you would use as your HMAC access id, and the `secret` field is your HMAC secret key, and the combination represents your `gcs.keyfile`.

*Caveat:* This secret will be displayed only *once*. You won't be able to retrieve it again through gcloud commands. This means it is crucial to store it somewhere secure, such as in a secret manager (google cloud secret manager in this case is the most recommended way).

**Snippet 2: Python Example (using google-cloud-storage library)**

This demonstrates using the generated access id and secret with the `google-cloud-storage` client library in python. Be sure you have installed this library using pip first: `pip install google-cloud-storage`.

```python
from google.cloud import storage

access_id = "GOOG..." # Replace with your actual access ID
secret_key = "0/abcdefghijkl....." # Replace with your actual secret

storage_client = storage.Client(
    credentials=None,
    _http=None,
    client_options={"api_endpoint": "https://storage.googleapis.com"},
    _use_grpc=False, # Explicitly use the REST API
)

storage_client.hmac_key = {"access_id": access_id, "secret": secret_key}

bucket = storage_client.bucket('your-bucket-name')

blob = bucket.blob('your-object-name.txt')

blob.upload_from_string('Hello World')
print(f"Uploaded blob {blob.name} successfully")
```

In this python snippet, note how we explicitly pass in the access id and the secret key when initializing the `storage.Client`. The `client_options={"api_endpoint": "https://storage.googleapis.com"}, _use_grpc=False` options make sure that the hmac authentication is used. The usual service account authentication doesn't involve these options.

**Snippet 3: Deactivating HMAC keys**

To disable or rotate HMAC keys, you will have to use `gcloud iam service-accounts keys deactivate`. It will prompt you to confirm deactivation.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys deactivate <access id> --project=project-id
```

Replace `<access id>` with the actual `accessId` you've obtained from the hmac-key.json file. After deactivation, any request to GCS using this key will fail.

This is a simple yet important example for security management practices. In the real world, these keys would never be stored directly in the code, but instead would be retrieved dynamically at runtime using a secrets management system. This allows easier key rotation without requiring code updates, and it prevents accidental exposure of these keys in code repositories.

To solidify your understanding of this topic, I recommend diving into the official Google Cloud documentation on HMAC keys for Cloud Storage. Also, take a look at "Cloud Security Engineering: Building Secure Systems on Google Cloud Platform" by David R. Blank-Edelman and David Pollak for a detailed perspective on secure cloud practices, including best practices for credential management. Additionally, understanding the underlying principles of authentication and authorization protocols will enhance your knowledge; consider resources such as "Understanding OAuth 2.0" by Aaron Parecki.

In conclusion, there isn’t a ‘gcs.keyfile’ to obtain in the same sense as a service account key file. You create HMAC keys, and then securely manage and use their corresponding access id and secret key within your applications or infrastructure. The above examples should give a practical grounding, and further study of the recommended material can assist you in properly implementing HMAC authentication in your projects. Remember, proper security management is paramount when handling cloud resources.
