Alright, let's tackle this. It’s a surprisingly nuanced area, and I remember a project back in '09 where we heavily relied on dynamic configurations, which often involved precisely this: building hashes where the values were essentially method calls on an instance. The challenge, as always, lies in getting the binding correct and avoiding those nasty "undefined method" errors at runtime.

The core concept here involves understanding that a lambda in Ruby is a closure; it captures its surrounding scope. When we want a lambda to call an instance method, we need to ensure that 'self' within that lambda refers to the correct instance. Simply creating a lambda and assigning it won't magically bind it to a particular object. That's where the trick lies.

Let's walk through a few techniques.

**Technique 1: Directly Referencing Instance Methods**

The most straightforward approach is to use the method object directly within the lambda. Ruby's `method` method (no relation to calling a method) on any object will return a `Method` object, which is a first-class object representing that method. We can then use `call` on this `Method` object within the lambda. The key here is that when you invoke a method object via `call`, you're essentially telling it what the `self` should be.

```ruby
class MyClass
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end

  def add_five
    @value + 5
  end

  def multiply_by_two
    @value * 2
  end
end


instance = MyClass.new(10)


method_hash = {
  add: -> { instance.method(:add_five).call },
  multiply: -> { instance.method(:multiply_by_two).call }
}

puts method_hash[:add].call # Output: 15
puts method_hash[:multiply].call # Output: 20
```

In this example, `instance.method(:add_five)` returns a method object bound to the *instance*, and the lambda effectively says "call this method on that object". Crucially, the lambda is capturing the specific *instance*, so it will consistently operate on that specific object even if the value of the `instance` variable changes later.

**Technique 2: Leveraging `bind` for Context**

Alternatively, you can use the `bind` method to explicitly set the object context for a method. `bind` will return a *bound* method object, which behaves in a way that always calls its corresponding method on the object you've bound it to. It's quite powerful, and in my experience, less prone to subtle errors when refactoring than the previous method.

```ruby
class MyOtherClass
  attr_accessor :initial_value

  def initialize(value)
    @initial_value = value
  end


  def square
    @initial_value ** 2
  end


  def double_and_add_one
    (@initial_value * 2) + 1
  end
end

another_instance = MyOtherClass.new(7)

method_hash_bound = {
  square: -> { another_instance.method(:square).bind(another_instance).call},
  double_add: -> { another_instance.method(:double_and_add_one).bind(another_instance).call }
}


puts method_hash_bound[:square].call # Output: 49
puts method_hash_bound[:double_add].call # Output: 15
```

Notice the use of `bind(another_instance)` before calling `call`. This effectively says, “no matter what, the ‘self’ inside `square` or `double_and_add_one` should always refer to `another_instance`”. This approach is more explicit and, in many ways, more self-documenting.

**Technique 3: Using `send` for Dynamism**

Now let’s imagine needing more flexibility—perhaps you have a list of methods to execute dynamically based on external input or configuration. In this case, using `send` within the lambda might be preferable.  `send` allows you to dynamically invoke a method specified by a string or symbol on an object. This offers a great way to externalize method calls.

```ruby
class YetAnotherClass
  attr_reader :setting_value

  def initialize(starting_value)
    @setting_value = starting_value
  end


  def increment_by_one
    @setting_value += 1
  end


  def decrement_by_one
      @setting_value -= 1
  end
end


dynamic_instance = YetAnotherClass.new(15)


methods_to_call = [:increment_by_one, :decrement_by_one]

dynamic_hash = methods_to_call.each_with_object({}) do |method_name, hash|
  hash[method_name] = -> { dynamic_instance.send(method_name) }
end

dynamic_hash[:increment_by_one].call
puts dynamic_instance.setting_value # Output: 16
dynamic_hash[:decrement_by_one].call
puts dynamic_instance.setting_value # Output: 15
```
Here, the `dynamic_hash` is constructed dynamically from the `methods_to_call` array. Each key in the hash becomes a method name, and its lambda value executes that method on the `dynamic_instance` using `send`.  This adds a layer of runtime configurability not available with the other approaches.

**Important Considerations**

*   **Scope Capture:** Always double-check the scope in which you're creating the lambda. Subtle scope issues are common when dynamically creating these structures.
*   **Error Handling:** It is good practice to incorporate proper error handling, particularly when using `send`, as it can raise exceptions if the method doesn't exist.
*   **Readability:** While `send` is potent, prefer more explicit methods when appropriate for better code clarity.
*   **Method Visibility:** Be mindful of method visibility. If you're using `send` or `method`, be sure the targeted method is accessible within your class definition.

For further study, I highly recommend looking at the documentation on Ruby's `Method` class and the `Kernel#method`, `Method#bind` and `Object#send` methods in the official ruby-doc. Specifically, ‘The Well-Grounded Rubyist’ by David A. Black offers an incredibly detailed overview of Ruby internals, including a thorough discussion on method objects and closures. Also, the writings of Matz, the creator of Ruby, often provide the best insights into the language's design principles. Reading his work (available through various resources) can greatly improve your grasp of Ruby's more nuanced mechanics.

In short, creating these method-referencing hashes requires careful attention to scope and binding. While the approaches described are powerful, choose them deliberately based on your project's needs and maintainability requirements. From my experience, keeping the code clear and explicit is paramount in avoiding future headaches.
