Let's tackle this, shall we? I recall a particular project involving time-series data back in 2018; the source data for the project, bizarrely enough, stored dates as 'MM_DD' strings without any year information. When we tried plotting it using Altair, the initial results were, as you might imagine,… unconventional. The graphs were interpreting ‘MM_DD’ as, well, just numbers without a temporal component. We ended up spending a good chunk of time figuring out how to properly coax Altair into treating this string representation as time information. Here’s what we learned, and how you can solve this very practical problem.

The challenge arises because Altair, at its core, expects datetime objects or numerical representations of dates/times when dealing with temporal axes. When you feed it a string like ‘MM_DD’, it defaults to treating it as categorical or numerical data, which is often not the desired behavior. To correct this, we need to pre-process the data to include the year information, then explicitly tell Altair how to parse it correctly.

The core principle involves several steps: 1) temporarily introduce a consistent year into your data so that it becomes a valid datetime object (or an epoch time integer), 2) format your axis to show only the month and day parts of that modified date, thus simulating the desired ‘MM_DD’ display on the graph, and 3) ensure your timescale is correct for your desired application – since you are now dealing with a full date, you might need to account for how that impacts your display on the x-axis, especially when dealing with long time series.

Let’s look at some code snippets to illustrate how to achieve this in Python using Altair:

**Example 1: Using a fixed year**

This is the most straightforward approach if you're not concerned about the absolute calendar year of your data; it only cares about relative month and day. I use a constant year value here, and then format the axis to only show the month and day.

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

# Sample data (MM_DD strings)
data = {'date': ['01-15', '02-28', '03-10', '04-01', '05-20'], 'value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Function to create datetime objects with a fixed year
def to_datetime_fixed_year(date_str, year=2024):
    return pd.to_datetime(f'{year}-{date_str}', format='%Y-%m-%d')

# Apply the function to create the new datetime column
df['datetime_fixed'] = df['date'].apply(to_datetime_fixed_year)

# Altair chart
chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_line().encode(
    x=alt.X('datetime_fixed:T', axis=alt.Axis(format='%m-%d', title='Date (MM-DD)')),
    y='value:Q',
    tooltip=['date', 'value']
).properties(
    title='Time Series Data'
)

chart.show()
```

In this example, we've crafted a `to_datetime_fixed_year` function that prepends a constant year (2024 in this case) to the original string, effectively turning ‘01-15’ into ‘2024-01-15’ and then converting that into a proper pandas datetime object. Crucially, we specify the axis format as '%m-%d’ in Altair's `alt.Axis` settings. This ensures that the plotted axis *displays* only the month and day, despite the data actually containing a full date, which is essential for Altair’s internal processing. We are not changing the underlying time but how it's displayed on the chart.

**Example 2: Using a base year and epoch time**

Sometimes a more granular approach to time-series is required. In this example, we convert dates into epoch time (seconds since January 1, 1970) using a base year so that the x-axis scale works better than if we were using a single constant date, especially when dealing with data across multiple "years." This is not a common use case for 'MM_DD' data, but it's useful if you have some sort of repeating cycle that you need to model with a start date rather than assuming a date.

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
import time

# Sample data (MM_DD strings)
data = {'date': ['01-15', '02-28', '03-10', '04-01', '05-20', '01-15'], 'value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 12]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Function to create datetime objects with a base year
def to_epoch_time(date_str, base_year=2023):
  date_obj = pd.to_datetime(f'{base_year}-{date_str}', format='%Y-%m-%d')
  return int(time.mktime(date_obj.timetuple())) # Convert to seconds since epoch

# Apply the function to create the new epoch column
df['epoch_seconds'] = df['date'].apply(to_epoch_time)

# Altair chart
chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_line().encode(
    x=alt.X('epoch_seconds:T', axis=alt.Axis(format='%m-%d', title='Date (MM-DD)')),
    y='value:Q',
    tooltip=['date', 'value']
).properties(
    title='Time Series Data with Epoch Time'
)

chart.show()

```

Here, we have the `to_epoch_time` function which converts our 'MM-DD' string to a date within the base year, then into seconds since the epoch using the `time.mktime` function, and we finally cast that value as an integer before passing it to Altair. This is particularly helpful if you are doing any complex time calculations since epoch time is a standard format. Again, we use `alt.Axis(format='%m-%d')` to manage the axis display, showing only month and day. In most situations the previous approach is preferred, unless you need to track the number of seconds.

**Example 3: A more robust function using string manipulation and integer conversion**

This approach can be faster since it converts strings to integers directly instead of relying on date objects, and it is also easier to port if you aren't using pandas.

```python
import altair as alt
import time

data = {'date': ['01-15', '02-28', '03-10', '04-01', '05-20', '01-15'], 'value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 12]}

def to_epoch_time_optimized(date_str, base_year=2023):
  month = int(date_str[:2])
  day = int(date_str[3:5])
  # construct a time tuple from integers, and then convert
  return int(time.mktime((base_year, month, day, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)))


# Add the new value to the data dictionary
for i in range(len(data['date'])):
  data['epoch_seconds'] = [to_epoch_time_optimized(d) for d in data['date']]


chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_line().encode(
    x=alt.X('epoch_seconds:T', axis=alt.Axis(format='%m-%d', title='Date (MM-DD)')),
    y='value:Q',
    tooltip=['date', 'value']
).properties(
    title='Time Series Data with Epoch Time (Optimized)'
)

chart.show()
```

This function, `to_epoch_time_optimized`, is a more efficient approach if you don't need a fully formed date object during the conversion process. You may find this useful in contexts where you need to squeeze performance or work outside of the pandas ecosystem. Again, we use `alt.Axis(format='%m-%d')` to manage the axis display, showing only month and day.

It's also important to note that the way you choose your 'base' or 'fixed' year *can* impact the look of your graph, especially if you have multiple periods with similar MM-DD values that might span actual calendar years. In that situation, careful use of epoch time can be helpful.

For a more in-depth understanding of date formatting in python, I'd suggest looking at the official Python documentation on the `datetime` module, specifically the `strftime` and `strptime` methods. The pandas documentation also details how pandas implements datetimes, which is what Altair uses as well. Additionally, the Altair documentation contains precise information on the various formatting options available for `alt.Axis`.

This detailed approach, born out of real-world data challenges, should give you a firm handle on how to interpret ‘MM_DD’ time information effectively within Altair. The most important takeaway is the combination of a suitable data transformation and explicit axis formatting.
