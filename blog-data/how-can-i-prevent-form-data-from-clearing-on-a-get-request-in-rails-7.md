Okay, let's tackle this. I've seen this issue pop up more times than I care to remember – that frustrating scenario where you submit a form, expecting a filtered list or some other action via a get request, and boom, all your carefully inputted data vanishes into the ether. It's a classic gotcha, and thankfully, there are some effective strategies to prevent it.

The fundamental issue, as many of you may already know, lies in how http get requests are intended to function. They are designed to retrieve resources based on the url, with any parameters appended as part of the query string. Unlike post, put, or patch requests, they don’t inherently carry a payload (a body) in the same manner. Browsers, by default, don't retain form data when initiating a get request. When you navigate to a new url or refresh, that data isn’t sent along, leading to the form being reset.

Over the years, I've found that attempting to 'force' a get request to behave like a post is not a sustainable solution. Instead, we need to think about how to pass data in a get request appropriately, while also maintaining user-friendliness. The best practices usually boil down to two main approaches: leveraging query parameters correctly and considering whether you really need a get request in the first place.

Let’s start with the most common scenario: a search or filter form. Here, we typically want to submit user inputs (e.g., keywords, categories, date ranges) and update the view without clearing the form. The solution is to explicitly add the form inputs to the url as query parameters when the form is submitted.

Here’s a basic example within a Rails view (`app/views/products/index.html.erb`):

```erb
<%= form_tag products_path, method: :get do %>
  <div class="field">
    <%= label_tag :query, "Search Keywords:" %>
    <%= text_field_tag :query, params[:query] %>
  </div>
  <div class="field">
    <%= label_tag :category, "Category:" %>
    <%= select_tag :category, options_for_select([['All', ''], ['Electronics', 'electronics'], ['Books', 'books']], params[:category]) %>
  </div>
  <div class="actions">
    <%= submit_tag "Search" %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

And this controller action (`app/controllers/products_controller.rb`):

```ruby
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @query = params[:query]
    @category = params[:category]
    @products = Product.all
    @products = @products.where("name LIKE ?", "%#{@query}%") if @query.present?
    @products = @products.where(category: @category) if @category.present?
  end
end
```

Notice how, in the view, I'm pre-populating the input fields with the values from the `params` hash (specifically `params[:query]` and `params[:category]`). When the form is submitted via get, the browser will append the form data as query parameters in the url (like `/products?query=my+search&category=electronics`). The controller then uses these parameters to filter the products. Critically, because we're loading the form with the values from the same `params` hash, the form will remain populated even after the get request is processed.

However, this approach works best for smaller, straightforward filters. When the form becomes complex with multiple fields, nested parameters, or sensitive data, relying entirely on query parameters can become clunky and even potentially insecure (as sensitive data ends up visible in the browser's address bar and server logs). That’s when we might need to consider a slightly different strategy, one where we briefly use a post request.

Imagine a scenario where a user is filling out a rather detailed form, perhaps to customize a configuration or to search through a very specific inventory. Here, we might temporarily submit the form data via a post request to store it in a session. We can then redirect to a url that uses get request parameters, passing along the necessary data using the session. Let's look at an example:

First the form (`app/views/complex_forms/new.html.erb`):

```erb
<%= form_tag complex_forms_path, method: :post do %>
  <div class="field">
    <%= label_tag :field1, "Field 1:" %>
    <%= text_field_tag :field1, params[:field1] %>
  </div>
  <div class="field">
     <%= label_tag :field2, "Field 2:" %>
     <%= text_area_tag :field2, params[:field2] %>
  </div>
  <div class="actions">
    <%= submit_tag "Submit Configuration" %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

Next the controller (`app/controllers/complex_forms_controller.rb`):

```ruby
class ComplexFormsController < ApplicationController
    def new
    end
  
    def create
        session[:complex_form_data] = params.permit(:field1, :field2)
        redirect_to complex_forms_show_path(query_params: { field1: session[:complex_form_data][:field1], field2: session[:complex_form_data][:field2] })
    end
  
    def show
      @form_data = { field1: params[:query_params][:field1], field2: params[:query_params][:field2] }
    end
end
```

And finally the show view (`app/views/complex_forms/show.html.erb`):
```erb
<p>Field 1: <%= @form_data[:field1] %></p>
<p>Field 2: <%= @form_data[:field2] %></p>
```

In this example, the initial submission is a post request to the `create` action. We then store the important data into the session and issue a redirect to the `show` action using get, carrying the important parameters. This allows the form's results to be available to the user while maintaining a reasonable get request behavior for further page navigations. This approach also has the additional benefit of preserving form data across navigations, something a normal get request doesn't do.

Finally, a practical example is using partial updates with ajax requests. Instead of reloading a whole page, you update specific sections of a page.

Here's a javascript example for a button click (`app/views/ajax_forms/index.html.erb`):

```erb
<div id="target-content"> Initial content </div>
<button id="myButton">Click</button>

<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
  document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function(){
        fetch('/ajax_forms/update', {
           method: 'GET'
        })
        .then(response => response.text())
        .then(text => {
         document.getElementById('target-content').innerHTML = text
        });
       });
    });

</script>
```

And the accompanying controller (`app/controllers/ajax_forms_controller.rb`):

```ruby
class AjaxFormsController < ApplicationController
    def index
    end
  
    def update
      render plain: "Updated content fetched via ajax"
    end
end
```

Here, we're not even relying on a form submission but on a simple button that sends an AJAX get request, and the new content is rendered to a specific div tag on the page without any reload.

For further understanding, I'd suggest diving into the HTTP specifications, particularly the sections related to get requests and their limitations, and the workings of HTTP forms. A book like "HTTP: The Definitive Guide" by David Gourley and Brian Totty is a valuable reference. Additionally, understanding the basics of how browsers handle form submissions and the behavior of query parameters in URLs will be crucial. I would also suggest reading documentation surrounding the Rails controller methods, specifically related to parameters.

In closing, avoid attempting to shoehorn get requests into behaving like post requests for complex form data. It’s best to either correctly use url parameters or to use the session to store the data briefly before redirecting to a get-style request. By choosing the right approach, based on your specific needs, you will be able to make the user experience smoother and prevent unwanted data loss, leaving you with a more robust application.
