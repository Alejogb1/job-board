Alright, let's tackle this. I remember back in the early days of a particularly sprawling deep learning project, we were dealing with half a dozen experiments running simultaneously, all chucking logs into their own directories. Trying to compare them using separate TensorBoard instances was a nightmare; squinting at different browser tabs trying to discern trends. The frustration was palpable, but it did push me to explore solutions for visualizing these disparate logs in a unified view. The crux of it is: yes, it's absolutely feasible to combine multiple TensorBoard logs into a single plot. Here’s how you do it, and some things to watch out for.

The essential mechanism involves pointing a single TensorBoard instance to multiple log directories. TensorBoard is designed to handle this gracefully. Instead of just specifying one directory, you provide a comma-separated list of directory paths. When you launch TensorBoard, it scans all of those specified locations and combines the collected scalar, histogram, image, and other data points into a unified interface.

It's worth noting that the underlying implementation in TensorBoard relies on the structure of the log files. Each logged event, whether it’s a scalar value, histogram, or image, is associated with a tag and a step number (essentially an iteration or epoch). TensorBoard then intelligently uses these tags and steps to align the various data sets. If experiments use different tag names for what you intend to compare, you'll run into issues. Tag consistency across your experiments becomes critical to obtain meaningful comparisons. If that is the case, manual tag inspection and potentially renaming during logging are required which I can elaborate on later.

Now, let’s get into some practical code examples. Suppose you have three experiments whose logs are stored in directories named `experiment_a`, `experiment_b`, and `experiment_c`.

**Example 1: Launching TensorBoard with multiple log directories**

This is the most straightforward method. From your terminal, you would run something like this:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir experiment_a,experiment_b,experiment_c
```

This single command launches TensorBoard, pointing it to all three directories. You'll then be able to navigate to your localhost on the specified port (usually 6006) and see all the data combined into a single view, selectable via dropdown menus that allow you to choose which experiment logs you want to visualize. This assumes all your metrics were logged in a consistent manner across these experiments. If that wasn't the case, you might be able to fix it retroactively as demonstrated in the upcoming example.

**Example 2: Retroactively fixing inconsistently named logging tags**

In a past project I encountered a scenario where one colleague logged loss as `training_loss` and another used `loss`. TensorBoard would not easily compare those. A solution is to manipulate the log files themselves. Although I advise against modifying log files directly in production settings, this can be a useful diagnostic exercise. This is a simplified demonstration using Python and the TensorFlow library's event writer and reader. Please note that directly manipulating event files can lead to data corruption if you are not very careful; hence this should be performed on backup copies of the logs. Here's a script that iterates through the event files, corrects the tag, and writes a new event to a different directory to prevent overwriting the original.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

def fix_log_tag(log_dir, output_dir, old_tag, new_tag):
    if not os.path.exists(output_dir):
        os.makedirs(output_dir)

    for event_file in os.listdir(log_dir):
        if event_file.startswith('events.out'):
            reader = tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator(os.path.join(log_dir, event_file))
            writer = tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter(output_dir)

            for event in reader:
                if not event.HasField("summary"):
                   continue
                for value in event.summary.value:
                    if value.tag == old_tag:
                       new_value = tf.compat.v1.Summary.Value(tag=new_tag, simple_value=value.simple_value)
                       new_summary = tf.compat.v1.Summary(value=[new_value])
                       new_event = tf.compat.v1.Event(wall_time=event.wall_time, step=event.step, summary=new_summary)
                       writer.add_event(new_event)
                    else:
                       writer.add_event(event)
            writer.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    original_log_directory = "experiment_a" # Log directory that needs fixing
    corrected_log_directory = "experiment_a_fixed"
    fix_log_tag(original_log_directory, corrected_log_directory, "training_loss", "loss")

    # Example of using modified directory in tensorboard
    # tensorboard --logdir experiment_a_fixed,experiment_b,experiment_c
```

This script reads through each event in the `experiment_a` log file and creates a new event in `experiment_a_fixed` replacing `training_loss` with `loss`, if the tag name is found. You can then use this new directory combined with your others in TensorBoard to unify your visualization. Remember this assumes scalar data; dealing with histograms or images would require adapting this code accordingly.

**Example 3: Using programmatically generated log files with consistent naming**

To avoid the need to retroactively change tag names, good logging practices should be adopted from the start. Below is an example of how you can use the tf.summary operations to consistently log metrics, ensuring proper comparison across different experiments. Here's a fragment of code demonstrating consistent logging with specific tag naming practices within a typical training loop. This would be part of a larger training script.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os

def train_model(log_dir, epochs=10):
    if not os.path.exists(log_dir):
        os.makedirs(log_dir)

    writer = tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter(log_dir)

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Simulate training process
        train_loss = np.random.rand()
        train_accuracy = np.random.rand()

        # Log the metrics with consistent tags
        summary = tf.compat.v1.Summary(value=[
            tf.compat.v1.Summary.Value(tag="train_loss", simple_value=train_loss),
            tf.compat.v1.Summary.Value(tag="train_accuracy", simple_value=train_accuracy)
            ])
        writer.add_summary(summary, epoch)

        # Similarly log validation metrics
        val_loss = np.random.rand()
        val_accuracy = np.random.rand()
        summary = tf.compat.v1.Summary(value=[
            tf.compat.v1.Summary.Value(tag="val_loss", simple_value=val_loss),
            tf.compat.v1.Summary.Value(tag="val_accuracy", simple_value=val_accuracy)
            ])
        writer.add_summary(summary, epoch)

        print(f"Epoch {epoch}: train_loss={train_loss:.4f}, train_accuracy={train_accuracy:.4f}")

    writer.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
   train_model("experiment_d") # Create a new log directory with consistent tagging
   train_model("experiment_e")
   # Then launch tensorboard:
   # tensorboard --logdir experiment_d,experiment_e
```

This snippet demonstrates that training or validation loss and accuracy can be logged to the same folder using consistent tagging for all experiments to ensure easy comparison within tensorboard. If this kind of approach is used throughout experiments, unified visualizations become much simpler.

For further reading on this subject, I would recommend a deep dive into the official TensorFlow documentation on TensorBoard; you can always find it with a quick web search. Furthermore, Andrew Ng’s deep learning specialization on Coursera and the book "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville will also provide you with an in-depth understanding of all the concepts touched on above. They may not cover TensorBoard in precise detail, but understanding the principles of deep learning and how these logs are generated will significantly enhance your ability to troubleshoot and use TensorBoard effectively.

In summary, combining logs is quite achievable if your logging practices are sound. Consistent tag names are essential for comparability, and a little bit of Python scripting can help when discrepancies arise, but prevention is always better than cure. The ability to view the entirety of your experiments simultaneously is a tremendous advantage for the overall debugging and monitoring. Let me know if there is anything more I can clarify.
