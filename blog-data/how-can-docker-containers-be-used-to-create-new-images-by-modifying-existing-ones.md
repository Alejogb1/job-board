Alright, let’s talk about extending existing docker images; it's a topic I've spent quite some time with, especially back when we were migrating our monolithic application to microservices. It’s not just about spinning up containers; it’s also about how we build upon existing functionalities without starting from scratch. You see, the beauty of docker lies in its layered file system and the ability to derive new images from existing ones through a process known as building. This isn’t some black box operation; it’s fundamentally about creating a new, distinct image based on changes you make to a base image.

Docker images aren't monolithic blobs. They are built from layers, which are essentially read-only snapshots of the filesystem. When you create a new image *from* an existing one, you are typically adding new layers on top of those base layers. This is what provides the efficiency that docker is known for; it allows for shared layers between images, minimizing disk space usage and speeding up image retrieval. The magic happens with the `docker build` command, coupled with a Dockerfile, which is essentially a script containing all the instructions needed to construct your new image.

Now, let's consider how you actually do this. The first crucial step involves choosing the right base image. It's incredibly important because everything in your new image builds on top of this foundation. Ideally, you’ll choose a minimal base image that contains only the bare essentials for your application. For instance, alpine linux is a popular choice due to its tiny size. It's tempting to go for something more comprehensive, but it's crucial to keep your image small, both for performance reasons and to reduce your security surface.

Next, within the Dockerfile, you instruct Docker on how to modify your base image to construct your new image. Instructions can include things like copying files into your image, installing dependencies, and setting default command-line instructions. Let’s work through some examples to illustrate the process, moving from the simple to a bit more complex.

**Example 1: Adding a Simple Script**

Imagine we’re using an alpine linux image and we want to create a new image that contains a basic python script and executes it. Our Dockerfile might look like this:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk update && apk add python3 py3-pip
COPY ./my_script.py /app/my_script.py
WORKDIR /app
CMD ["python3", "my_script.py"]
```

And the corresponding `my_script.py` could be something simple like:

```python
print("hello from docker!")
```

Here, `FROM alpine:latest` establishes the base image, `RUN apk update && apk add python3 py3-pip` installs python, `COPY` adds your script to the container image, `WORKDIR` sets the working directory and `CMD` sets the default command executed upon running the container. You would build this using the command `docker build -t my-python-image .` and then run with `docker run my-python-image`.

**Example 2: Working With Application Dependencies**

Let’s step up the complexity by looking at an example involving node.js. Let’s say you have a basic node application with some npm dependencies. A suitable docker file may look like this:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Here, we're using the official `node:18-alpine` image as the base. The `COPY package*.json ./` instruction copies just the package manifest files first, allowing docker to cache the `npm install` layer (crucial for build speed if your dependencies change infrequently). We then copy the remaining project files and expose port 3000. This assumes you have a node application with a `start` script configured in your `package.json`. You can build this image with `docker build -t my-node-app .`.

**Example 3: Multi-stage builds**

For a more advanced scenario, let's explore multi-stage builds. This method helps create smaller final images by separating the build environment from the runtime environment, which is extremely useful when compiling code. Here's an example using a go application:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build stage
FROM golang:1.20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN go build -o /go/bin/my-go-app

# Stage 2: Final stage
FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=builder /go/bin/my-go-app /usr/bin/my-go-app
CMD ["/usr/bin/my-go-app"]
```

This is a two-stage process. The first stage, named 'builder', uses a full go environment to compile the application. The second stage, using a minimal alpine base, copies only the compiled binary, resulting in a much smaller and less vulnerable final image. This is extremely important as you only include what is strictly necessary in your final image, which is a critical security best practice. Building this image is the same as before, `docker build -t my-go-app .`

In all these examples, the `docker build` command creates new image layers by executing the instructions specified in the Dockerfile. Each instruction typically creates a new layer, which is a key aspect of docker’s efficient storage and caching mechanisms. When you modify the dockerfile, docker will utilize the existing cached layers when possible, speeding up your build process.

However, it’s crucial to recognize that building new images on top of existing ones is more than just modifying configurations; it's about properly layering your application and ensuring maintainability. Consider these things while designing your dockerfiles. The order of the commands is very important, especially when combined with a caching mechanism. Placing commands that are less likely to change higher up in your Dockerfile will result in fewer rebuilds and a faster build process. It's also important to minimize the number of layers in your image, which can be achieved through combining multiple commands into a single `RUN` command. Another best practice includes avoiding storing secrets in your Dockerfiles. Instead, use build arguments or secrets provided during runtime.

For further exploration, I highly recommend delving into the official Docker documentation, particularly the sections on Dockerfiles and best practices. In addition to the official sources, the “Docker Deep Dive” book by Nigel Poulton is an excellent resource for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the docker engine. Additionally, studying the works of folks like Jessie Frazelle, known for her work on container security, can provide extremely useful perspectives on best practices and more complex container deployment models. Understanding these mechanisms and best practices is what allows for robust and maintainable containerized applications. It's not about just making it work; it's about making it work well.
