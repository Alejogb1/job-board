Alright, let’s tackle this. Type hinting `Point` objects when using `aioinflux` is a common sticking point, and frankly, it's understandable. Having battled with this myself on a rather large sensor data pipeline, I’ve found that approaching it systematically, rather than relying on guesswork, saves a good deal of headache.

The core challenge here is that `aioinflux`’s `Point` class doesn't provide a directly importable type hint. The library uses `namedtuple`-like structures to construct points, but it doesn't expose a specific type that you can directly use in your function signatures or type variables. This absence forces us to be a bit more creative when providing type annotations for functions that accept or return these point objects.

The crux of the solution revolves around using `typing.TypedDict` and potentially `typing.Dict` where `TypedDict` is not applicable (like if the shape is not strictly known beforehand). Let’s break down why and how. A `TypedDict` will allow us to accurately represent the structure of a `Point` as a dictionary where each key has an associated type. It's the closest thing we'll get to a concrete representation without diving into internal class definitions of `aioinflux` itself.

Let's see this in action with some examples. Let’s consider a scenario where we have a function that creates point objects for temperature data, using a tag and a value. Here’s how you might approach type hinting it:

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Dict, Any
from aioinflux import Point
import asyncio

class TemperaturePoint(TypedDict):
    measurement: str
    fields: Dict[str, float]
    tags: Dict[str, str]
    time: int  # Or float, depending on your time representation

async def create_temperature_point(
    location: str, temperature: float
) -> TemperaturePoint:

    point = Point(
        measurement="temperature_reading",
        fields={"value": temperature},
        tags={"location": location},
        time=int(asyncio.get_event_loop().time() * 1000_000_000) # time in nanoseconds
        )

    return point
```

In this example, `TemperaturePoint` serves as our type hint. It specifies the expected keys (`measurement`, `fields`, `tags`, `time`) and their corresponding types.  Notice, in this instance, we are using a `dict` for both the `fields` and `tags` and specifying their corresponding types as well. This is critical as the values inside the dictionaries can be other types as well, not just simple strings. The return type of the `create_temperature_point` function is `TemperaturePoint`. Now, a type checker will flag type mismatches during static analysis. For instance, if you try to return a point with a field that is not a number, mypy will catch it.

Next, imagine a scenario where you are processing multiple points and these points may not be of a single consistent type, which would prevent using `TypedDict` on a collection of point objects. Here's an example of how to type hint that situation:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from aioinflux import Point
import asyncio

async def process_points(points: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> None:
    for point in points:
      # point is type hinted as Dict[str, Any]
      print(f"Measurement: {point.get('measurement', 'N/A')}")
      print(f"Fields: {point.get('fields', 'N/A')}")
      print(f"Tags: {point.get('tags', 'N/A')}")
      print(f"Time: {point.get('time', 'N/A')}")


async def generate_multiple_points(locations: List[str], temperatures: List[float]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    points = []
    for location, temp in zip(locations, temperatures):
        point = Point(
            measurement="temperature_reading",
            fields={"value": temp},
            tags={"location": location},
            time=int(asyncio.get_event_loop().time() * 1000_000_000)
            )
        points.append(point)
    return points
```
In this example, the function process_points consumes a `List[Dict[str, Any]]` which could be a list of `Point` objects. The function `generate_multiple_points` is actually what produces them. Notice, while `Point` objects are dict-like structures, we cannot directly use `List[Point]` as a type hint as, again, `Point` itself is not exposed as a type. Using `Dict[str, Any]` allows us to loosely type a `Point` in its `dict` representation in situations where it is hard to enforce a strict `TypedDict` style.

Lastly, let's look at what it might look like to have a more sophisticated `TypedDict` with complex field types and then process this:

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Dict, Any
from aioinflux import Point
import asyncio
from datetime import datetime


class SensorDataPoint(TypedDict):
    measurement: str
    fields: Dict[str, Any]
    tags: Dict[str, str]
    time: datetime


async def generate_sensor_point(
    sensor_id: str, temperature: float, humidity: float
) -> SensorDataPoint:
    point = Point(
      measurement="sensor_data",
      fields={"temperature": temperature, "humidity": humidity},
      tags={"sensor_id": sensor_id},
      time=datetime.now()
    )
    return point


async def process_sensor_points(points: List[SensorDataPoint]) -> None:
    for point in points:
        print(f"Sensor ID: {point['tags']['sensor_id']}")
        print(f"Temperature: {point['fields']['temperature']}")
        print(f"Humidity: {point['fields']['humidity']}")
        print(f"Timestamp: {point['time']}")
```

Here we have introduced `datetime` as our timestamp, and the `fields` dictionary has multiple key/value pairs. Notice how `SensorDataPoint` accurately reflects the structure of the `Point` objects our functions are interacting with. The `process_sensor_points` function receives a list of `SensorDataPoint`, and the type checker can identify whether that's correct.

Now, a couple of recommendations for deepening your understanding. First, dive into the official Python documentation on the `typing` module, specifically focusing on `TypedDict`. This will give you the foundation to effectively handle various typing scenarios beyond just `aioinflux` points. Second, look at "Effective Python" by Brett Slatkin. This is a really accessible and practical guide to writing better Python, with a strong focus on the how and why behind various language features, including type hints. While not specifically about `aioinflux`, it sets you up for writing robust, type-safe Python code in general. Also, I would recommend "Programming in Python 3: A Complete Introduction to the Python Language" by Mark Summerfield for a more rigorous explanation of python itself.  Lastly, consider delving into the source code of `aioinflux` itself to understand how those point objects are represented internally. While we shouldn't type hint against implementation details, it gives a more thorough understanding of the data structure.

In conclusion, when type hinting `Point` objects in `aioinflux`, the key is to create type-safe definitions using `TypedDict` when you know the schema of the point or `Dict[str, Any]` when the shape is more dynamic or unknown. These are then applied to the function signatures for clarity and robustness, and when coupled with proper tooling like mypy, can save a lot of development time and effort. Remember type hints are a design tool and should represent the flow of data. Avoid overcomplicating the point, and ensure that it's actually capturing your intentions. These steps will lead you towards a much clearer and maintainable codebase.
