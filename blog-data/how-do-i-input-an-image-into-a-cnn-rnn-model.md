Alright, let's talk image input to a CNN-RNN model. It's a problem I've tackled a few times, most notably when I was working on a project that aimed to generate captions for short videos, which meant handling both spatial and temporal data. The challenge, as you've likely discovered, lies in bridging the gap between the spatial representation of an image (handled well by CNNs) and the sequential nature of information processing in RNNs. It's not a straightforward plug-and-play, but with a bit of careful structuring, it becomes quite manageable.

The crux of it is transforming the image into a suitable input sequence for the RNN. Instead of feeding the raw pixel data, which would be computationally infeasible and not very meaningful, we use the CNN as a feature extractor. This initial phase is crucial because it pre-processes the image into a higher-level, more compressed representation that is easier for the RNN to process.

Specifically, we typically use the convolutional layers of the CNN to learn spatial hierarchies in the image. After several convolutional and pooling layers, we extract the output of a specific layer. I've found that the output of the last convolutional layer, right before the fully connected layers (if there are any), tends to work particularly well as it contains a compact feature map. This feature map retains important information about the image content, but crucially is in a lower-dimensional space.

Now, how do we go from this feature map to something the RNN understands? The feature map isn't a sequence – it’s more like a spatial representation. This is where we often flatten it. Flattening collapses the spatial dimensions of the feature map into a single vector. If the feature map's dimensions are, say, `height x width x channels`, the flattened version becomes a single vector of `height * width * channels` elements.

This flattened vector is then fed as the input for each time step in the RNN sequence, but it's crucial to note we're not introducing sequence by manipulating single image; rather, the feature representation becomes time-invariant input for the recurrent part of the network if you are handling only single images for single output. For sequential information, or multi-image use cases, we do need to handle the sequencing.

Let me illustrate with some code snippets. The first example will deal with single image, single output scenario, which is very often used in image-captioning applications.

**Example 1: Single Image, Single Output (Image Captioning):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

class CNN_RNN_Single(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, rnn_hidden_size, vocab_size, num_rnn_layers=1):
        super(CNN_RNN_Single, self).__init__()
        self.cnn = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
        # remove classification layer for feature extraction
        self.cnn = nn.Sequential(*list(self.cnn.children())[:-2])
        # Freeze the CNN weights
        for param in self.cnn.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = False

        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        # Calculate the output size of the CNN. Important when you change your CNN model
        dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224) # Assuming input images are 224x224 RGB
        cnn_output_size = self.flatten(self.cnn(dummy_input)).shape[1]
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(input_size=cnn_output_size, hidden_size=rnn_hidden_size, num_layers=num_rnn_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(rnn_hidden_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, images, caption_length):
        # images is [batch_size, 3, H, W],  caption_length is the actual sequence length (not max)

        features = self.cnn(images) #[batch_size, Channels, H, W]
        features = self.flatten(features) #[batch_size, Channels*H*W]
        features = features.unsqueeze(1) # Reshape to (batch_size, sequence_length=1, features)

        # Initialize the hidden and cell states at the start of the sequence.
        h0 = torch.zeros(1, images.size(0), self.rnn.hidden_size).to(images.device) # num_layers * batch_size, hidden size
        c0 = torch.zeros(1, images.size(0), self.rnn.hidden_size).to(images.device) # num_layers * batch_size, hidden size

        rnn_output, _ = self.rnn(features, (h0,c0)) # rnn_output = [batch_size, sequence_length = 1, hidden_size]

        output = self.fc(rnn_output[:, -1, :]) #output = [batch_size, vocab_size]
        return output

# Example usage
model = CNN_RNN_Single(rnn_hidden_size=256, vocab_size=1000) # Example values for vocab_size and hidden size
dummy_image_batch = torch.randn(32, 3, 224, 224) # batch of 32 images
caption_length = torch.tensor([1]) #Dummy Sequence length for batch = 1

output = model(dummy_image_batch, caption_length)
print(output.shape) # Should be [32, 1000]
```
This example shows how a single image is passed through a CNN, flattened, and then treated as the single time step input for the RNN.

Now, what if we are dealing with sequence of images? This is where we need to be careful. A typical example is video classification or action recognition. We need to extract the CNN features *for each frame* and treat them as a sequence. Here’s an example illustrating this.

**Example 2: Image Sequence Input (Video Classification):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

class CNN_RNN_Sequence(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, rnn_hidden_size, num_classes, num_rnn_layers=1):
        super(CNN_RNN_Sequence, self).__init__()
        self.cnn = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
        self.cnn = nn.Sequential(*list(self.cnn.children())[:-2])
        for param in self.cnn.parameters():
           param.requires_grad = False # Freeze the CNN weights

        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
        cnn_output_size = self.flatten(self.cnn(dummy_input)).shape[1]

        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(input_size=cnn_output_size, hidden_size=rnn_hidden_size, num_layers=num_rnn_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(rnn_hidden_size, num_classes)


    def forward(self, images):
      # images shape: [batch_size, seq_len, channels, H, W]

        batch_size, seq_len, channels, height, width = images.size()
        cnn_input = images.view(batch_size * seq_len, channels, height, width)
        features = self.cnn(cnn_input) # shape [batch_size * seq_len, feature_map_dim, h, w]
        features = self.flatten(features) # shape [batch_size * seq_len, flattened_dim]
        features = features.view(batch_size, seq_len, -1) # shape [batch_size, seq_len, flattened_dim]

        # Initialize the hidden and cell states at the start of the sequence.
        h0 = torch.zeros(1, images.size(0), self.rnn.hidden_size).to(images.device)
        c0 = torch.zeros(1, images.size(0), self.rnn.hidden_size).to(images.device)

        rnn_output, _ = self.rnn(features, (h0,c0))
        output = self.fc(rnn_output[:, -1, :])
        return output

# Example usage
model = CNN_RNN_Sequence(rnn_hidden_size=256, num_classes=10)
dummy_image_sequence = torch.randn(32, 10, 3, 224, 224)  # batch of 32 sequences, each with 10 frames
output = model(dummy_image_sequence)
print(output.shape) # Should be [32, 10]
```

In the video classification example above, I reshaped the input tensor and applied the CNN to each frame within a sequence, transforming the collection of frames into a corresponding collection of CNN-extracted features. This collection of features, then, forms the input sequence to the RNN layer.

Finally, if you are dealing with sequential images and generating a sequential output (e.g., video captioning), you need to combine the single-image example and the image sequence example. It becomes an extension of the sequence example, but the RNN layer will not output a single classification, but a sequence.

**Example 3: Image Sequence Input, Sequence Output (Video Captioning):**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

class CNN_RNN_Seq2Seq(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, rnn_hidden_size, vocab_size, num_rnn_layers=1):
        super(CNN_RNN_Seq2Seq, self).__init__()
        self.cnn = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
        self.cnn = nn.Sequential(*list(self.cnn.children())[:-2])
        for param in self.cnn.parameters():
           param.requires_grad = False # Freeze the CNN weights
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
        cnn_output_size = self.flatten(self.cnn(dummy_input)).shape[1]
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(input_size=cnn_output_size, hidden_size=rnn_hidden_size, num_layers=num_rnn_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(rnn_hidden_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, images, captions):
      # images shape: [batch_size, seq_len, channels, H, W]
      # captions shape [batch_size, caption_length]

      batch_size, seq_len, channels, height, width = images.size()
      cnn_input = images.view(batch_size * seq_len, channels, height, width)
      features = self.cnn(cnn_input) # shape [batch_size * seq_len, feature_map_dim, h, w]
      features = self.flatten(features) # shape [batch_size * seq_len, flattened_dim]
      features = features.view(batch_size, seq_len, -1) # shape [batch_size, seq_len, flattened_dim]

      # Initialize the hidden and cell states at the start of the sequence.
      h0 = torch.zeros(1, images.size(0), self.rnn.hidden_size).to(images.device)
      c0 = torch.zeros(1, images.size(0), self.rnn.hidden_size).to(images.device)

      rnn_output, _ = self.rnn(features, (h0, c0)) #Output will have shape [batch_size, seq_length, hidden_size]
      output = self.fc(rnn_output)
      return output


# Example usage
model = CNN_RNN_Seq2Seq(rnn_hidden_size=256, vocab_size=1000)
dummy_image_sequence = torch.randn(32, 10, 3, 224, 224) #Batch size, sequence_length, channels, H, W
dummy_captions = torch.randint(0, 1000, (32,20)) #Batch size, sequence_length
output = model(dummy_image_sequence, dummy_captions)
print(output.shape) # Should be [32, 10, 1000]
```
This example, shows a common approach, feeding the image representation for each time step, and then generating a sequence of words. This architecture also serves as a general purpose encoder-decoder, where the encoder can be a CNN, followed by an RNN or a transformer, and the decoder is typically an RNN or a transformer.

For deeper understanding of the underlying concepts, I would highly recommend checking out the seminal works on image captioning and video understanding such as:
*   **"Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator"** by Vinyals et al., (2015), which is a great starting point for image-to-text tasks.
*   **"Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Visual Recognition and Description"** by Donahue et al., (2015). This is great for understanding the spatio-temporal fusion aspects.
*   For a good treatment of sequence to sequence models, read through **“Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks”** by Sutskever et al., (2014).

Also, the official documentation and tutorials for Pytorch or Tensorflow, depending on your preference, offer numerous practical implementations of CNN-RNN models.

Remember to tune your model hyperparameters and perhaps experiment with other CNN architectures depending on the specifics of your task. Good luck.
