Alright,  Encoding the subject header when using `System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient` isn't as straightforward as you might initially think, particularly if you're aiming for robust handling of special characters. I’ve certainly bumped into this in past projects, notably one where we were dealing with a global client base and character encoding inconsistencies kept messing up email subjects. Let me walk you through it, drawing from my experience and throwing in some code examples.

First, the crux of the issue is that the email subject header, according to internet standards, has limitations on the characters it can directly contain. Characters beyond the basic ASCII range, along with certain reserved characters, need to be encoded. While base64 isn't typically used for email subjects in its raw form, it becomes an essential component when implementing *MIME encoded-word* syntax, which uses base64 to encode text data.

The `System.Net.Mail.MailMessage` class doesn’t automatically handle this encoding for you in a truly comprehensive manner, especially when considering display in diverse email clients. So, we have to take matters into our own hands. This means that instead of just assigning a string to `MailMessage.Subject`, we'll be crafting the subject string ourselves in the format required by MIME, which has the general structure: `=?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=`.

Here's a breakdown of the key components and how we use them with base64 encoding:

*   **`charset`**: This specifies the character set used in the text, typically utf-8 for maximum compatibility.
*   **`encoding`**: This indicates the encoding method, and in our case, it's `B` for base64.
*   **`encoded-text`**: This is the base64 encoded text of the subject.

Now, let's look at how to construct this. The essential part is getting the base64 encoding of your subject text, wrapped in the proper mime syntax.

**Code Example 1: Simple Base64 Subject Encoding**

This example demonstrates the basic principle of creating the subject string using UTF-8 encoding and base64:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.Text;

public class EmailSender
{
    public void SendEmail(string toAddress, string subjectText)
    {
        using (var message = new MailMessage())
        {
            message.To.Add(toAddress);
            
            // Encode the subject
            string encodedSubject = EncodeSubject(subjectText, "utf-8");

            message.Subject = encodedSubject;
            message.Body = "This is the email body.";

            using (var client = new SmtpClient("your_smtp_server"))
            {
                //configure smtp client here with credentials etc.
                client.Send(message);
            }
         }
    }


    private static string EncodeSubject(string text, string charset)
    {
      byte[] bytes = Encoding.GetEncoding(charset).GetBytes(text);
      string base64String = Convert.ToBase64String(bytes);
      return $"=?{charset}?B?{base64String}?=";
    }
}
```

In this snippet, the `EncodeSubject` function converts the input text into a byte array using the specified character set, gets its base64 representation and then wraps it with the appropriate MIME encoded-word syntax. This approach ensures that, even if the subject text contains non-ASCII characters, they will be delivered and displayed correctly in the majority of email clients. Please note that you need to configure the `SmtpClient` with your server details and authentication details to actually send an email.

However, this simple encoding might fall short when dealing with extremely long subject lines. RFC 2047 limits the length of each encoded-word to 75 characters, excluding the charset and encoding markers. We need to handle these longer subjects by splitting them up into multiple encoded-words.

**Code Example 2: Handling Long Subject Lines**

Here’s a modified example, taking into account the RFC 2047 length limitation:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.Text;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class AdvancedEmailSender
{
    public void SendEmail(string toAddress, string subjectText)
    {
        using (var message = new MailMessage())
        {
            message.To.Add(toAddress);

            // Encode the potentially long subject
            string encodedSubject = EncodeLongSubject(subjectText, "utf-8");
            message.Subject = encodedSubject;
            message.Body = "This is the email body.";

            using (var client = new SmtpClient("your_smtp_server"))
            {
                //configure smtp client here with credentials etc.
                client.Send(message);
            }
        }
    }

    private static string EncodeLongSubject(string text, string charset)
    {
        byte[] bytes = Encoding.GetEncoding(charset).GetBytes(text);
        string base64String = Convert.ToBase64String(bytes);

        var encodedWords = new List<string>();
        int chunkSize = 75; // Limit based on RFC 2047
        for (int i = 0; i < base64String.Length; i += chunkSize)
        {
            int length = Math.Min(chunkSize, base64String.Length - i);
            string chunk = base64String.Substring(i, length);
            encodedWords.Add($"=?{charset}?B?{chunk}?=");
        }
        return string.Join(" ", encodedWords);
    }
}
```

The `EncodeLongSubject` method breaks the base64 encoded string into chunks of at most 75 characters. It then wraps each chunk in MIME encoding syntax and concatenates them with spaces. This ensures the subject is both properly encoded and conforms to the length constraints. Remember to also handle situations where the individual encoded words themselves do not fit within the headers length limit. You can use header folding for that, which you can read about in RFC 5322. In practice though, subject lines of this length become hard to read for users.

**Code Example 3: Subject Encoding with Pre-existing Mime Markers**

There is also the case, although quite niche, where you receive the subject pre-formatted as a mime header, but that includes invalid encoding. In that instance, we would need to parse and re-encode it:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class EmailSenderWithRepair
{
  public void SendEmail(string toAddress, string subjectText)
  {
    using (var message = new MailMessage())
    {
      message.To.Add(toAddress);

      // Attempt to repair the subject if it contains mime headers
      string repairedSubject = RepairSubject(subjectText);

      message.Subject = repairedSubject;
      message.Body = "This is the email body.";

      using (var client = new SmtpClient("your_smtp_server"))
      {
        //configure smtp client here with credentials etc.
        client.Send(message);
      }
    }
  }


    private static string RepairSubject(string subject)
    {
        string mimePattern = @"=\?([^?]+)\?([QB])\?([^?]+)\?=";
        var matches = Regex.Matches(subject, mimePattern);

        if (matches.Count == 0)
        {
            // Nothing to do.
           return EncodeSubject(subject, "utf-8");
        }

        var repairedSubjectParts = new List<string>();
        int lastIndex = 0;
      
        foreach (Match match in matches)
        {
            if (match.Index > lastIndex)
            {
                repairedSubjectParts.Add(subject.Substring(lastIndex, match.Index - lastIndex));
            }

            string charset = match.Groups[1].Value;
            string encoding = match.Groups[2].Value;
            string encodedText = match.Groups[3].Value;
            
           if (encoding.Equals("B", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
             {
                 try
                 {
                    byte[] decodedBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(encodedText);
                    string decodedText = Encoding.GetEncoding(charset).GetString(decodedBytes);
                    repairedSubjectParts.Add(EncodeSubject(decodedText, "utf-8"));
                 }
                 catch (FormatException)
                 {
                     // Base64 decoding failed for some reason. just leave it and continue.
                     repairedSubjectParts.Add(match.Value);
                 }
             }
          else
          {
            // other encodings not handled for brevity. add if necessary
              repairedSubjectParts.Add(match.Value);
          }
           lastIndex = match.Index + match.Length;
        }
      
        if (lastIndex < subject.Length)
        {
          repairedSubjectParts.Add(subject.Substring(lastIndex));
        }
     
        return string.Join("",repairedSubjectParts);
    }

     private static string EncodeSubject(string text, string charset)
    {
      byte[] bytes = Encoding.GetEncoding(charset).GetBytes(text);
      string base64String = Convert.ToBase64String(bytes);
      return $"=?{charset}?B?{base64String}?=";
    }
}
```

Here, the `RepairSubject` method first checks if the subject contains encoded mime parts. If it does, it then extracts the charset, encoding, and encoded text. If the encoding is base64, it attempts to decode it, and re-encode it with UTF-8 and re-build the mime subject. Other encodings are left as is. If it does not contain mime encoded parts, the regular `EncodeSubject` method is used. This approach attempts to handle existing partially encoded subject headers you might receive from external sources and ensures consistent formatting.

For a deep dive into these standards, I highly recommend consulting RFC 2047, RFC 5322, and, for more general mail transport specifics, RFC 5321. Understanding these underlying documents will provide a solid foundation when working with email encoding. “Programming Microsoft.NET” by Jeff Prosise is another excellent resource which provides some background. Additionally, the book “Internet Messaging” by Marshall Rose covers the foundations of email technologies.

In summary, tackling base64 encoding for subject headers requires a clear understanding of both the `System.Net.Mail` classes and MIME encoding standards. By implementing these approaches you'll be equipped to handle complex subject lines, ensuring correct delivery and display of your emails across different email clients. This is definitely not something that should be overlooked, as consistent email rendering goes a long way in ensuring your communications are received effectively.
