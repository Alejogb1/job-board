Alright, let’s unpack this. I’ve seen this exact scenario more times than I care to remember, and it almost always boils down to subtle differences in implementation, even when the declared architectures appear identical. The fact that you’re seeing an arithmetic error in one model where the other, seemingly identical model doesn't, points to underlying discrepancies that aren’t immediately obvious. It’s rarely about the architecture itself, but rather how that architecture is instantiated and trained.

Here's how I typically approach troubleshooting such issues, drawing from a rather painful experience back when I was working on a complex image processing pipeline for medical imaging. We had two convolutional neural networks, declared with the same layers in Keras, but one was occasionally spitting out NaNs (not a number) during training, leading to arithmetic errors, while the other was humming along nicely. It was frustrating, to say the least.

First, let's consider the most likely suspects. The architecture might look identical on paper, but differences can arise in:

1.  **Weight Initialization**: If the weights are initialized differently, even with seemingly random initialization, you can see markedly different training behaviors. Some initializations might place weights in a region of the parameter space that leads to exploding gradients and eventually, NaNs, due to numerical instability.
2.  **Data Preprocessing**: Even seemingly benign differences in data preprocessing, such as mean normalization, scaling, or shuffling, can impact the learning process dramatically. One model could be exposed to slightly different data distributions, leading to divergent learning paths and potentially numerical instability issues.
3.  **Regularization**: Even if you specify the same kind of regularization (e.g., L2 weight decay or dropout), the actual implementation can vary depending on the framework or even small changes to settings.
4.  **Learning Rate and Optimization Parameters**: These are crucial. The selected learning rate, or other optimizer parameters like momentum and Adam's beta coefficients, significantly impact convergence and stability. The same rate can be stable for one model's initialization but lead to divergence for another with different weights.
5.  **Floating-Point Precision**: This is less frequent but worth considering. If one model is being trained with 32-bit floats and the other with 16-bit floats, it's more likely to see numerical errors in the 16-bit training. Different hardware could default to different precision settings, which is something many overlook.

Let's look at some illustrative examples:

**Example 1: Weight Initialization**

Let's suppose we're using PyTorch. Here are two models that, while architecturally the same, use different initialization strategies:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Model 1: Default Initialization
model1 = SimpleModel()

# Model 2: Custom Initialization (Xavier)
model2 = SimpleModel()
def initialize_weights(m):
    if isinstance(m, nn.Linear):
        nn.init.xavier_uniform_(m.weight)
        nn.init.zeros_(m.bias)
model2.apply(initialize_weights)


# Dummy input
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Forward Pass
output1 = model1(dummy_input)
output2 = model2(dummy_input)
print("Output Model 1:", output1)
print("Output Model 2:", output2)
```

Even though the model architectures are identical, this simple initialization change can lead to drastically different training outcomes. Model 2, due to the Xavier initialization, might show faster and more stable training. The same architecture, initialized differently.

**Example 2: Subtle Differences in Data Preprocessing**

Now, consider a scenario where data is preprocessed differently:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Dummy Data
data1 = np.random.rand(100, 10)
data2 = np.random.rand(100, 10)

# Preprocessing for Model 1: No Scaling
processed_data1 = data1

# Preprocessing for Model 2: Standard Scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
processed_data2 = scaler.fit_transform(data2)

print("Mean Data 1:", np.mean(processed_data1))
print("Mean Data 2:", np.mean(processed_data2))
print("Variance Data 1:", np.var(processed_data1))
print("Variance Data 2:", np.var(processed_data2))


```

Model 1 receives raw input, while model 2 is exposed to standardized data. This difference can profoundly affect how the models learn, and it’s possible one of these preprocessing methods could exacerbate gradient issues. One could lead to a stable training, while the other is prone to issues.

**Example 3: Regularization Differences**

Finally, let’s look at a regularization difference:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a similar Simple Model (from Example 1)
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Model 1: No L2 Regularization
model1 = SimpleModel()
optimizer1 = optim.Adam(model1.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Model 2: With L2 Regularization (weight decay)
model2 = SimpleModel()
optimizer2 = optim.Adam(model2.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-5)

# Dummy input
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
# Dummy target
dummy_target = torch.randn(1, 2)


# Simulate a training step for both model.
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

optimizer1.zero_grad()
output1 = model1(dummy_input)
loss1 = criterion(output1, dummy_target)
loss1.backward()
optimizer1.step()

optimizer2.zero_grad()
output2 = model2(dummy_input)
loss2 = criterion(output2, dummy_target)
loss2.backward()
optimizer2.step()

print("Model 1 Parameters after one training step:", model1.fc1.weight[0,:5])
print("Model 2 Parameters after one training step:", model2.fc1.weight[0,:5])

```

Here, model 2 incorporates L2 regularization, which penalizes large weights during training. This seemingly small change, can significantly stabilize training. The weights might be larger for Model 1 and thus be more prone to larger gradients.

When troubleshooting issues like this, I’d recommend a meticulous approach:

1.  **Framework Check**: Ensure both models are truly using the same backend. If you are using different versions of a library, then it might exhibit different behaviors.
2.  **Reproducibility**: Attempt to reproduce the issue consistently across multiple runs. Random seeds will help.
3.  **Step-by-Step Comparison**: Carefully log or print out the values of key variables (weights, gradients, outputs) at each step in the training process. If there is a divergence in the training, you should spot it early.
4.  **Gradient Analysis**: Specifically, track the magnitudes of the gradients during backpropagation. Exploding gradients can be a common cause of numerical errors and are often the result of overly large learning rates or incorrect weight initialization.
5.  **Loss Tracking**: Plot both the training and validation loss. Are both trending down smoothly? If the loss of one model is exhibiting abrupt changes, then that model is the culprit.

To deepen your understanding, I highly recommend examining *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville for the fundamental concepts. For more practical aspects related to numerical stability, look into *Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing* by William H. Press et al. These are resources that have helped me debug this and similar issues numerous times.

In my experience, the issue is almost never the architecture declared in the code, but rather in the details of *how* that architecture is implemented and trained. It’s a debugging process, and patience is key. So, start investigating the differences in implementation and trace the divergence; you'll likely pinpoint the source of the arithmetic error soon enough.
