Alright, let's break down this somewhat perplexing epoch count discrepancy. It seems you're observing a situation where your model is reporting 647 epochs, despite you explicitly specifying only 5 epochs for training. That's not unusual when dealing with complex deep learning workflows, and I've definitely seen similar situations myself. I remember back in my early days of training convolutional nets for image recognition – specifically, one model for classifying microscopic images – I got tripped up by this exact issue, and it took me a while to understand what was truly happening behind the scenes.

The root of the problem, and what you are likely experiencing, lies in the subtle differences between how we define epochs and how the training loop actually progresses through your data, especially when using specific tools like data loaders or similar abstractions. The number of 'epochs' you specify is often a high-level instruction, whereas the internal mechanism might iterate based on 'steps' or 'batches'. An *epoch*, in theory, represents one full pass through the entire training dataset, while a *step* or a *batch* is one iteration where a subset of the data is processed for gradient calculation and model update.

Here's the breakdown. With a dataset of 23,000 samples and a batch size of 32, one 'epoch' will be completed after the entire dataset is fed through the network in batches. More precisely, it requires (23000 / 32) = 718.75 steps to complete a single epoch. Since steps must be whole numbers, this typically gets rounded up to 719 steps per epoch. This number signifies the *number of iterations per epoch*. Similarly, your validation set with 2300 samples and batch size of 32 requires (2300/32) = 71.875 which is generally rounded up to 72 steps for full validation.

Now, if you intend for your model to train for 5 epochs, the total steps performed should be approximately 719 * 5 = 3595, give or take some minor rounding variations. What you're seeing (647 epochs), however, suggests your training code likely isn’t interpreting your 'epoch' value at the high level you expect. Instead, it's probably configured to track training iterations at the batch level, where the loop is likely counting up each iteration and confusing 'iterations' with 'epochs' at this level. This is quite common when working with custom or improperly configured training loops or when certain libraries implicitly manage iteration counts. Let me illustrate with examples using Python.

**Example 1: Incorrect Tracking (Potential Source of Issue)**

Here, a typical scenario where an improperly configured training loop leads to confusion:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Simulate data
X_train = torch.randn(23000, 10)
y_train = torch.randint(0, 2, (23000,)).float()
X_val = torch.randn(2300, 10)
y_val = torch.randint(0, 2, (2300,)).float()


train_data = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
val_data = TensorDataset(X_val, y_val)

train_loader = DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_data, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)


class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)
    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc(x))

model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.BCELoss()


epochs = 5
epoch_count = 0

for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = criterion(output, target.unsqueeze(1))
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    epoch_count += 1
    print(f"Batch number: {batch_idx}, Reported Epoch: {epoch_count}, Loss: {loss.item()}")


print(f"Total epochs reported (incorrect): {epoch_count}")
```

In this code, we're iterating through batches and incrementing `epoch_count` with each batch – completely disregarding the concept of a full pass through the dataset. The output would incorrectly report an extremely large 'epoch' count (close to the 3595, as computed before). This is effectively counting the iterations, not true epochs.

**Example 2: Correct Tracking using Nested Loops**

Let's correct this by implementing proper epoch tracking using nested loops:

```python
epochs = 5
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target.unsqueeze(1))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        if batch_idx % 100 == 0: #Print every 100th batch to reduce clutter
            print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Batch: {batch_idx}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1} completed")


```
Here, the 'epoch' is now correctly defined. The outer loop represents a full traversal of the training data, and the inner loop iterates over batches within that epoch. We've now correctly separated the concept of batch steps and epochs, ensuring proper training.

**Example 3: Using Callbacks for Tracking**

Many frameworks provide built-in callbacks or utilities to manage epochs correctly, which simplifies your code:

```python
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR

epochs = 5
writer = SummaryWriter() #For Tensorboard tracking, can be omitted
scheduler = StepLR(optimizer, step_size = 1, gamma=0.9) # For learning rate scheduling, can be omitted


for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.train()
    running_loss = 0.0
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target.unsqueeze(1))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        running_loss += loss.item()

    avg_loss = running_loss / len(train_loader)
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch + 1}, Avg Training Loss: {avg_loss}")
    writer.add_scalar('Training Loss', avg_loss, epoch) #Log the loss to Tensorboard, can be omitted

    model.eval()
    val_loss = 0.0
    with torch.no_grad():
      for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(val_loader):
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target.unsqueeze(1))
        val_loss+= loss.item()

    avg_val_loss = val_loss/len(val_loader)
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch + 1}, Avg Validation Loss: {avg_val_loss}")
    writer.add_scalar('Validation Loss', avg_val_loss, epoch) #Log the validation loss to Tensorboard, can be omitted
    scheduler.step()

writer.close() #Close the Tensorboard writer, can be omitted

```
Here we can see an example of how one might calculate average losses per epoch and log them using an external logger like Tensorboard. Additionally, we add an example of how to implement a learning rate scheduler to reduce the learning rate at a set interval, allowing us to control convergence.

**Recommendations for Resources:**

To understand these concepts more deeply, I highly recommend consulting the following resources:

1.  **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This book is the gold standard for theoretical underpinnings of deep learning, covering all aspects of training, including datasets, batching and the mathematics behind neural networks.
2.  **The official documentation of your chosen deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow):** These are the primary resources for how the training loops work in that specific framework, including details about data loaders and custom training procedures. Look specifically for sections related to `DataLoader`, training loops, and callbacks.
3.  **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron**: This book provides clear, practical examples of using Keras and Tensorflow, which includes common training loop pitfalls and best practices for avoiding them.
4.  **Research papers on specific training techniques:** Search for papers that address best practices on training loops, learning rate scheduling, and optimization methods.

In summary, the discrepancy you're seeing almost certainly arises from how your code is interpreting 'epochs' versus individual steps through batches. You're very likely iterating at the step level and incorrectly tracking the count as epochs. Ensure your code correctly uses nested loops or built-in framework utilities to reflect what constitutes a full pass over your dataset and not simply iterations within each epoch. I’ve spent countless hours debugging similar issues and I can say, getting the details correct often significantly changes the performance and stability of the model. Good luck!
