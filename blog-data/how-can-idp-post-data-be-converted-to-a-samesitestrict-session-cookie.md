Okay, let's tackle this. Handling IdP responses and translating them into secure session cookies, particularly with `SameSite=Strict`, is a topic I’ve navigated quite a bit in past projects, particularly when dealing with sensitive data across different domains. The crux of the matter lies in the careful orchestration of the IdP’s response and how we leverage that to establish a secure and reliable session within our application. It’s not always straightforward, but understanding the mechanics helps significantly.

The core challenge, as you rightly pointed out, involves receiving data, often as a `POST` request from an identity provider (IdP), and using that data to establish a session managed by a `SameSite=Strict` cookie. This means we're dealing with a cross-site context which, in a standard setup, would block the setting of the cookie. However, there's a workaround: the temporary redirect.

The general flow involves these steps: After the user authenticates with the IdP, it redirects the user back to our application, typically using a `POST` request with the authentication assertion (e.g., SAML, OIDC). We cannot directly set the session cookie from this initial post; the browser will reject the set-cookie directive from the response due to `SameSite=Strict`. Our application will receive the POST request and handle the assertion by validating the signature. Once we have the validated data, we need to perform a temporary redirect (a 302 or 303 response). This redirect should send the user to a page on our domain. Within the redirect response, we include the `set-cookie` header. By issuing this redirect response from our server with the cookie header, we bypass the SameSite restriction because the browser now considers the cookie to be set within our domain's context.

Let's delve into some code examples to illustrate this more concretely, considering both PHP and Python as common backends. Note that these are simplified examples for clarity; in a production setup, robust error handling, proper security practices like CSRF protection, input validation, and a robust secure token generator should always be used.

**Example 1: PHP implementation**

```php
<?php

// Assume we receive the POST request with the IdP assertion here.
// In a real-world scenario, you would validate the signature
// of the assertion and extract user information.

// Simplified user data retrieval
$userId = "user123"; // Replace with actual retrieval from the decoded assertion

// Create session identifier (e.g., using a secure token generator)
$sessionId = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));

// Store user session data (e.g., in a database or session store)
// For this example, we'll skip persisting data
// and only set the session cookie.

//Set the cookie before redirect
header("set-cookie: session_id={$sessionId}; httponly; samesite=strict; path=/; secure");

// Temporary redirect to a page on our domain
header("Location: /dashboard", true, 303);
exit;

?>
```

Here, after validating the IdP response (which is not shown in detail to keep the code minimal), we're creating a session id. Most importantly we're sending a `set-cookie` header with `samesite=strict` with the redirect. It is also marked `secure` meaning only secure https connections will send the cookie. Finally, we issue a redirect to our application's dashboard page. The browser will follow the redirect and send future requests, from the dashboard, to the application with the cookie.

**Example 2: Python (Flask) implementation**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, redirect, make_response
import secrets

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/idp_callback", methods=["POST"])
def idp_callback():
    # In reality, you'd validate the IdP response here.
    # Simplified user identification
    user_id = "user456" # Replace with real user data from decoded assertions
    session_id = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)

    # Session logic - normally data persistence and retrieval should take place.

    response = make_response(redirect("/dashboard", 303))
    response.set_cookie('session_id', session_id, httponly=True, samesite='Strict', secure=True)
    return response


@app.route("/dashboard")
def dashboard():
    return "Welcome to the dashboard!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In the Flask example, the same logic holds. The `/idp_callback` route handles the initial POST request and generates a unique session id. We then construct a response with a redirect to `/dashboard` and include the `set-cookie` header with the session id, same-site attribute, and secure flag.

**Example 3: NodeJS (Express) implementation**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const app = express();
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // To parse URL-encoded bodies
app.use(cookieParser());

app.post('/idp_callback', (req, res) => {
    //  In reality, validate the IdP response here.
    const userId = "user789"; // Simulated user ID from validated assertion
    const sessionId = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');


    res.cookie('session_id', sessionId, {
      httpOnly: true,
      sameSite: 'strict',
      secure: true,
      path: '/',
    });
    res.redirect(303, '/dashboard');
});

app.get('/dashboard', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the dashboard!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server started on port 3000'));

```
Here, the NodeJS example uses `express` and `cookie-parser`. Similarly, the `/idp_callback` route is where we handle the POST and generate the session and issue a redirect. It will add the `Set-Cookie` response header to the redirect.

The key takeaway from all these examples is the redirect with the `set-cookie` header. This step is fundamental to circumventing the restrictions imposed by `SameSite=Strict` in cross-site `POST` requests. It allows you to correctly set a secure session cookie when the user is redirected back to your domain from the IdP.

For deeper understanding of these concepts, I'd recommend diving into the following resources:

1.  **"High Performance Browser Networking" by Ilya Grigorik:** While not solely focused on session management, this book provides an excellent overview of how browsers work, including details about cookies and networking protocols, which is essential for understanding the nuances of `SameSite`.
2.  **RFC 6265:** This is the original specification for HTTP state management mechanisms, specifically cookies. It provides the foundation for understanding how cookies work.
3.  **RFC 7034:** This discusses the `SameSite` cookie attribute and the reason for its introduction, including the different options: `strict`, `lax` and `none`.
4.  **"OAuth 2 in Action" by Justin Richer and Antonio Sanso:** Specifically, look into chapters that cover security and token handling. Though focusing on Oauth2, the principles of handling sensitive authentication data are universal.

Implementing `SameSite=Strict` cookies correctly is critical for modern web applications. This isn’t simply about adhering to security recommendations; it's about crafting a secure and robust session management system, and a thorough grasp of the underlying protocol mechanics will help prevent problems down the road. I have found it, from past experience, that the redirect with set-cookie is the way to go when implementing security authentication.
