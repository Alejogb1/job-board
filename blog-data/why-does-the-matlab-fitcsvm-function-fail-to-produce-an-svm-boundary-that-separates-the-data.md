Alright, let's tackle this. I've seen this particular problem manifest itself more times than I’d care to recount, usually involving some frustrating late-night debugging sessions. The fact that `fitcsvm` in MATLAB doesn't always generate a separating hyperplane as expected – especially when it seems like it should – stems from several intertwined factors. It's not necessarily a bug, but more about the underlying assumptions and how we, as users, are interacting with the algorithm.

The core issue usually boils down to these major points: data characteristics, parameter tuning, and the underlying optimization process. Let’s break each of these down and I'll provide some illustrative examples based on real scenarios I've encountered over the years.

First, the data itself can be the culprit. It’s quite common to have data that isn’t linearly separable, or worse, is poorly conditioned. Linear separability means that a hyperplane can perfectly divide the dataset into distinct classes. If that’s not possible, the classic SVM tries to find the best compromise, which might not look like a clear division to the human eye or might not be the division we're expecting. Poor conditioning, on the other hand, can make the optimization process incredibly difficult. This can occur with features that have vastly different scales, or, worst case scenario, data which has some features that are linear combinations of other features.

Consider this scenario I had working on a project involving sensor data. We had a dataset with two classes that, on the surface, looked perfectly separable. However, after applying `fitcsvm`, the resultant decision boundary was subpar. I eventually diagnosed the problem, and the data was not fully separated because of an outlying data point for one of the classes. This outlying point caused `fitcsvm` to overcompensate. Let’s simulate a basic version of this case with some code:

```matlab
rng(123); % For reproducibility
data_class1 = [randn(40, 2) + 2; 10, 10]; % Intentionally add an outlier to class 1
data_class2 = randn(40, 2) - 2;

X = [data_class1; data_class2];
Y = [ones(41, 1); -ones(40, 1)]; % Class labels

svm_model = fitcsvm(X, Y, 'KernelFunction', 'linear', 'Standardize', true);

figure;
gscatter(X(:,1), X(:,2), Y);
hold on;
plot(X(svm_model.IsSupportVector, 1), X(svm_model.IsSupportVector, 2), 'ko', 'MarkerSize', 10);

sv = svm_model.SupportVectors;
b = svm_model.Bias;
w = svm_model.Beta;
x1_range = min(X(:, 1)):0.1:max(X(:, 1));
x2_sep = -(b + w(1)*x1_range) / w(2);
plot(x1_range,x2_sep, 'r-');

hold off;
```

In this code, I deliberately added an outlier to `data_class1`. As you see when you run it, the linear boundary generated by the SVM is skewed trying to "accommodate" the outlier, demonstrating how data characteristics can significantly influence the results. You might see that the margin does not separate the classes perfectly as you would expect.

The second crucial aspect is parameter tuning. `fitcsvm` offers numerous parameters, and if not configured appropriately, it can easily stumble. One of the most relevant parameters is the ‘kernel function’, which dictates the nature of the boundary – linear, polynomial, or radial basis function (RBF), for instance. If your data exhibits a complex, non-linear relationship, a linear kernel will simply not cut it, regardless of how perfect the data seems. Similarly, if you are using other kernel options such as the RBF kernel, the regularization parameter, `BoxConstraint`, and the ‘kernel scale’ (`KernelScale`) also require correct configuration. Using a RBF kernel with a low `KernelScale` value may overfit the data, while a high one might not provide the needed granularity to find an appropriate boundary.

Let's take a look at a case where data is better separated with a RBF kernel. I was working on a project involving image data classification and had an issue similar to this one: The linear kernel couldn't form an adequate separation of the data, and the use of a RBF kernel was required. The linear kernel led to incorrect classifications on some regions of the input space. Here’s a code example:

```matlab
rng(42); % For reproducibility

% Generate data for two non-linearly separable classes
r1 = sqrt(rand(50,1))*4;
theta1 = rand(50,1)*2*pi;
data_class1 = [r1.*cos(theta1), r1.*sin(theta1)];

r2 = sqrt(rand(50,1))*10 + 6;
theta2 = rand(50,1)*2*pi;
data_class2 = [r2.*cos(theta2), r2.*sin(theta2)];

X = [data_class1; data_class2];
Y = [ones(50, 1); -ones(50, 1)];

% Linear kernel
svm_model_linear = fitcsvm(X, Y, 'KernelFunction', 'linear', 'Standardize', true);
% RBF Kernel
svm_model_rbf = fitcsvm(X, Y, 'KernelFunction', 'rbf', 'Standardize', true, 'KernelScale', 2);

figure;
subplot(1,2,1);
gscatter(X(:,1), X(:,2), Y);
hold on;
plot(X(svm_model_linear.IsSupportVector, 1), X(svm_model_linear.IsSupportVector, 2), 'ko', 'MarkerSize', 10);
sv_l = svm_model_linear.SupportVectors;
b_l = svm_model_linear.Bias;
w_l = svm_model_linear.Beta;
x1_range_l = min(X(:, 1)):0.1:max(X(:, 1));
x2_sep_l = -(b_l + w_l(1)*x1_range_l) / w_l(2);
plot(x1_range_l,x2_sep_l, 'r-');
title('SVM with Linear Kernel');
hold off;

subplot(1,2,2);
gscatter(X(:,1), X(:,2), Y);
hold on;
plot(X(svm_model_rbf.IsSupportVector, 1), X(svm_model_rbf.IsSupportVector, 2), 'ko', 'MarkerSize', 10);
title('SVM with RBF Kernel');
hold off;

```

In this code, you will see that the decision boundary of the RBF kernel correctly separates the data, while the linear boundary fails to do so. This illustrates how the kernel selection matters significantly.

Finally, let's touch on the underlying optimization problem. The SVM seeks to minimize a cost function while simultaneously maximizing the margin between the classes. The optimization process isn't always smooth sailing, especially when dealing with complex datasets. If the optimization algorithm gets stuck in a local minimum, it might converge to a suboptimal solution. Adjusting the optimizer parameters or switching between different solvers can sometimes alleviate this issue. For example, the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm is generally used by default for SVMs; however, it might not converge in all cases. In particular, datasets that are very unbalanced or high dimensional can be problematic for the default solver, in this case we might choose to use an alternative solver. I've had instances where switching to the ‘ISDA’ solver in MATLAB’s fitcsvm resulted in convergence to the desired solution after the default one failed. It’s not a silver bullet, but something to consider.

Here is a minimal code snippet demonstrating this:

```matlab
rng(111);

% Generate some data with overlapping classes and high dimensionality
X = randn(100, 50);
Y = [ones(50,1); -ones(50,1)];

% Linear Kernel and default solver:
svm_model_default = fitcsvm(X,Y, 'KernelFunction', 'linear', 'Standardize', true);

% Linear Kernel and ISDA solver:
svm_model_isda = fitcsvm(X,Y, 'KernelFunction', 'linear', 'Standardize', true,'Solver', 'ISDA');

fprintf('Number of support vectors with SMO solver: %d\n',sum(svm_model_default.IsSupportVector));
fprintf('Number of support vectors with ISDA solver: %d\n',sum(svm_model_isda.IsSupportVector));

```

In the above example, you will see the number of support vectors when each solver is used. In some instances, and especially with high dimensionality, the two solvers can obtain significantly different values of support vectors, and even different boundaries. Note that this particular example doesn't generate a visual output of the boundary, since 50-dimensional data cannot easily be visualized.

In summary, when `fitcsvm` doesn't produce the expected result, the issue rarely lies with the function itself but is more often due to the nature of your data, the parameters you chose, and the optimization limitations. Pay close attention to the data distribution, experiment with different kernel functions, tune parameters like `BoxConstraint` and `KernelScale`, and consider exploring alternative solver options. And as always, if your SVM fails even after thorough tweaking, consider using more advanced methods like ensemble methods or feature engineering to make the problem more tractable.

For further reading, I highly recommend "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, particularly chapter 12 on support vector machines. This book provides a robust theoretical and practical foundation for understanding these algorithms and is a go-to resource for anyone serious about machine learning. Another useful resource is "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop. Specifically, chapter 7 on kernel methods and chapter 4 on linear models. These will help strengthen your intuition.
