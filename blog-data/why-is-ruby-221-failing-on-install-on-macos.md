Alright, let's address this ruby 2.2.1 installation issue on macOS. It's a situation I've encountered more than once, and it typically boils down to a handful of very specific reasons stemming from underlying system changes and dependency incompatibilities that became prominent after the fact. It’s not necessarily a reflection of a fundamental flaw in ruby itself, but more a result of the environment it is trying to operate within.

The core issue with ruby 2.2.1 on modern macOS boils down to its reliance on older versions of `libssl` (OpenSSL) and related dependencies. Apple, in their quest for enhanced security, has moved forward with newer iterations of these libraries, leaving older software, like ruby 2.2.1, in a state of conflict. When you attempt to install ruby 2.2.1, the compilation process fails during the linking phase because the symbols it expects from OpenSSL are either missing or have different signatures in the modern system libraries.

Now, let me break this down further. I recall a project back in 2017 where we had a legacy application stubbornly clinging to ruby 2.2.1. We initially tried installing it directly with `rvm` or `rbenv`, and faced immediate build errors. It was frustrating at the time because all we wanted was to get it up and running, and we had this dependency nightmare. We learned the hard way that direct installation was not the solution.

The compiler errors, if you were to inspect them closely, usually point directly to the `openssl` library during the `make` process, indicating missing or undefined symbols, or version incompatibilities. This isn't a problem specific to any particular ruby installation tool; it's a fundamental conflict between the ruby source and what the operating system provides.

To resolve this, we needed to control the environment where ruby 2.2.1 was being built. This meant building ruby against a compatible OpenSSL version. There are multiple routes to accomplish this, but one reliable method involves leveraging the `--with-openssl-dir` option during the `ruby-build` process (if using `rbenv`) or modifying environment variables within RVM or similar tools.

Here are three different scenarios, each with a corresponding code snippet that represents how we might resolve this problem:

**Scenario 1: rbenv with explicit OpenSSL installation**

In this approach, we'll explicitly install a compatible OpenSSL version, making it available at a defined path. We then configure `rbenv`'s build process to use this specific version.

```bash
# Install a known good openssl version (e.g., 1.0.2)
brew install openssl@1.0
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0/bin:$PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0/include"

# Install ruby 2.2.1 with rbenv, pointing to our custom OpenSSL dir
rbenv install 2.2.1 --with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0
rbenv global 2.2.1
```

This snippet first installs `openssl@1.0` using Homebrew (ensure you have it installed). We then modify the `PATH`, `LDFLAGS`, and `CPPFLAGS` environment variables to make sure the build process links against the specific version we installed. Finally, the `rbenv install` command is executed, utilizing the `--with-openssl-dir` option to tell `ruby-build` where to find the necessary headers and libraries. We then set this as the global ruby version.

**Scenario 2: Environment variable approach with rbenv**

This second option uses environment variables to pass configuration options, bypassing the direct use of `--with-openssl-dir` for those who prefer a cleaner command structure.

```bash
export RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0"
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0/bin:$PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0/include"

rbenv install 2.2.1
rbenv global 2.2.1
```

Here, `RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS` tells the build process to use our specific OpenSSL directory. This can be useful if you're automating installation across many systems, as you keep the core `rbenv` command less cluttered. The other environment variables ensure proper linking.

**Scenario 3: RVM with custom flags**

For users of RVM (ruby version manager), the approach is slightly different but conceptually similar:

```bash
rvm install 2.2.1 --with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.0
rvm use 2.2.1 --default
```

Similar to `rbenv`, RVM also supports the `--with-openssl-dir` option during the install. You'll also need to ensure OpenSSL is installed and reachable by RVM's build process, just like in the `rbenv` examples above. RVM, however, typically handles the `LDFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS` setting internally, which is what we've taken into account here and not explicitly defined those variables, though it is still something you might have to configure. The important part is the flag during installation. This example shows how RVM lets you easily set a default version once installed.

These examples illustrate that the fundamental challenge is getting the ruby 2.2.1 build process to correctly link against an OpenSSL version that it understands. The specifics of how to achieve this varies based on your installation tool (`rbenv`, `rvm`, etc), but the core strategy remains the same – control the OpenSSL environment during ruby's compilation.

For further in-depth exploration, I highly suggest consulting the official documentation for your specific ruby version manager, specifically focusing on build options. Also, the OpenSSL project's website and documentation are invaluable for understanding how to work with different OpenSSL versions. Additionally, *“Understanding Unix/Linux Programming”* by Bruce Molay provides essential details on system programming which greatly aids in troubleshooting such compilation issues. Furthermore, while older, *“The Art of Software Production”* by Neil Fenton contains important information about dependency management strategies, applicable to solving this exact problem.

Finally, always ensure that you're retrieving these dependencies (specifically OpenSSL) from trusted sources such as Homebrew or official project websites. This provides a layer of security by minimizing exposure to modified or malicious builds. It also prevents further frustration by making sure the right version is in place. The scenarios outlined above, while not exhaustive, represent methods that have successfully addressed the ruby 2.2.1 installation challenges I’ve faced in the past. I hope it gives you a good start.
