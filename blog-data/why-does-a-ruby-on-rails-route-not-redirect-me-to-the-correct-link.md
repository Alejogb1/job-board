Let's tackle this route redirection puzzle, shall we? I've certainly encountered this particular head-scratcher more times than I care to count over the years. Back when I was developing a rather ambitious e-commerce platform—a project that, looking back, seemed designed to test my sanity—I ran into this exact problem. The user would click 'submit,' and instead of ending up where they should, they'd land somewhere completely unexpected, or worse, get stuck in a redirection loop. It's frustrating, to put it mildly, and more often than not, the solution isn't as simple as it seems.

The root causes of incorrect redirections in Rails routes are multifaceted, ranging from syntax errors in your routing configuration to subtle inconsistencies in your controller logic, or even interaction issues with request parameters. Let's break down the most common scenarios I’ve seen and how to troubleshoot them effectively.

Firstly, a classic mistake is a misconfigured routes.rb file. This file is the heart of Rails routing; any errors here will ripple throughout your application. For example, imagine you have a resource defined as:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
resources :products do
  member do
    get 'review'
    post 'submit_review'
  end
end
```

And in your controller, you’re trying to redirect after a successful review submission like this:

```ruby
# app/controllers/products_controller.rb
def submit_review
  # ...processing logic...
  redirect_to product_path(@product), notice: 'Review submitted successfully.'
end
```

Now, if instead of `product_path` you mistakenly use `products_path`, you'll be redirected to the index of all products rather than the show page for the specific product. This might seem trivial, but in a complex application, such small errors are surprisingly common and lead to quite a lot of debugging time.

A deeper look might reveal that you intended to use `product_review_path(@product)` to redirect back to the `review` action within the same resource but ended up using the wrong path helper entirely. In this particular case, ensuring you are using the *correct* path helper is paramount. The output of `rails routes` in your terminal is a crucial tool to make sure that you use the correct route path when redirecting. It gives a detailed breakdown of all the routes you've defined and the corresponding path helpers. It's an invaluable resource that every Rails developer should know and utilize.

Secondly, the issue might lie in your controller’s `redirect_to` calls, particularly how they handle parameters. Consider a scenario where you have a nested resource like this in your `routes.rb`:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
resources :users do
  resources :orders
end
```

And your intention is to redirect after creating a new order, such as:

```ruby
# app/controllers/orders_controller.rb
def create
  @order = current_user.orders.build(order_params)
  if @order.save
    redirect_to user_order_path(user_id: current_user.id, id: @order.id), notice: 'Order created!'
  else
    render :new
  end
end
```

Here, you are explicitly providing `user_id` and `id` parameters to construct the URL for the `user_order_path`. This approach is workable but could be improved for maintainability. Rails provides the flexibility to infer these from the objects themselves rather than relying on passing each parameter individually. A more idiomatic way is:

```ruby
# app/controllers/orders_controller.rb
def create
  @order = current_user.orders.build(order_params)
  if @order.save
    redirect_to user_order_path(current_user, @order), notice: 'Order created!'
  else
    render :new
  end
end
```

The main problem here can arise when you incorrectly include or exclude a needed parameter, especially with nested resources. It’s essential to make sure all the required parameters for the path are present, and, to use the most idiomatic syntax for more concise, less error-prone code. I’ve seen instances where a developer would forget to pass a critical identifier, like the `user_id` in the previous case, resulting in the application failing to locate the correct route and often leading to an unexpected redirect.

Thirdly, consider the order of routes definition within `routes.rb`. The order matters a lot. Routes are matched sequentially, and the first match wins. If you have a general route definition before a more specific one, the specific route might never be reached, which could lead to incorrect redirects or unexpected behavior. For example:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
get 'profiles/:id', to: 'profiles#show'
resources :users
```
In this case, any url for the `show` action inside users resources `/users/:id` will match the `profiles/:id` route. Therefore the user will not be directed to the user’s controller and the expected `users#show` action. The correct way to define the routes would be:
```ruby
# config/routes.rb
resources :users
get 'profiles/:id', to: 'profiles#show'

```
It’s an easy mistake to make, especially in a growing application where the route file has many lines. Understanding the precedence of your route definitions is key. The rule to remember here is: *more specific routes should generally be defined before more general routes*.

Finally, there are cases where the redirection problem isn’t a problem with the Rails routes themselves but rather how the redirection is being initiated. A common situation involves JavaScript executing a form submission and not handling the response from the server correctly. If your form submission triggers a JavaScript event that manages the response, it’s imperative to ensure that the JavaScript code correctly processes the redirection. It might be preventing the default behavior of the form submission and not redirecting to the location specified by Rails. This can occur if an error is introduced within the JS code that stops the propagation of form events or if you are overriding the default HTML form behaviour without including a manual redirection afterwards. In the case of AJAX requests, the browser won't follow redirects automatically and you will need to handle them within your javascript code.

To further your understanding of routing mechanisms and request handling in web frameworks, I recommend delving into these technical resources:
1. **The Ruby on Rails Guides** — The official documentation is an invaluable resource, particularly the "Rails Routing from the Outside In" guide. It provides a comprehensive overview of all routing options, strategies, and common pitfalls.
2. **"Agile Web Development with Rails 7" by Sam Ruby, David Bryant Copeland, and Dave Thomas** — This book is a practical guide to building Rails applications and includes a thorough explanation of routing and redirection techniques.
3. **"Understanding REST APIs" by Leonard Richardson and Mike Amundsen** – It provides a solid theoretical base for designing API routing in general. This can help avoid errors in your routes when your application has API endpoints.

In conclusion, if you are experiencing incorrect redirections, take a methodical approach. Check your routes file for syntax errors and proper definitions. Verify that you’re using the correct path helpers, and that your controller code correctly extracts and passes all required parameters. Pay close attention to how your JavaScript interacts with the form submission process, if any. Remember, a methodical approach and a clear understanding of how Rails handles routing are the foundation of an efficient development process. I've seen too many hours spent in debugging sessions that could have been avoided by taking it one step at a time and ensuring each piece of the routing mechanism is correctly configured.
