Okay so scraping LinkedIn without actually being logged in yeah that's a whole thing. It's not a free for all data party. Basically LinkedIn does not want you poking around if you're not a registered and active user. They put up walls man. Lots of walls.

First big issue is access. Unauthenticated scraping means you're seen as a generic web visitor not a user which translates to way less data visibility. They serve up severely stripped down versions of profiles if they serve them up at all. The public facing parts yeah you might get those but forget seeing all the good stuff like past positions detailed skill lists endorsements connections and a whole lot more of the juicy bits you actually want.

Think of it like going to a library without a library card. You can walk around look at some titles on the shelves maybe read a book description on the cover but you can't borrow anything or get inside the main stacks where the cool books live. That's essentially your experience scraping LinkedIn without logging in.

Another thing is rate limiting. They're watching. LinkedIn has systems in place that detect unusual traffic patterns. If it spots what looks like a robot rapidly hitting their site without any user sessions they'll block your IP address or throw up a captcha wall. You become a ghost to them basically. No data for you. They are extremely aggressive about this. Its not like you hit a threshold and they just ask you to slow down they will cut you off.

Also the website is dynamic. So scraping can be unpredictable. The layout changes. The classes of elements used for information can be renamed. What worked today might completely fall apart tomorrow. Without a session LinkedIn can do whatever they want with the page and your scraping setup might break down entirely. They know that you are not logged in so you have no expectation of seeing things correctly. This constant flux is a pain to keep up with. You're always chasing a moving target and that is a lot of dev time. You also have to deal with CSRF tokens anti-bot protections all these things are significantly more difficult to bypass without a valid session.

And then there’s the legal and ethical question. Scraping data without explicit permission from a platform is a grey area at best. LinkedIn's terms of service explicitly forbid it. They can and do send legal notices and even take legal action. They want to control their data and prevent misuse. Youre effectively violating an agreement when you bypass that and it comes with potential consequences. It’s generally understood that circumventing their security measures without authorisation is a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or similar laws.

So for all these reasons scraping without a LinkedIn session is just a very difficult proposition. It's more time more pain and not a guaranteed result. You are much better off exploring official APIs if available or using methods that comply with their terms of service.

Let’s look at this in terms of examples. Imagine you're trying to get a job title from a LinkedIn profile using some Python and Beautiful Soup but without any session data.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/some-public-profile/"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

job_title = soup.find(class_='pv-top-card-v2-section__headline')

if job_title:
    print(job_title.text.strip())
else:
    print("Job title not found or accessible without an active session")
```

This might work sometimes on a very basic stripped down profile. Maybe even the title is there sometimes if its a very simple profile. But its unreliable.

Now lets say you were looking for the summary which is much harder to get.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/some-public-profile/"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

summary = soup.find(class_='pv-about-section')

if summary:
    print(summary.text.strip())
else:
    print("Summary not found or inaccessible without an active session")

```

Good luck with this one. You will likely be met with a big blank or a "Sign in to see more" message. This kind of data is deliberately hidden without a session and even if it is there its in a very different structure.

Finally think about the skill list something that people might want for talent searches.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/some-public-profile/"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')


skills = soup.find_all(class_='pv-skill-category-entity__name-text')
if skills:
    for skill in skills:
        print(skill.text.strip())
else:
    print("Skills not found or inaccessible without an active session")
```

This one is basically not going to work at all. This is a section that heavily relies on your session to show and also has a lot of dynamic loading. You might see an empty list or again some message stating you need to log in. The data is just not there if you are not authenticated.

So the bottom line is if you are trying to get LinkedIn data without a session you are going to hit a lot of roadblocks. The website is not designed to be scraped like this. Its designed to present personalised information to logged-in users so bypassing the login is going to be very difficult and unreliable.

As for resources to learn more about ethical web scraping and the legalities involved I would check out papers like "The Ethics of Web Scraping" or "Automated Data Collection: Legal and Policy Implications" for a deep dive into the legal aspects. For technical insights on how websites detect and prevent scraping look for research on techniques like "Anti-Bot Technologies" and "Web Scraping Detection Methods". These will provide a detailed background on how websites like LinkedIn implement protections. You can find these in academic journals and in the computer science literature databases. Books on website security also discuss these defensive practices in depth, so its best to delve into these as there are no real shortcuts. You will need to build a base understanding of both.
