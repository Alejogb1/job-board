, let's unpack this. The question of completely suppressing repainting in Swing is one that, in my experience, often surfaces when developers are grappling with performance issues or trying to achieve very specific visual effects. It's a question with a nuanced answer, not a simple yes or no. I've certainly had my share of late nights trying to optimize various custom swing components over the years, and the intricacies of repainting were often at the heart of the matter.

The fundamental issue here lies in Swing's architecture. Swing's drawing mechanisms, as you likely know, are primarily driven by an event dispatch thread (edt). Repaints, ultimately, are requests to the EDT to render parts of or entire components. The system typically determines what needs repainting based on a combination of factors: changes to component properties, user interactions, window resizing, and explicit calls to `repaint()`. Consequently, a "complete" suppression of repainting – in the sense of eliminating *all* rendering – is usually not possible or even desirable for components that are supposed to display or update content. The challenge, then, is less about outright suppression and more about controlled and efficient repainting.

Now, let’s address what one can meaningfully achieve. It is possible, through specific techniques, to *minimize* or defer repaints or to control the circumstances under which a repaint occurs, giving the *illusion* of complete suppression. For example, we can use double buffering to avoid flickering, control the areas that are repainted, or strategically manipulate when `repaint()` gets called. These methods can dramatically improve the user's perception of performance even if repaints themselves aren’t entirely eliminated at the system level.

Here's a breakdown of how one would typically approach this, alongside some code examples:

**1. Using Double Buffering:**

Swing, by default, does utilize double buffering for most components; however, it’s crucial to understand how to influence it directly, especially in custom painted components. When you paint directly to a component’s graphics context without a buffer, the drawing operations could be partially visible during a redraw, leading to a jarring flicker effect. Manual double buffering can help eliminate this.

Here’s how to implement it:

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;

public class BufferedPanel extends JPanel {

    private BufferedImage buffer;

    @Override
    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        if (buffer == null || buffer.getWidth() != getWidth() || buffer.getHeight() != getHeight()) {
            buffer = new BufferedImage(getWidth(), getHeight(), BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB);
        }
        Graphics2D bufferGraphics = buffer.createGraphics();
        // perform all painting operations on the buffer
        bufferGraphics.setColor(Color.BLUE);
        bufferGraphics.fillRect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight());
        bufferGraphics.setColor(Color.YELLOW);
        bufferGraphics.fillOval(10, 10, 50, 50);
        bufferGraphics.dispose(); // good practice to release graphics resources
        g.drawImage(buffer, 0, 0, null);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Double Buffered Panel");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.add(new BufferedPanel());
        frame.setSize(300, 200);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

In this example, the component always paints to a `BufferedImage` (our buffer) and then renders the buffer to the actual component. This gives the perception of a single, smooth update rather than multiple flickering draws. We're not *suppressing* a repaint, but we're making the visual output appear as one distinct update and thus reduce the flicker.

**2.  Controlling Repaint Areas:**

Instead of blindly calling `repaint()` on a whole component, which can be expensive, we can focus on just repainting the specific areas that need updating. This is especially useful for complex visuals with many discrete elements.

Consider this:

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D;

public class SelectiveRepaint extends JPanel {

    private Rectangle2D.Double movingRect = new Rectangle2D.Double(10, 10, 50, 50);
    private double dx = 1;
    private double dy = 1;

    public SelectiveRepaint() {
        Timer timer = new Timer(20, e -> {
            Rectangle2D.Double oldRect = (Rectangle2D.Double) movingRect.clone();
            movingRect.x += dx;
            movingRect.y += dy;

            if (movingRect.x > getWidth() - movingRect.width || movingRect.x < 0) {
                dx = -dx;
            }
            if (movingRect.y > getHeight() - movingRect.height || movingRect.y < 0) {
                dy = -dy;
            }

            // Calculate the union of the old and new rects
            Rectangle damageRect = oldRect.createUnion(movingRect).getBounds();
            repaint(damageRect);
        });
        timer.start();
    }
    @Override
    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g); // Clear background
        Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;
        g2d.setColor(Color.RED);
        g2d.fill(movingRect);
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Selective Repaint");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.add(new SelectiveRepaint());
        frame.setSize(300, 200);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

Here, instead of calling `repaint()`, we calculate a "damage rectangle" that encloses both the old and new position of a moving rectangle.  We then use `repaint(damageRect)` to trigger a repaint only for the necessary area, rather than the whole panel. Again, we are not *suppressing* repainting, just *limiting* it to only the necessary region.

**3. Deferring Repaints:**

Sometimes, you want to delay repaints until a series of changes have been made, rather than repainting after each minor change. You could, for example, accumulate changes in a batch and perform the repaint only when a certain condition is met. Here’s an overly simplified illustration:

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;


public class DeferredRepaint extends JPanel {

    private List<Integer> data = new ArrayList<>();

    public DeferredRepaint() {
        Timer timer = new Timer(100, e -> {
            //Simulating some changes
            data.add((int) (Math.random() * 200));
            if(data.size() % 10 == 0){
             repaint(); // Repaint every 10 changes, deferring some updates
            }
        });
        timer.start();
    }
    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;

        int yOffset = 20;
        for (Integer value : data) {
            g2d.drawString(String.valueOf(value), 10, yOffset);
            yOffset += 15;
        }
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Deferred Repaint");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.add(new DeferredRepaint());
        frame.setSize(300, 300);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}

```

In this example, data is being updated continuously. However, the component only repaints every 10 changes to `data`. The other changes are "deferred" and thus the repainting frequency reduced. This kind of approach will improve perceived performance if the changes are happening very frequently.

**In conclusion,**

While you can’t completely eliminate repainting in Swing in the absolute sense, you can and should control *when* and *how much* repainting occurs. These techniques, used judiciously, allow you to build performant Swing applications.

For further reading, I highly recommend exploring books such as "Filthy Rich Clients" by Chet Haase and Romain Guy, which details how Swing handles drawing mechanisms. Also, the official Java documentation for `javax.swing.JComponent` and related classes in the AWT package is crucial for a deeper understanding of this area. Understanding how Swing manages its rendering pipeline is fundamental to tackling the challenges of performance optimization in complex graphical UIs. I would also encourage diving into any research papers dealing with specific drawing algorithms that address specific kinds of drawing optimization. You might find some useful ones that can be adapted to the needs of your Swing application. Remember, controlling, not suppressing, is the key to optimal rendering in Swing.
