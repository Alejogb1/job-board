well, alright, let’s talk about tensorflow checkpoints, because i’ve definitely spent way too much time staring at them. it’s one of those things that seems simple on the surface, but there’s a good bit going on under the hood, and i’ve had my fair share of headaches because of it, particularly back when i was messing around with custom training loops for a reinforcement learning agent using some bleeding edge tf version at the time. it was 2.1, i think? it caused all sorts of issues, anyway…

basically, tensorflow checkpoints are the system’s way of saving the state of your model. and i don’t just mean the weights of your neural network, it’s more than that. it captures all the trainable variables associated with your model and any associated optimizers if you tell it to do so. think of it as a snapshot of your model’s brain, preserved at a certain point in its training. this is crucial for various reasons; think long training runs on beefy servers that could crash at any moment.

the way it operates is by mapping variable names to their tensors and then storing all this information in a set of files. it doesn't save the model architecture in the checkpoint, only the variable data so we always need the model definition handy. these files are usually a combination of a “checkpoint” file that tracks the saved variable data, and a set of data files that end with a `.data-00000-of-XXXXX` suffix. the `xxxxx` part is just the numbering when it needs to break up the checkpoint into multiple parts. it’s important to keep all of this together, or the checkpoint won’t work. i’ve done that before… lost a bunch of training time because i moved one file thinking it was not relevant. ugh!

the core operation behind this is a specialized serialization process. tensorflow figures out which variables are trainable, gathers their current values and serializes them into a format that can be written to disk, along with any metadata required to restore them accurately. the key here is that it's designed for efficient and reliable storage and retrieval. tf uses protobufs for this if i recall, which is neat.

from a user perspective, this is exposed via the `tf.train.Checkpoint` class or its higher-level api like the keras `model.save_weights` or even higher using `model.save`, but they all have a checkpoint instance hidden beneath. let me show a quick code example using `tf.train.Checkpoint` in a low level way.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# define our little model here
class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(MyModel, self).__init__()
    self.dense_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')
    self.dense_2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.dense_1(inputs)
    return self.dense_2(x)

model = MyModel()

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001)

checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model, optimizer=optimizer)
checkpoint_prefix = "./training_checkpoints/ckpt"

# let's say we trained for a while...

# saving the checkpoint.
checkpoint.save(file_prefix=checkpoint_prefix)
print(f'checkpoint saved in {checkpoint_prefix}')
```

what i am doing here, is creating a `tf.train.Checkpoint` object, and passing the model and the optimizer instances to it, then calling the `save` function, and it saves the model’s weights and optimizer state using the `checkpoint_prefix` path.

when you want to restore a model, you load the checkpoint like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# re-define the model
class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(MyModel, self).__init__()
    self.dense_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')
    self.dense_2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.dense_1(inputs)
    return self.dense_2(x)

model = MyModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001)

checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model, optimizer=optimizer)
checkpoint_path = tf.train.latest_checkpoint("./training_checkpoints")

if checkpoint_path: # we check if there is a checkpoint before we call restore.
    checkpoint.restore(checkpoint_path)
    print(f'checkpoint restored from {checkpoint_path}')
else:
    print('no checkpoints found.')

# we now have our model with the restored weights
```

i am re-defining the model here to simulate that we are in a new session or script, in this case i am using the `tf.train.latest_checkpoint` function to grab the path of the last checkpoint saved in the specified directory. note that the model class definition **has** to be the same, otherwise, you might run into issues, i learned this the hard way once because i changed a name in the model, and it failed to restore, took me a while to realize what was going on!

now, let's do one more example, this time using the keras api as a showcase of the higher level checkpointing:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# simple keras model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(28,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') # we need to compile it.
checkpoint_path = "./keras_training_checkpoints/cp.ckpt"
model.save_weights(checkpoint_path) # we saved the weights in the default tf format, under the hood tf.train.Checkpoint is used.

model.load_weights(checkpoint_path) # we restored the saved weights, neat!
```

in this last snippet we showed how to save and restore weights using the keras api, which is simpler to use, but under the hood, it calls the `tf.train.Checkpoint`, behind the scenes.

one important bit to note, is that a checkpoint only saves the variables, like, for example, the weights and biases of a neural network and optimizer states, but not the model definition or the full computational graph itself. it's just the numerical values of the variables. so the model needs to be defined before loading the weights. if we are saving it using the tf.keras `model.save()` function it stores the model architecture also, using another type of file format, for example, saved models.

now a bit of my experience with all this, as i was saying before, one time i was working with some custom keras training loops, and i forgot to add the optimizer to the checkpoint object, and after a day of training, i restored and realized that my optimizer state was gone. then i had to re-train all again. oh, good times, right?, anyway, i found the tensorflow guides very useful in these issues, they do a good job explaining these things.

also, if you really want to get down into the weeds about serialization and how tensorflow is designed, i would suggest digging into the original tensorflow papers and publications, the details can be surprisingly enlightening and they discuss the design considerations for the framework. i think reading “tensorflow: a system for large-scale machine learning” is a good starting point for that. understanding the underpinnings of this helps you avoid some silly mistakes. also, the official documentation usually has good detail, so that's a valuable resource.
