Alright, let’s tackle this peculiar behavior you’re observing with Rails, ActiveAdmin, and cached sql queries after three page refreshes. It's a classic case of understanding the layered caching mechanisms at play, and it's something I’ve personally encountered in several projects— most notably a complex inventory management system we built a few years back. We kept seeing similar query caching after a couple of refreshes, and it took a little investigation to unearth all the moving parts. The issue isn't necessarily a bug in ActiveAdmin or Rails but more about how these systems manage resources efficiently.

The phenomenon you're describing points to a combination of factors, mainly involving the interaction between Rails’ built-in query caching and, potentially, other layers like browser caching or even database caching. We should examine the following:

*   **Rails Query Cache:** Rails employs a query cache at the application level. This cache operates on a per-request basis within your Rails app. When you execute a database query using Active Record, the results are stored in this cache using the query itself as the key. Subsequent requests, within the same request-response cycle, that execute the same query will retrieve the result from the cache rather than hitting the database. This is efficient for repetitive queries within the scope of the same request, but it doesn't explain the behavior over multiple refreshes. The cache is normally reset at the end of each request. However, the cache is *not* cleared upon a new request coming in from a browser refresh.
*   **Request Lifecycle & Middleware:** The Rails request lifecycle is essential here. Each time you refresh the ActiveAdmin page, you’re initiating a new HTTP request-response cycle. Rails middlewares, including those handling caching, come into play. However, these are specifically request based middlewares and will typically reset on every request.
*   **ActiveAdmin Caching Strategies:** ActiveAdmin itself doesn't introduce its own specific query caching at this level that would influence this behaviour, but it does build on top of rails. If ActiveAdmin makes several of the same queries to the database on a single request then you may notice caching due to the Rails caching layer, which is part of the overall active record stack.
*   **The "Third Time" Phenomenon:** The trick with the three refreshes is likely not hard-coded in Rails. The behaviour you're observing tends to be the compound result of an existing browser caching policy interacting with request and server behaviours, *and specifically* the behaviour that if the browser thinks the page has not changed, it can retrieve the page from the browser cache. Now, this is important because the `ETag` header generated by Rails and used by the browser has a particular expiry time, and will not be regenerated if the server side content and the request are the same. Since Rails has a query cache, after two requests for the same page, the data *on the server* is now static, and therefore when the request is sent, the browser is informed to use the cached copy of the response page. This is why the same queries are suddenly "cached" as there is a lack of change in the data coming to the page to require new queries.

To be clear, that third refresh isn't a magic trigger; it's simply that the initial two refreshes are usually sufficient for the page content to settle enough for the browser caching to become effective with the `ETag`.

To illustrate, consider these scenarios. Let's imagine an ActiveAdmin resource showing a list of products.

**Scenario 1: Initial Page Load (No Caching)**

Here is a simplified example of an ActiveRecord query inside a controller:

```ruby
# In a hypothetical ActiveAdmin controller, something like
def index
  @products = Product.all
  render 'index' # using erb or similar
end
```

On the initial page load, the query `Product.all` hits the database. The data is returned, cached by Rails *for the scope of the request*, and then rendered to the user. The browser recieves a response with a particular `ETag` header, and stores the request information and header data in a cache.

**Scenario 2: Second Refresh (Still No Query Caching)**

Refreshing the page starts a new request. Rails executes `Product.all` again, hitting the database, populating the query cache *for this specific request* and rendering the content and sending another, potentially new, `ETag` if the data changes. Note that the original request's query cache is discarded.

**Scenario 3: Third Refresh (Potential Caching, Data Stability)**

Now, *if* the `products` data hasn’t changed (meaning the result set is identical), a couple of things are likely happening. Firstly, the `ETag` that Rails is sending is the same as the previous request. The browser, knowing the content hasn't changed, may start retrieving the content from it's own local cache using the `ETag` as a lookup key. This means that the browser will not initiate a new network request at all, or will use a conditional get request that can return a `304 Not Modified` which does not require a new page to be transmitted. In this case, even the *conditional* request is not requiring a new query.

This process will not be visible on the Rails server logs as no requests were sent! The lack of a new request means that Rails doesn't run the query at all. The result from the query cache, as always, is discarded once the request has been handled, but this doesn't matter as there was no request at all.

Let's now get a bit more practical with some simplified code examples that show how you can test the caching:

**Example 1: Explicit Rails Query Cache Logging**
This code doesn't control the behaviour, but it does demonstrate the cache in action:

```ruby
# inside the controller
def index
  Rails.logger.info "query cache start"
  @products = Product.all
  Rails.logger.info "query cache end"
  render 'index'
end
```

This simple code will print "query cache start" and "query cache end" to the Rails logs. If you have a page that does multiple database queries, you'll see those log messages surrounding each query if they are run at all. If you are seeing logs during every request, and queries are still cached on the *client* side, this implies a problem is elsewhere.

**Example 2: Conditional Data Updates**

Here's a model modification that will force database changes, which should prevent caching:

```ruby
# In a Product model
before_save :update_timestamp

def update_timestamp
  self.updated_at = Time.now # ensure a change
end
```

With this change, *every* time the object is saved the timestamp is updated. In most systems this is a very common approach to update the data so that new queries are run every time, and no static response is sent to the browser. This demonstrates that *changing* data is the most common way to ensure a query is run every time.

**Example 3: Clearing the Rails Cache**

Although the Rails cache is cleared between requests, it can be manually cleared. This is not usually necessary, but it is useful to understand what the cache is, and how you may need to clear it for testing:

```ruby
# from the console
Rails.cache.clear
# this will clear the query cache in memory

# to completely clear the query cache (if persistent)
# Product.connection.execute('delete from ar_internal_metadata where key="schema_migrations"')
# Rails.cache.clear
```

The first method, `Rails.cache.clear` will only clear the in-memory query cache. If you are using a persistent caching method, like Redis or memcached, then they will need to be manually cleared. The second method here shows a query that will reset the migrations, which will clear the *entire* database structure from the cache.

**What Can You Do?**

1.  **Investigate your browser's caching settings:** Check your browser's developer tools to see how it’s handling `ETag` headers and cached responses.
2.  **Ensure Data Variability:** If data is unchanging, ensure that your queries are designed to always retrieve the latest data. If the data has not changed on the server, then you may need to ensure that the `ETag` header is generated in a way to always cause a new page load, which is usually not recommended. It's usually the reverse of this issue.
3.  **Monitor Database Queries:** Tools like `pg_stat_statements` for postgresql can help identify how often queries are executed by the database itself. Check the slow query logs as well, as if they are slow, they may take longer to execute and the perceived problem may not be caching related at all.
4.  **Rails Caching Documentation:** The official Rails documentation has an excellent section on caching that's worth revisiting. The official ruby on rails guides are an invaluable resource.

In terms of reading, I would highly recommend “*Rails 7: A Pragmatic Guide*” by Stefan Wintermeyer, as well as the official ActiveRecord and Rails caching guides. These resources will provide a detailed understanding of Rails caching mechanisms and best practices. Understanding the intricacies of http caching is also essential, and reading the relevant sections of *High Performance Web Sites* by Steve Souders will be very beneficial to give you a broader understanding.

In closing, the three-refresh behavior is more about the confluence of request lifecycle, caching layers, browser caching and the stability of the data, rather than a specific feature or bug. Armed with the right debugging techniques, and a solid understanding of each part of the stack, these issues can be resolved methodically.
