Let’s tackle this, shall we? It's not unusual to encounter scenarios where the default tokenization behavior of pre-trained models, particularly Wav2Vec2 with its connectionist temporal classification (CTC) tokenizer, doesn't quite fit the nuances of your specific audio data. I’ve certainly been there, having worked on a project several years back involving heavily accented speech recognition, where the standard tokenizer struggled with certain phonetic patterns. So, instead of just accepting the defaults, let’s explore how you can customize a Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer with specific rules.

Fundamentally, the Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer, like most tokenizers, is built around the idea of converting raw input, in this case, audio, into a sequence of discrete units or tokens that the model can understand. The pre-trained tokenizer is trained to capture a specific distribution of sounds from its training dataset. When you encounter datasets that deviate from this distribution, customizations become essential. Customization, in this context, isn't about rewriting the whole tokenizer from scratch. Instead, we're usually talking about modifying the vocabulary (the set of possible tokens) and/or the tokenization rules (how the input is converted to those tokens).

One of the primary customization points is modifying the `vocab.json` and `merges.txt` files, which are the foundation of many tokenizers. You'd typically find these within the tokenizer directory after downloading one, say, from Hugging Face's model hub. The `vocab.json` file maps token strings to token ids, and `merges.txt` contains byte-pair encodings (bpe), if used by the tokenizer. Changing these will alter how the tokenizer views the world and what patterns it'll map to its internal representation. We're not going to delve too deep into the theory behind bpe since it is a large area of study in itself; however, being aware it exists and its function is very important for the tokenizer.

The challenge, however, is that directly editing those files and re-initializing the tokenizer often breaks it, or at least drastically reduces its effectiveness. Pre-trained models rely heavily on the token mappings they were trained with; changing them will affect the model's ability to map inputs to meaningful representations. The trick is to *add* new tokens in a way that preserves the meaning of the existing ones and then use these new tokens appropriately in your processing pipeline. This can be accomplished by carefully identifying the missing tokens from your training data, constructing the files appropriately, and properly integrating the tokenizer back into the model’s preprocessing pipeline. This is very important since it impacts the performance of the overall model.

Let's get to the code examples. Assume you are using the `transformers` library.

**Example 1: Adding Custom Tokens**

Suppose your dataset has audio that uses specific non-standard symbols. Let’s say, we need to add "SPK1" and "SPK2" to denote speaker labels for a diarization task. We can't just add these to our dictionary because the tokenizer will not know what to do with this data. It expects to take as input raw audio, not speaker tokens. We can't replace data with this data because then the model will fail. The approach is to add these as new tokens to the vocab and then, during preprocessing, we add these *after* tokenizing the data to indicate the speaker label. In essence, we're not tokenizing these, but rather tagging the *output* of the tokenization.

```python
from transformers import Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer
import json
# Load existing tokenizer
tokenizer = Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h")

# Get existing vocab
vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()

#Add new tokens with the next available ID
new_tokens = ["SPK1", "SPK2"]

for token in new_tokens:
    new_id = len(vocab)
    vocab[token] = new_id

#Update the tokenizer with the new vocabulary
tokenizer.vocab = vocab
tokenizer.ids_to_tokens = {id: token for token, id in vocab.items()}

print(tokenizer.vocab)
print(tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(["SPK1", "SPK2"]))

#Then, during preprocessing of the transcript, append this token to the end or start
#of the token ids: e.g.
example_token_ids = tokenizer.encode("this is an example sentence")
example_token_ids_with_speaker_tag = example_token_ids + [tokenizer.vocab["SPK1"]]
print(example_token_ids_with_speaker_tag)

#Note that it would be up to your model to understand how these tokens are used. You are adding tokens that are outside
#of the scope of the actual model. In this case, we add it to the end of the token id list, but where you put it 
#will depend on the actual architecture.
```

This example demonstrates the core of adding new tokens. Notice, however, the model was not re-trained to learn the connection between these new tokens and audio representations, it simply has placeholders for it. That is what I mean by we are effectively tagging the output with the speaker labels.

**Example 2: Custom Normalization**

Tokenization often includes pre-processing steps like text normalization. In some cases, default normalizations are insufficient, especially with audio transcripts from varied sources. I’ve seen instances, especially with historical recordings, where specific abbreviation conventions require special handling, which was not covered by the standard normalization.

```python
import re
from transformers import Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer

tokenizer = Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h")


def custom_normalization(text):
    # Example: Handling contractions and specific symbols. In practice, you'd want to build out a more
    # complete set of rules for your specific situation
    text = re.sub(r"can't", "cannot", text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    text = re.sub(r"won't", "will not", text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    text = re.sub(r"&", " and ", text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    return text

# Now you use this when generating transcripts which are to be tokenized
example_text = "I can't do that & it won't matter."
normalized_text = custom_normalization(example_text)
encoded_ids = tokenizer(normalized_text).input_ids
decoded_text = tokenizer.decode(encoded_ids)

print(f"original text: {example_text}")
print(f"normalized text: {normalized_text}")
print(f"Encoded ids: {encoded_ids}")
print(f"Decoded text: {decoded_text}") # note that the decode is not 100% reversible. It's just going to decode based on the best match.
```

In the example, we implement a simple `custom_normalization` function. This function contains some string substitution of common abbreviations. Before tokenizing any input, you would first pass it through this normalization. The `transformers` library provides a default normalization function which is used during preprocessing and you can override this behavior. In this case, the original text has contractions and symbols which are normalized to their long-form representation during pre-processing. It is important to remember that the tokenizer is primarily based on a list of tokens that it knows, so these pre-processing steps are very important to ensure the correct mapping is made.

**Example 3: Token Overriding (With Caution)**

This is the most advanced and is rarely needed; it's something that might be used with truly unusual situations where you *must* modify the tokenization itself, but it is very risky. For instance, if the default tokenizer breaks down a very common word in your dataset into sub-word units and causes issues with model performance, we could consider making the entire word a single token, but remember that the underlying model hasn't seen this mapping. However, if the issue is severe enough, we may consider it. The approach would require the tokenizer to be modified before we ever trained the model and retrain the model to learn the mappings.

```python
from transformers import Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer
import json
import copy

tokenizer = Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h")

#Lets say we want to make "audio" a single token instead of subword units
example_text = "This is about audio engineering."
original_ids = tokenizer.encode(example_text)
print(f"Original encoding: {original_ids}")
original_tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(original_ids)
print(f"Original tokens: {original_tokens}")

# Manually create the new token id mapping
vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
new_token = "audio"
if new_token not in vocab:
    new_id = len(vocab)
    vocab[new_token] = new_id

#Update the tokenizer with the new vocabulary and then replace the specific tokenization rules
tokenizer.vocab = vocab
tokenizer.ids_to_tokens = {id: token for token, id in vocab.items()}

def custom_tokenize(text, tokenizer):
    # Split the sentence into individual words.
    words = text.split()
    token_ids = []
    
    for word in words:
         if word == new_token:
            token_ids.append(vocab[new_token])
         else:
            token_ids.extend(tokenizer.encode(word))
    return token_ids
    
custom_ids = custom_tokenize(example_text, tokenizer)

print(f"Custom encoding: {custom_ids}")
print(f"Decoded custom id:{tokenizer.decode(custom_ids)}")
```

This code modifies the tokenizer such that anytime the word `audio` appears, it is converted to its new id directly. Note that this is a *very* strong assumption to make since it completely overwrites any subword tokenization and assumes the model will work well with that mapping. You can also think of the `custom_tokenize` function as an advanced form of pre-processing, where you modify what *comes out* of the tokenizer in terms of token ids.

**Additional Notes**

When customizing, always start by trying to avoid changing the tokenizer directly. Instead, prioritize careful normalization or handling of the output from the tokenizer, like in examples 1 and 2. If you must modify tokens, always perform retraining of the model to ensure it can still make good mapping from your data.

For further reading, I would highly recommend two resources: “Speech and Language Processing” by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin which provides a comprehensive background on natural language processing, and then a deeper dive into sequence to sequence modeling with “Attention is All You Need” the original paper on transformers by Vaswani et.al. These resources will help understand the complexities of tokenization and the limitations that these approaches can pose.

Customizing tokenizers is a nuanced process. The approaches I've outlined provide a good foundation, but the specific implementation will vary based on your dataset and objectives. Keep experimenting and validating your modifications to ensure they improve your model’s performance.
