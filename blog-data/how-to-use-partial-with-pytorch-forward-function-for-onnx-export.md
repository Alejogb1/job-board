Let's tackle this directly. I've seen this particular challenge pop up more than a few times over the years, especially when trying to bridge the gap between PyTorch's flexible forward pass and ONNX's more rigid graph structure. The issue typically stems from the way ONNX traces operationsâ€”it wants a clear, static sequence of operations, and `partial` application, while incredibly useful in Python, can introduce a layer of indirection that throws off the tracer.

Essentially, `partial` from Python's `functools` module lets you create a new function with some of the arguments of an existing function pre-filled. This is fantastic for code reusability and modularity. However, when you're preparing a PyTorch model for ONNX export using `torch.onnx.export`, the tracing process that ONNX uses needs to understand the exact sequence of operations performed by the model's forward pass. If the forward pass relies on a `partial`-wrapped function, the tracer may not be able to correctly determine the actual computation graph because the arguments to the forward pass are not directly being passed to the wrapped function. This leads to a broken ONNX graph that doesn't match what you intended.

So how do we navigate this? The answer involves understanding exactly what the tracer needs to function correctly, which boils down to a direct, traceable execution path for the forward pass. In other words, you need to make sure that all the arguments to the core operations during the model's forward pass are passed directly, without any layer of function currying or indirection.

Let's illustrate with some examples. Imagine, I had to build a convolutional network with varying kernel sizes based on the input. Using `partial` seemed like a neat solution initially.

**Example 1: The Problematic `partial` Approach**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from functools import partial

class MyConvModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, kernel_size):
        super(MyConvModel, self).__init__()
        conv_layer = partial(nn.Conv2d, in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=kernel_size, padding='same')
        self.conv1 = conv_layer(bias=False) # this is where the partial is used.

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        return x

# Let's try and export this to ONNX
model = MyConvModel(kernel_size=3)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)

try:
    torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "conv_partial_bad.onnx", verbose=False)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This example, if you tried to run it, will raise an exception during ONNX export. The specific error will vary depending on the PyTorch version, but it'll consistently point to the `partial` application within the `__init__` method as the source of the failure because the arguments to nn.Conv2d are passed by partial instead of directly. The tracer cannot follow. It's a dead end for it.

**Example 2: A Simple Direct Solution (Preferred)**

The simplest way to resolve this is, obviously, to not use `partial` in a place where it is going to be traced, which is most of the time during model initialization or in the `forward` method. We can instead explicitly define the layers directly. This ensures all argument passing happens within the model's context.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyConvModelFixed(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, kernel_size):
        super(MyConvModelFixed, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=kernel_size, padding='same', bias=False)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        return x

# Export the model
model_fixed = MyConvModelFixed(kernel_size=3)
dummy_input_fixed = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
torch.onnx.export(model_fixed, dummy_input_fixed, "conv_partial_good.onnx", verbose=False)
print("ONNX export successful using the direct approach.")

```

This second approach, with direct instantiation, is the most robust for ONNX export. It is simple, predictable, and will nearly always be the best option. However, sometimes you might really want to structure your code for reusability.

**Example 3: Reusable Function with Direct Application (Alternative if code reuse is a must)**

You might have other reasons for wanting to encapsulate the configuration. In such cases, instead of relying on `partial`, you can use a custom helper function to generate layers while still applying the configuration directly within your class' initialization.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def create_conv_layer(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, padding, bias):
    return nn.Conv2d(in_channels=in_channels, out_channels=out_channels, kernel_size=kernel_size, padding=padding, bias=bias)


class MyConvModelReusable(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, kernel_size):
        super(MyConvModelReusable, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = create_conv_layer(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=kernel_size, padding='same', bias=False)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        return x


# Export the model
model_reusable = MyConvModelReusable(kernel_size=3)
dummy_input_reusable = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
torch.onnx.export(model_reusable, dummy_input_reusable, "conv_partial_reusable.onnx", verbose=False)
print("ONNX export successful using the custom function for reusability.")
```
This achieves a form of reusability, but within the confines of direct application that ONNX can trace successfully. It provides an alternative where you may have numerous configurations or want to parameterize your model definition with helper functions and configurations.

In summary, the key takeaway here is to understand that ONNX export requires a clear, direct path for its tracer. `partial` application breaks that path, which results in the export failing. The remedy is to avoid `partial` where the tracing happens, usually during model initialization or the forward method itself, and instead, apply configurations directly within the model's scope, or use custom functions if you must, ensuring that any parameterized layer creation is still traceable. If you are diving deeper into this topic, the PyTorch documentation for `torch.onnx.export` is your first stop. Then, you can delve into papers on ONNX graph construction and tracing to better understand the underlying challenges. For a comprehensive understanding of deep learning model deployment, consider the book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens et al., which covers model export and deployment strategies extensively. Also, review documentation of your particular ONNX runtime for specific edge-cases that might arise from complex model structure.
