, let’s tackle this. I remember a particularly tricky project back in my early days dealing with recommender systems; it involved intricate feature engineering where I needed precise control over embedding updates. We weren't talking about typical parameter gradients; it was about selectively modifying a single element within an embedding vector, and let me tell you, it wasn't straightforward. So, the question, "How can a single vector element be updated during neural network training?", seems pretty simple on the surface, but it requires some precision in our approach to ensure stability and prevent unwanted cascading effects. Let's unpack the techniques I’ve found effective.

The core challenge arises from the backpropagation algorithm that neural networks use for training. Typically, backpropagation calculates gradients for entire weight tensors, not individual elements within those tensors. Therefore, updating a single element requires surgical precision in how we handle those gradients. You can’t just modify the value directly outside of the optimization loop because you'll bypass the fundamental learning process.

One method, and arguably the most direct, is to create a custom gradient update. This involves masking the gradient so only the desired element is updated. Here’s a conceptual illustration using, let’s assume, a PyTorch-like syntax:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class CustomUpdateModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim, vocab_size):
        super(CustomUpdateModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        return self.linear(embedded)

# Initialize parameters
embedding_dim = 10
vocab_size = 100
model = CustomUpdateModel(embedding_dim, vocab_size)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Define index of element to be updated
index_to_update = 5 # example, modify element at index 5
embedding_idx = 0  # example, index of specific input in the embedding lookup


# Example training step with custom update
def custom_train_step(model, optimizer, criterion, x, y, index_to_update, embedding_idx):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(x)
    loss = criterion(output, y)
    loss.backward()

    # create a mask that is all zeros except for where we want to update
    mask = torch.zeros_like(model.embedding.weight.grad)
    mask[embedding_idx, index_to_update] = 1

    # apply mask to the embedding grad
    model.embedding.weight.grad = model.embedding.weight.grad * mask

    optimizer.step()
    return loss.item()


# Example usage
inputs = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (5,)).long() # 5 random input tokens
targets = torch.randn(5,1) # random targets
epochs = 100

for epoch in range(epochs):
    loss_val = custom_train_step(model, optimizer, criterion, inputs, targets, index_to_update, embedding_idx)
    if epoch % 20 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss_val}")


# Check the updated single element
print("\nFinal embedding vector:")
print(model.embedding.weight[embedding_idx])
```

In this example, a mask is created to zero out the gradients of all embedding weights except for the one we wish to modify. This isolates the update process to only that specific element during optimization. Notice we don't manipulate the weights directly; instead, we work with the gradients before the optimizer applies its step, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the backpropagation cycle.

Another approach, which I've utilized particularly when dealing with attention mechanisms, involves a more nuanced manipulation of the loss function, focusing on only the output that is affected by the specific embedding element. For instance, let's say you have a sequence-to-sequence model, and you wish to force a certain embedding element to contribute more to a particular token’s prediction:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SequenceToSequenceModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim, vocab_size, hidden_dim):
        super(SequenceToSequenceModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.rnn = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        _, hidden = self.rnn(embedded)
        output = self.fc(hidden.squeeze(0))
        return output

# Setup parameters
embedding_dim = 32
vocab_size = 50
hidden_dim = 64
model = SequenceToSequenceModel(embedding_dim, vocab_size, hidden_dim)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(reduction='none') # important: 'none' for manual loss modification

# Element and sequence to affect
index_to_update = 12
embedding_idx = 0
target_token_idx = 2  # example: impact the prediction of token at index 2


# Custom training function with targeted loss
def custom_train_seq_step(model, optimizer, criterion, inputs, targets, index_to_update, embedding_idx, target_token_idx):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss_all = criterion(outputs, targets) # cross entropy on entire sequence

    # only take the loss on a specific output token that's affected by the modified embedding element
    loss = loss_all[target_token_idx] # pick specific loss for gradient modification
    loss.backward()

    # mask the embedding update as before
    mask = torch.zeros_like(model.embedding.weight.grad)
    mask[embedding_idx, index_to_update] = 1
    model.embedding.weight.grad = model.embedding.weight.grad * mask

    optimizer.step()
    return loss.item()


# Generate random data
input_seq = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (1, 10)).long() # batch_size x seq_len
target_seq = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (1, 10)).long().squeeze(0) # target sequence (batch_size = 1)
epochs = 100

for epoch in range(epochs):
   loss_val = custom_train_seq_step(model, optimizer, criterion, input_seq, target_seq, index_to_update, embedding_idx, target_token_idx)
   if epoch % 20 == 0:
      print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss_val}")

# Check updated element
print("\nFinal Embedding Element:")
print(model.embedding.weight[embedding_idx][index_to_update])
```
Here, we only consider the loss generated by the output token we are targeting, using `reduction='none'` in the loss function so it computes the loss for every element individually, which then we can pick and use for our targeted backward pass.

Finally, you could also consider a hybrid method involving both gradient masking *and* loss manipulation. This is particularly helpful if you have multiple objectives related to different elements in the same embedding. As an example, let's consider that we want to affect two indices in the embedding, each with their own target token output:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SequenceToSequenceModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim, vocab_size, hidden_dim):
        super(SequenceToSequenceModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.rnn = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        _, hidden = self.rnn(embedded)
        output = self.fc(hidden.squeeze(0))
        return output

# Setup parameters
embedding_dim = 32
vocab_size = 50
hidden_dim = 64
model = SequenceToSequenceModel(embedding_dim, vocab_size, hidden_dim)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(reduction='none') # important: 'none' for manual loss modification

# Define multiple indices, embeddings and target tokens to affect
indices_to_update = [12, 25]
embedding_indices = [0, 1]
target_tokens = [2, 5]


# Custom training function with targeted loss and gradients for multiple indices
def custom_train_multiple_step(model, optimizer, criterion, inputs, targets, indices_to_update, embedding_indices, target_tokens):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss_all = criterion(outputs, targets) # cross entropy on entire sequence
    total_loss = 0

    # iterate through all indices to affect
    for i in range(len(indices_to_update)):
        loss = loss_all[target_tokens[i]] # pick specific loss for gradient modification
        total_loss += loss # accumulate all the losses for all indices

    total_loss.backward()
    
    # mask the embedding update for all indices
    mask = torch.zeros_like(model.embedding.weight.grad)
    for i in range(len(indices_to_update)):
        mask[embedding_indices[i], indices_to_update[i]] = 1
    model.embedding.weight.grad = model.embedding.weight.grad * mask

    optimizer.step()
    return total_loss.item()


# Generate random data
input_seq = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (1, 10)).long() # batch_size x seq_len
target_seq = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (1, 10)).long().squeeze(0) # target sequence (batch_size = 1)
epochs = 100

for epoch in range(epochs):
   loss_val = custom_train_multiple_step(model, optimizer, criterion, input_seq, target_seq, indices_to_update, embedding_indices, target_tokens)
   if epoch % 20 == 0:
      print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss_val}")

# Check updated elements
print("\nFinal embedding elements updated:")
for i in range(len(indices_to_update)):
    print(f"Element {indices_to_update[i]} at Embedding {embedding_indices[i]}: {model.embedding.weight[embedding_indices[i]][indices_to_update[i]]}")
```

Here, we are creating a training step that takes into account multiple indices to update, and target tokens in the output to impact their update, accumulating losses and applying the gradient mask on the embedding.

For further reading on these topics, I strongly suggest consulting deep learning resources like “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, which provides a thorough theoretical background. For practical implementation details, delve into the PyTorch documentation and resources like the "Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" course materials, particularly the sections dealing with backpropagation and custom loss functions. These resources will provide both the theoretical foundation and the practical know-how to implement sophisticated gradient manipulation techniques like these.
