Okay, let’s unpack this. I remember vividly a project a few years back—we were monitoring a rather complex, containerized application, and the incessant ‘Invalid data format’ errors from our Telegraf tail input were driving the entire ops team a bit bonkers. We had initially chalked it up to a misconfigured log format, but the reality, as often happens, was layered and nuanced. The issue isn’t inherently about Telegraf itself; instead, it typically stems from a mismatch between what Telegraf *expects* and what the log files actually *contain*. Let’s delve into the practicalities of how to troubleshoot and resolve this.

Fundamentally, the Telegraf `tail` input plugin operates by reading new lines appended to specified files, then parsing each line using a configured data format. When it encounters a line that does not conform to that expectation—that's where we see the “Invalid data format” error. It's the parser's way of saying, "I have no idea how to interpret this." These errors usually indicate one of the following scenarios: 1) A genuine misconfiguration of the `data_format`, 2) Data present within the file not matching the defined format, or 3) Occasionally, issues in the file reading itself.

Let’s start with the most prevalent case—the configuration mishap. Within the telegraf.conf file, the tail input plugin usually specifies the `data_format` as ‘grok’ or ‘json’ (amongst others). The `grok` format requires defining a pattern that matches the structure of the log line, while `json` expects the log line to be a valid json document. If the log lines being tailed do not align with that configured format, the error results. For example, if your application logs entries are plain text, yet Telegraf is configured to use `json`, this misconfiguration will trigger the error.

Consider this initial incorrect configuration:

```toml
[[inputs.tail]]
  files = ["/var/log/app.log"]
  data_format = "json"
  json_time_key = "timestamp"
  json_time_format = "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
  name_override = "app_logs"
```

Here, we’ve specified json as the `data_format`, expecting each line of `/var/log/app.log` to be a JSON document. However, if the log file looks like:

```
2023-10-26 10:00:00 INFO: Server started
2023-10-26 10:00:05 ERROR: Connection failed
```

Telegraf will throw the 'Invalid data format' error for each of these lines.

The initial troubleshooting step should always be to examine the actual log file's format. A common initial solution involves switching to a different format when the logs are plain text, using `data_format = "value"`:

```toml
[[inputs.tail]]
  files = ["/var/log/app.log"]
  data_format = "value"
  name_override = "app_logs"
```

In this configuration, Telegraf will treat each log line as a single field named ‘value’, effectively forwarding the text as is. While this stops the error, it's often not the ideal solution, since it prevents structuring data based on fields for effective metric analysis.

Now, let's tackle another common scenario where the format is not completely plain, such as log entries following some structured format like this example:

```
2023-10-26 10:00:00 | INFO  | Server started | component:system
2023-10-26 10:00:05 | ERROR | Connection failed | component:network, error_code:500
```
In this case, using a `grok` pattern can parse each line into fields. Here’s a configuration example that employs `grok`:

```toml
[[inputs.tail]]
  files = ["/var/log/structured.log"]
  data_format = "grok"
  grok_patterns = ["%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:time} \\| %{LOGLEVEL:level}  \\| %{GREEDYDATA:message} \\| component:%{WORD:component}(?:, error_code:%{NUMBER:error_code})?"]
  grok_timezone = "Local"
  name_override = "structured_logs"
```

In this configuration, the `grok_patterns` specifies the format using predefined and custom patterns. This enables Telegraf to extract fields such as `time`, `level`, `message`, `component`, and optionally `error_code`. The grok debugger tool available within the Telegraf documentation or online can help to construct and validate these patterns; a recommended resource is "The Logstash Grok Filter Plugin" documentation, which though tied to logstash, the concepts and syntax of the grok patterns are exactly the same. The `grok_timezone` setting allows for correct timestamp conversion based on the source timezone.

The key is meticulously mapping your grok pattern to the log line's structure. It took us hours, a few late nights, and copious amounts of coffee to get the grok pattern just right for a very specific, vendor-provided application. We had to manually iterate over sample log lines and modify the grok pattern repeatedly until it correctly extracted the fields we were after. This iterative, hands-on debugging is often necessary.

Lastly, if you're dealing with JSON logs but the structure varies slightly, using jq processors in Telegraf can be crucial. Consider this json log line:

```json
{"timestamp": "2023-10-26T10:00:00Z", "level": "INFO", "message": "User logged in", "context": {"user_id": 123}}
```

You want to capture `user_id`. The issue might be `json_query` and how you select nested fields. Instead of doing:

```toml
[[inputs.tail]]
  files = ["/var/log/json.log"]
  data_format = "json"
  json_time_key = "timestamp"
  json_time_format = "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
  json_query = "context.user_id"
  name_override = "json_logs"
```
which would result in error if context doesn't exist, we can include the `jq` processor in Telegraf:

```toml
[[inputs.tail]]
  files = ["/var/log/json.log"]
  data_format = "json"
  json_time_key = "timestamp"
  json_time_format = "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
  name_override = "json_logs"

  [[inputs.tail.processors]]
    [[inputs.tail.processors.exec]]
      command = ["jq", "-r", ".context.user_id // null"]
      name_override = "user_id"
```
The `jq` command effectively extracts the user_id if present, and returns `null` otherwise preventing the 'Invalid data format' error. The `jq` command line processor can handle various transformations and field selections which proves to be invaluable.

In summary, encountering ‘Invalid data format’ errors with the Telegraf tail input typically stems from a format mismatch. Carefully inspect your log file structure, then align your telegraf configuration accordingly. Start by experimenting with the `value` data format, if the log is simple, then incrementally move towards more structured formats like `grok` or `json` when the logging format is more complex. Utilize `grok` debuggers and the `jq` command line processor to tailor your configurations to your specific use case. For a deeper dive, I'd suggest exploring "Effective Monitoring and Alerting" by Slawek Ligus, which covers practical techniques for monitoring various types of applications and how to handle complex log formats, while "Programming in Go" by Mark Summerfield can aid in troubleshooting more complex Telegraf configurations in the future. This was certainly our recipe for taming that particular influx of log errors, and I'm confident it'll provide a solid foundation for your own troubleshooting efforts.
