Let's tackle this challenge. I've seen this specific issue crop up in several projects, particularly when building chat interfaces using various messaging platforms. The frustration of an inline keyboard stubbornly persisting after a user has dispatched their message is quite understandable. It disrupts the flow and can be confusing for users. The key to gracefully removing these keyboards lies in understanding the platform-specific mechanisms for controlling them. The behaviour isn’t uniform across all systems, necessitating distinct approaches for different environments. I’ll walk you through this, breaking it down into core concepts and showing examples across three hypothetical scenarios.

The fundamental principle behind removing an inline keyboard is straightforward: it requires issuing an explicit instruction to the platform’s API that the keyboard should no longer be displayed. Most modern messaging systems handle this via a combination of message sending flags or separate API calls aimed at keyboard management. Critically, these actions must be triggered in response to an event—in this case, the user sending a text message. Let's dive into the details, using a hypothetical platform called "Chatterbox" to illustrate the concepts; I’ll then transition to two more realistic examples.

**Scenario 1: Chatterbox – a simplified conceptual platform**

Imagine “Chatterbox” has an API where you send a message alongside a `reply_markup` field to display an inline keyboard. When a user interacts with the keyboard, they effectively send a ‘callback’ to your application with relevant data from the selected button, enabling you to process further interactions. For this system, let’s assume a simple command is required to dismiss the keyboard on receiving a text message.

```python
# Chatterbox API pseudo-code

def send_message(chat_id, text, reply_markup=None):
    # Simulates sending a message with optional inline keyboard.
    print(f"Chatterbox: Sending '{text}' to chat {chat_id} with keyboard: {reply_markup}")


def remove_keyboard(chat_id, message_id):
    # Simulates removing a previously sent keyboard.
     print(f"Chatterbox: Removing keyboard for message {message_id} in chat {chat_id}.")


def process_message(message):
    chat_id = message['chat_id']
    text = message['text']

    if message['type'] == 'text': # Regular text message
        message_id = message['message_id']  # Assuming we store this ID
        send_message(chat_id, f"Received your message: {text}")
        remove_keyboard(chat_id, message_id)

    elif message['type'] == 'callback_query':
        callback_data = message['data']
        send_message(chat_id, f"You selected: {callback_data}")


# Example usage:

initial_message = {
    'chat_id': 1234,
    'message_id': 5678,
    'type': 'text',
    'text': 'Hello, choose an option:'
}

keyboard = [['Button 1', 'Button 2'], ['Button 3', 'Button 4']]
send_message(initial_message['chat_id'], initial_message['text'], reply_markup = keyboard )

user_message = {'chat_id':1234, 'type':'text', 'text':'Some text message', 'message_id': 5678} #The same message ID as the initial message
process_message(user_message)
```

Here, in `process_message`, we immediately send an acknowledgment message, then call `remove_keyboard` using the `message_id` of the original message which had the keyboard attached. This simplistic example highlights that the principle is to explicitly tell the API to remove the keyboard on receiving the subsequent message or event.

**Scenario 2: Telegram Bot API**

Now, let’s move to a real-world example using the Telegram Bot API. Telegram offers a `reply_markup` parameter, much like our imaginary Chatterbox, to create inline keyboards. However, removing them after text input requires a different approach: editing the original message containing the keyboard to remove the `reply_markup` altogether. You cannot remove a keyboard from any message but the one it is attached to, and you cannot remove it without editing the message. The following shows how to implement this functionality:

```python
import telegram
import telegram.ext
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler, CallbackQueryHandler, MessageHandler, Filters


def start(update, context):
  keyboard = [[telegram.InlineKeyboardButton("Button A", callback_data='A'),
               telegram.InlineKeyboardButton("Button B", callback_data='B')]]
  reply_markup = telegram.InlineKeyboardMarkup(keyboard)
  update.message.reply_text('Choose an option:', reply_markup=reply_markup)

def handle_text_message(update, context):
  message_id = update.message.message_id # Important: grab the original message id
  chat_id = update.message.chat_id
  context.bot.edit_message_reply_markup(chat_id=chat_id, message_id=message_id, reply_markup=None)
  update.message.reply_text(f"Received: {update.message.text}")

def button(update, context):
  query = update.callback_query
  query.answer()
  query.edit_message_text(text=f"Selected option: {query.data}")



def main():
  TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
  updater = Updater(TOKEN, use_context=True)
  dp = updater.dispatcher

  dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
  dp.add_handler(CallbackQueryHandler(button))
  dp.add_handler(MessageHandler(Filters.text, handle_text_message))

  updater.start_polling()
  updater.idle()

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

In this example, the `handle_text_message` function intercepts any text message. It retrieves the `message_id` of the original message containing the keyboard (this is important!) and utilizes `bot.edit_message_reply_markup` to modify this message, setting `reply_markup=None`. This effectively removes the inline keyboard, and then sends a new confirmation message. The key learning here is that message modification, not removal, is the mechanism.

**Scenario 3: Slack API**

Finally, consider Slack’s API for interactive messages. Slack uses JSON payloads for messages and attachments, where interactive components are nested. Removing a keyboard, again, entails updating the original message using the `chat.update` method. This involves providing the original message timestamp and setting an empty `attachments` array or clearing the `actions` field containing the keyboard buttons:

```python
import slack_sdk

def send_slack_message(client, channel, text, attachments=None):
    response = client.chat_postMessage(channel=channel, text=text, attachments=attachments)
    return response['ts'] # Get the timestamp of the original message.

def handle_slack_message(client, channel, original_ts, text):
    # Modify the original message to remove the keyboard components

    client.chat_update(
        channel=channel,
        ts=original_ts,
        attachments=[] # Remove all attachments, including the keyboard
    )
    client.chat_postMessage(channel=channel, text=f"Received message: {text}")

def main():
  SLACK_TOKEN = "YOUR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN"
  slack_client = slack_sdk.WebClient(token=SLACK_TOKEN)

  channel_id = "YOUR_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID"
  keyboard = [
  {
    "type": "actions",
      "elements": [
        {"type": "button", "text": "Option 1", "value": "1"},
        {"type": "button", "text": "Option 2", "value": "2"}
        ]
  }]
  ts = send_slack_message(slack_client, channel_id, "Please choose an option.", keyboard)

  # Simulation of a message received from the user.
  user_text = "some user input"
  handle_slack_message(slack_client, channel_id, ts, user_text)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Here, `handle_slack_message` takes the timestamp (`ts`) of the original message as input, which you would usually store after sending the initial message. We use this timestamp to call `chat.update`, specifically setting `attachments` to an empty list. This deletes any present interactive components. We then follow-up with a new confirmation message that is independent of any keyboard controls.

These examples, spanning a conceptual system and two real-world ones, demonstrate the common thread of actively managing message content rather than passively expecting keyboard removal. The key takeaway is the platform-specific approach.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further and in-depth understanding of these topics, I recommend focusing on platform-specific documentation:

1. **Telegram Bot API documentation:** The official documentation is thorough and contains all the necessary details about the API calls and objects involved.
2. **Slack API documentation:** Slack also has extensive documentation, crucial for understanding how to handle messages and interact with their platform.

By mastering these API specific methods and understanding the underlying principles, you’ll be well-equipped to handle the intricacies of managing inline keyboards in any messaging system. Remember to always refer to official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date details. This direct and explicit manipulation of messages is, in my experience, the most effective and reliable method to solve the presented problem.
