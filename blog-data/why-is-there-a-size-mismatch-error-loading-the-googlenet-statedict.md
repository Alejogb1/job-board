, let's dive into this. It's not uncommon to encounter the frustrating size mismatch error when attempting to load a `state_dict` for GoogLeNet, or any pre-trained model for that matter. I remember facing this issue during a rather complex image classification project a few years back involving specialized medical imaging, which really hammered home the importance of understanding the underlying mechanics of model loading. It wasn't simply plug and play, as I initially hoped, and the debugging process was quite informative.

The core problem stems from discrepancies between the architecture of the model you're trying to load and the model whose `state_dict` you’re loading from. A `state_dict`, in PyTorch for instance, is essentially a Python dictionary mapping parameter names (like `conv1.weight`, `fc.bias`, etc.) to their corresponding tensors (containing the model's weights and biases). When a size mismatch occurs, it means that at least one tensor in the dictionary has dimensions that don’t correspond to the expected dimensions within the architecture you're loading into.

There are several common culprits for these mismatches, and they often relate to subtle but critical architectural variations. The most frequent one, in my experience, is when the final layers, especially the fully connected (fc) layer designed for a specific number of output classes are not compatible. For instance, a GoogLeNet model trained on the ImageNet dataset, which has 1000 output classes, will have an fc layer tailored to that. If you're loading it into a model intended for a different number of classes (let’s say, a binary classifier with two classes), the dimensions will inevitably clash.

Another potential source of mismatch arises due to changes in the architecture itself. While GoogLeNet might seem like a single unified model, there can be variations depending on the specific implementation, or even different versions available across frameworks. It’s quite common for slight differences in the ordering, addition, or removal of intermediary layers. Even seemingly minor adjustments can affect the shape of resulting tensors, causing mismatches. Also, sometimes the model you download has been modified from the original implementation, for instance for fine tuning.

A less common but significant problem can be related to differences in how the tensors are structured between different implementations. I recall encountering a situation where the way bias terms were handled, while functionally identical, caused shape mismatches. Some libraries might store biases in a slightly different way internally, leading to different shape layouts and causing errors in loading state dicts from each other.

To illustrate these concepts more practically, consider the following simplified code snippets.

**Example 1: Mismatch due to differing final fully connected layers.**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

# Standard GoogLeNet with 1000 classes
googlenet_1000 = models.googlenet(pretrained=True)

# Modified GoogLeNet with 2 classes
class CustomGoogLeNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomGoogLeNet, self).__init__()
        self.features = models.googlenet(pretrained=False).features
        self.avgpool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1, 1))
        self.fc = nn.Linear(1024, 2) # Output 2 classes

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.features(x)
        x = self.avgpool(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

googlenet_2 = CustomGoogLeNet()

try:
    googlenet_2.load_state_dict(googlenet_1000.state_dict()) # Causes a size mismatch in 'fc' layers
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
This snippet clearly demonstrates the issue where the final fully connected layer, designed for 1000 classes in the pretrained model, is incompatible with our modified model expecting 2 output classes.

**Example 2: Using a partially loaded state_dict.**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

# Standard GoogLeNet with 1000 classes
googlenet_1000 = models.googlenet(pretrained=True)

# Modified GoogLeNet with 2 classes
class CustomGoogLeNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomGoogLeNet, self).__init__()
        self.features = models.googlenet(pretrained=False).features
        self.avgpool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1, 1))
        self.fc = nn.Linear(1024, 2) # Output 2 classes

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.features(x)
        x = self.avgpool(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

googlenet_2 = CustomGoogLeNet()

state_dict_1000 = googlenet_1000.state_dict()
# Create partial dict removing the 'fc' layer
state_dict_2 = {k: v for k, v in state_dict_1000.items() if not k.startswith('fc')}

# Load the partial dictionary, the 'fc' weights will be randomly initialised.
googlenet_2.load_state_dict(state_dict_2, strict=False) # No size mismatch here

print("State dict loaded successfully, but final fc layer is randomly initialized.")
```

This example demonstrates how to partially load a `state_dict`, avoiding the mismatch by excluding the mismatched layers. It uses the `strict=False` flag which allows for missing keys in state_dict.

**Example 3: Shape mismatch due to layer modification.**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

# Standard GoogLeNet with 1000 classes
googlenet_1000 = models.googlenet(pretrained=True)


class ModifiedGoogLeNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModifiedGoogLeNet, self).__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(*list(models.googlenet(pretrained=False).features.children())[:3]) # Modified number of layers
        self.avgpool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1, 1))
        self.fc = nn.Linear(256, 1000)  #Adjust input size because of layer removal


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.features(x)
        x = self.avgpool(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

modified_googlenet = ModifiedGoogLeNet()

try:
    modified_googlenet.load_state_dict(googlenet_1000.state_dict())
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Here, the architecture is significantly altered by truncating the initial features layer, which results in a shape mismatch as the rest of the tensor layers will be incompatible because their input feature size does not match the output of the modified 'features' module. This highlights how seemingly small structural modifications drastically impact loading a `state_dict`.

To address these issues, it’s crucial to meticulously compare the architectures of the source model (whose `state_dict` you have) and the target model you are loading into. If you find that a part of the model has different dimensions from the pretrained state dict, then one common way to circumvent this is to either modify the final output layers of the model, modify the final layer of the `state_dict`, or load all weights except the incompatible ones, as shown in the code snippets above. It’s also worth examining the exact implementation details of both models. Sometimes minor discrepancies can be traced back to the specific library versions or model weights.

For a deeper dive, I recommend reading research papers around the concepts of transfer learning and model architectures. The original GoogLeNet paper, “Going Deeper with Convolutions” by Szegedy et al., is a must-read. Also exploring books covering the fundamentals of deep learning and PyTorch or TensorFlow will provide a good base. For more detailed information on specific loading behaviours, the official PyTorch documentation, specifically the modules on `nn.Module` and `torch.load`, will prove invaluable.

Finally, while debugging these errors can be frustrating initially, understanding the root causes and having a systematic approach to identify the mismatches can substantially improve your ability to debug model loading issues in the long run. It's all part of the process of building and deploying complex models, so don't let a few error messages set you back.
