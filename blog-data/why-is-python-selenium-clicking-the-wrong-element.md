,  I've definitely been down that rabbit hole with Selenium and Python more times than I care to remember. The 'clicking-the-wrong-element' issue is a classic, and it often stems from a few common underlying causes, all related to how Selenium interacts with the dynamic nature of web pages. It's rarely as simple as 'Selenium is broken'; more frequently, it's about how we’re locating elements and how the page is structured.

First, let's address the fact that web pages aren't static entities. They're built using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and JavaScript can, and often does, alter the structure of a page after it has loaded. This means that elements might not be in the same position or even exist by the time Selenium gets around to interacting with them.

One prime suspect is incorrect or brittle locators. In my experience, I’ve found that relying too heavily on very specific CSS selectors, or, even worse, xpath that includes absolute paths, is a recipe for disaster. These locators are extremely vulnerable to even minimal changes in the site’s HTML structure. I recall once, during a particularly frustrating project, I was using xpath selectors that looked like `/html/body/div[3]/div/div[2]/button`, only to find that the client's marketing team had shifted around some divs and the automated clicks were now targeting entirely different parts of the interface.

The solution? Embrace more robust strategies like using relative xpaths, css selectors targeting attributes such as ids, classes and `data-*` attributes, or, preferably, leveraging locators that are less reliant on the page's precise layout. Using things like `id` attributes when they’re present and stable, or searching for elements with particular semantic classes is considerably more reliable.

Another common culprit is the timing. Selenium doesn’t automatically wait for elements to be interactive. If you instruct Selenium to click an element before it's fully loaded and rendered, there’s no guarantee that it will click what you intend. Elements can be invisible, covered by overlays, or not even present in the dom yet when selenium tries to interact. This race condition frequently leads to clicks on the wrong element, or no click at all. This is where explicit waits and condition checks are very important. Implicit waits, while often useful, can sometimes lead to unintended consequences because they apply to the *entire* time selenium is running. Explicit waits targeted at specific elements are often more accurate and reliable.

Then, there's the matter of overlapping elements, even when the desired element *is* technically present in the dom. If, for example, a modal dialog appears on top of the target element before it is clicked, selenium will target whatever element is found under the coordinates it was targeting when the click command was invoked, and that might very well be a completely different element than intended. This is particularly common in dynamic front-end applications with complex layering.

Finally, I've encountered cases where the page itself was designed with multiple elements that look identical on the surface (same text, same styling), but have different functional roles, which often happens when elements are generated dynamically using JavaScript and share the same class names.

Let’s demonstrate these points with a few code examples.

**Example 1: Demonstrating the Problem with Brittle Locators**

Let's say our page had a button that, before, we located using this xpath:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com") #Assume example.com has the structure

# brittle xpath example:
element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "/html/body/div[1]/div/div[2]/button")

# after a page refactor, the div moved.
# the following xpath will no longer work
# this often leads to a 'no such element' exception, or clicking the wrong button

try:
    element.click()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Exception encountered using brittle xpath: {e}")
finally:
    driver.quit()
```

This code might have worked yesterday, but today, a structural change in the html renders it useless.

**Example 2: Solution with Robust Locators and Explicit Waits**

A better approach uses more robust locating by `id`, classes and waits:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com")

# improved locator with id, if available or other semantic class
# Using explicit wait to allow for dynamic loading of page.
try:
    element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "myButton")) # replace 'myButton' with a meaningful id attribute. or by.css_selector(".buttonClass") if no ids present.
)
    element.click()
    print("Button clicked successfully using id or semantic class!")
except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception Encountered: {e}")
finally:
    driver.quit()
```

This example shows using `WebDriverWait` with the `element_to_be_clickable` method, which ensures that we don’t click an element until it is fully rendered and available for interaction. Also, the use of an id makes for much more robust locator selection.

**Example 3: Handling Overlapping Elements**

Let’s assume a modal window appears and hides the target element, which has the id ‘targetButton’:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.common.exceptions import ElementClickInterceptedException

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com") #Assume example.com has the structure

try:
    # Find the button we want to click.
    target_element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, 'targetButton')))

    # Attempt to click the button.
    target_element.click()
    print("Target button clicked successfully.")


except ElementClickInterceptedException:

    # If an element click exception happens we can try to find the obstructing modal
    print("Element click Intercepted. Modal present, attempting to close.")
    try:
        modal_close_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 5).until(
            EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CLASS_NAME, 'modal-close')) # replace 'modal-close' with the correct class for modal close button
        )
        modal_close_button.click()

        # after closing we re-try the target element, since it should now be clickable.
        target_element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, 'targetButton')))
        target_element.click()
        print("Target button clicked successfully after modal close.")

    except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed to handle element click interruption: {e}")
except Exception as e:
        print(f"An Exception Encountered: {e}")

finally:
    driver.quit()
```

In this scenario, we’re using a `try-except` block to specifically catch `ElementClickInterceptedException`. If this exception is encountered, we can handle the situation in a more appropriate way (by closing the dialog in this instance) before continuing with our desired interactions.

So, in essence, the issue isn't that Selenium is inherently clicking the wrong thing; it's more about how we instruct it, and how we handle the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of web pages. Robust locators, explicit waits, and mindful exception handling are crucial when writing reliable Selenium automation tests.

For those looking to deepen their understanding of web automation, I'd highly recommend delving into "Selenium WebDriver 3 Practical Guide" by Boni Garcia, as well as the official Selenium documentation, which is incredibly well-maintained. Also, the book "Test Automation Patterns: Effective Test Cases for Selenium, Cucumber, and More" by Mark Winteringham and the W3C specifications for web components and javascript interactions are invaluable for further reading. These resources offer in-depth explanations and best practices that go a long way in avoiding such issues and, ultimately, improving the stability and robustness of our automation projects.
