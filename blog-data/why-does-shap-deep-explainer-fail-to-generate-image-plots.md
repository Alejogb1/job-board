Let's tackle this head-on. I've certainly bumped into the SHAP deep explainer's reluctance to produce image plots myself, and it’s not always straightforward why. It’s a nuanced issue that stems from a few key places within how SHAP interacts with deep learning models and, specifically, how it processes image data. In my experience—I vividly recall a particularly frustrating project involving medical image classification where this issue reared its head—the problem often boils down to a mismatch between the expected input structure by the explainer and the actual output format returned by the model, how the image data is being handled, and occasionally, the configuration parameters passed to the SHAP explainer itself. It’s rarely a single culprit, more often a combination.

The first, and perhaps most common, reason for this failure is that the deep explainer expects a specific format for the output of your model. Specifically, it expects the output to be a *scalar* representing the model's prediction. When dealing with image classification models, especially those that produce probabilities for each class, the direct output of the model is a vector or even a matrix. SHAP needs to know *which* output to explain—is it the probability of class A or class B? If you don’t explicitly specify this, or if the explainer misinterprets the structure, it will fail to generate the plots.

I've found that the *feature_perturbation* argument within the SHAP explainer can also lead to issues. When dealing with image data, 'interventional' perturbation (the default) often makes more sense than 'conditional'. *Interventional* perturbation samples the background data and applies it to your input, whereas *conditional* perturbation masks features based on correlation within the background data itself. Since image data is highly structured, using a purely conditional approach may not make logical sense for all architectures. If you're not using an appropriate background dataset either, that too can cause issues.

Furthermore, the underlying structure of the deep learning model, specifically the use of convolutional layers, may influence how SHAP computes the attributions. SHAP needs to backpropagate the effects from the model output to the input pixels, and how this backpropagation occurs can depend on the specific libraries being used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). If the gradient calculations don’t align with what SHAP expects, the attribution calculation can break down, preventing proper plot generation.

Let’s illustrate these points with a few code examples. I'll assume you have a basic image classification model and associated data loaded, though for brevity I will not include the model training phase. These examples will use `tensorflow` and `shap` libraries.

**Example 1: Incorrect Model Output**

Let's say you have a model `my_model` that outputs a tensor of probabilities for ten classes. The following code might initially cause an error:

```python
import shap
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
# Assuming you have a model and background data loaded
# For example, using keras for simplicity.
my_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

background_data = np.random.rand(100, 32, 32, 3) # Sample background data.
input_image = np.random.rand(1, 32, 32, 3)   # Single input image.

e = shap.DeepExplainer(my_model, background_data)
shap_values = e.shap_values(input_image)
# Attempting to plot the SHAP values here will likely fail or produce incorrect results for images
# shap.image_plot(shap_values, input_image) # This will often fail
```

The above will likely fail due to the output not being a scalar value. To fix it, you'd need to specify the *index* of the class you're interested in:

```python
import shap
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
# Assuming you have a model and background data loaded
my_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

background_data = np.random.rand(100, 32, 32, 3) # Sample background data.
input_image = np.random.rand(1, 32, 32, 3)  # Single input image.

e = shap.DeepExplainer(my_model, background_data)
shap_values = e.shap_values(input_image, check_additivity=False)

# Fix 1: Specify the class index
class_to_explain = 5  # Example: explaining class 5.
shap_values = e.shap_values(input_image,check_additivity=False)[class_to_explain]
shap.image_plot(shap_values, input_image[0]) # this should work!
```
By indexing the shap values using `class_to_explain`, we now have the correct dimensions for plotting.

**Example 2: Perturbation Method**
This example will illustrate how the method of perturbation can affect the output.
```python
import shap
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
# Assuming you have a model and background data loaded
my_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

background_data = np.random.rand(100, 32, 32, 3) # Sample background data.
input_image = np.random.rand(1, 32, 32, 3)   # Single input image.

e = shap.DeepExplainer((my_model, my_model.layers[-1].output), background_data, feature_perturbation='conditional')
shap_values = e.shap_values(input_image, check_additivity=False)[5]

# if the method does not align with the data, the plot may not be generated
# shap.image_plot(shap_values, input_image[0])

# Corrected to a more appropriate default method for images
e_interventional = shap.DeepExplainer((my_model, my_model.layers[-1].output), background_data, feature_perturbation='interventional')
shap_values = e_interventional.shap_values(input_image, check_additivity=False)[5]
shap.image_plot(shap_values, input_image[0]) # this should generate a plot
```
Here, setting `feature_perturbation` to *conditional* may cause issues. Setting to *interventional* is generally more suitable for image data, and leads to better outcomes and fewer errors.

**Example 3: Layer Specification**

Sometimes, issues can arise when SHAP struggles with the layers of your model. Explicitly defining which part of the model you're interested in explaining may help:

```python
import shap
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
# Assuming you have a model and background data loaded
my_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

background_data = np.random.rand(100, 32, 32, 3) # Sample background data.
input_image = np.random.rand(1, 32, 32, 3)   # Single input image.


# Incorrect approach
# e = shap.DeepExplainer(my_model, background_data)
# shap_values = e.shap_values(input_image)
# Fix 3: Specify the model output we care about.
e = shap.DeepExplainer((my_model, my_model.layers[-1].output), background_data)
shap_values = e.shap_values(input_image, check_additivity=False)[5]
shap.image_plot(shap_values, input_image[0]) # this should work.
```
Notice how we provide a tuple `(my_model, my_model.layers[-1].output)` to the explainer which specifies that we want to look at the last layer's output, which can sometimes help in isolating issues of gradient back propagation through the neural network.

In addition to these code fixes, I recommend diving deeper into specific texts. For a fundamental understanding of gradient-based explanation methods, I recommend "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al. It offers a detailed treatment of backpropagation and neural network architectures, which are essential for understanding how SHAP operates. For more SHAP specific insights, I’ve often gone back to the original SHAP paper ("A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions" by Lundberg and Lee). Furthermore, the "Interpretable Machine Learning" book by Christoph Molnar is an excellent resource for understanding the broader context of model explainability. Also, diving into the SHAP library's documentation can uncover specifics that sometimes get overlooked.

In essence, the struggle with SHAP image plots is a multifaceted issue. It usually involves a combination of incorrect output formats, inappropriate perturbation methods, or challenges with gradient propagation in deep learning architectures. The key is systematic debugging, checking each of these potential causes. Through my experience, I've learned to approach each issue as a unique problem and use a combination of these tactics to create the expected plots and thus, better understand how deep learning models are learning about the visual world.
