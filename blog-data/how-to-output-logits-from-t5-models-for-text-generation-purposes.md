 I’ve definitely been down this road before, specifically during a project aiming to refine a summarization pipeline, where direct access to logits was crucial for implementing custom scoring mechanisms. The usual approach with T5, employing something like `model.generate()`, masks away the raw output probabilities, providing only the decoded text. But sometimes, that intermediate data – the pre-softmax logits – is precisely what's needed. So, how do we extract these? The trick lies in manipulating the model's forward pass and understanding what tensors are produced.

Fundamentally, the `generate()` method is a convenience function. It orchestrates the entire decoding process from input to output text. What we’re after is the underlying tensor that’s fed into the softmax function – that’s where the logits reside. We’ll essentially need to intercept the output of the model before the softmax and its associated argmax operations are performed.

Let’s first consider a basic T5 implementation with transformers. We typically interact with it through its `generate` function, like this:

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

input_text = "summarize: This is a long text that needs to be summarized."
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
output_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=20)
output_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(output_text)
```

This gets us the generated summary. But if we need the logits, we have to take a different path. We need to avoid `generate` completely and work directly with the `forward` method. The key is that the `forward` method gives us access to, among other things, a tensor called `logits`.

Here’s how to do that:

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

input_text = "summarize: This is a long text that needs to be summarized."
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Use the model's forward pass. We need to provide the attention mask.
attention_mask = input_ids.ne(tokenizer.pad_token_id)
outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, decoder_input_ids = input_ids)

logits = outputs.logits # This contains the logits. Shape: [batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]
print(f"Logits shape: {logits.shape}")

# If you wish to examine the log-probabilities, you can perform softmax
log_probs = torch.log_softmax(logits, dim=-1)
print(f"Log probabilities shape: {log_probs.shape}")

# If we want to see the token ids with highest probability along sequence we can do argmax
predicted_token_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)
print(f"Predicted Token IDs: {predicted_token_ids}")

# To obtain tokens from ids
predicted_tokens = tokenizer.batch_decode(predicted_token_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(f"Predicted Tokens: {predicted_tokens}")
```

In this code block, note the careful construction of the call to `model()` – we supply `input_ids` and the `attention_mask`. Without the attention mask, the model won’t know which parts of the input to consider. Also, note we provided `decoder_input_ids`, it might be needed in some cases, and it would be the input ids if we want to keep auto-regressive nature. Crucially, `outputs.logits` now holds the pre-softmax values, a tensor with the shape typically `[batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]`. We can then perform `log_softmax` if needed.

Now, you might be wondering what is actually happening step by step. The logits essentially capture how likely the model believes a certain token is, given the context. Each position in the generated sequence will have a corresponding logits vector; the size of this vector is the size of the model's vocabulary. Let’s illustrate this step-by-step, using single batch size and simplified approach for easier understanding.

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

input_text = "summarize: This is a long text."
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Get attention mask
attention_mask = input_ids.ne(tokenizer.pad_token_id)

# Initial decoder input - usually start of sequence.
decoder_input_ids = torch.tensor([[tokenizer.pad_token_id]]) # Start with the <pad> token

all_logits = []

# Auto-regressive generation process
for _ in range(10):  # Generate up to 10 tokens. You might adjust the amount based on needs.

  outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids)

  # Extract the logits from the last generated token
  logits = outputs.logits[:, -1, :]  # Shape: [batch_size, 1, vocab_size] then slice to remove sequence dimension
  all_logits.append(logits)

  # Get the token ids with the highest probability
  predicted_token_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1) # Shape : [batch_size,1]

  # Append the next predicted token to the decoder sequence for the next forward pass.
  decoder_input_ids = torch.cat([decoder_input_ids, predicted_token_ids], dim=1) # Shape: [batch_size, sequence_length + 1]

all_logits = torch.cat(all_logits, dim=1) # Shape: [batch_size, generated_sequence_length, vocab_size]
print(f"Concatenated logits shape: {all_logits.shape}")

predicted_text = tokenizer.decode(decoder_input_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(f"Predicted Text: {predicted_text}")
```

This last example simulates the auto-regressive nature of text generation. We are iteratively taking the logits from the last predicted token and appending to the input sequence and re-passing them to the decoder. By collecting all those logits we can have access to the full sequence logits.

Now, where can you learn more? For a deep dive into transformer architectures, I’d highly recommend the original “Attention is All You Need” paper by Vaswani et al., which lays the groundwork for T5. You’d also benefit from studying the Hugging Face Transformers library documentation, particularly the sections on the `T5ForConditionalGeneration` model and its forward pass. Specifically for logit analysis, examining the work on sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms will give additional context. The “Speech and Language Processing” book by Jurafsky and Martin provides excellent, broad coverage of the theoretical aspects. These resources will help you not just use these models, but understand the underlying mechanics of what you're doing.

In summary, accessing T5 model logits involves circumventing the `generate()` method, directly engaging the model’s `forward()` method, and then examining the produced `logits` tensor. This grants you control over the raw output scores before the final token selection. Remember to handle the batch and sequence dimensions properly as you work through the data. You can use it to perform advanced tasks like custom decoding, scoring, or adversarial analysis. It’s a powerful tool once you understand how to utilize it.
