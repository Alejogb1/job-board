Let's tackle this. It’s a common problem, and I've definitely seen my share of headaches trying to solve it efficiently, especially when dealing with large document sets. The core challenge, as I understand it, is to pinpoint instances of textual similarity *within* a single document, not across multiple documents. This differs from typical similarity searches, which are often geared towards comparing one text against a corpus.

From my experience, this kind of analysis crops up frequently in scenarios like identifying repeated sections in lengthy reports or spotting potential plagiarism in submitted works. The approach I’ve found to be most effective involves a combination of preprocessing, vectorization, and similarity calculation, all powered by the robust NLP capabilities of Python. Let's break it down.

First, and critically, is preprocessing. Text rarely comes perfectly structured, so you must prepare it before you can even begin to compare it. This is often more art than science, but some common steps include converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and eliminating stop words (common words like ‘the,’ ‘a,’ ‘is’ that contribute little to meaning). Lemmatization or stemming can also help by reducing words to their root form, which makes similar words, even with different endings, register as closely aligned. For example, 'running,' 'ran,' and 'runs' would all be reduced to 'run,' allowing our similarity calculations to be more accurate.

Next, we need a way to represent text numerically, which is where vectorization comes in. One effective technique I've used is TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). TF-IDF balances how often a term appears in a document with how rare it is across all documents. If we were comparing across documents, this helps identify the terms that are specific to a single document and differentiate it from others. In our case, we are looking within a document so we treat sections within the document as separate “documents” when calculating TF-IDF. Once vectorized, each text section is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space.

Now, for the core question – identifying similar sections. Once we have our vectors, we can use cosine similarity. Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors; the smaller the angle, the more similar the vectors (and thus, the text) are. It’s particularly well-suited for text data because it’s less sensitive to differences in text length than Euclidean distance, for example. We can calculate the cosine similarity between all the possible pairs of vectors in our vectorized text sections. Those pairs with similarity scores that exceed a certain threshold are deemed as ‘similar.’

Let’s get into some code, using Python’s `scikit-learn` and `nltk` libraries. For starters, here’s how we could handle text preprocessing and vectorization using TF-IDF. I assume here that we have a long string representing the content of our document, which we are breaking into segments. I am going to break it into segments using a very simple line break split, but this could use any number of segmentation techniques such as paragraphs, or a fixed number of words using sliding windows.

```python
import nltk
import re
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

nltk.download('stopwords', quiet=True)
nltk.download('wordnet', quiet=True)

def preprocess_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    words = text.split()
    words = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words]
    return " ".join(words)

def vectorize_text(text_segments):
    preprocessed_segments = [preprocess_text(segment) for segment in text_segments]
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(preprocessed_segments)
    return tfidf_matrix, vectorizer

# Example Usage
long_text = """
This is the first section of our document. It explains some key concepts.
The first section of our document introduces some important information.
This is another section discussing different points.
Yet, it mentions some points similar to the first section.
And again, we talk about some key concepts in a bit more detail.
"""

text_segments = long_text.strip().split('\n')
tfidf_matrix, vectorizer = vectorize_text(text_segments)
print(f"Shape of TF-IDF matrix: {tfidf_matrix.shape}")

```
This code performs basic text preprocessing such as lowercasing, removing punctuation, removing stop words, and lemmatization. Then, we use `TfidfVectorizer` to convert the processed segments into a TF-IDF matrix. The output will show the shape of the matrix, which corresponds to the number of segments and the number of unique terms across those segments.

Now that we have our vectorized text, let's calculate the cosine similarity scores. Here's how:

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

def calculate_similarity(tfidf_matrix, threshold=0.5):
    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix)
    num_segments = tfidf_matrix.shape[0]
    similar_pairs = []

    for i in range(num_segments):
      for j in range(i + 1, num_segments): # Avoid comparing a segment to itself and avoid comparing the same pairs twice
        similarity = similarity_matrix[i, j]
        if similarity > threshold:
            similar_pairs.append((i,j, similarity))
    return similar_pairs

# Example Usage
similar_pairs = calculate_similarity(tfidf_matrix)
for i, j, score in similar_pairs:
    print(f"Segment {i+1} and {j+1} are similar with score: {score:.3f}")

```

This code calculates the cosine similarity between all possible pairs of text segments using the TF-IDF matrix from our previous code. It then prints the indices of any pairs that score over a given similarity threshold. You may need to adjust this threshold depending on the kind of text and the granularity of similarity you are interested in.

Finally, to really highlight similar segments, we could create a function that returns the actual text segments that are similar:
```python

def highlight_similar_text(text_segments, similar_pairs):
  if not similar_pairs:
      return "No similar segments found"
  output = ""
  for i, j, score in similar_pairs:
    output += f"**Segment {i+1}:**\n{text_segments[i]}\n"
    output += f"**Segment {j+1}:**\n{text_segments[j]}\n"
    output += f"**Similarity Score:** {score:.3f}\n\n"
  return output


# Example Usage
highlighted_text = highlight_similar_text(text_segments, similar_pairs)
print(highlighted_text)

```
This code takes as input the text segments as a list of strings, along with our list of segment pairs and their scores, and returns a formatted output displaying the similar segments with their score.

It's worth mentioning that other vectorization techniques, such as word embeddings (word2vec, GloVe, or even more advanced models like transformers) could be used instead of TF-IDF and may lead to improved accuracy, but they come with added complexity. The choice really depends on the nature and size of your data, and how critical it is to identify similarity.

For a deeper dive into these techniques, I'd recommend "Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin for a thorough theoretical background in NLP. Also, “Natural Language Processing with Python” by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper provides a very practical hands-on approach. For those interested in more advanced techniques and models, look into papers on transformers, BERT, and related architectures published in venues like NeurIPS, ACL, and EMNLP. These papers are often publicly available and can offer valuable insights into state-of-the-art NLP practices.

In my experience, fine-tuning these parameters – the preprocessing steps, vectorization method, and similarity thresholds – is crucial for achieving good results. It’s often an iterative process involving trial and error, but a careful application of these foundational techniques will help identify textual similarity within your document with acceptable accuracy and efficiency.
