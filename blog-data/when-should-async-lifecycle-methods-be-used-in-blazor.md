Okay, let's tackle this one. I recall a particular project, back in my early days with Blazor, where I initially misunderstood the implications of using asynchronous operations in lifecycle methods. We were building a fairly complex dashboard, pulling data from multiple apis, and my initial naive implementation resulted in some pretty nasty ui lockups. The experience cemented for me the importance of understanding when and why to use async in these contexts. Let's break it down, shall we?

The core of the issue lies in Blazor’s lifecycle and its synchronous nature, by default. Lifecycle methods like `OnInitialized`, `OnParametersSet`, and `OnAfterRender` are typically executed synchronously. This means if you initiate a long-running operation, like a network request or heavy computation, within these synchronous methods, your application’s ui thread will be blocked. The browser will effectively freeze, causing a poor user experience. This is where the asynchronous versions, `OnInitializedAsync`, `OnParametersSetAsync`, and `OnAfterRenderAsync`, become crucial.

I consider using async lifecycle methods to be a best practice in situations where you're interacting with external services, databases, or performing any action that could potentially take a non-trivial amount of time to complete. Let me emphasize that: *any* action that may not complete instantly. The key advantage here is non-blocking behavior. When you call an async method, you immediately relinquish the thread back to the caller (in this case, Blazor's render engine), allowing other operations to continue, including ui updates. Once the async operation finishes, the render engine is notified, and the component is re-rendered with the newly available data.

Consider an example where we need to load a list of products from a remote api. If you tried to do this within `OnInitialized`, the application would freeze until that request returns, making the app unresponsive.

Let’s start with a *bad* example, showcasing what *not* to do:

```csharp
@page "/badproducts"

<h3>Product List (Bad Example)</h3>

@if (products == null)
{
    <p>Loading...</p>
}
else
{
    <ul>
        @foreach (var product in products)
        {
            <li>@product.Name - @product.Price</li>
        }
    </ul>
}

@code {
    private List<Product> products;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        // This will block the ui thread!
        var client = new HttpClient();
        var response = client.GetAsync("https://api.example.com/products").Result;
        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            var json = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;
            products = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<Product>>(json);
        }
    }

    public class Product
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
    }
}
```

In this snippet, the `.Result` calls force the asynchronous operations to run synchronously on the ui thread. You’ll see the “loading” indicator until *all* operations complete, freezing the browser. This is an anti-pattern and will severely impact the user experience.

Now, let’s see the *correct* way:

```csharp
@page "/goodproducts"

<h3>Product List (Good Example)</h3>

@if (products == null)
{
    <p>Loading...</p>
}
else
{
    <ul>
        @foreach (var product in products)
        {
            <li>@product.Name - @product.Price</li>
        }
    </ul>
}

@code {
    private List<Product> products;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var client = new HttpClient();
        var response = await client.GetAsync("https://api.example.com/products");
        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            var json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            products = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<Product>>(json);
        }
    }

    public class Product
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
    }
}
```
Notice that we use `OnInitializedAsync` and the `await` keyword. This allows our component to stay responsive, and the render engine can continue to update the ui without being blocked while the http request is in progress. The ‘loading’ message is displayed, and the product list appears when the request completes.

There’s another important use case to cover: handling external state changes after an update. This is crucial for dealing with components that depend on external parameters that might change. `OnParametersSet` and `OnParametersSetAsync` deal with this, triggered when a component's parameters change. When these parameters change and might involve asynchronous operations, use the async variant.

Here’s an example demonstrating that point:

```csharp
@page "/userdetail/{UserId:int}"

<h3>User Details</h3>

@if (user == null)
{
    <p>Loading...</p>
}
else
{
    <p>Name: @user.Name</p>
    <p>Email: @user.Email</p>
}

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public int UserId { get; set; }

    private User user;


     protected override async Task OnParametersSetAsync()
    {
        user = null; // Reset user when parameters change
        if (UserId > 0)
        {
            var client = new HttpClient();
            var response = await client.GetAsync($"https://api.example.com/users/{UserId}");
             if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
             {
                var json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                user = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize<User>(json);
             }
        }

    }

    public class User
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Email { get; set; }
    }
}
```

In this final example, whenever the `UserId` parameter changes, we reset the `user` property and fetch new user data. Again, the use of `OnParametersSetAsync` ensures the ui thread isn't blocked while the api call is made.

As a general rule, prefer the `*Async` versions whenever you anticipate that the operations within the lifecycle method *could* take more than a trivial amount of time. This covers, but isn't limited to, network requests, database operations, file operations or other computationally intensive procedures.

To dive deeper into asynchronous programming and its interaction with the Blazor component model, I highly recommend exploring the content covered in *Programming in C#* by Jesse Liberty and *Concurrency in C# Cookbook* by Stephen Cleary. These resources can give you a comprehensive background on the fundamentals, patterns and best practices of asynchronous programming in .net, which are essential when working with Blazor. Additionally, exploring the official Microsoft documentation for Blazor lifecycle methods is crucial. These resources, coupled with diligent practice, will arm you with the ability to write reactive and performant Blazor applications.

So to wrap it up, use async lifecycle methods when you need to keep your ui responsive while performing time-consuming or potentially blocking operations. Don't try to make synchronous operations out of asynchronous code with `.Result` or `.Wait()` - this will inevitably lead to ui lockups. Asynchronous programming, while initially feeling slightly complex, is essential to mastering Blazor development, and it's something worth getting right.
