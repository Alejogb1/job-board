Okay so r times new roman font settings right yeah I've been down that rabbit hole a few times let me tell you it's a classic formatting struggle everyone bumps into sooner or later.

Let's get real here Times New Roman is like the default font of documents it's everywhere and for some reason things can get messy when you try to tweak it especially with software that doesn't handle font specifications gracefully. I remember this one project I worked on years ago maybe around 2015 or 2016 I was dealing with this report generation system we were building in house. It had to churn out hundreds of reports a day and the client wanted everything in Times New Roman which you know fair enough.

The issue wasn’t just “make the text Times New Roman” it was that the spacing the line height the size it all kept coming out wonky some sections were scrunched others were stretched it was a formatting nightmare. Spent a solid week just debugging font rendering issues back then ugh those were the days. I tried everything you can think of I mean every CSS trick every style override everything. It was before some of the modern styling frameworks were mature and common so it was largely CSS style sheets and some custom built logic.

Anyway let’s get to the point. If you’re dealing with Times New Roman you need to be precise. It's not a font that forgives sloppy coding or haphazard settings. You have to specify your font settings everywhere and if you're going for consistency you can't assume that it'll just "figure it out". You need to dictate things with precision. It's best to avoid relying on system defaults which can differ and often do.

So here are some areas where you might be facing issues and some strategies to deal with those issues using standard css approaches.

**1 CSS issues**

First things first make sure you're correctly specifying the font family. This looks simple but it can be the root of your problem:

```css
body {
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
```

Now notice the order here "Times New Roman" is the preferred choice Times is the backup and serif is the generic font family so if everything goes wrong at least you have a serif family font so things dont look too weird.
That backup part is important If "Times New Roman" isn't available for some reason (and it can happen more than you think) this way your text will at least stay somewhat readable with some serif variant.

Also you wanna make sure you aren't overriding it later down in your stylesheet with some other selector. CSS specificity is a real pain sometimes but you can't ignore it. Something like this might override your main font settings from above:

```css
.special-text {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif; /* oops this overrides the default setting */
}
```

Also a point of contention that I had back in 2015 was line-height so make sure you are precise on this aspect too:

```css
p {
   font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
   font-size: 16px; /* Define your font-size */
   line-height: 1.5; /* Example of specific line height */
}
```

Also if you are using external libraries that might override your settings then go check that too.

**2 Web Fonts and Embedding issues**

If you're working with web applications things get a bit trickier you can't always rely on the user having Times New Roman installed and accessible via the system fonts folder. This means you gotta use web fonts.

You should use a font service or self host your font files. When I was dealing with that report generation project we were self-hosting since we wanted tight control over everything and also at the time we were working with sensitive data and using external services was a big no no.

But if you're using a service like Google Fonts then make sure you link to the font correctly in your HTML. This goes in the `<head>` of your document:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Times+New+Roman&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

That `display=swap` attribute is useful it helps avoid flash of unstyled text but make sure you read up on it so you know all the implications before setting this in all the fonts in your website. Then you do what you would do in the previous part in your css specify that the font is Times New Roman.

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;
}
```

Also font weights and styles can change the overall look so specify if your font will be **bold** or *italic* that makes a difference.

**3 Document Generation issues**

If you're generating documents like PDFs programmatically well it's a whole different ball game. You need to choose the right library or service that can handle font embedding and encoding correctly. Some tools might render Times New Roman using a substitute font that causes inconsistencies. So check your library’s settings.

I recall using iTextSharp way back when we generated those reports and that library had font embedding configurations and settings and it was not intuitive to make it work. We went with using a specific font file to make sure everything was consistent across all the outputs.

Here’s how you could do that in a python based library.

```python
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.pdfbase import pdfmetrics
from reportlab.pdfbase.ttfonts import TTFont

# Register the font file first
pdfmetrics.registerFont(TTFont('TimesNewRoman', 'path/to/your/timesnewroman.ttf'))

c = canvas.Canvas("example.pdf")
c.setFont('TimesNewRoman', 12)
c.drawString(100, 750, "This is Times New Roman in the PDF.")
c.save()
```

Here `TimesNewRoman` is an alias you define and the library will then use the ttf file specified to render the font.

There’s a lot to consider here when generating documents. Check the documentation of your library or framework and pay special attention to font embedding or substitution.

**General considerations**

One thing I learned the hard way is to avoid using overly complex nesting of style rules. Keep your css selectors as straightforward as possible. This way it makes easier to understand which styles are applied and where. And do not under any circumstance ignore that part of the code you think is working well. There is no such a thing as "if it works do not touch it" sometimes you need to refactor your work just to make it work better later.

The thing I hate the most is when a font is changed via some javascript that's just messy. So try to make your javascript and css as modular as possible so they do not mess with each other and you do not end with some obscure javascript based overriding of the styles.

Also try using some development tools. Your browser usually has a development tool that lets you inspect the rendered fonts if you are using a web application. You should use those so you can pinpoint exactly where the problem is. So many times I just spent staring at code instead of looking at the real rendered result with those browser tools.

If you are dealing with complex rendering issues consider looking at articles about typography. There is a lot of research into how the fonts affect the reading experience and sometimes the issue is not in the code but in the font you choose. I recall reading a good paper on that maybe back in the late 2000s but I can't find the name of it now. Look for scholarly articles in digital libraries about font rendering that is how I normally find these things.

So yeah that's pretty much it in a nutshell. It's not rocket science but it can be deceptively difficult. The trick is to be consistent and specify everything explicitly. And the next time someone says "just make it Times New Roman" you'll be ready.

Also fun fact I once spent 3 hours trying to figure out why a font wasn't rendering correctly only to realize I had typed "Time New Roman" in the css so sometimes the problem is staring right at us.

Good luck with your font adventures.
