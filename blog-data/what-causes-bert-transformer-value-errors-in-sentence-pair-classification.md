Okay, let’s tackle this. I’ve seen this particular issue crop up more than a few times, especially back when fine-tuning BERT for tasks like natural language inference was less...well, less of a straightforward process than it is today. The infamous value errors during sentence pair classification with BERT transformers – they generally boil down to mismatches between the input you're providing and what the model expects, or internal configuration issues. It’s rarely a problem directly with the BERT model itself, but rather how the data is structured and processed on its way into the transformer. Let's break this down into the most frequent culprits, using my own experiences, and see how to address them.

First, the most common source of these errors, in my experience, comes from incorrect tokenization and input formatting. Remember, BERT doesn’t ingest raw text. It needs numeric representations – token IDs – corresponding to words, sub-words, or even characters. When working with sentence pairs, BERT expects a particular structure. It needs to discern the two sentences. This is typically accomplished using special tokens. The standard approach is to prepend the first sentence with the `[CLS]` token (classification token), separate the two sentences with a `[SEP]` token (separation token), and end the second sentence with another `[SEP]` token. If this is not done properly, or if the tokenization process is flawed, then the input sequence doesn't match BERT's training assumptions and will lead to value errors related to shapes of input data, incorrect attention masking, and so on.

Let's take an example. Say you're using the Hugging Face `transformers` library, and you attempt to simply tokenize two sentences separately and concatenate the resulting token IDs:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

sentence_1 = "This is the first sentence."
sentence_2 = "This is the second sentence."

tokens_1 = tokenizer.tokenize(sentence_1)
tokens_2 = tokenizer.tokenize(sentence_2)

ids_1 = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens_1)
ids_2 = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens_2)

combined_ids = ids_1 + ids_2

print(combined_ids) # Incorrect format
```

This will lead to problems. You haven't added those critical `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens, nor have you segmented or padded the input correctly. The output of this code will look like a simple sequence of tokens without markers distinguishing the two sentences.

The correct method should utilize the tokenizer’s encoding function, specifically designed for handling sentence pair inputs:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

sentence_1 = "This is the first sentence."
sentence_2 = "This is the second sentence."


encoding = tokenizer.encode_plus(
    sentence_1,
    sentence_2,
    add_special_tokens=True,
    max_length=128,
    padding='max_length',
    truncation=True,
    return_attention_mask=True,
    return_tensors='pt'
)


print(encoding['input_ids'])
print(encoding['attention_mask'])
print(encoding['token_type_ids'])
```

Here, `encode_plus` handles everything properly. It adds special tokens, performs padding up to a specified `max_length` if necessary, truncates if too long, and generates the `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, and `token_type_ids`. `token_type_ids` are crucial for sentence pairs since they mark which segment each token belongs to (zero for the first sentence, and one for the second). Without these, the transformer model has no way of knowing which tokens belong to which sentence. This was a common problem I faced early on when adapting single-sentence classification code to sentence-pair tasks, and I’d often see shape mismatches in tensors passed into the model as a result.

A second, less common but still significant reason for these value errors relates to incorrect sequence lengths. BERT, like most neural networks, operates on tensors of a consistent shape. When you feed it sequences of varying length, without proper padding or truncation, problems occur. Specifically, models expect that all inputs to a particular batch have the same dimension and are masked using an attention mask. Without padding, the sequences sent to the model in a single batch will have varying lengths, causing shape mismatches during the operations within BERT, which inevitably trigger value errors.

Now, you might think simply padding with zeros would solve everything. However, the attention mechanism within the transformer also needs to be aware of these padded elements. That’s why you need an attention mask. This mask has ones where there’s real data and zeros where padding has been applied. Failure to correctly apply attention masks during the forward pass (i.e., sending a sequence of ones, meaning that no tokens should be masked) will lead to incorrect calculations and again, value errors.

Let’s illustrate with another scenario. Let's say you’ve implemented custom logic for padding without using `encode_plus`. You might incorrectly construct your attention mask. Imagine a batch with two sentences, one of 10 tokens, the other of 20 tokens after tokenization. We'd pad to 20 and the mask would need to have the form `[1]*10 + [0]*10` for the first sequence and `[1]*20` for the second sequence. Here's how you might implement that incorrectly:

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

sentence_1 = "Short sentence."
sentence_2 = "This is a longer sentence to demonstrate the problem with padding."

tokens_1 = tokenizer.tokenize(sentence_1)
tokens_2 = tokenizer.tokenize(sentence_2)

ids_1 = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens_1)
ids_2 = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens_2)

max_length = max(len(ids_1),len(ids_2))

#Incorrect attention mask generation.
mask_1 = [1]*len(ids_1) #should pad with zero, but no padding provided
mask_2 = [1]*len(ids_2)

padded_ids_1 = ids_1 + [0]*(max_length - len(ids_1)) #padded to a max_length
padded_ids_2 = ids_2 + [0]*(max_length - len(ids_2))

ids_batch = torch.tensor([padded_ids_1,padded_ids_2])
attention_mask = torch.tensor([mask_1, mask_2]) #incorrect

print(ids_batch)
print(attention_mask) # incorrect mask: no padding zeros are present for sequence 1
```

Here we’ve incorrectly created a mask that only marks actual tokens. The first sequence should have 1's up to the location where it ends and then 0's. This would generate an error during the forward pass. The problem is solved, as demonstrated in the `encode_plus` example above, by passing `return_attention_mask=True` so that the correct attention mask is created by the tokenizer. You should almost always use `encode_plus` instead of custom implementations to avoid these issues.

Finally, another reason for value errors could be related to mismatches between the pre-trained model architecture and the architecture being used for classification. Although less common, if there's an inconsistency, such as the hidden size of the transformer output layer not matching the input size of your classifier layer, that could throw an error. This would most often occur if you were attempting to manually stitch a custom classifier onto BERT without using the standard approaches provided by the `transformers` library, which handles these compatibility issues.

For deeper understanding of these concepts, I would highly recommend "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. for a grounding in the transformer architecture and "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" by Devlin et al. for the specifics of BERT. Additionally, the Hugging Face `transformers` documentation offers extensive explanations on tokenization and input formatting. Understanding these resources should help solidify your grasp on how BERT processes sentence pairs and allow you to better debug these common value errors. From my experience, these errors are usually related to the ways you are constructing the input rather than any deep fault in the architecture itself.
