Alright, let's tackle log levels in Ruby on Rails 6.1. I've spent considerable time debugging distributed systems, often with applications running on Rails, and understanding log levels has been crucial for efficiently identifying and resolving issues. Instead of starting with definitions, let's consider a practical scenario. Years ago, we had a microservice that was exhibiting erratic behavior, and the initial logs were, frankly, a chaotic mess. Every single event, from successful API calls to database interactions, was being logged at the highest verbosity level, resulting in enormous, unwieldy log files. This experience firmly cemented the importance of precise log level management.

In essence, log levels are severity classifications assigned to logged messages, facilitating filtering and prioritizing essential information when troubleshooting an application. Rails uses the standard Ruby `Logger` class, which supports several predefined levels, each representing a different degree of seriousness: `:debug`, `:info`, `:warn`, `:error`, and `:fatal`. Log messages assigned to these levels are then filtered based on the configured log level of the application, and only those at or above this level are actually written to the log destination.

Rails 6.1 determines the active log level primarily through the `config.log_level` configuration option. This is usually set within the environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `config/environments/development.rb`, `config/environments/production.rb`). The default level for development is often `:debug`, allowing developers to see a large amount of detail. In production, it’s typically `:info` or `:warn`, which significantly reduces the log volume while still capturing important application events and potential problems.

The beauty is that you’re not limited to the default options. You can programmatically set the log level within your code, though it’s generally recommended to configure it through application configuration rather than through scattered code changes. I've seen too many cases where manual manipulation of the logger during production debugging led to inconsistencies and confusion, so I generally discourage this practice except for very specific scenarios. It's better to modify the configuration file and re-deploy when you need different granularity.

To demonstrate this concretely, let’s explore a few code snippets. Here’s a basic example of setting the log level in a Rails environment configuration file:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  #...other configurations...
  config.log_level = :warn
  #...other configurations...
end
```

In this example, the production environment is set to log at the `:warn` level and above, meaning `logger.warn`, `logger.error`, and `logger.fatal` messages will be written, but `logger.debug` and `logger.info` messages will not. This is crucial for keeping your production logs manageable.

Next, consider a scenario within a Rails controller where you’re performing some action and want to log the outcome. This next example shows how to generate logs using various levels:

```ruby
# app/controllers/my_controller.rb
class MyController < ApplicationController
  def some_action
    begin
      result = perform_complex_operation(params[:data])
      logger.info "Complex operation completed successfully with result: #{result}"
    rescue StandardError => e
      logger.error "Error during complex operation: #{e.message}"
      logger.debug "Full stacktrace: \n #{e.backtrace.join("\n")}"
      # Handle the error appropriately
      render status: :internal_server_error, json: { error: "An error occurred"}
    end
  end

  private

  def perform_complex_operation(data)
    # Simulate a complex operation
    raise "Simulated error" if data == "error"
    data.upcase
  end
end

```

Here, the `:info` level is used for successful completion, `:error` for handling any exceptions and the `:debug` level is used to log the full stacktrace when debugging. If your application’s log level is set to `:warn`, the `logger.info` and `logger.debug` statements will be suppressed and you will only see the error message which is logged at the `:error` level.

Finally, let’s say you're developing a background job and want to log how long a specific job takes to execute.

```ruby
# app/jobs/complex_job.rb
class ComplexJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(*args)
    start_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
    logger.info "Starting complex job with arguments: #{args}"

    # Simulate doing work
    sleep(2)

    end_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
    duration = end_time - start_time
    logger.info "Completed complex job in #{duration} seconds."
    logger.debug "Additional debugging info could go here if necessary."
  rescue StandardError => e
    logger.fatal "Job failed with error: #{e.message}"
    raise
  end
end
```

In this snippet, the job logs its start, completion time, and duration using `:info`, and includes additional debugging information using `:debug`, as well as logging errors at the `:fatal` level. Again, the output visible in your logs will depend on the configured `log_level` setting in the environment this job is running in.

Now, while Rails abstracts away some underlying complexity, you should always be cognizant of the Ruby `Logger` class under the hood. If you find yourself dealing with more advanced logging needs, like custom log formats or rotating log files, understanding the capabilities of `Logger` directly becomes vital. Specifically, investigating the `Formatter` option for log output is a worthwhile endeavor.

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting “The Well-Grounded Rubyist” by David A. Black. This provides a solid foundation on the inner workings of Ruby's standard library, which is essential to grasp the core behavior of the logger, as well as the `Ruby standard library documentation on Logger`. Also, looking into papers related to distributed system debugging practices is valuable, as efficient log handling is paramount in those contexts. Specifically, any publication discussing observability in modern application architectures, or log management and analysis best practices in DevOps environments, can provide valuable context. A deep dive into log aggregation solutions such as ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk will also broaden your practical knowledge in this domain. Finally, looking into papers that discuss observability practices and specifically on log analysis strategies can also offer relevant insights.

In my experience, using log levels effectively is not just about avoiding verbosity. It's about having clarity on what information is critical at each stage of your development cycle, understanding the operational impact of different levels of verbosity, and having the information that is crucial for effective debugging. It's a skill honed over time through trial and error, but one that significantly reduces the cognitive load required when things inevitably go wrong. Choosing the correct log levels ultimately results in quicker troubleshooting, a smoother development cycle, and more resilient applications.
