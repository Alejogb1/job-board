Okay, let's tackle this "no gradients" problem, a situation I’ve definitely been in myself more than a few times. It's a common stumbling block when diving into custom loss functions, and it usually boils down to a few core reasons. It's not some mystical occurrence, but rather a sign that the automatic differentiation engine, the backbone of gradient descent, can't trace a differentiable path through your calculations. I’ve seen this pop up in everything from complex convolutional networks to simple linear regression models when a loss is defined incorrectly.

The core issue often stems from operations within the custom loss function that are non-differentiable. This isn't always obvious, particularly if you're used to working with higher-level library functions. Think about it this way: backpropagation, at its heart, uses the chain rule of calculus to compute gradients. If there's a point where you can't calculate that derivative—where the function is not smooth or continuous—the chain breaks, and no gradient flows backward. Essentially, the optimizer doesn't know which way to adjust the weights to minimize the loss.

Non-differentiable operations can creep in through various avenues. Consider things like manual if-else statements that introduce discrete jumps, integer divisions or rounding functions that create non-smooth outputs, or using functions that have undefined derivatives at certain points, like `np.where()` without careful consideration. Another common problem is inadvertently breaking the computational graph by converting tensor types incorrectly, like converting a differentiable tensor to a numpy array and back. When you manually step outside the automatic differentiation framework, you’re essentially leaving that part of your loss un-differentiable.

Let's get concrete. One situation I faced involved a custom ranking loss where I had to implement some logic to handle top-k elements. Initially, I used direct indexing operations that weren’t playing nicely with the autograd system. I was effectively creating a disconnect. Looking back, the solution wasn’t particularly complicated, but it was a valuable reminder that the way you *express* a calculation is as crucial as the logic itself. Here is a version of code, that resulted in a “no gradients” error.

```python
import torch

def faulty_custom_loss(predictions, targets, k=3):
    batch_size = predictions.size(0)
    losses = []

    for i in range(batch_size):
        pred_i = predictions[i]
        target_i = targets[i]

        # This approach is not differentiable because of torch.topk
        # returning indices and the manual indexing.
        _, topk_indices = torch.topk(pred_i, k)
        topk_preds = pred_i[topk_indices]
        topk_targets = target_i[topk_indices]

        loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(topk_preds, topk_targets)
        losses.append(loss)

    return torch.stack(losses).mean()


# example usage
predictions = torch.rand(2, 10, requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.rand(2, 10)

loss_val = faulty_custom_loss(predictions, targets)
loss_val.backward() # this line throws 'RuntimeError: element 0 of tensors does not require grad and does not have a grad_fn'
print (predictions.grad)
```

The issue is in the non-differentiable indexing operation `topk_preds = pred_i[topk_indices]`. While `torch.topk` computes the top k values and associated indices it does not preserve gradient information when using the returned indices. Backpropagation can’t trace through this index operation and this, subsequently, kills the gradient.

Now, contrast that with a corrected version. The key here is using operations that are fully integrated with the automatic differentiation engine of torch. Instead of indexing, we use a masking strategy. This allows us to get the desired result but in a differentiable way.

```python
import torch

def corrected_custom_loss(predictions, targets, k=3):
    batch_size = predictions.size(0)
    losses = []

    for i in range(batch_size):
        pred_i = predictions[i]
        target_i = targets[i]

        _, topk_indices = torch.topk(pred_i, k)
        mask = torch.zeros_like(pred_i, dtype=torch.bool) # create a bool mask
        mask[topk_indices] = True # Set the mask to true where needed.

        topk_preds = pred_i[mask] # Index using the mask
        topk_targets = target_i[mask]

        loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(topk_preds, topk_targets)
        losses.append(loss)

    return torch.stack(losses).mean()

# example usage
predictions = torch.rand(2, 10, requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.rand(2, 10)

loss_val = corrected_custom_loss(predictions, targets)
loss_val.backward() # works correctly
print(predictions.grad)

```

Here, instead of directly indexing, I create a boolean mask using `torch.zeros_like()` and then select our top-k using that boolean mask. This operation is now differentiable because it’s based on a continuous selection mechanism. This lets the backpropagation engine do its thing without issues. Note that we are still using `torch.topk`, but not for *indexing*. Instead, we are obtaining the indices which we then use to build a *mask* which is, fundamentally, a differentiable operation.

A final, and perhaps more subtly problematic scenario, which I've also dealt with, arises when dealing with categorical data within a loss function. Consider this: let's assume you want to design a loss function which incorporates something similar to a soft one-hot-encoding. A common, but flawed approach, is shown below.

```python
import torch

def faulty_categorical_loss(predictions, targets):
    batch_size = predictions.size(0)
    losses = []

    for i in range(batch_size):
        pred_i = predictions[i]
        target_i = targets[i].long() # Convert target to long dtype which is discrete

        # Faulty approach: Manual conversion of a target tensor to a one-hot tensor that is disconnected from the differentiable graph.
        one_hot_targets = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(target_i, num_classes=predictions.size(1)).float()

        loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(pred_i, one_hot_targets)
        losses.append(loss)

    return torch.stack(losses).mean()


# Example Usage
predictions = torch.rand(2, 5, requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.randint(0, 5, (2,), dtype=torch.long)


loss_value = faulty_categorical_loss(predictions, targets)
loss_value.backward() # Results in a RuntimeError, no gradients.
print(predictions.grad)
```

The issue here stems from converting the *targets* from `long` dtype to a `float` dtype tensor using `torch.nn.functional.one_hot`. The `one_hot` function is *not* intended to handle differentiation if you want to be able to compute gradients with respect to the labels and is meant to be applied *once* to the *target*, before being used as an input to the loss function. In essence, we are disconnecting the gradient flow through the label space.

The correction here is to ensure that the operations we use for the targets are differentiable, for instance, through the use of softmax cross-entropy loss. The targets *should not* have a gradient because they should not be changed by the optimization process.

```python
import torch

def corrected_categorical_loss(predictions, targets):
    loss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(predictions, targets) # Cross-entropy is differentiable
    return loss

# Example Usage
predictions = torch.rand(2, 5, requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.randint(0, 5, (2,), dtype=torch.long)


loss_value = corrected_categorical_loss(predictions, targets)
loss_value.backward()
print(predictions.grad)

```

Here, I have removed the manual creation of one hot labels and, instead, used the `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` loss, which expects the predictions and the actual *categorical* target as an input (not the one-hot representation), and it takes care of the one-hot encoding and the negative log likelihood calculation internally. Crucially, it does so in a differentiable manner.

To deepen your understanding of these concepts I would suggest you dive into these sources: "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville – it goes deep into the nuances of gradient-based optimization and backpropagation. For something more hands-on and PyTorch-specific, look into the PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on autograd and writing custom modules. The work by Andrej Karpathy, particularly his lectures on neural networks (available online) are also invaluable, providing clear explanations and intuitions on these intricate areas.

Ultimately, the “no gradients” issue is usually a reflection of a misunderstanding of how automatic differentiation operates. The core principle here is to ensure every step of your calculation is expressible in terms of differentiable operations. By carefully considering your choice of functions and how they interact within your custom loss, you can debug such errors and build robust, well-defined models.
