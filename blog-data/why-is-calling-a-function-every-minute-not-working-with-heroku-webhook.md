ah, i see what's happening. this is a classic gotcha with heroku and background tasks, especially when involving webhooks. let me walk you through this, i've banged my head against this particular wall more times than i'd like to remember.

first off, the core issue isn't necessarily with your code's logic for executing a function every minute. that part, i'm guessing, you've got nailed down. the problem lies with *where* and *how* heroku handles processes and time-based triggers. see, heroku's dynos aren't meant to be long-running, persistently active virtual machines in the traditional sense. they spin up, handle requests, and might get scaled down when idle. that 'idle' state, that's where your timer runs into problems. heroku, by design, isn't really set up to guarantee that your little one-minute timer is going to keep on ticking reliably in the background on a web dyno.

let me tell you about my experience, this one project i was working on, about five years back, was this data aggregation platform. it had a webhook that needed to be called every hour by an api provider and then it was supposed to do some database magic. i set it up with a simple `while True` and `time.sleep` in a script running on the web dyno. i thought, hey, that’s it, done. it seemed to work okay in dev, but on heroku, it would just randomly stop after some time. logs were sporadic and confusing. i learned very quickly that’s a no-go in production.

the problem with your current approach (calling a function every minute), from what i can gather, is that heroku web dynos are primarily designed to process incoming web requests. they're not meant to be persistent background task runners. the thing to note here is that the web dyno is often 'sleeping' when there are no requests coming to your application. so, your timer, which is likely tied to the web dyno's process lifecycle, simply stops being executed when the dyno goes to sleep or is recycled. heroku's dyno manager, in its efforts to be efficient and conserve resources, can often end up terminating processes which are perceived to be non-essential or idle. a function that's supposed to be called every minute, might not be seen as essential for responding to http requests, and therefore gets pruned.

here's the typical problem: your code might look something like this, this is a python example of what not to do:

```python
import time
import requests

def my_function():
  # your function that calls the webhook.
  print('calling webhook')
  response = requests.get('https://your-webhook-url.com')
  print(f'response from webhook: {response.status_code}')
  pass

def run_every_minute():
  while True:
    my_function()
    time.sleep(60) # wait for 60 seconds

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_every_minute()
```

this sort of code works fine when you're running it locally. heroku, not so much. it might work for a bit, but its persistence isn't guaranteed.

the solution here lies in moving your scheduled task out of the web dyno and into a process that is designed to run in the background. heroku’s documentation, by the way, does a really good job of explaining this in detail.

one good option is to use heroku’s 'scheduler' add-on. this is a simple built-in cron job service provided by heroku, you set the schedule in the heroku dashboard and it will execute an arbitrary command. but there are limitations to it: it is not precise, so a task every minute might be difficult to setup and guarantee.

the better way, usually, is to use worker dynos and a task queue. that’s the preferred method and what i ended up doing when dealing with those heroku problems before. the general idea is that your web dyno will process requests, and for any background work, you’ll push the task to the queue. then, a dedicated worker dyno will fetch jobs from the queue and process them. for time-based operations, you have a worker process that continuously checks if a given time is reached, if yes it will add a new job to the queue. there are libraries for that.

here is an example of a worker process implementation using redis and rq which is what i have used multiple times in the past. here's a general rundown of the worker process code in python:

```python
import redis
import time
from rq import Queue
import requests

# configure redis
redis_conn = redis.Redis(host='your-redis-host', port=6379, password='your-redis-password')

# initialize task queue
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)


def my_webhook_function(url):
  print('calling webhook')
  response = requests.get(url)
  print(f'response from webhook: {response.status_code}')
  pass

def enqueue_webhook_task(url):
    q.enqueue(my_webhook_function, url)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    webhook_url = "https://your-webhook-url.com"
    while True:
        enqueue_webhook_task(webhook_url)
        time.sleep(60) # wait for 60 seconds
```

and here’s the worker that fetches the work from the queue:

```python
import redis
from rq import Worker, Queue

redis_conn = redis.Redis(host='your-redis-host', port=6379, password='your-redis-password')

# initialize task queue
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    worker = Worker([q], connection=redis_conn)
    worker.work()
```
this approach, although a bit more complex, is more robust and scalable. you're effectively separating your web requests processing from background tasks. it allows you to scale your worker dynos independently of your web dynos, which is great if you need to handle a lot of webhook calls. it also addresses the issue of web dynos sleeping or being terminated. a good book about it is "scalable internet architectures" it goes in deep into queue systems and how to use them.

a very important detail is that for worker dynos, remember to configure a `procfile` with a command that runs the queue worker script on startup:

```
worker: python worker.py
```

another great approach, and this is something i’ve used in recent times when i needed something more precise with time, is using `apscheduler` library which runs as a separate process. it's more flexible, and works well when you need to have very precise scheduling. it doesn't require an external task queue if you're not scaling massively, but you still need to run it in a separate worker dyno.

here’s an example of how you can achieve a function call every minute with apscheduler:

```python
from apscheduler.schedulers.blocking import BlockingScheduler
import requests
import time
import os

def my_webhook_function():
  webhook_url = os.environ.get('WEBHOOK_URL')
  print('calling webhook')
  response = requests.get(webhook_url)
  print(f'response from webhook: {response.status_code}')
  pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
  scheduler = BlockingScheduler()
  scheduler.add_job(my_webhook_function, 'interval', minutes=1)
  scheduler.start()

```
and your procfile would look like this:

```
worker: python scheduler.py
```

make sure you set a webhook url on the heroku environment config.
the key takeaway here is that web dynos on heroku aren't suitable for long-running background tasks, especially those needing precise time-based execution. using a worker dyno, either with a task queue or a scheduler like `apscheduler`, is the way to go for reliable execution. if you are using redis try to use the heroku add-on it makes the connection easier.

remember, it’s not your fault. heroku’s environment has its own quirks. we all learn by banging our heads a bit. and always start with the heroku documentation it will often guide you to the best solution for the problem at hand. if not stackoverflow is always an option... but you need to write it clearly so people can help. just make sure that you don't fall into the infamous 'works on my machine' pitfall. trust me, we've all been there. i'm also told that if a bug is a feature it means i’m not allowed to fix it, it seems to work somehow.
