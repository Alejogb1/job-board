Okay, let's tackle this. Having been through similar data wrangling scenarios more than a few times, I can appreciate the nuances involved. Separating unique words and their corresponding part-of-speech (pos) tags into distinct columns from a dataset is a fairly common preprocessing task when dealing with text data, especially in natural language processing. The core challenge here boils down to effective tokenization, tagging, and data transformation, each presenting its own set of technical details.

Essentially, we need to iterate through each text entry, identify the distinct words, determine their pos tags, and then structure this information into a tabular format. The complexities arise when considering variations in text structure, the ambiguity of some words (words can have multiple meanings and therefore, multiple pos tags) and the need for efficient code execution, especially if you're dealing with a large dataset.

Now, let me share three working examples that illustrate how to approach this. They're written in python, because, frankly, it’s the most practical language in this arena, primarily due to the strong ecosystem of nlp libraries. I will be using `nltk`, which is quite popular for these kind of tasks, and `pandas`, which is a workhorse for data handling and manipulation.

**Example 1: Basic Tokenization and POS Tagging with NLTK**

This example provides the core logic but doesn’t deal with the complexities of multiple tags or dataset handling. Its purpose is to illustrate the fundamental process.

```python
import nltk
from nltk import word_tokenize
from nltk import pos_tag
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
nltk.download('punkt') #required for word_tokenize
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger') #required for pos_tag
nltk.download('stopwords') #required for removing stop words

def extract_unique_words_and_tags(text):
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalnum() and token not in stop_words]
    tagged_tokens = pos_tag(filtered_tokens)
    unique_words = {}
    for word, tag in tagged_tokens:
        if word not in unique_words:
            unique_words[word] = tag

    return unique_words

text_example = "This is a test sentence, where we test different words. testing now!"
result = extract_unique_words_and_tags(text_example)
print(result)
```

In this initial snippet, I've started by importing the necessary components from the `nltk` library; specifically, tokenization, pos tagging functionality, and stopwords. Before using them, the necessary components must be downloaded. I then defined a function called `extract_unique_words_and_tags`. It takes in a text string, lowercases it, and applies tokenization and stop word removal to get a list of clean word tokens. A fundamental aspect is to use `.isalnum()` before doing stop word removal to discard punctuation and other non-alphanumeric characters. The pos tags for the tokens are determined, and these are stored into a dictionary keyed by word, with only unique words included. In this basic example, only the first pos tag is kept for each unique word.

**Example 2: Working with Pandas DataFrame**

The previous example was a functional demonstration but not terribly useful in real world applications. Most text data is stored in dataframes, so this example builds upon the first and introduces the pandas library to demonstrate the practicality of integrating this kind of processing directly into your typical data pipelines.

```python
import pandas as pd
import nltk
from nltk import word_tokenize
from nltk import pos_tag
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
nltk.download('punkt') #required for word_tokenize
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger') #required for pos_tag
nltk.download('stopwords') #required for removing stop words

def extract_unique_words_and_tags(text):
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalnum() and token not in stop_words]
    tagged_tokens = pos_tag(filtered_tokens)
    unique_words = {}
    for word, tag in tagged_tokens:
         if word not in unique_words:
            unique_words[word] = tag
    return unique_words

def process_dataframe(df, text_column):
    df['unique_words_tags'] = df[text_column].apply(extract_unique_words_and_tags)

    # Convert dictionary to separate columns for better structure
    expanded_data = df['unique_words_tags'].apply(pd.Series)
    df = pd.concat([df, expanded_data], axis=1)
    df = df.drop(columns=['unique_words_tags'])

    return df


data = {'text_content': ["This is another sentence for testing.",
                          "Yet another example to see how it works.",
                          "A final text string here."] }
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
processed_df = process_dataframe(df, 'text_content')
print(processed_df)
```

Here, we create a pandas dataframe and a similar extraction function as in the previous snippet. The main change lies in applying the function across an entire column using the `.apply()` method, and after obtaining the resultant dictionaries, they are converted into individual columns in the dataframe to fit the requirements. The `pd.concat` function ensures that the columns are appended to the dataframe and then the `unique_words_tags` column is dropped to clean up the dataframe. The output is a dataframe where each unique word from the input text column has its own column along with its pos tag as value.

**Example 3: Handling Multiple POS Tags**

In many situations, a word could have multiple interpretations and, therefore, multiple potential pos tags. The previous two examples considered only the first pos tag encountered, which is sometimes an inadequate approach. This final example demonstrates how to store all possible pos tags for a word.

```python
import pandas as pd
import nltk
from nltk import word_tokenize
from nltk import pos_tag
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
nltk.download('punkt') #required for word_tokenize
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger') #required for pos_tag
nltk.download('stopwords') #required for removing stop words

def extract_unique_words_and_tags_multiple(text):
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalnum() and token not in stop_words]
    tagged_tokens = pos_tag(filtered_tokens)
    unique_words = {}
    for word, tag in tagged_tokens:
        if word not in unique_words:
            unique_words[word] = [tag]
        else:
             unique_words[word].append(tag)
    return unique_words


def process_dataframe_multiple(df, text_column):
    df['unique_words_tags'] = df[text_column].apply(extract_unique_words_and_tags_multiple)

    #convert dictionary to separate columns for better structure
    expanded_data = df['unique_words_tags'].apply(pd.Series)
    df = pd.concat([df, expanded_data], axis=1)
    df = df.drop(columns=['unique_words_tags'])

    return df


data = {'text_content': ["The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog was barking.",
                          "Example of using multiple times, multiple tags.",
                          "A final example, that should be illustrative."] }
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
processed_df = process_dataframe_multiple(df, 'text_content')
print(processed_df)
```

In this third example, I modified the `extract_unique_words_and_tags_multiple` function to store a list of pos tags for each unique word, as opposed to storing only a single tag. The rest of the code, the `process_dataframe_multiple` function and the overall process, remains fairly identical to the previous example. This addresses the potential ambiguity in words that could be tagged with more than one pos type. The result is now a dataframe that not only provides unique words as separate columns but also presents the lists of their individual pos tags. Note that the lists can, sometimes, be of length one.

Now, regarding relevant resources, I'd recommend the following for deeper understanding:

1.  **"Natural Language Processing with Python" by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper.** This book is essentially the bible for anyone starting with NLTK. It provides a great grounding in the concepts and practical examples for basic and advanced nlp tasks.

2.  **"Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin.** This is a more comprehensive textbook that delves into the theoretical foundations of nlp. It’s useful for anyone looking for a broader and more rigorous understanding of the field, with chapters detailing various algorithms and modeling approaches.

3.  **The NLTK documentation itself.** The official documentation is well maintained, extremely detailed, and provides specific instructions for using the library's multiple modules. This is always the first place to check before looking for solutions online.

These resources provide a great starting point. I hope this helps you to extract the unique words and their pos tags from your dataset efficiently and effectively. Remember, preprocessing is a crucial step, and a solid understanding of the underlying mechanics can drastically improve the overall outcome of your nlp pipelines.
