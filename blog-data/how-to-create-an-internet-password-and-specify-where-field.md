alright, so you're asking about creating a password field on a webpage, and how to make sure that it's actually doing its job, yeah? i've been there, seen that, got the t-shirt, and probably a few scars too from dealing with user input. let me break it down based on how i’ve tackled this over the years, some lessons learned from the trenches, if you will.

first off, when we’re talking about password fields, we're mostly referring to `<input type="password">` in html. simple, but holds a lot of responsibility. it automatically masks the characters that the user types, which is a basic, but vital, security measure. it’s not foolproof but it’s a starting point. i remember when i first started, i’d seen a few “homegrown” implementations using javascript to mask letters, and they were… disaster areas. those early days made me very cautious about anything that wasn't a standard, browser-provided feature. the browsers generally handle password masking and auto-fill decently so it is best to rely on them, unless specific requirements override their behaviours.

however, let's talk about the full picture. just having that input field isn’t enough. we need proper html form structure and a secure backend to handle everything safely.

here's a quick html example for the password and user fields:

```html
<form id="loginForm" action="/login" method="post">
    <label for="username">username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required><br><br>
    <label for="password">password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="login">
</form>
```

note the `type="password"` attribute for the password. this tells the browser to mask the text. the `required` attribute makes it so that the field is mandatory to fill in to submit the form, which is best practice. this simple html structure is the foundation, but the actual security starts happening once the form is submitted.

this form will then be sent via the 'post' method to the `/login` url which it should be an endpoint in our backend.

when the form is submitted, it's our backend's responsibility to take care of the password securely. never, and i mean *never*, store passwords in plain text. i saw that once on an old system i inherited, and… well, let’s just say i had a rather long night. instead, use a proper hashing algorithm. bcrypt, argon2, or scrypt are solid choices. these algorithms add a 'salt' to the password and create a one-way hash. if someone steals your password database, they won't see the actual passwords, only the hashes, which are incredibly hard to reverse. think of it like this, it’s like trying to put toothpaste back into the tube; it will be messy and it would never go back completely the same.

here is a quick python example, using bcrypt, that you can adapt to your own backend framework, i will not add much context because every backend is different.

```python
import bcrypt

def hash_password(password):
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
    return hashed_password

def check_password(password, hashed_password):
    return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), hashed_password)

# example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    plain_password = "mysecretpassword"
    hashed = hash_password(plain_password)
    print(f"hashed password: {hashed}")

    is_correct = check_password(plain_password, hashed)
    print(f"password matches: {is_correct}")

    is_wrong = check_password("wrongpassword", hashed)
    print(f"password wrong: {is_wrong}")
```

this code snippet provides you with functions to hash and check your passwords.

it’s crucial to avoid storing the original passwords at all and rely on the secure hash. make sure to update the hash if any of the used security libraries has an update in their security. you don’t want to get caught using an outdated algorithm.

it isn't always easy making password handling, because there are also other things to consider. for example password reset, this is usually done via emails and it is important that these emails are safe and don’t expose password reset keys easily. the user must have access to the email, so usually these processes are done via a “magic link” mechanism to confirm the user ownership.

another thing that's often missed is password strength validation on the client-side, it gives the user immediate feedback before they submit. this usually involves checking for minimum length, required characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and maybe even making sure it's not a common password. javascript can handle that before sending the information to the backend. this is helpful to improve user experience and reduce the pressure to the backend by avoiding storing “weak” passwords.

here is a little javascript example for basic password validation you can apply to your webpage:

```javascript
function validatePassword() {
    const passwordInput = document.getElementById('password');
    const password = passwordInput.value;
    const passwordStrengthMessage = document.getElementById('passwordStrength');

    // basic check for min 8 characters
    if(password.length < 8){
         passwordStrengthMessage.textContent = 'password is too short, needs at least 8 characters';
         return false;
    }

     //check for at least one number
    if(!/\d/.test(password)){
        passwordStrengthMessage.textContent = 'password needs at least one number';
         return false;
    }
    // check for uppercase
     if(!/[A-Z]/.test(password)){
        passwordStrengthMessage.textContent = 'password needs at least one uppercase letter';
         return false;
    }

    // check for lower case
    if(!/[a-z]/.test(password)){
        passwordStrengthMessage.textContent = 'password needs at least one lowercase letter';
         return false;
    }

    // check for symbols
    if(!/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/.test(password)){
       passwordStrengthMessage.textContent = 'password needs at least one symbol';
       return false;
    }


    passwordStrengthMessage.textContent = 'password is strong';
    return true;

}
const loginForm = document.getElementById('loginForm');
loginForm.addEventListener('submit', function(event){
    if(!validatePassword()){
        event.preventDefault();
    }
})
```
this piece of javascript will run on submit, and will check the strength of the password before allowing the form to submit, it will also show the specific error on the passwordStrength html element. note that you can modify this password checker to fit your own requirements.

now, a word of caution. client-side validation is nice, but it's not a replacement for server-side validation. never trust data coming from the user’s computer, it is easily modifiable. always validate again at the backend to make sure no malicious data makes it to your database.

also, do not forget to protect the password reset and lost password functionality, because if that is left exposed, it could be exploited. consider implementing mechanisms like rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset feature.

the real challenge with security is that it's an ongoing process. you’ve got to constantly stay up-to-date with the latest exploits and recommendations. i’d recommend reading “serious cryptography” by jean-philippe aulbert and “applied cryptography” by bruce schneier. these books are essential for anyone dealing with any security related issue, and they cover this topic in very high detail.

one last very important note, make sure you have http enabled in your server, to guarantee the connection is encrypted, otherwise, all of this is pointless, if an attacker can read all the communications.

so, that's basically it in a nutshell. it's not just about throwing `<input type="password">` on a page. it’s about thinking through the entire workflow – from the user entering the password to the backend securely handling it. also do not forget about usability, because users will choose less secure passwords if they find them too hard to remember, the goal is to improve security without making the system too hard to use.
