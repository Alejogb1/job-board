Alright, let's tackle this one. The question of why certain TensorFlow Hub models resist fine-tuning is a recurring one, and it usually stems from a combination of factors embedded within their architectural design and the way they were initially trained. It's something I've bumped into a few times over the years, especially back when we were experimenting with transfer learning for a series of custom image recognition projects. We had one particularly stubborn ResNet variant from Hub that absolutely refused to budge, no matter what hyperparameter tuning voodoo we threw at it. After some serious inspection and experimentation, the patterns became quite clear.

The core reason isn't some sort of deliberate lock-down but rather the pre-training regimen coupled with the model's architecture. Essentially, a lot of models, especially older ones on Hub, are published with their parameters frozen intentionally. These models have often been trained on massive datasets, like ImageNet, and the pre-training process has resulted in parameters optimized for a specific task – in this case, classification of general images. Fine-tuning essentially means altering these already trained parameters to better fit a new, more specific task, which usually involves training on a smaller, more targeted dataset.

The challenge arises when those initial parameters are structured in a way that doesn't readily lend itself to further adaptation without risking catastrophic forgetting— that is, the model undoing its initial learning. Consider this: The earlier layers of many convolutional neural networks are responsible for extracting fundamental features like edges, corners, and textures. These are often highly generalizable and valuable across numerous tasks. The later layers, conversely, often specialize in features more specific to the pre-training task. Now, when you try to fine-tune the entire network, including these earlier layers, there is a risk of altering these fundamental feature detectors, potentially undermining their generalizability. This is especially true when the new dataset is considerably different from the original one the model was trained on.

Often, the models are published with only certain layers exposed for fine-tuning, or none at all. This is a deliberate design choice, influenced by considerations like avoiding the aforementioned catastrophic forgetting, as well as minimizing the computational demands on the user since fine-tuning deep networks can be quite resource-intensive. The frozen layers might also incorporate batch normalization layers, and these layers maintain running statistics that are influenced by the original training dataset. Changing these statistics without careful consideration can have adverse effects on the model's performance during fine-tuning.

Now, let's illustrate this with some examples of how this might look code-wise and how to address it when possible. Let’s start with an example where the entire model is frozen.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

# Example of a frozen TF Hub model
model_url = "https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_100_224/classification/5"
mobilenet_v2 = hub.KerasLayer(model_url, trainable=False)

# Attempt to set trainable to True, it won't have the desired effect
# It will still remain frozen due to the underlying implementation
mobilenet_v2.trainable = True
print(f"Is Mobilenet V2 trainable? {mobilenet_v2.trainable}")

# Let's define an input to demonstrate further
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3))
output_tensor = mobilenet_v2(input_tensor)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)

# Inspecting the layers of model - no trainable parameters reported
print(f"Trainable parameters: {sum([tf.keras.backend.count_params(p) for p in model.trainable_variables])}")
```

This snippet demonstrates that even if you set `trainable=True` for a model loaded via `tf.hub`, it might remain frozen due to internal mechanisms within the `KerasLayer` implementation and the model itself. You'll notice that the reported trainable parameters remain at 0, even after setting the trainable attribute. This is how certain models are explicitly made non-trainable.

Next, consider a model where only a part of it is intended for fine-tuning. This is quite common with more recent models, where we might have access to the classification layer but not the base convolutional feature extractor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

# Example of a partially fine-tunable model
model_url = "https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4" # Note this is feature vector model
feature_extractor = hub.KerasLayer(model_url, trainable=False)

# Now build our custom model on top
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3))
features = feature_extractor(input_tensor)
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(features) # 10 output classes
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_layer)

# Now setting the feature extractor part to trainable doesn't help, as it does not have trainable parameter in the first place.
# The weights of dense layer we just added are trainable.
model.layers[1].trainable = True  #This does nothing in our case, the feature extractor itself isn't trainable.
print(f"Is feature extractor layer trainable? {model.layers[1].trainable}")


print(f"Trainable parameters: {sum([tf.keras.backend.count_params(p) for p in model.trainable_variables])}")

# Inspecting the trainable parameters for dense layer that is the only one we have access to.
for p in model.trainable_variables:
  print(f"Trainable layer parameters: {p.name}")
```

In this example, the feature extraction part of the model ( `mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4`) is not fine-tunable. We build on top of it using a `Dense` classification layer. Setting the layer's `trainable` parameter to `True` will only affect *our* new `Dense` layer, not the pre-trained feature extractor which was loaded with `trainable=False`. This way, we are only fine-tuning the classification aspect of the model, leveraging the pre-trained feature extraction capabilities without disrupting them.

Finally, here’s a snippet where we *can* make certain layers trainable by inspecting the underlying model architecture and selectively targeting specific layers. This is the closest we get to achieving actual fine-tuning on older models which were intended to be mostly used as feature extractors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

# Example where some layers CAN be made trainable after inspecting the model.
model_url = "https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_100_224/feature_vector/5"  # Feature vector this time
mobilenet_v2_feature = hub.KerasLayer(model_url, trainable=False)


input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3))
features = mobilenet_v2_feature(input_tensor)
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(features)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_layer)


# Inspect the underlying keras model that the hub model uses.
for layer in mobilenet_v2_feature.trainable_variables:
    print(layer)

# Get the underlying keras model from the tf hub keras layer.
underlying_keras_model = mobilenet_v2_feature.get_config()["build_model"]

# Now find a suitable layer to allow fine-tuning of underlying feature extractor
# This works only if the model is built via Keras and not a custom module.
for layer in underlying_keras_model.layers:
    if "block_16_expand" in layer.name:
        layer.trainable = True
        print(f"Layer {layer.name} is now trainable")
        break


print(f"Trainable parameters: {sum([tf.keras.backend.count_params(p) for p in model.trainable_variables])}")
```

This last example highlights how one needs to inspect the model's underlying Keras structure to identify the exact layers that can be made trainable. It's a delicate operation and not always feasible.

For a deeper dive into the mechanics of transfer learning and the intricacies of these types of models, I highly recommend exploring the book "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet, particularly the chapters on convolutional networks and transfer learning. For a more formal treatment of the theoretical aspects, the original papers on ResNet, MobileNet, and related architectures would be invaluable. I would also suggest reviewing the TensorFlow documentation, as it often explains the specific implementation details of these models and how they are integrated into the framework. Finally, carefully reading the documentation for each model on TensorFlow Hub is crucial as the behavior can vary dramatically between models. The underlying message is: always check the specific details of the model before attempting fine-tuning, as not everything is trainable in the way one might intuitively expect.
