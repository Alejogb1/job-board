Alright, let's tackle this. The issue of a spring batch job failing with an exception when using `mapFieldSet` to read a single-column txt file isn’t exactly uncommon. In my experience, I’ve seen this particular situation arise multiple times, often when a seemingly straightforward text file ends up presenting a subtle configuration challenge. It typically boils down to a mismatch between how `mapFieldSet` expects the input to be structured and the actual content of the file, specifically with field mapping expectations.

Let's break this down step by step. The `mapFieldSet` method, which is usually utilized within a `LineMapper` implementation (most often a `DefaultLineMapper`), relies on the concept of a `FieldSet`. This `FieldSet`, think of it as a container for data extracted from a single line, needs to understand what constitutes a 'field' based on some delimiter. When dealing with a single-column txt file, the core problem arises if the line mapper's configuration anticipates a delimiter (such as a comma, semicolon, or even whitespace) when none actually exist in the single column file. It's a bit like trying to split a single word based on a space that's not there – it won't work.

The default behavior of `DefaultLineMapper` in combination with the common `DelimitedLineTokenizer` is to look for delimited fields. If your file has no delimiter, the tokenizer sees the whole line as a single, gigantic field, then attempts to map it based on index. However, when `mapFieldSet` is invoked to extract values by name, and no named fields have been configured or the indexes are wrong, it fails. This often leads to exceptions like `IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException` or `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, depending on how exactly you configured your `FieldSet` mapping.

Now, consider a typical scenario where we're expecting a single column containing user IDs, such as:

```
user123
user456
user789
```

If we configure our Spring Batch job to use `DelimitedLineTokenizer` without configuring it to recognize the single, undelimited field, we'll run into problems.

Here are three practical code examples demonstrating this common error and effective workarounds:

**Example 1: The Incorrect Setup (Resulting in an Exception)**

This setup will likely throw an exception because it expects a delimited structure.

```java
@Bean
public ItemReader<User> userReader() {
    return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<User>()
        .name("userItemReader")
        .resource(new ClassPathResource("users.txt")) // Assume users.txt contains user IDs, one per line.
        .lineMapper(new DefaultLineMapper<User>() {
            {
                setLineTokenizer(new DelimitedLineTokenizer()); // Default behavior tries to split on commas
                setFieldSetMapper(fieldSet -> {
                    User user = new User();
                    user.setUserId(fieldSet.readString("userId")); //Expects field "userId" but it is not defined
                   return user;
                });
            }
        })
        .build();
}
```
In this example, the default `DelimitedLineTokenizer` assumes that the input file is comma-delimited (or some other delimiter). However, we know the `users.txt` file has a single column. When `fieldSet.readString("userId")` is called, it doesn’t find a field named 'userId', the exception manifests. The problem here is a mismatch between how `DelimitedLineTokenizer` creates the `FieldSet` and how `FieldSetMapper` expects it to be. It's expecting "userId" to be a field name, and by default, the fieldset will simply name the field with an index.

**Example 2: Solution using a Custom Line Tokenizer**
A custom tokenizer that treats the entire line as a single field.
```java
@Bean
public ItemReader<User> userReader() {
    return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<User>()
        .name("userItemReader")
        .resource(new ClassPathResource("users.txt"))
        .lineMapper(new DefaultLineMapper<User>() {
            {
                 setLineTokenizer(new LineTokenizer() {
                    @Override
                    public FieldSet tokenize(String line) {
                        return new DefaultFieldSet(new String[]{line}, new String[]{"userId"});
                    }
                });
                setFieldSetMapper(fieldSet -> {
                    User user = new User();
                    user.setUserId(fieldSet.readString("userId"));
                    return user;
                });
            }
        })
        .build();
}
```
Here, we've replaced the `DelimitedLineTokenizer` with a custom `LineTokenizer` implementation. This custom tokenizer takes each line and creates a `FieldSet` containing a single string, which is correctly mapped to the "userId" field name, resolving the mapping issues.

**Example 3: Solution using a `PassThroughLineTokenizer`**

Spring Batch offers a `PassThroughLineTokenizer`, which is explicitly designed to treat the entire line as a single, un-split field. This solution is arguably more elegant than a custom tokenizer.

```java
@Bean
public ItemReader<User> userReader() {
     return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<User>()
            .name("userItemReader")
            .resource(new ClassPathResource("users.txt"))
            .lineMapper(new DefaultLineMapper<User>() {
                {
                    setLineTokenizer(new PassThroughLineTokenizer());
                    setFieldSetMapper(fieldSet -> {
                        User user = new User();
                        user.setUserId(fieldSet.readString(0)); // read using index 0
                         return user;
                    });
                 }
            })
            .build();
}
```

In this case, we use `PassThroughLineTokenizer` which generates a `FieldSet` where the entire line is the first element (index 0) which can then be retrieved from the `FieldSet` in the mapper using an index. Another option here is to use `setFieldSetMapper(fieldSet -> {User user = new User(); user.setUserId(fieldSet.readString(0)); return user;});`

It's crucial to remember that the key to avoiding these exceptions is to align your tokenizer's behavior with the structure of your input file. Incorrect assumptions about delimiters or field names often are at the root of problems.

For further study, I recommend exploring the official Spring Batch documentation, particularly the sections on `FlatFileItemReader`, `LineTokenizer`, and `FieldSetMapper` for a deeper understanding. Specifically, reading the chapters on "Working with Flat Files" can be very beneficial. The book "Spring Batch in Action" by Michael Minella also provides extensive, practical examples that directly address challenges like these. Moreover, you might want to delve into more theoretical discussions of text processing and lexical analysis in compiler design texts, such as "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman. While those are not Spring Batch specific, they provide a solid theoretical foundation.

In conclusion, the exception you're experiencing is due to a misalignment between the configuration of `mapFieldSet`, the `LineTokenizer`, and the structure of your single-column txt file. By ensuring that the `LineTokenizer` is set up to recognize the single field correctly, you can seamlessly read the data and avoid these exceptions. In essence, understand how each line gets tokenized and how that impacts your `FieldSet` mappings; it is fundamental for robust batch processing with Spring Batch.
