Alright, let’s tackle this. I remember a particularly frustrating project a few years back, involving genomic data visualization. We were using `ggpairs` quite heavily for exploratory analysis, and the default axis label sizes were just… inadequate, shall we say. The labels would overlap, making the plots practically unusable. So, believe me, I've been down this road, and it can be trickier than it seems at first glance.

The challenge with `ggpairs` isn't that you can't modify axis labels; it's that you need to understand the underlying structure to reach the correct levers. You're not directly modifying the axes of a single ggplot object, because `ggpairs` is generating a grid of them. Thus, the standard `theme` arguments you might instinctively reach for don't always apply directly. Instead, we need to tap into the `lower`, `upper`, and `diag` arguments, which control the subplots and their characteristics.

To adjust the axis label font size, we need to use the `axis.text` theme element specifically within the context of these `ggpairs` components. There are several ways to approach this, each with slightly different implications. Let’s explore three common scenarios with code examples.

First, let's consider a situation where you need to change the font size of *all* axis labels, both on the x and y axes, within your `ggpairs` plot. The code would look something like this:

```r
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  A = rnorm(100),
  B = rnorm(100, mean = 2),
  C = rnorm(100, mean = -1),
  D = rnorm(100, mean = 0.5)
)

ggpairs(data,
        lower = list(continuous = wrap("points", size=0.5)),
        upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size=3)),
        diag = list(continuous = wrap("densityDiag", size=1.5)),
        axisLabels='show'
        ) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8))
```

In this example, we create a `ggpairs` plot from some sample data. Crucially, we then chain a `theme` command that modifies the `axis.text` element globally, setting the font size to 8 points. This will apply the change to all the axis labels within the plot. The `axisLabels = 'show'` parameter within the `ggpairs` call is also necessary to ensure axis labels are visible in the first place.

Now, suppose you're dealing with plots where only the diagonal subplots need larger axis labels. Perhaps you're presenting a summary of the data, and those density plots and corresponding labels are central to your message. In this case, you need to specifically target the `diag` component of `ggpairs`. Here’s how you would do that:

```r
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data (same as before)
data <- data.frame(
  A = rnorm(100),
  B = rnorm(100, mean = 2),
  C = rnorm(100, mean = -1),
  D = rnorm(100, mean = 0.5)
)


ggpairs(data,
        lower = list(continuous = wrap("points", size=0.5)),
        upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size=3)),
        diag = list(continuous = wrap("densityDiag", size=1.5)),
        axisLabels='show') +
  theme(
    plot.diag = element_text(size = 12)
  )
```

Here, the crucial difference is that instead of `axis.text`, I'm using `plot.diag`. This particular theme element doesn't directly impact the axis text by default, but rather the text within each diagonal subplot that was explicitly labelled using the `axisLabels='show'` parameter in the `ggpairs()` call. This helps isolate and change specific axis labels that you may want to stand out and be more readable.

Finally, let's address a scenario where you want different font sizes for the x and y axis labels *only in lower and upper panels*. You might be thinking, “This is going to be complicated,” and while it’s slightly more involved, it’s manageable:

```r
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data (same as before)
data <- data.frame(
  A = rnorm(100),
  B = rnorm(100, mean = 2),
  C = rnorm(100, mean = -1),
  D = rnorm(100, mean = 0.5)
)


ggpairs(data,
        lower = list(continuous = wrap("points", size=0.5)),
        upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size=3)),
        diag = list(continuous = wrap("densityDiag", size=1.5)),
        axisLabels='show'
        ) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```

In this case, we are explicitly targeting `axis.text.x` and `axis.text.y`. By doing this, you gain more fine-grained control over each set of axis labels, allowing for different font sizes for horizontal and vertical axes and any other necessary text formatting.

Now, a few additional notes based on my experience. First, while the examples here use `size`, other relevant parameters like `face` (bold, italic), `color`, and `angle` can also be modified within the `element_text()` call. Second, I would strongly recommend consulting “ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis” by Hadley Wickham for a comprehensive understanding of the ggplot2 theming system. It’s the go-to resource for in-depth control over these elements. Also, Hadley Wickham’s “Advanced R” is immensely valuable for understanding how functions like `ggpairs` and `theme` are structured internally. Finally, I frequently reference the official ggplot2 documentation, available on the tidyverse website, for the most up-to-date information on parameters and options.

In my experience, the key takeaway is understanding that `ggpairs` produces multiple subplots, and you need to target the theming accordingly. While the global `theme(axis.text=...)` is the easiest option, sometimes you need to go deeper to get the specific look you need using `plot.diag` or `axis.text.x` and `axis.text.y`. It's an iterative process, so always examine the outcome and adjust as necessary. I hope this detailed breakdown helps you avoid the same visualization hurdles I encountered those years ago. Good luck with your data!
