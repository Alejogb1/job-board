Let's jump right into it. I've definitely tangled with delayed jobs in Rails quite a few times, and the question of rescheduling them is a common one that pops up in practice. The short answer is: yes, they can be rescheduled, but the "how" is where things get interesting, and it's far from a single approach. There are a few different ways to tackle it, each with its own set of considerations regarding performance, complexity, and the specific use case you’re trying to address. Let's break it down based on my experience, focusing on practical approaches.

First, let’s acknowledge the inherent nature of delayed jobs. When you enqueue a job using something like `delayed_job`, or a similar background processing library, you're essentially creating a record in a database table that stores the job's details—the handler (the code to execute), the arguments, and, crucially for our discussion, the run_at timestamp. It's this run_at timestamp that dictates when the job should be executed. So, to reschedule a delayed job, we're essentially talking about updating this field.

Now, in a basic scenario, where the rescheduling is predictable and needs no complex logic, you can simply leverage the built-in functionality if it is present for the specific job processing library you are using. For example, let's say you have a job that sends a welcome email and you need to reschedule it in case the email server is down. Here's an example using `delayed_job`:

```ruby
class SendWelcomeEmailJob < Struct.new(:user_id)

  def perform
    user = User.find(user_id)
    # Simulate email sending that might fail
    if rand(2) == 0  # Simulate occasional failure
      puts "Email failed, scheduling retry"
      reschedule_with_delay(1.hour)
      raise StandardError, "Email server down"
    end
    puts "Email sent successfully to user: #{user.email}"

  end

  def reschedule_with_delay(delay)
    job = Delayed::Job.where(handler: /SendWelcomeEmailJob/, :attempts.lt => 3).last

    if job
      job.run_at = Time.now + delay
      job.save!
    end
  end

end

# Somewhere in your user creation or signup process
user = User.create(email: "test@example.com", name: "Test User")
SendWelcomeEmailJob.new(user.id).delay
```

Here, we are defining a `reschedule_with_delay` method within the job itself. The most significant line is `job.run_at = Time.now + delay`. We find the most recent failed job (based on handler and attempt count) and reset the `run_at` time. This is a simple mechanism for basic retry or rescheduling based on specific failure scenarios.

Another pattern I’ve seen is to utilize a separate dedicated job scheduler mechanism rather than relying solely on the background processing library itself for complex rescheduling logic. Often this occurs when you need jobs scheduled based on more intricate schedules, for example, sending monthly reports to particular users, or executing jobs based on external system events. You could use something like the `whenever` gem to manage scheduled jobs, combined with delayed_job or sidekiq.

Consider the following, where we are dynamically scheduling a user report job to be run monthly based on a user’s registration date.

```ruby
require 'whenever' # If you use whenever

class GenerateUserReportJob < Struct.new(:user_id)

  def perform
    user = User.find(user_id)
    puts "Generating report for user: #{user.email}"
  end

  def self.schedule_for_user(user)
    #calculate the time for the next month report, based on user creation
    next_run_time = user.created_at.next_month
    GenerateUserReportJob.new(user.id).delay(run_at: next_run_time)

  end

end


# In your user model or somewhere relevant to scheduling
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  after_create :schedule_monthly_report

  def schedule_monthly_report
    GenerateUserReportJob.schedule_for_user(self)
  end
end

# Example user creation
User.create(email: "user1@example.com", name: "User 1")
```

In this scenario, we’re not exactly rescheduling an already queued job, but rather scheduling a new one dynamically based on the user's creation date. The important takeaway here is that, for regular and predictable rescheduling, using a separate scheduler gives you much more flexibility than constantly querying the delayed jobs table. Using delayed_job or sidekiq allows you to take advantage of a reliable queuing and processing system while also benefiting from the scheduling flexibility that other tools provide.

A third and more robust approach to rescheduling, which comes up quite often in systems that are very event-driven, is to introduce a sort of "retry queue" that keeps track of failed jobs and their respective backoff periods. In this pattern, the job doesn’t directly reschedule itself. Instead, it reports a failure to the "retry queue" which, after the designated delay, re-enqueues a similar job into the main queue. This adds another layer of indirection but gives you much more control.

Here's a simplified version of how this could look, assuming we are using a `RetryQueue` service or module:

```ruby
class BackgroundJob < Struct.new(:job_id, :payload)

  def perform
    begin
      process_payload
    rescue => e
       RetryQueue.enqueue_retry(self, e)
    end
  end


  def process_payload
     # Perform actual business logic
    puts "Processing job #{job_id} with payload #{payload}"
    if rand(3) == 0 #simulate error
       raise StandardError, "Processing failed"
    end

  end

end


# A simplified RetryQueue example. In a production app, you'd use something like Redis or a dedicated database table
module RetryQueue
  @@retry_jobs = {}

  def self.enqueue_retry(job, error)
     #add logic for exponentially growing delay, or configurable retry delay
     retry_delay = 10 # seconds as example
      @@retry_jobs[job.job_id] = {job: job, time: Time.now + retry_delay}

     #start retry processing
     RescheduleWorker.perform_in(retry_delay, nil)

  end

  def self.process_pending_jobs
    now = Time.now

    @@retry_jobs.each do |job_id, retry_details|
       if retry_details[:time] <= now
          puts "Rescheduling job #{job_id} after error."
          retry_details[:job].delay
          @@retry_jobs.delete(job_id)
       end

    end

  end


end


class RescheduleWorker

 def self.perform_in(delay, *args)
   sleep(delay)
   RetryQueue.process_pending_jobs
 end


end

# Example of a simple job
job = BackgroundJob.new("job-1", {key: "some data"})
job.delay

```

In this example, if a `BackgroundJob` fails, it informs the `RetryQueue`. A separate `RescheduleWorker` then periodically checks the queue and if the time is right, enqueues the job again. This is a powerful pattern because you can centralize retry logic, implement exponential backoff, and even introduce dead-letter queues for jobs that fail repeatedly. In real systems, a persistent store (like Redis or a dedicated database) is needed for the `@@retry_jobs` hashmap.

When thinking about rescheduling, it's crucial to consider the trade-offs. While directly updating `run_at` can work for basic cases, it becomes less manageable for complex rescheduling logic. Using an external scheduler or a separate retry queue provides better control and scalability. Always remember that each choice should align with your specific needs and the level of complexity your application demands. For more formal approaches to background job processing and job scheduling, I would recommend delving into the "Enterprise Integration Patterns" by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf. Also, if you’re utilizing `delayed_job`, a solid understanding of its underlying architecture and best practices is crucial for effective job rescheduling. You can dive deep into the documentation of `delayed_job` and also other background processing libraries to fully understand their inner workings. Finally, for a deep understanding of resilient systems, consider reading "Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software" by Michael T. Nygard, it offers insights that are invaluable in the context of background job processing. So, yes, rescheduling is possible, but the *how* is what really matters and needs to be tailored to your specific context.
