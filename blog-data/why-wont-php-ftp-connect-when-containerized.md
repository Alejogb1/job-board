Okay, let's tackle this. I've seen this particular headache rear its ugly head more times than I care to remember, often when transitioning a legacy php application into a containerized environment. The scenario of a php script failing to establish an ftp connection when running inside a container, while seemingly working fine outside, is almost always rooted in network configuration or permissions issues, not some inherent flaw in php itself. It's a frustrating situation, granted, but usually boils down to a few fairly common culprits.

My first encounter with this was back in 2015, migrating a fairly critical inventory management system to docker. The php ftp functions worked perfectly locally during development. Yet, the moment the docker container spun up, the ftp connection failed silently, leaving a very perplexed support team. After a lot of head-scratching and tcpdump sessions, the pattern became very clear.

Essentially, when you're working locally, your php script is typically running directly on your host machine, giving it direct access to your network and localhost. Containers, however, introduce a layer of abstraction. The network environment is no longer the host's direct network, but a virtualized one managed by the container runtime. This immediately introduces several potential points of failure for ftp connections.

Firstly, the most frequent culprit is the absence of proper *name resolution*. Inside a container, the default dns resolver might not be set up correctly, or it may not have access to the dns servers that resolve your ftp server's hostname. Consider this example, a very simplified php ftp connection attempt:

```php
<?php
$ftp_server = "ftp.example.com";
$ftp_user = "user";
$ftp_pass = "password";
$conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server);

if (!$conn_id) {
    echo "Couldn't connect to $ftp_server\n";
    exit;
}

if (@ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user, $ftp_pass)) {
    echo "Connected to $ftp_server as $ftp_user\n";
    ftp_close($conn_id);
} else {
    echo "Couldn't login to $ftp_server\n";
}
?>
```

This code, when run inside a container with incorrect or missing dns configurations, will likely fail at the `ftp_connect()` step. Your container needs to be able to resolve 'ftp.example.com' to an ip address. To remediate this, you can either explicitly specify dns servers in your docker configuration, use the host networking driver for development (not recommended for production) or use an environment variable for the hostname that resolves to the internal ip address of the target ftp server.

Secondly, firewalls can present significant obstacles. The container’s network stack, particularly when using the bridge network driver, might block outgoing connections to the standard ftp ports (21 for control and generally 20 for active data transfers or a higher range of ports for passive mode). If your host machine has a firewall enabled, you should ensure that connections from the docker bridge network are allowed to pass through. Likewise, any firewalls or network rules configured in the network where the ftp server is located must also permit connections from your docker container.

Often, the problem boils down to choosing the correct connection mode in the ftp protocol. Active mode ftp involves the server making a connection *back* to the client, which, in the case of a container, means the server would need to connect to the container’s often ephemeral and dynamically allocated ip address. This becomes a challenge when network address translation is at play. Passive mode (which, thankfully, has become more common) simplifies this by having the client initiate *all* connections, thereby mitigating the active connection issues. If you're not specifying the passive mode, you're likely having active mode issues without realizing it. You can force the passive mode in php like so:

```php
<?php
$ftp_server = "ftp.example.com";
$ftp_user = "user";
$ftp_pass = "password";
$conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server);

if (!$conn_id) {
    echo "Couldn't connect to $ftp_server\n";
    exit;
}

if (@ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user, $ftp_pass)) {
   ftp_pasv($conn_id, true); //enable passive mode
    echo "Connected to $ftp_server as $ftp_user\n";
    ftp_close($conn_id);
} else {
    echo "Couldn't login to $ftp_server\n";
}
?>
```

Enabling passive mode via `ftp_pasv($conn_id, true);` often resolves persistent issues related to the server being unable to reach the client. It also requires the ftp server to support passive connections, which most modern ftp servers do. If you're encountering persistent connection or data transfer issues, you should investigate the ftp server configuration and ensure it allows passive connections on the relevant port range.

Finally, incorrect environment variables and proxy configurations can also hinder ftp connectivity. If the container is behind a proxy server and your ftp server is not directly reachable, your php application will also fail to connect. In such cases, you may need to configure proxy settings inside the container. If your php application expects environment variables for the ftp server address, user, or password, these must be correctly defined within the docker environment. It's easy to miss this oversight, causing these issues. Consider this slightly modified example, where ftp credentials are read from environment variables:

```php
<?php
$ftp_server = getenv('FTP_SERVER') ?: 'ftp.example.com'; //defaults if env var not set
$ftp_user = getenv('FTP_USER') ?: 'user'; //defaults if env var not set
$ftp_pass = getenv('FTP_PASS') ?: 'password'; //defaults if env var not set

$conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server);

if (!$conn_id) {
    echo "Couldn't connect to $ftp_server\n";
    exit;
}

if (@ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user, $ftp_pass)) {
   ftp_pasv($conn_id, true); //enable passive mode
    echo "Connected to $ftp_server as $ftp_user\n";
    ftp_close($conn_id);
} else {
    echo "Couldn't login to $ftp_server\n";
}
?>
```

This code assumes you'll configure environment variables in the docker environment. Without these variables set correctly within the container, the code will either fall back to defaults or fail. This example also shows how a default value can be included if environment variables are not correctly set during container startup.

To debug these issues, I recommend starting with network checks using tools like `ping` and `nslookup` within the container to check name resolution. Then utilize `tcpdump` on both your host machine and inside the container to monitor network traffic and analyze connection attempts. If dns resolution is working correctly and passive mode is enabled, examine firewall configurations. For a deep dive into network debugging, “tcp/ip illustrated, volume 1: the protocols” by W. Richard Stevens is an invaluable resource. Also, understanding docker networking better would serve you well. "Docker in action" by Jeff Nickoloff is an excellent option for that. For more specific php ftp behavior I’d also look into the official php documentation for the ftp functions, you can often find clues there.

In my experience, the combination of faulty dns resolution, active ftp mode issues, and firewall configurations were typically the culprits. Once these issues are methodically ruled out, the ftp connection problems tend to vanish. The key, like with so much of technical troubleshooting, is a methodical, step-by-step approach. Good luck.
