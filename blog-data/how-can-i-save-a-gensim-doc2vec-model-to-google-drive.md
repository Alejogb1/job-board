Alright,  Saving a gensim doc2vec model to Google Drive—it’s a process I've streamlined quite a few times over the years, often finding myself tweaking the approach for different projects. I remember specifically a large-scale text analysis project, where we were processing millions of documents and retraining the model periodically. The need for reliable saving and loading to cloud storage became critical. The core challenge isn't in the gensim model itself, but rather in the interface between your local environment, gensim's model saving mechanisms, and the Google Drive api.

The essence of the solution lies in a combination of several steps: serializing the model from gensim, temporarily storing it locally, interacting with the google drive api, and then ensuring your processes can reliably access that data later. Gensim, as you're likely aware, can save models to disk as compressed binary files, and we'll utilize that capability.

First, you'll need the google drive api client. I’ve found the `google-api-python-client` library, typically installed via `pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib`, to be the most stable. You'll also need to authenticate to google drive, which involves creating credentials, which I assume you've done. Let’s focus on the actual save-to-drive aspect.

The basic process will unfold in roughly these steps:

1. **Serialize the model:** Save the trained `Doc2Vec` model to a local file, using gensim's built-in `save()` method.
2. **Authenticate with Google Drive:** Use the google api client to establish a connection to your Google Drive account with your credentials.
3. **Upload the Model File:** Upload the saved model file to Google Drive.
4. **Optionally track metadata:** store additional information such as the version, training date, and other relevant metadata for later retrieval.

Here's a basic code example to illustrate this:

```python
import gensim
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.http import MediaFileUpload
from google.oauth2 import service_account
import os

def upload_model_to_drive(model, local_filepath, drive_folder_id, credentials_path):

    # Save the gensim model locally
    model.save(local_filepath)

    # Authenticate with Google Drive
    creds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(credentials_path)
    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)


    # Upload the file to Google Drive
    file_metadata = {'name': os.path.basename(local_filepath), 'parents': [drive_folder_id]}
    media = MediaFileUpload(local_filepath, mimetype='application/octet-stream')
    file = service.files().create(body=file_metadata, media_body=media, fields='id').execute()

    # remove the local file after uploading.
    os.remove(local_filepath)

    print(f'File ID: {file.get("id")}')
    return file.get("id")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create a dummy model for demonstration
    documents = [gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(words=['hello', 'world'], tags=[0]),
                gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(words=['goodbye', 'world'], tags=[1])]
    model = gensim.models.doc2vec.Doc2Vec(documents, vector_size=5, window=2, min_count=1, workers=4)

    # Define the local file path, drive folder, and credentials file path
    local_file_path = 'doc2vec_model.model'
    google_drive_folder_id = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID' # replace with the ID of your desired Google Drive folder
    service_account_credentials = 'path/to/your/credentials.json' # path to your json file containing your service account credentials

    file_id = upload_model_to_drive(model, local_file_path, google_drive_folder_id, service_account_credentials)

    print(f"Doc2vec model uploaded with file id {file_id}")
```
In this first example, `service_account.Credentials` is used because it fits well into automated workflows where you don’t have user interaction. Notice the `application/octet-stream` mime type; it’s crucial for arbitrary binary files. Ensure you modify `YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` and `path/to/your/credentials.json` appropriately. Remember you need a service account for using this code. The id returned by the Google Drive service is critical for downloading the file later.

Now, let’s look at the inverse, loading a model from Google Drive. This time, I’ll also incorporate a simple version tracking mechanism for better management of multiple saved models:

```python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.http import MediaIoBaseDownload
from google.oauth2 import service_account
import gensim
import os
from io import BytesIO

def download_model_from_drive(file_id, local_filepath, credentials_path):
    # Authenticate with Google Drive
    creds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(credentials_path)
    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)


    # Download the model from Google Drive
    request = service.files().get_media(fileId=file_id)
    fh = BytesIO()
    downloader = MediaIoBaseDownload(fh, request)
    done = False
    while done is False:
        status, done = downloader.next_chunk()
        print(f"Download {int(status.progress() * 100)}%.")

    fh.seek(0)

    # Load gensim model from BytesIO buffer
    model = gensim.models.doc2vec.Doc2Vec.load(fh)

    # Save the model locally (optional).
    model.save(local_filepath)

    return model

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Replace with the actual file_id obtained from uploading
    uploaded_file_id = "YOUR_FILE_ID_FROM_UPLOAD"
    # Define the local file path and credentials file path
    local_file_path = 'downloaded_doc2vec_model.model'
    service_account_credentials = 'path/to/your/credentials.json' # path to your json file containing your service account credentials
    downloaded_model = download_model_from_drive(uploaded_file_id, local_file_path, service_account_credentials)

    print("Model loaded successfully from Google Drive.")

    # verify that model loaded and is working
    vector = downloaded_model.infer_vector(['test', 'document'])
    print(f"Inferred vector: {vector}")
```
Here, instead of writing to a file directly, we're using `io.BytesIO`. This avoids the need for intermediate temporary files when loading from Google Drive. We’re using the `MediaIoBaseDownload` object, which handles the stream and partial downloads, which are helpful when the models get very large. Again ensure you replace `YOUR_FILE_ID_FROM_UPLOAD` with the actual file ID you got from uploading the model.
Finally, consider a more robust model management system.  You might want to upload additional metadata to the Google Drive file. Here’s an enhanced snippet that does this by updating file description.

```python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.http import MediaFileUpload
from google.oauth2 import service_account
import gensim
import os
import json
from datetime import datetime

def upload_model_with_metadata(model, local_filepath, drive_folder_id, credentials_path, metadata=None):
    # Save the gensim model locally
    model.save(local_filepath)

    # Authenticate with Google Drive
    creds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(credentials_path)
    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)

    if metadata is None:
        metadata = {}
    metadata['upload_time'] = datetime.now().isoformat()
    metadata_string = json.dumps(metadata)

    # Upload the file to Google Drive
    file_metadata = {'name': os.path.basename(local_filepath), 'parents': [drive_folder_id], 'description': metadata_string }
    media = MediaFileUpload(local_filepath, mimetype='application/octet-stream')
    file = service.files().create(body=file_metadata, media_body=media, fields='id,description').execute()
    os.remove(local_filepath)

    print(f'File ID: {file.get("id")}, Description: {file.get("description")}')
    return file.get("id")


def retrieve_model_metadata(file_id, credentials_path):
   # Authenticate with Google Drive
    creds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(credentials_path)
    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)

    file = service.files().get(fileId=file_id, fields="description").execute()
    try:
        metadata = json.loads(file.get("description"))
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError):
        metadata = {}
    return metadata



if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create a dummy model for demonstration
    documents = [gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(words=['another', 'example'], tags=[0]),
                 gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(words=['testing', 'metadata'], tags=[1])]
    model = gensim.models.doc2vec.Doc2Vec(documents, vector_size=5, window=2, min_count=1, workers=4)

    # Define the local file path, drive folder, and credentials file path
    local_file_path = 'doc2vec_model_meta.model'
    google_drive_folder_id = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID' # replace with the ID of your desired Google Drive folder
    service_account_credentials = 'path/to/your/credentials.json' # path to your json file containing your service account credentials
    custom_metadata = {"version": "1.0", "training_data": "some_data"}

    file_id = upload_model_with_metadata(model, local_file_path, google_drive_folder_id, service_account_credentials, custom_metadata)
    print(f"Doc2vec model uploaded with file id {file_id}")
    retrieved_metadata = retrieve_model_metadata(file_id, service_account_credentials)
    print(f"Metadata: {retrieved_metadata}")
```

This example uses the `description` field in Google Drive to store a json payload, including a version number and date and other custom metadata.  You can retrieve this metadata later, which can be crucial for maintaining proper model lifecycle management. Be mindful, though, of the size limitations of that description field.

For further reading on the topics covered, I’d suggest "Natural Language Processing with Python" by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper for a solid foundation in text processing and gensim. For a deeper understanding of the Google Drive API, the official Google API documentation is, of course, the ultimate source, specifically looking into Google Drive API v3. For best practices in managing models and deployment, look at “Machine Learning Engineering” by Andriy Burkov. These resources, combined with hands-on practice, should equip you with the necessary knowledge. Remember that this process, while seemingly straightforward, is quite nuanced, especially with larger models and more complicated infrastructure. This should provide a good, solid starting point.
