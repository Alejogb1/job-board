Alright, let's dive into this. I've definitely been down that rabbit hole before—managing updates across multiple widgets in Qt can get a little complex, especially when you’re aiming for smooth, concurrent refreshes. Forget those awkward, staggered updates that make your application feel sluggish; what we want is a clean, almost instantaneous visual update.

The core issue centers around how `paintEvent` is called and how Qt manages the repaint process. By default, Qt calls `paintEvent` on a widget when it needs to be redrawn. This can happen because the widget's window was exposed, resized, or explicitly marked for an update via `update()` or `repaint()`. Now, if you're working with several widgets that need to refresh together, calling `update()` or `repaint()` on each one independently can cause those staggered updates we’re trying to avoid. The key lies in understanding how to trigger these updates in a way that minimizes visual artifacts and maximizes performance.

The simplest approach, albeit often insufficient for complex scenarios, is to trigger updates on all relevant widgets in a sequence and rely on Qt’s event loop to batch those paint events. Qt's event loop usually attempts to coalesce paint events if they occur close enough in time to prevent unnecessary re-draws. However, for multiple widgets that are tightly coupled, this is often not enough to yield the effect you are likely targeting, especially if you have complex painting routines.

Consider a scenario where I had to implement a custom data visualization tool, and I had a main graph widget surrounded by several smaller preview widgets which should reflect the current state of main graph view. Using naive individual updates, preview widgets were visibly lagging behind main graph updates.

Here is an illustrative code snippet of a simplified case:

```cpp
#include <QApplication>
#include <QWidget>
#include <QPainter>
#include <QTimer>
#include <iostream>

class CustomWidget : public QWidget {
public:
    CustomWidget(const QColor& color, QWidget* parent = nullptr) : QWidget(parent), color_(color) {
        timer_ = new QTimer(this);
        connect(timer_, &QTimer::timeout, this, &CustomWidget::updateData);
        timer_->start(50); // Simulate dynamic data
    }

    void updateData() {
       value_ += 5;
       if (value_ > 255)
          value_ = 0;
       update();
    }


protected:
    void paintEvent(QPaintEvent* event) override {
        QPainter painter(this);
        painter.fillRect(rect(), color_.lighter(value_));
    }
private:
    QColor color_;
    int value_ = 0;
    QTimer *timer_;
};


int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    QApplication app(argc, argv);
    QWidget mainWindow;
    mainWindow.setGeometry(100,100,800,600);

    CustomWidget* widget1 = new CustomWidget(Qt::red, &mainWindow);
    widget1->setGeometry(50,50,100,100);

    CustomWidget* widget2 = new CustomWidget(Qt::blue, &mainWindow);
    widget2->setGeometry(200,50,100,100);


    mainWindow.show();
    return app.exec();
}

```

In this basic example, each `CustomWidget` updates its color independently using `update()`. While the event loop tries to optimize it, if you run this with multiple widgets, you will often still observe slight phase shifts and not perfect synchronization, especially if your `paintEvent` implementations were more time-consuming.

One effective strategy to address this is to use a centralized data model that is shared across all widgets that need to update synchronously. Instead of having each widget manage its own data updates and trigger `update()` calls independently, you consolidate data and manage data changes, then trigger updates in a controlled manner. You then invoke a single update request on a parent widget, which will then trigger `paintEvent` calls for all related children.

Let's modify the previous example to use this model:

```cpp
#include <QApplication>
#include <QWidget>
#include <QPainter>
#include <QTimer>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>


class DataModel : public QObject {
  Q_OBJECT
public:
  DataModel(QObject* parent = nullptr) : QObject(parent) {
    timer_ = new QTimer(this);
    connect(timer_, &QTimer::timeout, this, &DataModel::updateData);
    timer_->start(50);
  }

  Q_SIGNAL void dataUpdated();

  int value() const {return value_;};

private:
  void updateData() {
     value_ += 5;
     if (value_ > 255)
       value_ = 0;
      emit dataUpdated();
    }

  int value_ = 0;
  QTimer *timer_;
};


class CustomWidget : public QWidget {
public:
    CustomWidget(const QColor& color, DataModel* model, QWidget* parent = nullptr) : QWidget(parent), color_(color), model_(model) {
        connect(model_, &DataModel::dataUpdated, this, &CustomWidget::requestUpdate);
    }

    void requestUpdate(){
       update();
    }


protected:
    void paintEvent(QPaintEvent* event) override {
        QPainter painter(this);
        painter.fillRect(rect(), color_.lighter(model_->value()));
    }
private:
    QColor color_;
    DataModel* model_;
};


int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    QApplication app(argc, argv);
    QWidget mainWindow;
    mainWindow.setGeometry(100,100,800,600);


    DataModel dataModel;
    CustomWidget* widget1 = new CustomWidget(Qt::red, &dataModel, &mainWindow);
    widget1->setGeometry(50,50,100,100);

    CustomWidget* widget2 = new CustomWidget(Qt::blue, &dataModel, &mainWindow);
    widget2->setGeometry(200,50,100,100);



    mainWindow.show();
    return app.exec();
}
#include "main.moc"

```
Here, the `DataModel` manages the data and emits a signal when an update occurs. Each `CustomWidget` is connected to this signal, and when the model emits, each widget request update on itself. This approach usually gives significantly better synchronization without resorting to complex manual painting logic.

For very complex scenes, you might find yourself needing an entirely different approach. In some scenarios, you could render to an offscreen buffer once and then use that buffer to update all your widgets. In this approach, you draw all content onto an image and then use `QPainter` to render this image to various widgets. In such a situation, one might employ techniques more aligned with graphics programming, as you’re effectively orchestrating an image buffer refresh and not relying on the standard `paintEvent` calls.

Here’s an outline of that process. Note, I have not included a working example in the text, due to its complexity: you would create a `QImage`, draw on it with `QPainter`, and then in your widgets’ `paintEvent`, you would draw this `QImage` to screen using `QPainter::drawImage`. The key aspect is to *ensure your image update is done just once per frame*. Each widget would then render the shared image within its paint event. If you have very different widget shapes, you would need to clip the image before rendering to the widget to maintain proper visualization.

These methods aren't mutually exclusive. Depending on the complexity and synchronization requirements of your user interface, you can combine these approaches. For example, for a main graph widget that updates a complex scene, use the off-screen render approach. For smaller preview widgets, you could use the shared model approach. This allows for a more targeted optimization process.

As for further reading, I would suggest diving into the official Qt documentation on the event system, specifically, sections covering the event loop, paint events, and using `QPainter`. A good practical book that delves into this would be "C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4", while the Qt documentation is for any version of Qt. You might find "Advanced Qt Programming: Creating Great Experiences for Desktop, Embedded, and Mobile" to also be helpful. Also, be sure to study the practical examples within the Qt source code, which can show a lot of advanced techniques. Studying examples in Qt Creator is especially useful.

Finally, always test your approaches, and remember that the best technique is highly contextual. Profiling your application using tools such as Qt Creator's analyzer can assist in detecting any potential performance issues during rendering. Effective refresh management, done correctly, makes a massive difference to your application’s user experience.
