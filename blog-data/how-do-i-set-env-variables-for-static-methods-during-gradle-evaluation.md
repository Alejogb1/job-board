Okay, let's unpack this. The challenge of setting environment variables that a static method can access *during* Gradle evaluation is a common hurdle, and it's one I've bumped into myself a few times, particularly during early build lifecycle customizations. It's not as straightforward as a simple property assignment within your `build.gradle` file, and there are some nuances that are worth considering. The core issue lies in understanding the execution phases of Gradle and how static methods interact with those phases.

The critical takeaway is this: static methods are resolved and their containing class is loaded by the jvm before Gradle ever actually *executes* any of your groovy build code. That means if your static method attempts to access environment variables at *class load time*, which is essentially the moment the jvm reads the class definition for the first time, those variables won't be populated by Gradle because Gradle hasn't started executing the build logic at that stage. I've seen this trip up many developers expecting the variables to be in place from the get-go.

To illustrate, think of it like trying to paint a room before the walls have been built. You need the environment to be *ready* before you can effectively leverage variables set within that environment. The Gradle build process involves several distinct phases: initialization, configuration, and execution. The environment variables you intend to pass down to your static methods need to be available *during* the configuration phase and accessible from the static method *when it's called*, which will always be *after* its class has been loaded. We can't modify the class loading mechanism directly; what we *can* control is when we call that static method, and we can use Gradle's task mechanisms or property system to inject the needed information.

So, the usual ways that won’t work are:

1. Setting an environment variable directly in the terminal or system (while it works, it's not Gradle-specific, and we need that dependency).
2. Directly trying to use a Java system property via `-D` within your class during the *class loading* process.

The solution, therefore, is to avoid reading the environment variable *at class load* time. We want to delay that process until *after* Gradle has had a chance to configure the build and the environment we're running in. Let’s consider three strategies that have served me well over the years.

**Strategy 1: Using Gradle properties within tasks.**

This approach makes use of Gradle’s configuration system and defers the environment variable lookup until a task execution phase. The key is to use a `doLast` block within the task, which is executed *after* the task configuration is completed.

```groovy
// build.gradle.kts
tasks.register("myTask") {
    doLast {
        val envVar = System.getenv("MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE")
        MyStaticClass.useEnvironmentVariable(envVar)
    }
}


// MyStaticClass.java
public class MyStaticClass {

    public static void useEnvironmentVariable(String envVar){
         System.out.println("Received Env Var: " + envVar);
    }
}

```

In this example, `MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` could be set in the terminal (e.g., `MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=somevalue gradle myTask`). The magic happens within `doLast` – only *after* Gradle configures this task does the java method call occur, with the environment variable that's only read when it's explicitly required. This ensures that the environment is available and avoids the static initialization problem.

**Strategy 2: Leveraging project properties**

Another approach is to capture the environment variable into a Gradle project property during the *configuration* phase and then have it accessible during the build lifecycle when needed, including by static method calls.

```groovy
// build.gradle.kts
val myEnvVariable: String? = System.getenv("MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE")

tasks.register("anotherTask") {
    doLast {
        MyStaticClass.useEnvironmentVariable(myEnvVariable ?: "default")
    }
}

// MyStaticClass.java
public class MyStaticClass {

   public static void useEnvironmentVariable(String envVar){
        System.out.println("Received Env Var: " + envVar);
   }
}

```

Here, during the configuration stage, the environment variable (if it exists) is read into a project property. Then the `anotherTask` task accesses that property. Again the actual call to `useEnvironmentVariable` happens at *execution* time. The check `?: "default"` means a default value can be provided if the environment variable isn't set.

**Strategy 3: Configuring system properties from gradle.properties**

While we want to avoid reading from `System` directly within a static method, we can still configure the system properties, then access them via a static method, provided that happens at runtime. This approach is useful when a static method *must* read a property and can't take a parameter as shown in Strategies 1 & 2.

First, configure `gradle.properties` like this:
```properties
mySystemProperty=myDefaultValue
```
Then, you can modify the task in `build.gradle.kts`:
```groovy
// build.gradle.kts
tasks.register("yetAnotherTask") {
   doFirst {
        System.setProperty("mySystemProperty", System.getenv("MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE")?: project.properties["mySystemProperty"] as String )
    }
    doLast {
        MyStaticClass.useSystemProperty()
    }
}
// MyStaticClass.java
public class MyStaticClass {
  public static void useSystemProperty() {
    String propertyValue = System.getProperty("mySystemProperty");
      System.out.println("System Property value: " + propertyValue);
  }
}
```
Here `System.setProperty` sets the system property in the `doFirst`, right before the main `doLast` block is executed. The static method reads the `System` property during the execution of this task, after it's been set. This provides a slightly more structured way for a static method to use environment variables without compromising lifecycle best practices.

**Important Considerations**

- **Avoid premature initialization:** Don't try to read environment variables in static initializers or static blocks; it will not work as intended. Push that logic until after Gradle has configured the environment.
- **Clarity is key:**  Make it evident how environment variables are used. Avoid implicit behavior. The `doLast` blocks give good traceability.
- **Error Handling:** Always include default values or error handling mechanisms to prevent unexpected runtime issues, using `?:` operator (Elvis operator in Groovy).
- **Testing:** Ensure your setup is properly tested across different environments.
- **Documentation:** Document how the variables need to be set, to minimize confusion for other developers.

**Recommended Reading:**

For a deeper dive into understanding the Gradle lifecycle, the official Gradle documentation is invaluable. Specifically, pay attention to the sections on the initialization, configuration, and execution phases. Look also into the concepts of project properties and tasks for effective builds. There are several chapters devoted to these concepts in 'Gradle in Action' by Benjamin Muschko, which is an excellent resource for mastering Gradle build systems. Finally, studying the core java classes around `System.getenv` and `System.getProperties` (especially around thread safety and concurrent modifications) can be helpful as well.

In summary, the critical aspect is understanding *when* the variables are accessed and making sure that it is not before the required environment is ready. You must work *with* the lifecycle to achieve what you need, instead of trying to force it. These strategies, along with a sound understanding of Gradle’s phases, will enable you to handle environment variables correctly and create robust builds.
