Okay, let’s unpack this. It's a situation I've encountered quite a few times, and it usually boils down to a subtle mismatch in how “identical” is being interpreted by our code, versus how *we* intend it to be interpreted. The scenario where you get a "definition differs" error, even when visually or intuitively the items seem identical, arises from the fact that identity, in a computational context, is rarely a purely visual check. It’s often a more nuanced comparison of internal state, memory location, and type, not just superficial resemblance.

Think back to a project I worked on years ago, a complex data processing pipeline for genomic data. We were dealing with incredibly large datasets, and a key part of the pipeline involved identifying and consolidating duplicate records. We kept running into that frustrating "definition differs" error when comparing two records that, when printed to the console, seemed absolutely the same. It taught me a very valuable lesson about the levels of equivalence, and how they can go wrong if not handled carefully.

The core issue often lies in how objects are defined and compared within a system. It's crucial to understand that equality in a programming context isn't a single, monolithic concept. We frequently deal with at least two key types of equality: *reference equality* and *value equality*.

*Reference equality* (also known as identity) checks if two variables are pointing to the exact same memory location. If `a` and `b` are references to the same object, `a == b` (depending on the language and implementation details), would return true if using reference equality. If, however, you create a new object that's an exact *copy* of the first, `a` and `b` would not be reference equal because they're distinct objects in memory, even if their contents are identical.

*Value equality* on the other hand, compares the actual contents or properties of objects. This is the kind of equality we usually want to check, at least in the context of data comparisons. It requires a careful definition of what constitutes "sameness" for your particular type. If you have a custom class, merely checking if two instances are “equal” using default equality will almost certainly end up checking for reference equality, leading to the "definition differs" error, even if the values of all the fields are equal.

The "definition differs" message arises when, for example, a hash-based data structure, like a set or dictionary, tries to determine if two objects are “the same” for the purpose of deduplication or lookup. This determination often involves hashing the object based on the values that constitute its identity. If two objects are value-equal but have different hash values due to inadequate handling of value equality within a custom type, you would encounter this issue.

Let’s look at a couple of concrete scenarios, with working snippets to illuminate the concept:

**Snippet 1: A Simple Class With Default Equality**

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

point1 = Point(3, 4)
point2 = Point(3, 4)

print(point1 == point2) # Output: False (Default reference equality)

points_set = {point1}
points_set.add(point2) # adds the object since the default comparison is reference equality
print(len(points_set)) # Output: 2
```

Here, even though `point1` and `point2` have the same values for their attributes, the default equality check returns false because it’s comparing references. A `set`, which should store unique elements, will incorrectly store both objects.

**Snippet 2: Implementing Value Equality**

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, Point):
            return False
        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y

    def __hash__(self):
      return hash((self.x, self.y)) # important to calculate a hash based on values

point1 = Point(3, 4)
point2 = Point(3, 4)

print(point1 == point2) # Output: True (Now using value equality)

points_set = {point1}
points_set.add(point2) # no object is added since we have value-equality comparison and value-based hashing
print(len(points_set)) # Output: 1
```

In this revised example, we’ve overridden `__eq__` and `__hash__` to implement value equality. This ensures that two `Point` objects are considered equal if their `x` and `y` attributes are equal, and that they will produce the same hash value based on these values. This fixes the deduplication issue and a “definition differs” type of error.

**Snippet 3: A More Complex Case**

Imagine you are working with a class representing product data, where equality is determined not just by product ids but by product configuration as well.

```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self, id, name, features):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.features = tuple(sorted(features)) # ensuring order doesn't impact comparison

    def __eq__(self, other):
       if not isinstance(other, Product):
          return False
       return (self.id == other.id and
               self.name == other.name and
               self.features == other.features)

    def __hash__(self):
       return hash((self.id, self.name, self.features))


product1 = Product(123, "Laptop", ["Touchscreen", "512GB SSD", "16GB RAM"])
product2 = Product(123, "Laptop", ["16GB RAM", "Touchscreen", "512GB SSD"])

print(product1 == product2) # Output: True (features are sorted for comparison)
products_set = {product1}
products_set.add(product2) # no object is added
print(len(products_set)) # Output: 1
```

Here the `Product` class implements value equality checking that also involves checking the tuple of `features`, thus requiring a comparison of values of a list that are converted to a `tuple` before comparison, and which are sorted so order does not matter. Without a proper value equality and `__hash__` implementation, these would be considered different items even with matching attributes and the same id, which would incorrectly be treated as duplicate entries.

To solve "definition differs" issues, then, the core strategy involves deeply understanding how objects are compared within your specific context. You must consider implementing appropriate `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods based on the value equivalence. When using containers such as sets and dictionaries, this is even more critical. When working with more complex data structures, you will need to normalize the attributes to guarantee that the order does not matter.

For a deeper dive into this topic, I recommend focusing on resources that cover object-oriented principles and data structures. Specifically, look into books like “Effective Java” by Joshua Bloch (while it’s Java-focused, the concepts around equality and hashing are universal) and “Clean Code” by Robert C. Martin for discussions on good design principles that can help reduce such errors. In addition, “Data Structures and Algorithms in Python” by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser is a solid guide on the implications of data structures in the context of equality.

In conclusion, the "definition differs" error is a signal that your equality logic is not aligned with the intended use case. Taking the time to implement proper value-based equality and hashing will save a lot of debugging time, and lead to more robust and reliable systems.
