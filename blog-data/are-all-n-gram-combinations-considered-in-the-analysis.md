Alright, let's tackle this one. It's a question that crops up quite frequently when discussing text analysis and, in my experience, it often leads to some misconceptions. So, let’s get into the specifics of n-gram processing and whether *all* combinations are indeed considered.

In short, the answer is usually no, not all possible n-gram combinations are analyzed in practical applications. This might seem counterintuitive at first, so let’s break down why and what the common strategies are. When we talk about n-grams, we're referring to contiguous sequences of ‘n’ items (usually words) from a given text. For example, “the quick brown fox” would yield the following bigrams (n=2): "the quick", "quick brown", "brown fox”. Trigrams (n=3) would give "the quick brown", "quick brown fox". And so on. The potential number of such combinations grows exponentially with n and the length of the text, which poses serious computational challenges.

My experience, particularly from a project a few years back involving large-scale customer feedback analysis, highlighted this issue very clearly. We initially attempted to extract and analyze all possible n-grams up to n=5. This led to a memory bottleneck and unbelievably slow processing, even on our fairly robust cluster. The problem was that the sheer volume of rare and essentially meaningless n-grams (sequences such as "a the and this" or "is of to was") overwhelmed the signal of the actually informative phrases. This experience underscored that indiscriminate n-gram extraction is rarely practical or useful.

So, what do we actually do? Instead of blindly collecting every possible combination, we employ several strategies to prune or focus on meaningful n-grams. These usually involve a combination of frequency analysis, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and filtering based on various criteria.

The most common starting point is **frequency-based filtering**. Simply stated, we count how often each n-gram appears in our corpus. N-grams that appear very rarely (below a certain threshold) are discarded. This effectively eliminates most of the noisy and nonsensical sequences. For instance, if our feedback dataset included millions of comments, a trigram like “the purple zebra” may appear only once or twice (if at all), and in that context, it’s unlikely to be relevant for sentiment or topic analysis, making it a prime candidate for exclusion. Frequency thresholds are usually determined empirically, often through experimentation. We'd typically plot a frequency distribution and pick a cutoff point where the curve flattens out, separating the high-frequency signal from the low-frequency noise.

Next, we can improve things with **POS tagging**. Using a tool like spaCy, NLTK, or Stanford CoreNLP, we can tag each word in our text with its grammatical role (noun, verb, adjective, etc). This allows us to focus our n-gram analysis on specific grammatical patterns. For instance, a sequence like "adjective noun" might be important for identifying entities, whereas sequences with a lot of conjunctions, prepositions, and articles may not be as interesting. We can build specific rules to filter n-grams based on their POS tag sequences. For example, if the goal is extracting sentiment, we might prioritize n-grams composed of “adjective” followed by “noun” and filter out n-grams where the first word is a preposition.

Another essential step is **stop word removal**. Stop words are extremely common words (like 'the', 'a', 'is') that carry little semantic meaning on their own. Before we calculate n-grams, it’s typical to remove these words, reducing the overall n-gram vocabulary size and allowing more meaningful patterns to surface.

Finally, there's the strategy of using **maximal n-grams**. Instead of considering all n-grams from n=1 to a maximum length, you might focus on the *longest* meaningful n-grams. If the text “the very quick brown fox jumps” is processed, you might keep “very quick brown fox jumps” and not all the contained subsets like “quick brown”, “brown fox jumps” etc. The assumption here is that the longest n-gram contains the most context and the shorter n-grams do not add much additional information.

To concretely demonstrate these principles, here are three simplified Python code examples using NLTK. The first one performs simple n-gram generation without filtering, to show how quickly the number of n-grams can explode. The second adds frequency-based filtering, and the third incorporates POS-based filtering.

```python
# Example 1: Basic N-Gram Generation (no filtering)
import nltk
from nltk.util import ngrams

text = "This is a test sentence for n-gram generation."
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
bigrams = list(ngrams(tokens, 2))
trigrams = list(ngrams(tokens, 3))

print("Bigrams:", bigrams)
print("Trigrams:", trigrams)

```
This snippet demonstrates that, even for a small sentence, the amount of n-grams increases with the value of n and that there are numerous n-grams that will be meaningless. Let's add some frequency filtering:

```python
# Example 2: N-Gram Generation with Frequency Filtering
import nltk
from nltk.util import ngrams
from nltk import FreqDist

text = "This is a test sentence for n-gram generation this is a repeat sentence"
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
all_bigrams = list(ngrams(tokens, 2))

freq_dist = FreqDist(all_bigrams)
filtered_bigrams = [gram for gram, freq in freq_dist.items() if freq > 1]

print("Filtered Bigrams:", filtered_bigrams)
```

This example shows how we can drastically reduce the list of n-grams by setting a frequency threshold. Finally, let's move on to POS-based filtering.
```python
# Example 3: N-Gram Generation with POS-Based Filtering
import nltk
from nltk.util import ngrams

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)

bigrams_with_pos = list(zip(ngrams(tokens, 2), ngrams([tag for _, tag in pos_tags],2)))

filtered_bigrams = [gram for (gram, tags) in bigrams_with_pos if tags[0] == 'JJ' and tags[1] == 'NN'] # Keep only "adjective noun" pairs
print("POS Filtered Bigrams:", filtered_bigrams)
```

This shows how we can select n-grams based on their Part-of-Speech tags. Here it keeps only the bigrams composed of an adjective followed by a noun.

To deepen your understanding of these concepts, I’d highly recommend exploring "Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin. This book provides an extensive and authoritative overview of all aspects of natural language processing. Additionally, research papers on n-gram language models are a valuable resource, for example, the foundational work on n-gram language models by researchers like Chen and Goodman. Also, the documentation for NLTK, spaCy, and Stanford CoreNLP can provide implementation details and more advanced techniques.

In conclusion, while all possible n-gram combinations exist theoretically, in practice, we always apply some level of filtering or selection to work with a manageable and meaningful set of n-grams. Ignoring this fact leads to noisy and often useless results. By leveraging frequency analysis, POS tagging, stop word removal, and other relevant techniques, we can focus on the most informative sequences for our particular application. This approach, honed through years of practical experience with large text corpora, is far more effective and computationally feasible than considering every single n-gram.
