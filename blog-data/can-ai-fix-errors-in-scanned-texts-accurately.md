Hey, OCR is pretty cool, right? I've been playing around with it lately and it's amazing how it can convert images to text. But, like all tech, it's not perfect. Sometimes it messes up the characters. That's where AI comes in. You can train AI models to correct those errors. I've been using a library called `pytesseract` in Python. It has a function called `image_to_string` which extracts text from an image. You can then use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to find and correct the errors. The cool thing about NLP is that it can learn the context of the text and make smarter corrections. I'm still experimenting with different models, but I'm really impressed with how well they can improve the accuracy of OCR.
