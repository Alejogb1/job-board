Alright, let’s talk about those pesky `NoMethodError` exceptions popping up in your `CommentsController#create` and `LikesController#create` actions. I’ve seen this particular issue rear its head more times than I’d care to count, and usually, it boils down to a few very specific, common pitfalls. It’s less about some grand, mysterious bug and more about a straightforward misunderstanding of object relationships or misconfigured configurations within the Rails framework. The nature of the error, ‘NoMethodError,’ essentially screams that you’re attempting to invoke a method on an object that doesn’t actually have that method defined. It’s a runtime error that occurs because the method call doesn’t match any of the object’s available interface. In the context of Rails controllers, this almost always signifies a problem with the data you’re trying to use during creation or the way you’re interacting with model associations.

Let’s break it down. When we're dealing with `create` actions in controllers, the typical workflow usually involves: 1) Receiving parameters from a form or API call. 2) Instantiating a new model object. 3) Assigning the received parameters to the new object’s attributes. 4) Attempting to save this object to the database. And it’s within these steps that `NoMethodError` tends to lurk, particularly in step 3 or during the save operation in step 4, often involving related models.

Based on the `CommentsController#create` and `LikesController#create` scenarios, I’d wager there’s a strong possibility of issues related to foreign keys or association mismatches. For example, let’s say your `Comment` model needs to be linked to a `Post` model. If, during the create action, you’re not correctly assigning the foreign key (let's say, `post_id`), or if you're trying to call a method on a nil object representing the related `Post`, `NoMethodError` is inevitable.

Similarly, in the `LikesController#create` action, perhaps your `Like` model needs to relate to both a `User` and something else, say a `Post` or a `Comment`. If you have not set up associations correctly, or you're passing an incorrect value, especially if it doesn't correspond to an existing record, you will encounter issues. It all boils down to ensuring that all required associations are correctly established and that the objects you're attempting to link do indeed exist in your database. Remember, Rails is very explicit about expecting objects to be where they are declared to be, and anything deviating from that expectation will throw an error.

Let me illustrate this with some fictional, yet representative code examples:

**Example 1: Incorrect Parameter Passing in `CommentsController#create`**

Imagine your `CommentsController#create` action looks something like this:

```ruby
def create
  @comment = Comment.new(comment_params)
  @comment.save # This line could cause NoMethodError
  redirect_to @comment.post
end

private

def comment_params
  params.require(:comment).permit(:body)
end
```

And the form you use to submit comments *only* submits the `body` attribute. In this case, you have an issue. Let's say your `Comment` model *must* have a `post_id`. While the `Comment.new(comment_params)` works, when the time comes to save, Rails may be expecting an associated Post object already or a `post_id` value, but you didn't provide either. Thus, either validation issues can occur, or worse when trying to get the `redirect_to @comment.post`, the `@comment.post` is likely nil.

Here’s the fixed version, which would prevent the `NoMethodError`, also incorporating basic validation check:

```ruby
def create
  @post = Post.find(params[:post_id]) # Assumes you're passing post_id

  @comment = @post.comments.build(comment_params)

  if @comment.save
    redirect_to @post, notice: 'Comment was successfully created.'
  else
    render 'posts/show', status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end

private

def comment_params
  params.require(:comment).permit(:body)
end
```

Here, I am doing a couple of crucial things: 1) finding the `Post` record based on the `post_id` passed in parameters 2) using the `comments.build` association method of the `@post` model, which not only instantiates a new comment, but automatically sets the correct `post_id` when we save. If a post with the given `post_id` does not exist, then `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` is thrown, which will need to be handled as well.

**Example 2: Association Issues in `LikesController#create`**

Let’s consider a more complex case. Suppose your `Like` model needs to associate with both a `User` and a polymorphic association that could be either a `Post` or a `Comment`. A typical `LikesController#create` action might resemble this initially, which is where things can go wrong:

```ruby
def create
  @like = Like.new(like_params)
  @like.save
  # redirect somewhere
end

private

def like_params
  params.require(:like).permit(:user_id, :likable_id, :likable_type)
end

```
The challenge here, as mentioned earlier, is that the `likable_id` and the `likable_type` needs to refer to existing records, otherwise you will get issues. If you send in params like `likable_id = 5` and `likable_type = "Post"` but there is no post record with `id = 5` , then saving will fail. Or if you call methods on the association later, such as `redirect_to @like.likable`, you'll face a `NoMethodError`. Here's the improved, and more resilient way of doing it:

```ruby
def create
    @likable = find_likable

  if @likable.nil?
     render plain: "Likable record not found", status: 404
    return
   end
    @like = current_user.likes.build(likable: @likable)


  if @like.save
    redirect_back fallback_location: root_path, notice: "Liked!"
  else
    render plain: "Failed to like", status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end

private
   def find_likable
      likable_type = params[:likable_type].constantize
      likable_type.find_by(id: params[:likable_id])
   rescue NameError
      nil
   end


   def likable_params
     params.permit(:likable_type, :likable_id)
   end
```

Here, a couple of key changes occur. First, we locate the `likable` record first by using `find_likable` function that uses `params[:likable_type]` and `params[:likable_id]` . Secondly, rather than manually passing in all parameters to the Like object, we utilize the association to the user with `current_user.likes.build` where the associated user is set automatically. The association to the `likable` record is then passed in by setting the `likable:` association when constructing the `Like` object. Error handling is built in to respond with 404 if a `likable` record cannot be found, and a 422 when saving of the like fails.

**Example 3: Misconfigured Associations**

Let's consider that the error is occurring when you redirect. Your comments and like models may be set up like this:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :comments
end

class Comment < ApplicationRecord
   belongs_to :post
end

class Like < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :user
    belongs_to :likable, polymorphic: true
end

```

But your `create` action may be missing the association, for example, `redirect_to @comment.post` in your `CommentsController#create`. If the `post_id` is not saved at the time of creation, the `post` association is not available yet. Therefore, if a developer tries to access the `post` association, it will throw a `NoMethodError`. Similarly with Likes, you can get `NoMethodError` if you try to `redirect_to @like.likable`, if either the record doesn't exist, or that the association itself was not properly set during object creation. The correct way is ensure all validations are added for the objects at the time of creation (as seen in examples 1 and 2) and to make sure the redirect is done with existing, associated objects.

**In summary**, when troubleshooting `NoMethodError` in your create actions, carefully scrutinize how you are handling model associations, how you are getting the objects, and whether the related objects actually exist in the database. Ensure that any foreign keys or association references are present and valid. Verify your parameter sanitization and the values you are passing in. Also, check if you're using helper methods that return nil values, that then you're attempting to chain method calls on.

For further in-depth study, I’d highly recommend diving into the official Rails guides concerning active record associations and validations. The "Agile Web Development with Rails" book is also an excellent resource for building a solid understanding of this fundamental web development pattern. The book 'Objects on Rails' provides a great way of thinking about objects and data in Rails applications, which may also give you an edge when debugging. Reading the source code of Rails on Github can also be helpful, as you can see the various associations and methods at play, including the active record library. Remember, understanding the core principles of object relationships and database interactions in Rails is paramount to writing bug-free applications.
