Okay, let’s unpack this. The question of checking for a specific substring within a Bash variable, particularly when that variable might contain multiline content, isn't as straightforward as a simple string comparison. I've had to deal with this exact scenario more times than I care to count, often when processing log files or configuration data stored in Bash variables. We need to iterate through each line and perform the substring check independently. Let's dive into the techniques.

Fundamentally, we're talking about a combination of string manipulation and iteration. Bash provides a few powerful ways to accomplish this, primarily utilizing loops and string-matching operators. The core concept revolves around splitting the multi-line variable into individual lines, then using pattern matching (such as `[[ ... ]]` with the `=~` operator or `grep`) on each line.

First, let's talk about how bash handles splitting into lines. Bash variables, when containing newline characters (`\n`), are treated as a single, continuous string, unless we specifically tell Bash to interpret them differently. We can use internal field separator (`IFS`) or the `readarray` command to split them.

Here’s a scenario I encountered while automating deployment scripts. I had a configuration string that looked something like this, stored within a variable aptly named `config_string`:

```bash
config_string=$'server1.example.com:8080\nserver2.example.com:9090\nserver3.example.com:8080\nserver4.example.com:7777'
```

I needed to check if any of those lines contained the substring `:8080`. Directly using `[[ $config_string =~ :8080 ]]` would be problematic, as it would treat the entire variable as one large string, not as individual lines.

So, let's look at the methods.

**Method 1: Using `readarray` and a Loop**

The most straightforward and often preferred approach is to use `readarray`, along with a `for` loop. `readarray` reads each line from standard input (or a variable) and populates an array. The nice thing is, it correctly handles newlines. Here’s how we could implement this check:

```bash
config_string=$'server1.example.com:8080\nserver2.example.com:9090\nserver3.example.com:8080\nserver4.example.com:7777'
substring=":8080"
found=false

readarray -t lines <<< "$config_string"

for line in "${lines[@]}"; do
  if [[ $line =~ "$substring" ]]; then
    found=true
    break
  fi
done

if $found; then
  echo "The substring '$substring' was found on at least one line."
else
  echo "The substring '$substring' was not found on any line."
fi

```

This snippet first defines the `config_string` and `substring`. Then, `readarray -t lines <<< "$config_string"` splits the multiline string into an array named `lines`, each element containing one line from the variable. `-t` makes sure that the trailing newlines are removed. The `for` loop iterates through each line within the `lines` array. `[[ $line =~ "$substring" ]]` performs the actual string match, and the `found` variable gets set if a match is located. The `break` ensures we stop looping once a positive match is located to save processing time.

**Method 2: Using a `while` Loop with `IFS`**

An alternative, older, yet sometimes preferable method is to use a `while` loop with the internal field separator `IFS`. `IFS` controls how Bash interprets words and lines. Specifically, by setting `IFS=$'\n'`, we instruct Bash to interpret each newline as a separate entry. Here is how it works:

```bash
config_string=$'server1.example.com:8080\nserver2.example.com:9090\nserver3.example.com:8080\nserver4.example.com:7777'
substring=":8080"
found=false

IFS=$'\n'
while read -r line; do
    if [[ $line =~ "$substring" ]]; then
        found=true
        break
    fi
done <<< "$config_string"

if $found; then
  echo "The substring '$substring' was found on at least one line."
else
  echo "The substring '$substring' was not found on any line."
fi
```

This second example accomplishes the same result as the first but it directly reads from the string. Here, `IFS=$'\n'` is set. The `while read -r line` loop reads each line, and `-r` tells read to not treat backslashes as escape characters (which helps avoid some obscure issues). It then runs the same match as before and sets the `found` variable.

**Method 3: Using `grep` (External Utility)**

Finally, we can achieve this using `grep`, an external utility powerful in its own right. The `grep` command is specifically designed to search text for specific patterns. In this context, it becomes quite efficient for our task:

```bash
config_string=$'server1.example.com:8080\nserver2.example.com:9090\nserver3.example.com:8080\nserver4.example.com:7777'
substring=":8080"

if echo "$config_string" | grep -q "$substring"; then
    echo "The substring '$substring' was found on at least one line."
else
    echo "The substring '$substring' was not found on any line."
fi
```

This snippet uses `echo "$config_string"` to pipe the string to `grep`. The `-q` option makes `grep` quiet, so it won’t print any output; it simply sets the return status indicating success or failure. If grep finds a matching line, it returns 0, treated as true in the shell conditional statement.

**Which method to use?**

*   `readarray` with loop: Generally preferred for readability and compatibility, especially if you need to do more than just check for the substring, as it's easier to manipulate the individual lines. It’s very bash-centric.
*   `while` loop with `IFS`: Useful when you want to avoid creating a large array in memory or are dealing with large strings that might not be suitable for array storage.
*   `grep`: Best for quick checks for the presence of a string. It's generally very fast since it's a highly optimized binary program. However, it might be overkill if you don't have specific `grep`-related needs.

For further exploration, I'd recommend checking out "Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide" by Mendel Cooper. It provides a very detailed breakdown of these and other Bash techniques. Another valuable resource is the "Bash Reference Manual", which is freely available and the single source of truth about Bash’s behaviour. Lastly, for understanding `grep` I recommend you study the POSIX documentation on `grep` and also read "Mastering Regular Expressions" by Jeffrey Friedl. It will greatly increase your regular expression skills, which are essential for working with text in almost any context.

In summary, while the question seems simple, the devil is in the details of how bash variables containing newlines are handled. Using `readarray`, `IFS` and `while`, or the external tool `grep` offers robust solutions to check for a substring within each line effectively and efficiently. My experience has shown me that choosing the approach often comes down to readability, specific requirements, and personal preference.
