```java
// Example code for a possible scenario

import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;

public class ClassConversion {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String className = "java.lang.String"; // Replace with the actual class name
        Class<?> clazz = Class.forName(className);
        Constructor<?> constructor = clazz.getConstructor(String.class);
        Object instance = constructor.newInstance("Hello, world!");
        System.out.println(instance);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The code uses reflection to dynamically create an instance of a class based on its string representation. The `Class.forName()` method loads the class dynamically, and the `getConstructor()` method retrieves the appropriate constructor. Finally, the `newInstance()` method creates a new instance of the class.

**Important Notes:**

* This solution is just a basic example. You need to replace `"java.lang.String"` with the actual class name you are trying to create.
* The code assumes that the class has a constructor that accepts a `String` argument. If the class has different constructors, you need to modify the code accordingly.
* This approach should be used with caution as it relies heavily on reflection and can be prone to errors. It's recommended to use other approaches like dependency injection or factory patterns for creating objects whenever possible.
* Consider adding error handling and validation to the code to handle cases where the class doesn't exist or the constructor is not available.
