Alright, let's tackle this bluetooth pairing annoyance on Android TV. It's a problem I've certainly faced in various embedded system integrations, and it usually stems from an interaction of device discovery mechanisms. Typically, you'll see these pairing requests because your Android TV is continuously scanning for discoverable bluetooth devices – that's essentially its default behavior. The challenge is to modify or circumvent this behavior in a way that's practical and, preferably, doesn't break other essential functionalities. We’re not talking about deep OS hacking here, just smart configurations and, where needed, tailored code.

The core issue is the system's bluetooth discovery process. Android, by design, promotes a user-friendly environment where adding devices is intuitive. However, this constant scanning can be a nuisance, especially when you're not actively trying to connect anything. To get around this, we'll need to consider a few layers. First, we examine existing system settings. Often overlooked, there may be a setting within the Android TV's specific bluetooth configuration to control discoverability, or at least the level of aggression used in the background scan. Some manufacturers provide additional options here; I’ve seen custom firmware that allows for turning off specific services related to constant scans. Look closely at your TV's settings menu. I can’t provide the *exact* path because manufacturers love to shift these around, but it's usually under 'bluetooth' or 'connections'.

If the UI settings don't cut it, we move to the next stage: application layer control. Certain Android applications use the Bluetooth APIs to maintain connections or search for devices. Consider if there's a persistent application initiating these scans. If the culprit can be identified, the most direct solution might be to modify the application permissions or uninstall it entirely if it's not needed. Android's permission system often allows granular control over bluetooth access for each application. Explore those in the system settings, and revoke unnecessary permissions.

And finally, when simpler methods fail, we might need to resort to a small application that is specifically written to manage bluetooth connectivity. We are not going to disable bluetooth entirely (that is an easy solution but not suitable for usecases which might involve other needed bluetooth devices), but what we can do is to control when and if device discovery is active.

Here are some code examples to illustrate how a small app can be built:

**Example 1: Limiting Discovery with the BluetoothAdapter:**

This snippet demonstrates how you can temporarily disable bluetooth device discovery. Crucially, you will need the appropriate bluetooth permissions to interact with the adapter. We'll include a simple toggle that allows manual on/off control. I’ve used this particular technique, adapted, on embedded devices with limited resources, which needed controlled bluetooth discovery for very specific periods of time.

```java
import android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter;
import android.content.Context;
import android.widget.Toast;

public class BluetoothController {
  private BluetoothAdapter bluetoothAdapter;
  private Context context;

  public BluetoothController(Context context){
    this.context = context;
    this.bluetoothAdapter = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();
  }


  public void toggleDiscovery(boolean enable){
     if (bluetoothAdapter == null){
        Toast.makeText(context, "Bluetooth not supported", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        return;
     }
     if (enable){
        if (!bluetoothAdapter.isDiscovering()){
           bluetoothAdapter.startDiscovery();
           Toast.makeText(context, "Bluetooth Discovery Started", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }else{
             Toast.makeText(context, "Bluetooth is already Discovering", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
     }else{
        if(bluetoothAdapter.isDiscovering()){
            bluetoothAdapter.cancelDiscovery();
            Toast.makeText(context, "Bluetooth Discovery Stopped", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }else{
           Toast.makeText(context, "Bluetooth is not Discovering", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
     }
  }
}
```

The code is very basic, and can be run on any android device, you would simply create a simple UI with an on/off button and connect it to the `toggleDiscovery` function. However, it should illustrate the core idea.

**Example 2: Monitoring and Controlling Bluetooth State (With BroadcastReceiver):**

This is a bit more robust because we actively monitor the bluetooth state changes. This allows you to set the discovery as you need, when it is needed. It also illustrates the use of a BroadcastReceiver for system-level events. It does require the correct permissions within your android project (`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>` and `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>`).

```java
import android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter;
import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.IntentFilter;
import android.widget.Toast;

public class BluetoothStateMonitor {
   private BluetoothAdapter bluetoothAdapter;
   private Context context;
   private BluetoothStateReceiver receiver;
   public interface BluetoothStateListener {
      void onBluetoothStateChanged(boolean isEnabled);
   }

   private BluetoothStateListener listener;
   public BluetoothStateMonitor(Context context, BluetoothStateListener listener){
    this.context = context;
    this.bluetoothAdapter = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();
    this.listener = listener;
   }

   public void startMonitoring(){
      receiver = new BluetoothStateReceiver();
      IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter(BluetoothAdapter.ACTION_STATE_CHANGED);
      context.registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
   }

    public void stopMonitoring(){
       if(receiver!= null){
          context.unregisterReceiver(receiver);
       }
    }
   public void enableBluetooth(boolean enable){
      if (bluetoothAdapter == null){
          Toast.makeText(context, "Bluetooth not supported", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
          return;
      }

      if(enable){
          if(!bluetoothAdapter.isEnabled()){
             bluetoothAdapter.enable();
          }
      }else{
         if(bluetoothAdapter.isEnabled()){
            bluetoothAdapter.disable();
         }
      }
   }

  private class BluetoothStateReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
        @Override
        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
            final String action = intent.getAction();
            if(action.equals(BluetoothAdapter.ACTION_STATE_CHANGED)){
               final int state = intent.getIntExtra(BluetoothAdapter.EXTRA_STATE, BluetoothAdapter.ERROR);
               listener.onBluetoothStateChanged(state == BluetoothAdapter.STATE_ON);
            }
        }
   }

}

```

Again, this is designed to be a simple illustration, but it highlights a very real-world approach – monitoring events rather than just blindly setting things. This receiver approach, for instance, enables you to implement logic like automatically disabling discoverability after a specific time period after a successful pairing, which is a very handy strategy that avoids any ongoing annoyance while allowing bluetooth to be active for other purposes.

**Example 3: Using a Service for Background Bluetooth Control:**

For continuous monitoring and control without needing the main UI of the application running, a `Service` might be more appropriate. A `Service` in android allows long running operations in the background, even if the activity or the UI is closed.

```java
import android.app.Service;
import android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.os.IBinder;
import android.os.Handler;
import android.os.Looper;
import android.widget.Toast;

import androidx.annotation.Nullable;


public class BluetoothControlService extends Service {
    private BluetoothAdapter bluetoothAdapter;
    private final Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        bluetoothAdapter = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();
    }

    @Override
    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
        monitorBluetoothState();
        return START_STICKY;
    }

    private void monitorBluetoothState() {
        new Thread(()-> {
            while(true){
                if(bluetoothAdapter != null && bluetoothAdapter.isEnabled() && bluetoothAdapter.isDiscovering()){
                  bluetoothAdapter.cancelDiscovery();
                  handler.post(()-> {
                      Toast.makeText(BluetoothControlService.this,"Discovery was disabled", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                  });
                  try{
                    Thread.sleep(1000 * 60 * 5); // Sleep for 5 minutes
                  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                   Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                   return;
                 }
                 }else{
                      try{
                        Thread.sleep(1000 * 10); // Check every 10 seconds
                      } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                          Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                          return;
                      }
                  }
              }
        }).start();

    }
    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
    }

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {
        return null;
    }
}

```

This example shows a simple service which will continuously monitor if the bluetooth is active and discovering devices, and disable discovery automatically (and show a message). While it's a simplified example, it points to how a more powerful and always-on control system can be built. It shows how a thread and handler can be used within a service to do background operations. This is where you would also look into implementing a "whitelist" of devices to ensure only specific devices are allowed to connect or trigger discovery.

Implementing any of these solutions might involve some level of familiarity with Android development. While the code here illustrates the main points, a thorough understanding requires that you delve into Android SDK documentation (particularly the `android.bluetooth` package), and resources like *Programming Android* by Zigurd Mednieks et al., which provides a very solid overview of practical Android development. For more advanced techniques, exploring official google documentation or the *Android System Programming* book from Apress would be very beneficial.

Remember, the best approach will depend on your specific scenario: The brand and model of the Android TV, your tolerance for a custom solution (an application), and whether you require any degree of bluetooth activity. These examples offer a way to manage the nuisance without completely compromising bluetooth connectivity.
