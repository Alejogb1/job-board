Alright,  I remember vividly a project a few years back, where we were building a CNN for a medical imaging classification task. The model’s performance was, frankly, excellent in terms of raw accuracy. But when it came time to explain *why* it was classifying a particular image as cancerous or benign, we were essentially looking at a black box. That’s a common situation with deep learning, and improving the understandability of predictions is vital for trust and real-world deployment. So, how do you break through the opacity of a Keras CNN? Here’s how I approach it, focusing on techniques that have consistently proven useful.

First, understand that 'understandability' isn't a monolithic goal. We need to differentiate between techniques for *visualizing* what the network focuses on and methods that allow us to *interpret* the network’s decision-making process. They are distinct and complementary.

For visualization, we often start with *activation maps*. This process involves extracting the feature maps from intermediate layers of the CNN after passing an input image. These maps show which parts of the input activated specific filters and, consequently, reveal where the network 'looks' for important features. In Keras, this is relatively straightforward. I frequently do this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_activation_maps(model, input_image, layer_name):
    """Visualizes activation maps for a given layer of a CNN.

    Args:
        model: A keras model.
        input_image: Input image as a numpy array with shape (height, width, channels).
        layer_name: The name of the layer for which activations are visualized.
    """
    intermediate_layer_model = keras.Model(inputs=model.input,
                                        outputs=model.get_layer(layer_name).output)

    input_image_expanded = np.expand_dims(input_image, axis=0) # Adding the batch dimension
    activations = intermediate_layer_model.predict(input_image_expanded)

    # Visualize the activation maps:
    num_filters = activations.shape[-1]
    rows = int(np.ceil(np.sqrt(num_filters)))
    cols = int(np.ceil(num_filters / rows))

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(rows, cols, figsize=(15,15))
    axes = axes.flatten()

    for i in range(num_filters):
        axes[i].imshow(activations[0, :, :, i], cmap='viridis')
        axes[i].axis('off')
    plt.show()
    plt.close()

# Example usage (assuming you have a model called 'my_model' and input 'test_image'):
# visualize_activation_maps(my_model, test_image, 'conv2d_layer_name_you_choose')
```

Here, the crucial bit is the `keras.Model` construction which specifically targets the output of a chosen intermediate layer. This lets you inspect, for instance, what features a convolutional layer is detecting. I recommend exploring several layers, starting from the initial ones and moving deeper. Initial layers often pick up low-level features like edges, whereas deeper layers recognize more complex patterns. Don't just look at individual activation maps, examine how they correlate with the original input.

Next, we move to Gradient-based methods, which build upon the idea of backpropagation. One popular technique I often use is *Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)*. Grad-CAM uses the gradients of the target class with respect to the final convolutional layer's feature maps to determine regions that are influential for the prediction. This provides a heatmap overlaid on the input image indicating where the model is looking to make a decision. Implementation requires accessing gradients, which Keras does allow. Here’s an example showcasing a barebones Grad-CAM:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K


def compute_gradcam(model, input_image, layer_name, class_index):
    """Computes and visualizes Grad-CAM heatmap for a specific class."""
    # Retrieve the output of the final conv layer for this image
    conv_output = model.get_layer(layer_name).output

    # Get the predicted class score
    predicted_class = model.output[:, class_index]

    # Calculate the gradients of the predicted class w.r.t. final conv output
    grads = K.gradients(predicted_class, conv_output)[0]

    # Get a function to retrieve the output and the gradient
    gradient_function = K.function([model.input], [conv_output, grads])
    output, grad_val = gradient_function([np.expand_dims(input_image, axis=0)])

    output, grad_val = output[0], grad_val[0]

    # Taking the weighted average of the gradient
    weights = np.mean(grad_val, axis=(0, 1))

    # Creating the gradcam
    gradcam = np.sum(weights * output, axis=-1)

    # Normalizing and visualizing the heatmap
    gradcam = np.maximum(gradcam, 0) / np.max(gradcam)
    gradcam = np.uint8(255 * gradcam)

    # Overlaying heatmap on original image
    heatmap = plt.cm.jet(gradcam)[:,:, :3] # Using jet colormap

    # Resize the heatmap to the original image's size
    heatmap = tf.image.resize(heatmap, (input_image.shape[0], input_image.shape[1])).numpy()

    plt.imshow(input_image)
    plt.imshow(heatmap, alpha=0.4)
    plt.show()
    plt.close()

# Example usage (assuming you have model, image, layer, and class):
# compute_gradcam(my_model, test_image, 'last_conv_layer_name', class_to_explain)
```
Grad-CAM is not perfect. The resolution of the heatmap is often limited to the resolution of the last convolutional feature map, leading to some blurriness. However, it offers a good understanding of what regions the network is utilizing for its classification. Be judicious in the selection of the `layer_name`; generally, you would select the last convolutional layer before the fully connected layer.

Finally, it's not all about visualization. *Perturbation analysis* is another powerful tool. This approach systematically alters the input image, such as by occluding parts of it, and observes how these perturbations affect the model's predictions. This helps you identify what areas are most salient for a given prediction. Here's an example of a basic occlusion sensitivity analysis:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def occlusion_sensitivity(model, input_image, occlusion_size, class_index):
    """Measures sensitivity of predictions to occlusion of regions in input image."""

    original_prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(input_image, axis=0))[0][class_index]
    rows, cols, _ = input_image.shape
    sensitivity_map = np.zeros((rows, cols))

    for i in range(0, rows - occlusion_size, 1):
        for j in range(0, cols - occlusion_size, 1):
            occluded_image = input_image.copy()
            occluded_image[i:i+occlusion_size, j:j+occlusion_size] = 0 # Occlude with zeros
            prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(occluded_image, axis=0))[0][class_index]
            sensitivity_map[i:i+occlusion_size, j:j+occlusion_size] += original_prediction - prediction

    plt.imshow(sensitivity_map, cmap='jet')
    plt.show()
    plt.close()


# Example usage:
# occlusion_sensitivity(my_model, test_image, occlusion_size=15, class_index=1)

```

By examining the `sensitivity_map`, you can see how the model’s prediction drops when specific regions are obscured, providing evidence for their importance. This can be useful when testing assumptions about what features might be important.

For deeper theory on these techniques, I would recommend exploring resources like “Interpretable Machine Learning” by Christoph Molnar. Additionally, the papers “Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-Based Localization” by Selvaraju et al. and “Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks” by Sundararajan et al. are crucial to understanding the theoretical foundation. These resources give not just the 'how' but also the 'why', which I find incredibly important for serious work.

In summary, achieving true understandability in CNNs is an iterative process. Activation maps give a broad view of learned features. Grad-CAM provides heatmap localization of important regions. Perturbation analysis reveals how the model's decision changes due to specific input changes. All these, when used in conjunction, allow you to create models that are more transparent and, ultimately, more trustworthy. It's not about completely demystifying the 'black box' but about understanding the inner mechanisms well enough to have reasonable confidence in their deployment.
