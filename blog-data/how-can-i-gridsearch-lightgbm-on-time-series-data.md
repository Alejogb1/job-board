Okay, let's tackle this. Having spent a fair amount of time working with time series forecasting and gradient boosting, I've learned that grid searching LightGBM on this type of data requires a more nuanced approach than a simple randomized search over parameter space. The inherent temporal ordering of time series data means that we can’t just shuffle our data or use standard cross-validation techniques; this can lead to severe data leakage and overly optimistic model evaluations. I remember a particularly painful project a few years back where I ignored this, resulting in a model that performed spectacularly on my validation set and miserably on actual new data – a mistake I only made once.

The central issue is that time series data is autocorrelated; past observations influence future observations. This violates the assumption of independent and identically distributed data which underpins much of traditional machine learning. Thus, our cross-validation and grid search strategies need to preserve this temporal order.

The first crucial aspect is to implement a *time-series specific cross-validation strategy*. Rather than randomly splitting your data, use techniques such as *forward chaining* or *rolling-origin* cross-validation. These approaches train on a contiguous window of the historical data and then validate on a subsequent, non-overlapping period. This mimics real-world prediction scenarios where we use past data to predict the future. Let me give you an example in python using `scikit-learn` and a custom function to create these splits:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

def create_time_series_splits(data, n_splits):
    """Creates rolling time-series splits."""
    tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=n_splits)
    splits = []
    for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(data):
      splits.append((data.iloc[train_index], data.iloc[test_index]))
    return splits

# Example usage
data = pd.DataFrame({'values': np.random.rand(100)})
splits = create_time_series_splits(data, n_splits = 5)
for train_set, test_set in splits:
    print(f"Train size: {len(train_set)}, Test size: {len(test_set)}")
```

Here, `TimeSeriesSplit` automatically manages the expanding window for training, and ensures our test set is always from the future relative to our training set. You'll notice how the training set grows with each fold, while the testing set remains consistent (given a fixed `n_splits`). The crucial bit is that we're not using future data to train models to predict past values.

Now, regarding grid searching, I often prefer using the `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` functions from scikit-learn. However, with time series data, we don't feed the data directly to these algorithms since we need to maintain the time series split we created above. Instead, we use a loop to iterate through our custom splits, train and evaluate our model with each parameter combination, and then collect and aggregate the results. This is where a bit of careful implementation is key. Let's say we wanted to find the best `learning_rate` for LightGBM:

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

def time_series_grid_search(data, param_grid, n_splits):
    """Performs grid search with time series splits on LightGBM."""
    results = []
    splits = create_time_series_splits(data, n_splits)

    for train_set, test_set in splits:
        for learning_rate in param_grid['learning_rate']:
            model = lgb.LGBMRegressor(learning_rate=learning_rate, objective='regression', seed = 42)
            model.fit(train_set.drop('values', axis = 1), train_set['values'])
            predictions = model.predict(test_set.drop('values', axis = 1))
            rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(test_set['values'], predictions))
            results.append({'learning_rate': learning_rate, 'rmse':rmse})
    return pd.DataFrame(results)

#example usage:
param_grid = {'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2]}
results = time_series_grid_search(data, param_grid, n_splits=5)

print(results)
```

In this simplified example, we iterate through the specified learning rates, train the model on each training set and evaluate on the respective test set.  We then aggregate the metrics, typically using something like the mean or median, to determine the ‘best’ parameters. Of course, in a real-world scenario, you'd want to grid search over more than just the learning rate, and perhaps adjust the number of leaves, the max depth of the trees and the number of boosting rounds among other hyperparameters.

Third, and this is a subtle point that I've seen often overlooked: consider incorporating lagged features into your feature matrix before training your LightGBM model. Time series models greatly benefit from having their previous values as inputs. The easiest way to create such features is to use the shift method from pandas. Here's how I often approach this:

```python
def create_lagged_features(data, lags):
    """Creates lagged features for time series data."""
    for lag in lags:
        data[f'value_lag_{lag}'] = data['values'].shift(lag)
    return data.dropna()


# Example usage
lags = [1, 2, 3]
lagged_data = create_lagged_features(data.copy(), lags)
print(lagged_data.head())
```

With these lagged features, the model is now able to learn sequential dependencies and temporal dynamics which are key to capturing the underlying patterns of your time series data. Remember to apply this preprocessing step before you start training and validating the model using the earlier methods.

For diving deeper into the theory and best practices for time series analysis, I'd highly recommend *Forecasting: Principles and Practice* by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos. It's an invaluable resource for getting to grips with the underlying principles. For a more practical guide on using machine learning for time series tasks, you should consider *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by Geron. Additionally, for understanding more advanced cross-validation strategies, a solid paper to read is “A Comparison of Cross-Validation Techniques for Time Series Forecasting” by Bergmeir and Benítez. This will expose you to methods beyond the simple time-series split I’ve shown here.

In summary, grid searching LightGBM on time series data boils down to implementing a proper time-aware cross-validation approach, being mindful about lagged features, and then using a methodical approach to tuning. Ignore the temporal nature of the data at your peril, or face the kind of frustration that I’ve endured in past projects.
