 so you're asking about JAX and its random normal generation stuff right Been there done that Let me tell you I've wrestled with this thing enough times to know a thing or two or maybe three

First off JAX random number generation isn't your typical NumPy random module It's a whole different ballgame It's all about purity and reproducibility when you are working with JAX you aren't messing around with global states and mutable randomness No siree This has its advantages like easier parallelisation and deterministic computations but it takes a bit of getting used to if you are coming from standard NumPy

Essentially JAX uses a concept called "key" Think of it as a seed but on steroids Instead of a single seed you have this key that can be split to get new keys without affecting the original key This is why you don't see functions like `np.random.seed()` in JAX it is all implicit with these keys This makes sure you get different random numbers every time you need them but with the control to replicate a sequence if you need to

Now to the good stuff normal distributions. To get a normal random array you use `jax.random.normal` This is where the key comes in If you don't use it you will end up getting the same set of random numbers each time You need to split the key to get different random values. I cannot emphasize how important that is I have seen so many people spend hours debugging this exact thing believe me it happened to me

 so the very basics. Here is a snippet to create a simple array of random numbers taken from a normal distribution

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

# This is your main random key initialize it somewhere up top only once
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)

#Split the key for every new random process
key1 , key2 = jax.random.split(key)

#Generate array from normal distribution
normal_array = jax.random.normal(key1 , shape = (5 ,5))
print(normal_array)

normal_array2 = jax.random.normal(key2 , shape = (5,5))
print(normal_array2)

```

See how we split the key before generating each array? If you run this multiple times you will get different outputs for `normal_array` and `normal_array2` but if you reuse `key1` or `key2` without splitting again you will get the same numbers each time I wasted a whole day before figuring this out because of some lazy copying and pasting.

Now you might wonder  so what about more complex cases where I need different kinds of randomness in my program? That's where the magic of key splitting comes in again Let's say you have a complex simulation with multiple random components each one needs its own source of randomness You wouldn't want all random numbers to come from the same key split right? The key to solving the issue is to split again and again for each random process

Let me give you an example Imagine a situation where you have a function that needs to generate random weights and biases for a simple linear model using normal distribution.

```python

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp


def init_params(key, input_size, output_size):

    key_w, key_b = jax.random.split(key)

    weights = jax.random.normal(key_w , (input_size , output_size))
    biases = jax.random.normal(key_b , (output_size ,))

    return weights, biases


key = jax.random.PRNGKey(1)
weights , biases = init_params(key , 10 ,5)

print("Weights : \n" , weights)
print("Biases : \n" , biases)


key2 = jax.random.PRNGKey(1) # Same seed to prove deterministic behavior
weights2 , biases2 = init_params(key2 , 10 , 5 )
print("Weights2 : \n" , weights2)
print("Biases2 : \n" , biases2)

```

See this works perfectly if you give the same seed you get the same initial parameters that is very important if you want to keep track of your experiments and have it repeatable

Now here's a thing people often get confused with when working with functions. What happens when you generate random numbers inside of a jitted function? The JIT compiler will only evaluate it once when the function is first compiled and not every time the function is called. This results in the same random numbers if we don't pass in a new key each time to the function.
To get around this you need to pass a key to the jitted function and split it inside the function.

Here is how to do it properly

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import jit


@jit
def my_random_function(key , shape ):

    key1 , key2 = jax.random.split(key)

    normal_arr = jax.random.normal(key1,shape)
    other_normal_arr = jax.random.normal(key2,shape)

    return normal_arr , other_normal_arr

key = jax.random.PRNGKey(2)

for _ in range(3):
    key , subkey = jax.random.split(key)
    arr1 , arr2 = my_random_function(subkey ,(3,3))
    print("Arr1 \n" , arr1)
    print("Arr2 \n" , arr2)

```

In this example, the `my_random_function` function is jitted, but the key is passed as an argument and split inside the function to make sure you get different random numbers on each function call.

One last thing before we wrap this up if you want to have a normal distribution with a custom mean and standard deviation. You can normalize the default normal distribution to any mean and std using this formula `output = mean + std * jax.random.normal(key, shape)`. It's simple straightforward math nothing too fancy there.

This whole randomness thing can feel a little weird and confusing at first especially if you are used to NumPy's global random state. But once you wrap your head around the idea of keys splitting it is actually really powerful and gives you a lot of control over randomness in your JAX programs. Once I was trying to debug a multi-agent system and I could not for the life of me figure out why I was getting the same sequence of random actions I was so mad I had to take a break after 4 hours of not getting it it turns out that I forgot to split my key in each agent during the initialization stage. So I learned my lesson that day the hard way. The important thing is that you can exactly replicate an experiment from its key so if someone claims to get some results you can ask them for the key and you can replicate it exactly if they do give you the key or if they lie then you know what's up that's the advantage of JAX. The funny thing is that now i miss the bad old days of debuging python and pytorch with random seeds sometimes feels like a more honest world

For more in-depth reading I suggest looking at the JAX documentation it is very good there is also a very good paper titled "JAX: Composable Transformations of Python+NumPy Programs" which explains the design principles of JAX in detail I would also recommend "Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers" the JAX version because it talks a lot about how to deal with randomness in a functional paradigm. They explain all of this in very detailed ways.

So that's it That's all I know about JAX's random normal generator. Good luck and don't forget to split your keys! I hope this was helpful
