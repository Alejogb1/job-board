Right then, let’s unpack this. Asynchronously calling methods from a property getter or setter in C# is, let's be frank, a bit of a minefield and a pattern that often leads to more problems than it solves. I've encountered this situation myself, many times, particularly in the early days of building a resource-intensive service where I naively tried to encapsulate everything. The initial allure of simplicity is usually followed by a cascade of headaches, mainly stemming from the inherent synchronous nature of property accessors.

First, it’s crucial to understand why direct asynchronous calls within a property are problematic. Property accessors are designed to be synchronous—they are intended to be fast, simple operations. Introducing async operations directly breaks that expectation. The caller of your property will expect an immediate return, not a `Task` or a `Task<T>`, which is precisely what an async method returns. Blocking the thread within a getter or setter waiting for a task to complete is a recipe for deadlocks and performance bottlenecks, essentially rendering the asynchronous nature of your calls pointless. Moreover, the semantics become quite counter-intuitive: what if the setter is called multiple times rapidly? What happens if the task is not yet complete and the getter is called? These are just some of the issues that pop up, often at the worst possible time.

Now, while directly invoking async methods from within property accessors isn’t recommended, there are workarounds, though they are not without caveats and should be carefully evaluated. The core challenge revolves around managing the asynchronous operation outside the property itself, usually using caching, event-based systems, or a dedicated background process.

One approach I’ve successfully implemented, albeit sparingly, involves using a backing field to store the results of the async operation and updating that backing field in the setter. In this case, we'd launch the async operation, but return a value already available to us, which might be default or last value. This approach works under a specific set of constraints, like if the data retrieval or manipulation is idempotent. Here’s a code snippet illustrating this:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class AsyncPropertyExample
{
    private string _data;
    private bool _isFetching;
    private Task _fetchTask;

    public string Data
    {
        get
        {
            // Return cached data, even if the async task isn't done.
            return _data;
        }
        set
        {
           _data = value; // Update the data in the backing field directly
           
           // Trigger an asynchronous data refresh using a Task if we haven’t yet.
           if (!_isFetching)
           {
               _isFetching = true;
               _fetchTask = FetchDataAsync(value).ContinueWith(_ => _isFetching = false);

           }
        }
    }

     private async Task FetchDataAsync(string input)
    {
        // Simulate fetching the data using the setter input.
        await Task.Delay(100);
        _data = $"Fetched data: {input}";
        Console.WriteLine($"Fetch Complete with Value: {_data}");

    }
}


public static class Program
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var example = new AsyncPropertyExample();

        // First access returns the initial data, likely null or an empty string
        Console.WriteLine($"Initial data: {example.Data}"); // Returns whatever initial value is in _data
        example.Data = "initial";

        // Access the property multiple times, and it doesn't block.
        Console.WriteLine($"First data retrieval: {example.Data}");
        example.Data = "test";
        Console.WriteLine($"Second data retrieval: {example.Data}");
       
        await Task.Delay(200); // Wait long enough for the background operation to complete
        Console.WriteLine($"Third data retrieval: {example.Data}");


    }
}
```

In this approach, the setter immediately updates the data and if necessary, initiates a background task to fetch fresh data. The `get` accessor returns the cached value, offering a non-blocking access. While this pattern is seemingly simple, it has drawbacks, including potential inconsistencies in returned data if the fetch operation is ongoing, and the added complexity of managing the async operation. It also doesn't allow for a synchronous way to wait for the async operation to complete, which can be problematic. This is a fairly common way to handle setting data which triggers a later update on the property, such as when using a view model.

Another slightly more involved, yet more robust, method utilizes an event to notify when the data becomes available. This approach decouples the setting process from the access, and it works well in situations where you want to trigger further processing after data availability. Here’s the code for that:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class AsyncPropertyExampleWithEvent
{
    private string _data;
    public event EventHandler<string> DataUpdated;

    public string Data
    {
        get => _data;
        set
        {
            _data = value;
           
            FetchDataAsync(value);
        }
    }

    private async Task FetchDataAsync(string input)
    {
        // Simulate fetching the data from a resource
        await Task.Delay(100);
        _data = $"Fetched data: {input}";
        Console.WriteLine($"Fetch complete with event firing, value: {_data}");
        DataUpdated?.Invoke(this, _data); // Raise the event
    }
}


public static class Program
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var example = new AsyncPropertyExampleWithEvent();
       
        example.DataUpdated += (sender, data) =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Data Updated Event Fired: {data}");
        };

        // First call
        example.Data = "initialData";

        // Subsequent calls
        example.Data = "newData1";
        example.Data = "newData2";

        await Task.Delay(200);
        //The DataUpdated event handler will be executed upon fetch completion.
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how the setter can trigger a background update via the `FetchDataAsync` method, and then invoke an event once the data has been fetched. The consumer of the class then subscribes to the `DataUpdated` event to receive the most recent data. This makes the access asynchronous while keeping the property accessors synchronous.

The final example I'd like to present uses a more specific type of situation, where you have a property that needs to perform some asynchronous work, but not necessarily every time. Imagine a scenario where you are loading user data, you might want to update the UI with a cached version immediately but also refresh it in the background. Here's a sample with a task cache:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Concurrent;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class AsyncPropertyExampleWithCache
{
    private string _cachedData;
    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, Task<string>> _tasks = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, Task<string>>();

    public string UserData
    {
        get
        {
           
            return _cachedData; // Return cached data or a default value.
        }
        set
        {
            // update cached data immediately
            _cachedData = value;

            // fetch data, but also make sure that only one operation is ongoing per key
            _tasks.GetOrAdd(value, FetchDataAsync);

        }
    }

    private async Task<string> FetchDataAsync(string userId)
    {
         Console.WriteLine($"Fetching user data for: {userId}...");
         await Task.Delay(100); // Simulate fetching.
         var data = $"Fetched user data for {userId}";

        Console.WriteLine($"Completed data for : {userId}");
         return data;
    }
}

public static class Program
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var example = new AsyncPropertyExampleWithCache();

        example.UserData = "user1";
        example.UserData = "user2";

        Console.WriteLine($"Initial user1 data: {example.UserData}"); // Returns immediately.
        example.UserData = "user1";
         Console.WriteLine($"Second user1 data: {example.UserData}"); // Returns cached version.
        example.UserData = "user3";

        await Task.Delay(300); // Wait for all async operations.
        Console.WriteLine($"Final user data: {example.UserData}");
    }
}
```

This version utilizes a concurrent dictionary to store tasks, ensuring that multiple attempts to fetch data for the same userId don't result in multiple unnecessary calls. The property returns immediately, and if you request the same data again it uses the cached version, if it's available. This approach offers much more control on how you treat async operations based on input data.

In summary, directly performing async operations within a C# property's getter or setter is generally not advisable due to the constraints of the synchronous property access model. Instead, opt for patterns that use caching, event notification, or background processes to manage asynchronous operations, and make sure to consider the specific needs of your application, and how users interact with that property. I would recommend digging into 'Concurrent Programming on Windows' by Joe Duffy and 'C# 8.0 in a Nutshell' by Joseph Albahari for more of the core concepts used here. Each has a different angle on understanding asynchronous programming and will enhance the understanding further.
