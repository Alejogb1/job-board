Let’s tackle this gradient tracking issue. I've seen this crop up countless times, and it's often a matter of understanding the nuances in how autograd works with pytorch tensors. It’s not always obvious, and the symptoms can be a bit misleading. When a tensor is created with `requires_grad=True`, it signals to pytorch that the operations performed on this tensor should be tracked, allowing for the subsequent calculation of gradients during backpropagation. However, this flag is not the *only* determining factor. I recall a particularly frustrating debugging session a few years ago when I was working on a custom convolutional neural network; I had meticulously set `requires_grad=True` on my input tensor, but the gradients remained stubbornly `None`. It wasn't due to a bug in the network architecture, but rather, a silent and critical detail in how the operations on the tensor were being handled.

The core of the issue often lies in how pytorch's autograd system builds the computational graph. This graph essentially represents the sequence of operations performed on tensors, creating a dependency tree that autograd uses to compute the gradients. If an operation, explicitly or implicitly, leads to the creation of a *new* tensor that is detached from the graph, then any subsequent operations on this new tensor will not have their gradients tracked even if the tensor's `requires_grad` flag is set to `True`. In simpler terms, the `requires_grad` flag is not contagious; if it's lost at some point, it will not be recovered automatically.

Let’s get into the specific scenarios.

First, an in-place operation can break the graph. These operations modify the tensor directly rather than creating a new one. While convenient, they alter the tensor history, which means previous operations that led to the tensor are essentially rewritten. Autograd cannot efficiently track gradients when such changes happen. Pytorch will usually warn you about these scenarios. For instance, suppose we modify a tensor `a` with an in-place addition like this: `a += some_other_tensor`. This is *not* the same as `a = a + some_other_tensor`. The first is in-place and breaks the graph tracking; the second involves creation of a new tensor, inheriting `requires_grad=True` if the involved tensors have this property and preserving the graph.

Second, certain tensor manipulation functions detach the tensor from the computational graph. The most common example here is explicitly using the `.detach()` method. If, for some reason, a tensor you wish to track has been `.detach()`ed at some point, then autograd won't build a graph back from this point on. The detached tensor has no knowledge of the operations that produced it, nor does autograd retain the connections required for backpropagation. It acts as a newly created tensor, and it will propagate this detachment to subsequent operations, regardless of the `requires_grad` flag. Similarly, operations that return *values* rather than *tensors* can also implicitly cause detachment, because operations on simple values are not part of the tensor computational graph.

Third, and frequently overlooked, is the conversion of tensors to numpy arrays and back. If you convert a pytorch tensor to a numpy array with `.numpy()`, any operations you perform on the numpy array are, of course, outside of pytorch's autograd system. Subsequently converting the numpy array back into a pytorch tensor, with `torch.from_numpy()`, does *not* magically re-attach it to the graph. This new tensor is entirely disconnected from the graph, regardless of any setting for `requires_grad=True`.

Let's illustrate with code. First, an example of the in-place issue:

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor with requires_grad=True
a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], requires_grad=True)

# In-place addition, breaking the graph
a += b

# Calculate the gradients, and they will be 'none'
c = a * 2  # even this will not be part of a graph since a has no tracking history.
c.sum().backward()
print(a.grad) # Output: None, because of in-place operations before c was defined.
```

Here, even though `a` was initially created with `requires_grad=True`, the in-place operation `a+=b` modifies `a` directly without retaining the operation history needed for automatic differentiation.

Now, consider the detach issue:

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor with requires_grad=True
a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)

# Detach the tensor
detached_a = a.detach()

# Perform an operation on the detached tensor
c = detached_a * 2
c.sum().backward() # this should fail because of c not being in any graph.
print(a.grad) # Output will also likely be None, as the forward pass did not use the original 'a' value
```

Here, even if we try to perform backpropagation, the gradients of `a` will be `None` as `detached_a` is explicitly cut off from the computation graph. The operation on `c` can’t be traced back to ‘a’s history. We will often get runtime errors if we try to call `backward()` on a detached tensor directly.

Finally, the numpy conversion issue:

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

# Create a tensor with requires_grad=True
a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)

# Convert to numpy array
a_numpy = a.detach().numpy() # detach here to avoid in-place changes on numpy array
# Perform operation on numpy array
a_numpy_modified = a_numpy * 2

# Convert back to torch tensor
a_modified = torch.from_numpy(a_numpy_modified).requires_grad_(True)

# Perform operations
b = a_modified * 2
b.sum().backward()

print(a.grad) # Output: None - the conversion broke the graph.
print(a_modified.grad) # Output: Tensor([2., 2., 2.]), gradients can be computed from the newly created tensor.
```

In this third example, although we explicitly set `requires_grad=True` on the tensor converted back from the numpy array, it’s still completely disconnected from the original tensor 'a' and the graph that it belonged to. Autograd won't trace the history back to the original tensor. Also, notice how in the third example, I detach `a` before converting it to a numpy array. This is important to avoid in-place operations implicitly happening via numpy array manipulation.

The solution to these problems is generally to be vigilant about the operations you perform on tensors which need gradient tracking. Avoid in-place operations where possible. If you need to detach a tensor, make sure you understand why and whether you might need the gradients from that part of the graph later. When converting to numpy, understand that the connection to the autograd graph is lost and, if necessary, carefully rebuild the tracking when needed.

For resources on autograd and best practices, I recommend studying the official PyTorch documentation thoroughly. Beyond that, “Deep Learning with Pytorch” by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann provides a very good explanation of the core concepts behind the autograd engine. Additionally, research papers such as the original AutoGrad paper (“Automatic Differentiation in Machine Learning: A Survey”) can be quite helpful in developing a deep understanding of the underlying mechanics. These sources provide the technical details necessary to avoid common pitfalls, including the very specific case you've encountered here.
