Alright, let's tackle this. I've seen this issue pop up more than a few times, and it usually boils down to a few key differences in how LSTMs and Dense Neural Networks (DNNs) handle input data, especially when we're talking about time series. Specifically, the `TimeseriesGenerator` in Keras, while incredibly useful, can sometimes be a bit… finicky. The problem isn’t that LSTMs are inherently worse; it's more about how the data is shaped and fed into them compared to a standard DNN.

Before we get deep into the weeds, let's clarify. DNNs, which are often used for classification and regression tasks on static data, are designed to process independent input vectors. Each input is treated as a separate instance with no inherent temporal ordering or relationship to others. They’re essentially looking at the data in a snapshot-like manner. LSTMs, on the other hand, are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) designed to handle sequential data. They are built to remember previous inputs and learn temporal dependencies within the data. That sequential processing is where the `TimeseriesGenerator` and the LSTM's expectations can clash if we’re not careful.

The root cause, in my experience, is usually one of three things, often in combination: the input shape incompatibility, the inadequate sequence length, or issues with normalization/preprocessing. Let’s explore each one.

**1. Input Shape Incompatibility:**

The most frequent culprit is that the `TimeseriesGenerator` might not be creating input sequences in the shape the LSTM expects. A DNN usually expects input of shape `(batch_size, number_features)`, where each batch is a collection of independent instances. An LSTM, on the other hand, needs input of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, number_features)`. This third dimension, `sequence_length`, is the number of time steps the LSTM processes in one go. If `TimeseriesGenerator` is improperly configured, it can produce data that's missing the sequence length dimension or has an incorrect length. When the LSTM receives an input that doesn’t have that sequence dimension, it will not work as expected, often resulting in no learning happening.

To illustrate, let’s take a fictitious scenario I once encountered. We had some sensor readings collected every minute. Our goal was to predict the next sensor value using past readings. If the generator was configured to output only a single timestamp at a time, the shape would be (batch_size, num_features) which is good for DNNs but an LSTM would fail. Let's illustrate this.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Sample Data (100 timestamps, 2 features)
data = np.random.rand(100, 2)

# Incorrect TimeSeriesGenerator config for LSTM
generator_incorrect = keras.preprocessing.sequence.TimeseriesGenerator(
    data, data, length=1, batch_size=16
)

# Sample batch
batch_x, batch_y = generator_incorrect[0]
print("Incorrect shape for LSTM (X):", batch_x.shape) # Output: (16, 1, 2) with sequence length of 1
print("Incorrect shape for LSTM (Y):", batch_y.shape) # Output: (16, 2)

# Correct TimeSeriesGenerator config for LSTM
generator_correct = keras.preprocessing.sequence.TimeseriesGenerator(
    data, data, length=5, batch_size=16
)

# Corrected batch
batch_x_correct, batch_y_correct = generator_correct[0]
print("Correct Shape for LSTM (X):", batch_x_correct.shape) # Output: (16, 5, 2) sequence length of 5
print("Correct Shape for LSTM (Y):", batch_y_correct.shape) # Output: (16, 2)
```

In the first case, we are generating an output sequence of length 1. LSTMs expect the second dimension to be greater than 1. The corrected configuration sets `length` to 5, generating sequences of 5 time steps as inputs to the LSTM. This change makes all the difference. A DNN might be successful with the first (incorrect) output because it does not care about a sequence but a specific input. This is a simple, but very important distinction.

**2. Inadequate Sequence Length:**

Even if the shapes are technically correct, the `sequence_length` chosen can be insufficient for the LSTM to capture meaningful temporal patterns. LSTMs work by remembering information over time, so if the `length` parameter in the `TimeseriesGenerator` is too small, the LSTM may not have enough context to learn anything useful. For short sequences, the LSTM effectively behaves like a feedforward network since it does not get to utilise its temporal characteristics. This would also result in no learning if the underlying signal requires it.

Let’s say I was working on predicting stock prices. I used a sequence length of just two or three days. The LSTM barely had time to remember anything, thus it could not learn. A DNN using an equivalent lookback of 1 day would probably not be successful either, but using features derived over the past 10 or 20 days might be enough for a DNN to generate a usable forecast. However, an LSTM would have the potential to capture more complex patterns, but only if given a sufficiently long lookback window, while a DNN might be better suited to the feature-engineered case.

**3. Normalization and Preprocessing Issues**

Another critical difference often missed is data normalization. LSTMs, like other neural networks, usually benefit from normalized or standardized input data. If the data is significantly unscaled or has high variance, it can be more difficult for the model to converge. Time series data, in particular, often requires careful scaling to ensure the gradient doesn't explode or vanish during backpropagation. A DNN, although it can also suffer from this, does not have the same issues with long-term dependencies or memory limitations as an LSTM. It may be more resilient to some extent to non-normalised data, especially when working with smaller sequences.

Let’s show an example of data normalization before running an LSTM:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Sample Data (100 timestamps, 2 features with large magnitude difference)
data = np.random.rand(100, 2) * np.array([1, 1000]) # Unscaled data

# scale data between 0 and 1
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# generator with the correct scale
generator_scaled = keras.preprocessing.sequence.TimeseriesGenerator(
    scaled_data, scaled_data, length=10, batch_size=16
)


# generator with unscaled data.
generator_unscaled = keras.preprocessing.sequence.TimeseriesGenerator(
    data, data, length=10, batch_size=16
)

# Sample batch
scaled_x, scaled_y = generator_scaled[0]
print("Scaled input data shape (X): ", scaled_x.shape)
print("Scaled output data shape (Y): ", scaled_y.shape)

# Sample batch
unscaled_x, unscaled_y = generator_unscaled[0]
print("Unscaled input data shape (X): ", unscaled_x.shape)
print("Unscaled output data shape (Y): ", unscaled_y.shape)
```

While the unscaled and scaled data have the same shape, the use of the scaler can drastically improve the performance of the LSTM. In contrast, a DNN might not have the same requirements, thus can still converge.

**In summary:**

The fact that a DNN can train on the data while an LSTM doesn’t usually boils down to:
1.	The **input shape** being misconfigured by the `TimeseriesGenerator` (missing or incorrect sequence length), leading to an incorrect input shape for an LSTM.
2.  An **insufficient sequence length**, which means that the LSTM does not have enough context to capture the temporal dependencies needed for training, while a DNN may not rely on such dependencies.
3.  **Normalization or pre-processing issues**, particularly with unscaled data, where LSTMs are often more sensitive than DNNs.

For deeper understanding, I'd recommend delving into:

*   "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville: The canonical text on deep learning, offering thorough insights into LSTMs and RNNs.
*   "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron: Practical guide with detailed examples and explanations, perfect for getting hands-on with Keras and time series.
*   Research papers on ‘vanishing gradients’ in RNNs, particularly the original LSTM paper by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, that can help you understand the inner workings and requirements of LSTMs.

I hope this clarifies why you might be encountering this issue. Remember to always double-check your input shapes, experiment with sequence lengths, and pay close attention to preprocessing when dealing with time series data and LSTMs. It's always the little details that can make the difference.
