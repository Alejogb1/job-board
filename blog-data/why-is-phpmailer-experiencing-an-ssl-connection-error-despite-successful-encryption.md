Alright, let's unpack this. I've definitely been down this rabbit hole a few times, and it's often more nuanced than a simple SSL configuration issue. You're seeing that PHPMailer *appears* to encrypt the connection successfully, but then throws an error indicating a problem with the SSL connection. It's a frustrating spot to be in, but there are a few common culprits we can investigate.

The key thing to understand is that "successful encryption" in the context of network communication, especially with protocols like SMTP, doesn't only mean the initial handshake went smoothly. It involves a secure channel being established *and maintained* correctly. The error you are seeing typically indicates a disconnect between what PHPMailer expects and what the mail server provides during the lifecycle of the connection, even if the initial TLS handshake was successful.

One frequent issue, which I've personally encountered while deploying email functionalities in complex web applications, arises from certificate verification. Even with encryption in place, PHPMailer needs to trust the certificate presented by the mail server. This is not just about the certificate being valid according to its issuing authority, it's about the whole chain of trust. Sometimes, particularly with self-signed or internally generated certificates, the necessary root and intermediate certificates are not included in PHP's certificate store or are missing from your system. In such situations, the initial encryption can complete, but verification fails afterward, leading to the ssl connection error.

Another, perhaps less obvious, problem is with the *protocol version* negotiated during the TLS handshake. Older servers might support only older versions of TLS, or they may enforce TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1 which are now considered insecure and often disabled by default on the client side. PHPMailer, or more precisely the underlying TLS library used by PHP, might default to a later, stronger version of the protocol. When the server doesn't support it, you get the error even though encryption is enabled. The negotiation appears successful only at the beginning, but fails during session.

Finally, something I stumbled across in a particularly hairy deployment, involves mismatches between host names and the Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) included in the server's SSL certificate. If the hostname used in PHPMailer’s `Host` property does not match the values present in the certificate, you might experience issues. Technically, this is a certificate validation error, but because encryption is *initiated*, it’s easily confused with an SSL connection problem. This kind of error often surfaces on systems using load balancers and multiple mail server configurations.

Let's illustrate these with some code examples, focusing on how to address these specific problems:

**Example 1: Certificate Verification Issues**

Here's a basic setup where we force PHPMailer to disable certificate verification. This is *not* a recommended approach for production but is extremely useful for diagnostics.

```php
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Assuming you have PHPMailer installed via Composer

$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {
    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_SERVER;
    $mail->isSMTP();
    $mail->Host       = 'your.mail.server.com';
    $mail->SMTPAuth   = true;
    $mail->Username   = 'your_username';
    $mail->Password   = 'your_password';
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS;
    $mail->Port       = 587;

    // ONLY FOR TESTING - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
    $mail->SMTPAutoTLS = false;
    $mail->SMTPOptions = array(
        'ssl' => array(
            'verify_peer' => false,
            'verify_peer_name' => false,
            'allow_self_signed' => true
        )
    );
     // Setting this to false is dangerous; only do it for testing.

    $mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Mailer');
    $mail->addAddress('to@example.com', 'Receiver');
    $mail->isHTML(true);
    $mail->Subject = 'Test Email';
    $mail->Body    = 'This is a test email';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Message has been sent';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
?>
```

In this snippet, I’ve set `verify_peer` and `verify_peer_name` to `false`, essentially bypassing certificate validation. If this resolves the issue, you *know* that the problem lies with your certificate setup. The fix, in a production scenario, would involve installing the correct certificate chain in your system or updating your PHP configuration to point to the correct certificate bundle. You may need to consult your system documentation for specifics.

**Example 2: TLS Version Mismatch**

Here's how we can try to force a specific TLS version. Again, this isn't something you’d typically want to hardcode, but it is useful for isolating the problem.

```php
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Assuming you have PHPMailer installed via Composer

$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {
    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_SERVER;
    $mail->isSMTP();
    $mail->Host       = 'your.mail.server.com';
    $mail->SMTPAuth   = true;
    $mail->Username   = 'your_username';
    $mail->Password   = 'your_password';
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS;
    $mail->Port       = 587;

    // Try forcing TLS v1.2, or fallback to TLSv1.1 if it fails.
    $mail->SMTPOptions = array(
        'ssl' => array(
            'crypto_method' =>  STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_2_CLIENT | STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_1_CLIENT
        )
    );
    //Alternatively, try TLS v1.1 only:
    //  $mail->SMTPOptions = array(
    //      'ssl' => array(
    //          'crypto_method' => STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_1_CLIENT
    //      )
    //   );


    $mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Mailer');
    $mail->addAddress('to@example.com', 'Receiver');
    $mail->isHTML(true);
    $mail->Subject = 'Test Email';
    $mail->Body    = 'This is a test email';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Message has been sent';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
?>
```
Here, the `crypto_method` option dictates which TLS protocols will be used during the handshake. If forcing an older version like TLS v1.1 solves the error, you know you must adjust your server configuration or, ideally, upgrade to modern TLS versions on both ends.

**Example 3: Hostname Mismatch**

This example is more conceptual than a direct code change, but it illustrates the point. It’s about ensuring your configuration matches what the server advertises:

```php
<?php
// In your mail sending logic
$mail = new PHPMailer(true);
$mail->Host       = 'mail.example.com'; // make sure this matches exactly
                                       // the common name or Subject Alternative name
                                       // in your mail server certificate.

// Rest of configuration remains the same as earlier
?>
```

Here, the key is to ensure the value of `Host` is exactly the same as what is present in the mail server's certificate. Incorrectly set `Host` values can trigger an apparent SSL connection issue.

For further reading on TLS/SSL, and how certificates work under the hood, I recommend looking at "Bulletproof SSL and TLS" by Ivan Ristić. It’s a deep dive into all things TLS/SSL and can provide a really solid understanding of the mechanisms involved. Furthermore, you might want to consult the official PHP documentation on streams context options and the openssl extension, focusing particularly on the sections detailing peer verification. And finally, for a comprehensive understanding of email protocol details, the "SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol" RFC documents are highly valuable.

In summary, what you are seeing isn't necessarily a problem with encryption failing initially. It's more about how the handshake is maintained, the protocol version agreed upon, and how both ends validate the whole process. It's a layered problem that often requires a detailed investigation. I hope this helps you resolve the error. Let me know if you have more questions.
