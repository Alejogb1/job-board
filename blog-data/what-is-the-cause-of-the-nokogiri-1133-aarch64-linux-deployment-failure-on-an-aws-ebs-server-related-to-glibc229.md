Okay, let’s break down this frustrating nokogiri deployment issue. I've certainly seen my fair share of these kinds of dependency clashes, and the nokogiri gem, specifically, has been the culprit more than once in my experience. This particular error, `nokogiri-1.13.3-aarch64-linux deployment failure on an AWS EBS server related to GLIBC_2.29`, is indicative of a classic mismatch between the compiled binary of the gem and the system libraries available on the target environment.

In essence, `nokogiri-1.13.3-aarch64-linux` is a pre-compiled binary built for a specific architecture (`aarch64`, often ARM64) and, crucially, linked against a particular version of the GNU C Library, or glibc. The `GLIBC_2.29` part tells us that this specific version of nokogiri was compiled expecting glibc version 2.29 or later to be present on the system. If your AWS EBS server, particularly if it's running an older Amazon Linux version or a custom image, doesn't have glibc 2.29 available, then you're going to hit this failure. The dynamic linker can't find the required symbols in the system's glibc, leading to the deployment failure.

This often arises because pre-compiled gems are meant to offer a convenience, skipping local compilation which can be slow, but they do so at the cost of assuming a reasonably up-to-date and consistent runtime environment. This is why containerization, for instance, tries to offer a more predictable and standardized environment, addressing precisely this type of issue.

Now, let’s talk about solutions. We have a few avenues to explore, each with different trade-offs:

**1. Update the Underlying Operating System:**

The most straightforward but sometimes the most invasive is to update the base operating system on your EBS instance to one that includes glibc 2.29 or later. This would involve upgrading to a more recent version of Amazon Linux or the equivalent of your chosen distribution. While this is the “proper” way to resolve the issue, it may require substantial testing to ensure your application remains compatible with the updated OS and system libraries.

**2. Force Local Compilation of the Gem:**

The second approach avoids OS upgrades and is, in my experience, often the preferred fix. We can force bundler to compile the gem locally during deployment rather than trying to use the pre-compiled binary. This is achieved by specifying an instruction in your `Gemfile` or using environment variables during your deployment. Bundler then compiles nokogiri on the EBS instance, dynamically linking it with the specific version of glibc available, thereby avoiding the compatibility issue. This means the build process will take slightly longer but increases portability.

Here’s how you can do it in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'nokogiri', '~> 1.13.3', :platforms => :ruby do
  # This forces compilation even on platforms where a pre-compiled binary might be present
  ENV['NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES'] = 'true' # explicitly use OS libraries, ensuring compatibility
end
```

This `ENV` variable forces the `nokogiri` gem to attempt a build from source, ensuring a proper link against the glibc version of the system. Make sure to install the necessary build tools and headers (like `gcc`, `make`, `zlib-devel`, `libxml2-devel`, and `libxslt-devel`) for the compilation to succeed; these often need to be added via the system package manager.

**3. Dockerization:**

The most robust and arguably the most forward-thinking solution is to migrate to containerization using Docker. With Docker, you control the entire runtime environment, including the precise version of glibc. You build your application inside a container based on an image that guarantees glibc 2.29 (or whatever version you need) is present and all the native gems are built there, during your docker build. This ensures your application will consistently run no matter what version of glibc is on the host system.

Here's an example of a Dockerfile fragment:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile fragment
FROM ruby:3.1-slim # Use a Ruby base image, or customize it.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev
WORKDIR /app
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN bundle install --jobs=4
COPY . .
# ... rest of the dockerfile ...
```

In the Dockerfile excerpt above, we're ensuring that our container has the necessary tools (`build-essential`, `libxml2-dev`, `libxslt1-dev`, `zlib1g-dev`) for compiling gems and a consistent version of glibc. The gems are compiled inside the Docker container during the image build process and are guaranteed to run on that environment.

The advantage of Docker is that it decouples your application from the specific version of libraries available on the EBS server. Your application is run inside its containerized environment, and the host's system libraries become less significant.

**Code Snippet for Environment Variable on CLI:**

For debugging, you can often force the gem to compile locally by running your `bundle install` with an environment variable:

```bash
NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES=true bundle install
```

This command can be especially useful in CI pipelines or during debugging locally and is the equivalent action to the one we set in the Gemfile.

**Recommendation for Further Reading**

For more detailed understanding on related topics, I would highly recommend reading *Operating System Concepts* by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne. This provides a fundamental grasp of operating system concepts, which is invaluable when troubleshooting these types of dependency issues. Additionally, for a deeper dive into dynamic linking and shared libraries, I suggest reviewing the relevant sections of *Linkers and Loaders* by John R. Levine. For Docker and containerization, the official Docker documentation is very comprehensive. Also, specifically for gem dependencies and bundler, I'd look into the bundler documentation. Finally, for a general understanding of build processes and compilers, the gcc documentation is an amazing resource for technical depth.

In conclusion, a `nokogiri-1.13.3-aarch64-linux` failure related to `GLIBC_2.29` boils down to a compiled gem expecting a newer version of the GNU C Library than is present on your server. You have multiple options, from updating the OS, forcing local compilation, to containerization. My advice, based on past experiences, would be to evaluate your long-term goals: if this is a one-time issue, local compilation might be sufficient. However, if you’re building a complex application, it's worth considering containerizing it for improved portability and stability, as it effectively eliminates these kinds of environment dependencies.
