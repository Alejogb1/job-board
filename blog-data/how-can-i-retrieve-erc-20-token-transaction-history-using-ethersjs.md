Okay, let's tackle this one. Been down this road myself plenty of times, often finding that seemingly simple question can quickly lead to quite a rabbit hole. Getting a reliable and complete ERC-20 token transaction history using ethers.js requires a bit of finesse, more so than a simple, singular function call. It's not just about a single query; it's about understanding the underlying data structures and limitations. Here's how I approach it, based on my experiences building various blockchain analytics tools over the past several years.

The core of the issue is that ERC-20 token transfers are not stored as a separate, dedicated transaction type in the blockchain. Instead, they're encoded within the 'logs' emitted by smart contracts, specifically within the 'Transfer' event. We must delve into these logs and parse them correctly to extract the transfer details.

First, we need an ethers.js provider. This gives us access to the blockchain data. Let’s assume we have that already set up and ready to go:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
// Assume provider is initialized elsewhere. example:
// const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('YOUR_RPC_ENDPOINT');
```

Now, the trickiest part begins – assembling the appropriate filter for `provider.getLogs`. We need to tell the provider precisely which events from which contract we're interested in. This involves specifying the contract address and the `Transfer` event signature. Let’s see some code for that:

```javascript
async function fetchTokenTransfers(tokenAddress, provider, fromBlock = 0) {
    const transferEventSignature = ethers.id("Transfer(address,address,uint256)");
    const filter = {
        address: tokenAddress,
        topics: [transferEventSignature],
        fromBlock: fromBlock
    };

    const logs = await provider.getLogs(filter);
    return logs.map(log => {
        const parsedLog = new ethers.Interface([
            "event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)"
        ]).parseLog(log);

        return {
            from: parsedLog.args.from,
            to: parsedLog.args.to,
            value: parsedLog.args.value.toString(), // Convert BigNumber to string for easier handling
            blockNumber: log.blockNumber,
            transactionHash: log.transactionHash,
            logIndex: log.logIndex
        }
    });
}

```

In this snippet, we’re crafting a filter for the `Transfer` event. The `ethers.id("Transfer(address,address,uint256)")` part generates the keccak256 hash of the event signature, which is how the blockchain identifies events. We are also setting a `fromBlock`. If we don't provide it, we fetch all blocks, which may cause performance issues. This function fetches the logs, parses them using an `ethers.Interface` to correctly structure the extracted data (from, to, value, blocknumber, transactionhash, and logindex), and returns an array of these data records. Notice the use of `.toString()` on the `value`; without this, it returns a BigNumber object, which can cause issues if not handled correctly.

One very important consideration is pagination. Blockchains can get enormous, and it’s highly unlikely that a single call to `getLogs` will grab everything if we are requesting data from start of chain. We should use a mechanism to fetch data in manageable chunks using the block numbers. Here’s an example of how to handle that:

```javascript
async function fetchAllTokenTransfers(tokenAddress, provider, batchSize = 5000) {
   let allTransfers = [];
   let currentBlock = 0;
   const latestBlock = await provider.getBlockNumber();

   while(currentBlock <= latestBlock) {
        const toBlock = Math.min(currentBlock + batchSize, latestBlock)
       const transfers = await fetchTokenTransfers(tokenAddress, provider, currentBlock);
       allTransfers = allTransfers.concat(transfers);
       currentBlock = toBlock + 1; //increment to the next block to fetch from
       //you might want to add a delay here to prevent rate limiting
   }
   return allTransfers;
}
```

Here, we introduce `fetchAllTokenTransfers`, which iteratively calls `fetchTokenTransfers`, grabbing logs in batches using a `while` loop. The function gets the latest block, and loops until current block number exceeds it. We use the `batchSize` to process logs in chunks, which is usually required by most providers when making calls to their apis. This method avoids overwhelming the provider and handles large transaction histories efficiently. Keep in mind, that an insufficient batch size might end up taking longer than expected, while too high of a batch size can exceed rate limits with certain providers and might make calls fail, so a bit of tuning is often required.

Finally, consider how to make this process resilient. What if a provider call fails, or there's an unexpected error? We need error handling:

```javascript
async function fetchTokenTransfersWithRetry(tokenAddress, provider, fromBlock = 0, maxRetries = 3) {
    let retries = 0;
    while (retries < maxRetries) {
      try {
        return await fetchTokenTransfers(tokenAddress, provider, fromBlock);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error fetching logs: attempt ${retries + 1}/${maxRetries}. Error:`, error);
        retries++;
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * (retries**2))); //exponential backoff
      }
    }
    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch logs after ${maxRetries} retries for contract: ${tokenAddress}`);
}
```

This updated function incorporates a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle potential transient network issues or rate limiting by the provider. We use a simple `while` loop with `try-catch` to handle errors, and if an error occurs we wait before retry to prevent overloading provider.

Important takeaways from my experience with this kind of task:

* **Provider reliability:** The quality of your provider matters. Infura, Alchemy, or QuickNode are popular, but even these can have issues occasionally. Therefore, the retry mechanism mentioned previously is crucial. You might also want to research using fallback providers.
* **Rate limiting:** Almost every provider has rate limits, and exceeding them can result in failed requests. Be mindful of the number of requests you make and implement appropriate delays/backoff strategies.
* **Block range:** Start from block 0 if you want *all* transfers since the token deployment. For ongoing updates, you should track which blocks you’ve already processed to avoid duplicates. Saving the last processed block number in a database or file is usually how this is achieved.
* **Event parsing:** Be incredibly careful with event signatures, as even small discrepancies can lead to incorrect parsing of the logs. Always double check the ABI and signatures you're using.
* **Performance:** Large token contracts can have millions of transactions, and processing all of them can take significant time. Consider techniques such as database indexing and caching.

For further reading, I highly recommend delving into the Ethereum Yellow Paper for a solid theoretical grounding on the underpinnings of blockchain mechanics and specifically transaction logs. Additionally, the official ethers.js documentation is critical for understanding the nuances of the library. Also, “Mastering Ethereum” by Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood provides a comprehensive understanding of Ethereum architecture and smart contract behavior. These resources should provide you with a more complete perspective for approaching this type of problem, allowing you to adapt and optimize your solution as needed.
