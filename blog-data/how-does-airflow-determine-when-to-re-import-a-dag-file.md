Let's unpack this. I’ve spent a fair amount of time dealing with subtle DAG-refresh issues in Airflow environments, both at scale and with more modest setups. The key thing to understand here is that Airflow’s DAG parsing and re-importing process isn't just some magical black box; it's a carefully orchestrated set of checks and balances designed to maintain both responsiveness and stability. The goal, primarily, is to avoid unnecessary overhead – parsing DAG files is a relatively expensive operation – and also to ensure that when changes *are* made, they're reflected swiftly and correctly.

The fundamental mechanism for determining when to re-import a DAG file revolves around monitoring file modification times. I once worked on a large data pipeline where unexpected changes in the timestamp of a DAG file (due to an overly enthusiastic backup script, I later discovered) repeatedly triggered DAG reloads, leading to resource contention. From that experience, I truly grasped the nuances of this aspect of airflow.

Airflow primarily checks the last modification time (mtime) of DAG files. When the scheduler starts, or when the DAG processor periodically re-scans the DAG directory (dictated by the `dag_dir_list_interval` configuration parameter), it creates a metadata store in the database tracking the mtime of all observed DAG files. It's important to note that this directory scan isn’t just about *new* files; it also compares the current mtime of each already known dag file against the stored mtime. If there's a discrepancy—meaning the file has been modified since the last scan—it triggers a DAG reload for that specific file. This, in turn, initiates the DAG parsing process.

This mechanism isn't just a simple file timestamp comparison, however. It's crucial to also know how Airflow handles scenarios where file changes *aren't* straightforward, or where there are subfolders containing DAG definitions. It uses a recursive scan, meaning that if any file *within* a DAG folder is modified, the entire DAG is reloaded. This is intentional; changes to supporting files, like custom operators, macros, or utility scripts, can also affect DAG behavior.

Now, let's go into code snippets. It is worth emphasizing that directly manipulating Airflow internals via Python is highly discouraged in production environments. These examples are merely to illustrate concepts and help with comprehension.

**Example 1: Illustrating basic file mtime comparison (simulated)**

This Python snippet doesn't directly interact with Airflow but shows the general idea of how file mtimes are compared to trigger a re-parse:

```python
import os
import time

def get_file_mtime(file_path):
    """Gets the file's modification time as an integer"""
    return int(os.path.getmtime(file_path))

def simulate_dag_reload(file_path, last_known_mtime):
    """Simulates a DAG reload based on mtime changes"""
    current_mtime = get_file_mtime(file_path)
    if current_mtime > last_known_mtime:
      print(f"File: {file_path} modified. Triggering DAG reload.")
      return current_mtime
    else:
      print(f"File: {file_path} unchanged.")
      return last_known_mtime

# Create a dummy file for the simulation
with open("example_dag.py", "w") as f:
    f.write("# Example DAG file")

initial_mtime = get_file_mtime("example_dag.py")
print(f"Initial mtime: {initial_mtime}")

# First check - no change
updated_mtime = simulate_dag_reload("example_dag.py", initial_mtime)

# Sleep to allow for a timestamp to change
time.sleep(1)

# Modify the file
with open("example_dag.py", "a") as f:
    f.write("\n# Modified DAG file")

# Second check - detects change
updated_mtime = simulate_dag_reload("example_dag.py", updated_mtime)
```

This demonstrates how a simple change in mtime triggers the simulated "reload". Of course, in Airflow, the "reload" involves parsing the DAG definitions and making them available.

**Example 2: Subfolder Impact (Conceptual)**

This example shows (again, conceptually) how Airflow will re-parse a main DAG even if only a file in a subfolder was modified. It relies on the premise that Airflow will recursively search for Python files.

```python
import os
import time
import shutil

# Create a dummy structure

os.makedirs("example_dag_dir/subfolder", exist_ok=True)
with open("example_dag_dir/my_dag.py", "w") as f:
    f.write("# Main DAG")

with open("example_dag_dir/subfolder/helper.py", "w") as f:
    f.write("# helper function")

def check_dag_dir(dag_dir_path, stored_mtimes):
    updated_mtimes = {}
    reload_required = False
    for root, _, files in os.walk(dag_dir_path):
        for filename in files:
            if filename.endswith(".py"):
                file_path = os.path.join(root,filename)
                mtime = int(os.path.getmtime(file_path))
                if file_path not in stored_mtimes or mtime > stored_mtimes.get(file_path):
                    print(f"File {file_path} was modified or is new. DAG reload required")
                    reload_required = True
                updated_mtimes[file_path] = mtime
    return updated_mtimes,reload_required

stored_mtimes, _ = check_dag_dir("example_dag_dir", {}) # Initial scan
print("Initial scan completed")

time.sleep(1)
# Modify a subfolder file
with open("example_dag_dir/subfolder/helper.py", "a") as f:
    f.write("\n# Subfolder Helper update")

updated_mtimes, reload = check_dag_dir("example_dag_dir", stored_mtimes)

if reload:
    print("DAG refresh required due to change within dag directory")
else:
    print("No changes detected.")


shutil.rmtree("example_dag_dir") # Cleaning up.
```

This illustrates the recursive behavior. Even if the primary `my_dag.py` file isn't changed directly, a modification in the subfolder will flag the need for a DAG reload, since Airflow doesn't have to know about which files are related. Only their mtime is used to identify changes.

**Example 3: File Renaming and Deletion.**

Airflow does not explicitly listen for these events. A rename event is treated as the creation of a new file and the deletion of the old one based on the filename. Since it iterates through a directory, a change in name is like a new entry. A deletion is removed from the tracker.

```python
import os
import time
import shutil

# Create a dummy structure

os.makedirs("example_dag_dir_renames", exist_ok=True)
with open("example_dag_dir_renames/my_dag_original.py", "w") as f:
    f.write("# Main DAG")


def check_dag_dir(dag_dir_path, stored_mtimes):
    updated_mtimes = {}
    reload_required = False
    for root, _, files in os.walk(dag_dir_path):
        for filename in files:
            if filename.endswith(".py"):
                file_path = os.path.join(root,filename)
                mtime = int(os.path.getmtime(file_path))
                if file_path not in stored_mtimes or mtime > stored_mtimes.get(file_path):
                    print(f"File {file_path} was modified or is new. DAG reload required")
                    reload_required = True
                updated_mtimes[file_path] = mtime
    return updated_mtimes, reload_required

stored_mtimes, _ = check_dag_dir("example_dag_dir_renames", {}) # Initial scan
print("Initial scan completed")


# Rename the file
os.rename("example_dag_dir_renames/my_dag_original.py", "example_dag_dir_renames/my_dag_renamed.py")

updated_mtimes, reload = check_dag_dir("example_dag_dir_renames", stored_mtimes)

if reload:
    print("DAG refresh required due to change within dag directory (rename)")
else:
    print("No changes detected.")

shutil.rmtree("example_dag_dir_renames") # Cleaning up.
```

The above example will show a rename is identified as a change and will re-parse. Note that it is not looking for renames specifically but identifies the change in entries within the directory. This is a key point in how airflow identifies changes.

For deeper understanding, I recommend looking into the Apache Airflow documentation, specifically the sections related to the scheduler and DAG loading. In addition, the book “Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow” by Bas Geerdink is a great resource that goes into the details of internal processes.  The source code itself, found in the airflow repository, particularly in the `airflow/dag_processing/manager.py` and `airflow/dag_processing/processor.py` modules, would be an authoritative place to observe these mechanisms directly. These areas will give a great deal of insight into this process.
