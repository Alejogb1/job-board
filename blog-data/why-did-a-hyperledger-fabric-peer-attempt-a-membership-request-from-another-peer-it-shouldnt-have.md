Alright, let's tackle this. I've seen this scenario play out more times than I care to remember, and it's almost always a subtle interplay of configuration nuances and network state complexities within Hyperledger Fabric. To answer why a peer might attempt a membership request from another peer it shouldn't, we have to dig into several potential causes, each rooted in the distributed nature of the platform and its reliance on a robust membership service.

My experience, particularly during a large-scale deployment for a supply chain network a few years back, taught me that these seemingly inexplicable peer interactions often boil down to issues with the gossip protocol, misconfigured channel definitions, or, more rarely, certificate expiration or misconfiguration. It's never just one thing, usually a cascade. Let's break it down into common culprits.

Firstly, and perhaps the most frequent source of this issue, is the *gossip protocol*. Fabric peers use gossip to discover other peers in their organization and maintain an updated view of channel membership. This protocol relies on a system of communication that, when not properly configured, can lead to peers attempting to connect or 're-connect' to peers that are not part of their channels or organizations. Imagine, for a moment, a peer experiencing network instability. It loses connectivity to its expected peers. When it recovers, if its gossip configuration isn't carefully tuned, it might attempt to reach out to any peer it previously knew of, even if that peer has moved on or is in an entirely different organizational context. This isn’t a security flaw, rather it is the protocol doing its best to recover the cluster state; the problem then lies in an incorrect setup causing this behavior.

Secondly, the channel configuration itself is critical. Specifically, the `channel.config` block, which dictates who can participate in which channels, might not be aligned with the perceived reality of each peer. Consider a scenario where a peer is incorrectly associated with a channel within the channel's configuration, even if it is intended to be part of another channel or no channel at all. In such a case, it will naturally attempt to initiate a membership process with any peer within that incorrect channel’s membership list, even if it's an inappropriate target. Furthermore, the anchor peer definition within the channel can often cause issues, with improperly specified anchor peers leading to incorrect connections.

A less common but equally critical aspect involves certificate handling and expiration. Each peer uses cryptographic certificates to establish its identity and secure communication. If a peer's certificate is expired or if the root ca used to generate these certificates is not recognized, this can cause a peer to attempt to re-authenticate against a peer it should not. This process usually involves an authentication handshake, which, if failed, would be logged as a membership related event. It's crucial to ensure all certificates are valid, properly deployed, and regularly renewed as per the organization's policy.

Finally, we have to acknowledge the possibility of incorrect application code or smart contract implementation that uses peer identities, which can lead to similar authentication-related errors, though these would rarely involve explicit membership requests. A badly implemented smart contract interacting with the membership service could lead to calls that look similar to membership attempts from the network level, even though that's not their underlying intent.

To concretely illustrate these concepts, let's look at a few simplified scenarios and the potential code snippets that might help to uncover the issues:

**Scenario 1: Gossip Protocol Issues**

Suppose we have two organizations: `Org1` and `Org2`, and each has a peer (say, `peer0.org1` and `peer0.org2`). Imagine that initially `peer0.org1` was incorrectly included in gossip anchors of `Org2`. This would prompt a connection from `peer0.org1` to `peer0.org2` which would normally be unexpected.

```yaml
# Example excerpt from the core.yaml file of peer0.org1
peer:
  gossip:
    bootstrap: peer0.org2:7051 # Incorrectly including a peer from another org
    useLeaderElection: true
    orgLeader: false
```
The above configuration would actively direct `peer0.org1` to contact `peer0.org2` even if there is no channel in which they are both members. To debug this, we can check the network configuration, primarily the `core.yaml` configurations of each peer as shown above, and the network logs, which usually give detailed insights on the handshake or connections attempted by a specific peer.

**Scenario 2: Channel Configuration Mismatch**

Consider the channel `mychannel`. We can check the channel configuration block using the `configtxlator` tool, specifically:
```bash
# Retrieve the channel config
peer channel fetch config config.pb -c mychannel --orderer orderer.example.com:7050 --tls --cafile orderer-ca.crt
# Decode the config
configtxlator proto_decode --input config.pb --type common.Config > config.json
```

Then in the generated `config.json` file we would look at the `groups` and `values` sections, to identify the members.
```json
{
    "channel_group":{
        "groups":{
            "Application":{
                "groups":{
                    "Org1MSP":{
                        "values":{
                            "MSP": {
                                "value": {
                                    "config":{
                                        "admins":[],
                                        "root_certs":[],
                                        "intermediate_certs":[],
                                        "organizational_unit_identifiers":[],
                                        "tls_root_certs":[],
                                        "tls_intermediate_certs":[]
                                        }
                                    }
                            }
                        }
                    },
                     "Org2MSP":{
                        "values":{
                            "MSP": {
                                "value": {
                                    "config":{
                                        "admins":[],
                                        "root_certs":[],
                                        "intermediate_certs":[],
                                        "organizational_unit_identifiers":[],
                                        "tls_root_certs":[],
                                        "tls_intermediate_certs":[]
                                        }
                                    }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If a peer is included within the MSP of another organization than its own, it would attempt to connect to other members of the organization through the channel's gossip mechanism. In a similar fashion, if the anchor peers are incorrect then similar issues would arise.

**Scenario 3: Certificate Issues**

When a peer’s certificate is expired or not properly recognized it will often result in errors related to authentication. We often would see a message such as this in the peer logs: `Authentication failed: certificate chain verification failed` This usually requires inspection of the `msp` folder within the peer configuration, the output of `openssl x509 -in <cert_path> -text` to check the expiration date, and also checking if the chain of certificates is correctly configured from the root CA downwards.

```bash
# Example OpenSSL command to inspect certificate expiration
openssl x509 -in peer.crt -text -noout
```
This command will show details about a specific certificate, including its valid start and end dates, allowing us to quickly identify potential issues stemming from certificate expiration.

Troubleshooting these kinds of problems isn’t straightforward but it is essential to have access to thorough and detailed logs of each peer which would allow for pinpointing the issues. Further investigation should include reviewing the Fabric documentation, as well as exploring some of the insightful research papers such as those detailing the specifics of the gossip protocol or the membership service, and the official Hyperledger Fabric documentation itself. For example, the Fabric documentation contains several excellent sections detailing peer communication patterns, configuration specifics and also the operational aspects of certificate management, all of which are indispensable for resolving issues like these.

In summary, when a Hyperledger Fabric peer attempts a membership request from a peer it shouldn't, the root cause is typically a nuanced interplay of configuration issues, particularly those related to the gossip protocol, channel definitions, certificate handling or a combination thereof. By methodically examining these aspects, leveraging the tools available, and maintaining a solid understanding of Fabric’s underlying mechanisms, we can effectively debug these types of challenges.
