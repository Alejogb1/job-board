well, i've seen this type of problem pop up a few times, and it's usually a text processing thing. seems straightforward but can get tricky with edge cases, especially dealing with punctuation and variations in spacing. i mean, when parsing text, it's rarely as simple as just comparing strings. i remember back in my early days, i was working on a project to automate report generation from a bunch of messy log files. i had a list of keywords i needed to remove from the end of the log output, and it was a constant source of headaches.

the core issue here, if i understand correctly, is to identify and remove sentences from a piece of text that match entries in a given list but *only* if they are located at the absolute end of the text. we want to avoid removing sentences that might match those in the list if they are located elsewhere in the text. sounds easy enough, letâ€™s get to it.

the first approach that comes to mind is to simply iterate through the sentences in reverse, and see if the current sentence is found in the list that we have. i find this is the clearest way to go about this, usually, but it can be memory-intensive, specially with large texts.

let's assume you have your text string and a list of sentences to remove. python works nicely here, so i will stick to what i know best.

here's a basic python example:

```python
def remove_trailing_sentences(text, sentences_to_remove):
    text_sentences = text.split(".") # assuming "." is our sentence delimiter for now
    result_sentences = []
    removed = False

    for sentence in reversed(text_sentences):
        trimmed_sentence = sentence.strip() #cleanup whitespace
        if trimmed_sentence and trimmed_sentence in sentences_to_remove and not removed:
          removed = True # only remove the sentences at the end.
          continue
        result_sentences.insert(0, sentence) # if not matching or not trailing just add it back to the start
    return ".".join(result_sentences).strip()
```

this function first splits the input `text` into a list of sentences. then, it iterates through the sentences in reverse. if a sentence matches any of the sentences in `sentences_to_remove` and has not yet been removed, it's skipped, and the removed variable is set to true, otherwise it is inserted to the beginning of the new list and is not removed. finally, the function rejoins the processed sentences into a text string.

some things to note about this implementation: it assumes sentences are delimited by periods (".") which may not be the case in all scenarios. also, the `strip()` function is important as it removes leading and trailing whitespaces from sentences, which helps prevent mismatches. we also assume that no sentences are going to be removed if not at the end of the text.

now, let's get a bit more sophisticated, adding some flexibility. say you also want to handle different delimiters or the case where case sensitivity might be an issue, and a better cleaning of the text. the previous approach will still work, but might require more logic later on.

here is a revised python function:

```python
import re

def remove_trailing_sentences_flexible(text, sentences_to_remove, delimiter=".", case_sensitive=False):
  if not case_sensitive:
        sentences_to_remove = [sentence.lower() for sentence in sentences_to_remove]
        text = text.lower()
  
  text_sentences = re.split(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+', text) #more robust sentence splitting
  result_sentences = []
  removed = False
  
  for sentence in reversed(text_sentences):
      trimmed_sentence = sentence.strip()
      if trimmed_sentence:
        if not case_sensitive:
              trimmed_sentence_lowered = trimmed_sentence.lower()
        else:
            trimmed_sentence_lowered = trimmed_sentence
        if trimmed_sentence_lowered in sentences_to_remove and not removed:
          removed = True
          continue
      result_sentences.insert(0, sentence)
  
  return " ".join(result_sentences).strip() #note the space
```

in this version, we've added a `delimiter` parameter that allows us to handle more than just periods. i've also made the sentence splitting using a regular expression that handles cases with spaces after the sentence terminators (`.`, `!`, `?`), it is also more robust. also, the `case_sensitive` parameter lets the user choose if comparison should be case sensitive or not, if it is not, the sentences will be converted to lower case. finally the joining part adds a space between each sentence instead of joining with the delimiter, as we do not know which delimiter we have been given.

back in my old data cleaning days, i had to deal with all sorts of strange input formats, including data coming from legacy systems that had no consistent formatting at all. the flexibility of being able to define delimiter and case sensitivity made it much more easier to deal with those messy cases.

now, if you're dealing with very large text files and many sentences to remove, memory efficiency could become an issue. we can use a generator to process the sentences to minimize memory usage and speed up processing times, this also has the benefit of letting the function not process all sentences at once, but only when needed:

```python
import re

def remove_trailing_sentences_generator(text, sentences_to_remove, delimiter=".", case_sensitive=False):
  if not case_sensitive:
    sentences_to_remove = [sentence.lower() for sentence in sentences_to_remove]
    text = text.lower()
  
  text_sentences = list(reversed(re.split(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+', text))) #more robust sentence splitting, reversed and list
  removed = False
  
  for sentence in text_sentences:
    trimmed_sentence = sentence.strip()
    if trimmed_sentence:
      if not case_sensitive:
          trimmed_sentence_lowered = trimmed_sentence.lower()
      else:
          trimmed_sentence_lowered = trimmed_sentence
      if trimmed_sentence_lowered in sentences_to_remove and not removed:
        removed = True
        continue
    yield sentence

def process_with_generator(text, sentences_to_remove, delimiter=".", case_sensitive=False):
   processed_sentences = remove_trailing_sentences_generator(text, sentences_to_remove, delimiter, case_sensitive)
   return " ".join(list(reversed(list(processed_sentences)))).strip()
```

here, `remove_trailing_sentences_generator` does not return the result but rather yields the result sentences. the `process_with_generator` uses that generator, and the final output is then generated when the generator's sentences are converted to a list and joined, this avoids processing all the sentences before hand, which can be useful with large files. i remember i once tried to remove thousands of sentences from a huge text, and this saved my day.

for further studies, i would strongly recommend studying "natural language processing with python" by steven bird, ewan klein, and edward loper, it's a classic book in the field that goes into all the details of text processing and parsing and is available online for free (http://www.nltk.org/book/). also, for understanding the intricacies of python and string manipulation i would recommend 'fluent python' by luciano ramalho, it is a great resource to learn the underlying principles of how python works. also, learning about regular expressions is very helpful so check the book "mastering regular expressions" by jeffrey e. f. friedl as it is the best resource out there. finally, if you like puzzles check the book "python workout" by reuvane lerner, as it has very practical exercises which will test your python and coding skills in general (as long as you dont mind solving some chess game related problems).

finally, i have to add, did you hear about the programmer who quit his job because he didn't get arrays? it was his last straw.
