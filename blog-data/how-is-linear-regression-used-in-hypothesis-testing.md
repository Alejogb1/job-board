Linear regression, often perceived primarily as a predictive modeling tool, forms a robust basis for conducting several types of hypothesis tests, particularly when examining relationships between variables. The core idea rests on assessing the statistical significance of the estimated regression coefficients. Specifically, if a predictor variable has a statistically significant coefficient, we can reject the null hypothesis that it has no effect on the response variable, thereby establishing evidence of a relationship. The analysis relies on assumptions about the data and uses statistical measures to quantify these relationships.

To clarify how this works, consider a scenario where I've been working on predicting product sales based on advertising spend. A simple linear model can be described as:

```
Sales = β₀ + β₁ * Advertising + ε
```

Here, β₀ is the intercept, β₁ is the coefficient representing the effect of advertising on sales, and ε represents the error term. Hypothesis testing in this context involves evaluating whether β₁ is significantly different from zero. The null hypothesis (H₀) is typically: β₁ = 0 (advertising has no effect). The alternative hypothesis (H₁) would then be β₁ ≠ 0 (advertising has some effect). We assess this using the t-statistic derived from the estimated coefficient and its standard error. A sufficiently large t-statistic, corresponding to a low p-value, would lead us to reject the null hypothesis, concluding there is a statistically significant relationship between advertising expenditure and product sales.

Let's look at a slightly more complex case using multiple regression. Suppose I was also tracking competitor advertising and wanted to examine its impact on our sales, considering our own advertising. Now the model would be:

```
Sales = β₀ + β₁ * OurAdvertising + β₂ * CompetitorAdvertising + ε
```

In this scenario, we can perform several tests. First, we can evaluate each coefficient individually. We can test if β₁=0 (our advertising has no effect) or β₂=0 (competitor advertising has no effect). Furthermore, we can conduct an F-test to see if either or both advertising variables jointly contribute to the model's predictive power. If the F-statistic is significant, it suggests that at least one of these advertising variables is useful in predicting sales. The F-test compares a model containing our advertising and competitor advertising to a model with just the intercept.

Finally, let’s discuss interaction terms. If I suspected that the effect of my advertising depends on the amount of competitor advertising, I would include an interaction term in my model:

```
Sales = β₀ + β₁ * OurAdvertising + β₂ * CompetitorAdvertising + β₃ * (OurAdvertising * CompetitorAdvertising) + ε
```

Now, β₃ represents the interaction effect. The hypothesis test would involve testing if β₃ is significantly different from zero. A significant β₃ suggests that the relationship between my advertising and sales changes depending on the level of competitor's advertising, rather than simply both having independent and constant effects.

These examples reveal how, beyond prediction, linear regression facilitates rigorous statistical testing through the analysis of its coefficients. The core idea remains: we formulate hypotheses about the relationships between variables, then assess statistical significance based on the properties of the estimated model.

**Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression for Sales and Advertising**

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

# Sample Data
data = {'Advertising': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
        'Sales': [25, 45, 60, 80, 95]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Add constant for intercept
X = sm.add_constant(df['Advertising'])
y = df['Sales']

# Fit the model
model = sm.OLS(y, X)
results = model.fit()

# Print summary with hypothesis test results
print(results.summary())
```
*Commentary:* This code utilizes `statsmodels` to build and fit an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression model. The `sm.add_constant` adds the necessary intercept term to the design matrix. The `results.summary()` then provides detailed statistical output, including the t-statistic and p-values for both the intercept and the 'Advertising' coefficient. The p-value for the advertising coefficient allows us to directly test the null hypothesis that advertising has no impact on sales.

**Example 2: Multiple Regression with Two Predictors**
```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

# Sample Data with two predictors
data = {'OurAdvertising': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
        'CompetitorAdvertising': [15, 25, 20, 35, 40],
        'Sales': [25, 45, 55, 70, 85]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define predictors and response variable
X = df[['OurAdvertising', 'CompetitorAdvertising']]
y = df['Sales']
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Fit the model
model = sm.OLS(y, X)
results = model.fit()

# Print summary including overall F-test
print(results.summary())
```
*Commentary:* Here, the code expands on the previous example by using two predictor variables. The F-test result in the summary measures the joint significance of the advertising variables in predicting sales. A significant F-statistic suggests that at least one of the predictors has a significant impact on the response variable. The code also demonstrates the individual t-tests for each coefficient.

**Example 3: Linear Regression with an Interaction Term**

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample Data
data = {'OurAdvertising': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
        'CompetitorAdvertising': [15, 25, 20, 35, 40],
        'Sales': [30, 60, 50, 90, 95]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define variables and interaction term
df['Interaction'] = df['OurAdvertising'] * df['CompetitorAdvertising']
X = df[['OurAdvertising', 'CompetitorAdvertising', 'Interaction']]
y = df['Sales']
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Fit the model
model = sm.OLS(y, X)
results = model.fit()

# Print results including the interaction
print(results.summary())
```
*Commentary:* This example demonstrates incorporating an interaction effect between 'OurAdvertising' and 'CompetitorAdvertising'. We explicitly calculate the interaction term and include it as a separate predictor variable in the linear model. The t-test p-value for this new 'Interaction' coefficient tests if the relationship between our advertising and sales changes based on the competitor's advertising spend. This allows us to examine more complex relationships.

**Conclusion:**

Simple linear regression is ideal when examining a direct relationship between one predictor and one outcome variable, offering simplicity and speed, but at the cost of limited analysis possibilities. Multiple regression is well-suited when multiple independent variables may affect the outcome, allowing for nuanced analysis. Finally, incorporating interaction terms offers a method to discover when the effect of one variable is contingent on the value of another, though interpretation demands care and sufficient data is necessary to avoid overfitting. Therefore, the appropriate choice depends on the complexity of the relationships between variables under study. If a single predictor is sufficient for a hypothesis, a simple linear regression is adequate. However, when there are multiple or interactive effects, a multiple regression with interaction terms may provide a more robust and informative analysis.
