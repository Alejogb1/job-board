,  I remember back in my days of heavily optimizing constraint programming models, we encountered this exact issue: inexplicably slow solve times when including `show` statements in MiniZinc. It's a question that's less about fundamental constraint satisfaction and more about the inner workings of the MiniZinc compiler and its interface with the underlying solvers. Let me break down why this happens, from a perspective built on a fair bit of practical experience.

The core issue stems from how MiniZinc handles `show` statements. At its heart, MiniZinc is a *modeling* language, not an execution language. When you declare variables, constraints, and goals, you are creating a representation of your problem. The `show` statement, however, demands a specific *runtime* action: the output of variable values. This seems simple on the surface, but that's not how constraint solvers typically operate internally.

Constraint solvers focus almost entirely on finding a solution that satisfies the constraints. They are optimized for this. Adding `show` changes the playing field. When the MiniZinc compiler encounters a `show` statement, it generates code that requires the solver to not just *find* a solution, but also to *report* on the intermediate values of the variables throughout the search process. This is a key distinction: the solver's primary goal is still to find solutions, but now it also has to keep a record of relevant variable values to prepare for the `show` statement.

The implications are that the constraint solving engine now has additional work. It needs to store variable assignments at various points in the search, so it can actually print them out later. This usually involves creating more overhead than if the solver was just trying to solve. This overhead can have a significant impact on performance, especially on large models with long solution times, because the underlying search process, which can be quite involved already, now needs to perform this extra book keeping at each decision node. The impact can be dramatic with frequent or complicated shows.

To be more precise, think of it from a computational perspective. The solver's algorithm is typically based on backtracking search or some variant of it. Usually, when a solver finds a variable assignment which does not lead to a solution, it discards the information it held on that partial assignment. When a show is introduced, that information can't be discarded so readily since it might need to be printed. The implication is that the memory and data access patterns during search become less optimized for search, and become more optimized for information retrieval.

Let's illustrate this with a couple of basic MiniZinc models. First, a simple example without the `show` statement:

```minizinc
int: n = 10;
array[1..n] of var 1..n: x;

constraint alldifferent(x);

solve satisfy;
output ["x = ", show(x)];
```
This model just needs to find an assignment of values to x that satisfy the all-different constraint. Notice the output statement happens only *after* a solution is found. Now, let's consider the case of a show *within the solve block*:

```minizinc
int: n = 10;
array[1..n] of var 1..n: x;

constraint alldifferent(x);

solve satisfy;
output ["x = ", show(x)];
```

While this output doesn't actually show anything during the solving process, internally a record of the values are being kept. The extra data storage and manipulation can still impact the time taken to find the answer even if nothing is being shown.

A much more impactful example is when using a `show` statement *inside* a `forall` constraint:
```minizinc
int: n = 10;
array[1..n] of var 1..n: x;

constraint alldifferent(x);
constraint forall(i in 1..n-1)(show("x[",i,"]=", x[i]) /\ x[i] < x[i+1]);

solve satisfy;
output ["x = ", show(x)];
```
This model is not very common, but it demonstrates a very important point. In this instance, we are showing the value of x at every iteration of the constraint loop. In essence, the solver must keep track of these values to present them in the output. This can slow down solving tremendously due to the extra processing. Furthermore, the solver might actually change how it tries to find the solution in the first place because it has the extra constraints from outputting values to deal with.

These examples highlight a critical point: *where* you place `show` statements matters. Even if the `show` statement doesn't result in extensive output being printed, the extra overhead on the solver to track intermediate variable values still impacts performance. The more complex and granular the `show` statements are, particularly within a constraint, the more the slowdown will become. The solver’s internal mechanisms, which are finely tuned to efficiently solve constraints, are now having to deal with extra data and bookkeeping.

The solution, then, is to avoid using `show` statements within the solving process, unless you *absolutely* need to debug a specific aspect of the search. It's more efficient to allow the solver to focus on its primary purpose—finding a solution—and only then print the results after a complete solution is reached.

For anyone looking to deepen their understanding of constraint programming principles and solver implementation details, I would highly recommend the book "Handbook of Constraint Programming" edited by Francesca Rossi, Peter van Beek, and Toby Walsh. This is a comprehensive resource covering fundamental concepts and techniques, and will provide a solid foundation in understanding why certain behaviors occur with these models and implementations. I would also recommend exploring the MiniZinc tutorial directly from their website which discusses best practices. Another important book is "Principles of Constraint Programming" by Krzysztof R. Apt.

In summary, the performance hit from `show` statements isn’t a bug, but a consequence of the necessary extra work required by the solver to output variable values at different search states. While `show` can be invaluable for debugging, it's essential to use it judiciously to avoid compromising the performance of your MiniZinc models. Keep the focus on letting the solver do its primary job: solving your constraints as efficiently as possible.
