Alright, let's talk multi-output convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PyTorch, specifically when you're juggling a custom train/test dictionary. It's a scenario I've encountered more than a few times, and believe me, the devil is often in the details when moving beyond basic tutorials. I remember one project involving multi-modal medical imaging, where I had to predict multiple disease markers from a single scan. The data wasn't structured in your typical folder-based image layout, leading to a similar setup. It was a learning experience, to say the least, and it prompted the necessity for a manually constructed dataset representation and associated training structure.

The core challenge with your request revolves around properly feeding diverse output labels to your model and handling them effectively during backpropagation. The standard PyTorch image datasets, like `ImageFolder`, are great for one-to-one mapping. But you have a dictionary, which is much more flexible, yet requires a bit more scaffolding.

Let’s dissect this. The key elements I've found crucial for this implementation are: data loading customization, careful model output handling, and loss function application. We need to build a custom PyTorch dataset class that understands your dictionary structure, and also ensure our model architecture is designed to produce outputs matching the structure within this custom dataset. Finally, we ensure loss computation matches each output of the model with associated targets from your dictionary.

Let's start with the data loading portion, which is the foundation. You'll need to create a class inheriting from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. This allows PyTorch’s dataloader to manage your data loading efficiently.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from PIL import Image
import os

class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data_dict, transform=None):
        self.data_dict = data_dict
        self.keys = list(data_dict.keys())
        self.transform = transform

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.keys)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        key = self.keys[idx]
        image_path = self.data_dict[key]['image_path']
        labels = self.data_dict[key]['labels']

        image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB')
        if self.transform:
            image = self.transform(image)

        labels_tensor = torch.tensor(labels, dtype=torch.float)

        return image, labels_tensor
```

In this `CustomDataset` class, `data_dict` is your manually created dictionary, where each key corresponds to a sample and holds `image_path` and its respective target `labels`. The `__getitem__` method opens an image, applies transformations (if provided), converts both the image to a PyTorch tensor, and the labels to a tensor of the type `torch.float` to ensure compatibility with most common loss functions like `nn.MSELoss` or `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`. The `__len__` method indicates the total length of samples within the dataset. This encapsulates our custom data loader behavior.

Now, let's move to the CNN model itself. For simplicity, I'll use a basic CNN, but the core principle remains the same – adjust your output layers based on the number of labels you need to predict. Let’s assume for this example you wish to have 3 different outputs.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class MultiOutputCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_outputs):
        super(MultiOutputCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 56 * 56, 128)  # Adjust based on your image size
        self.output_layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(128, 1) for _ in range(num_outputs)]) # Dynamic Output Layers


    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(F.max_pool2d(self.conv1(x), 2))
        x = F.relu(F.max_pool2d(self.conv2(x), 2))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        outputs = [layer(x) for layer in self.output_layers]
        return outputs
```

Here, the `MultiOutputCNN` class contains convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer, similar to many basic CNN architectures. The key is the `nn.ModuleList` called `output_layers`. Each element within this list is a separate linear layer which we use to generate independent outputs. `num_outputs` parameter determines the number of these layers, directly aligning with the number of label targets within your dictionary. The `forward` function calculates independent output using all the linear layers within the `output_layers` `nn.ModuleList`. This setup decouples output prediction allowing for more complex target mapping. Keep in mind this assumes an image size that, after the convolutional and pooling layers, ends up with a tensor of `32 * 56 * 56` elements, you may need to change this based on your input sizes, for example by adding more convolution and pooling layers or changing the size of the initial fully connected layer.

Finally, how do we make all this work during the training phase? A key aspect is the loss function, which needs to be computed for each output individually and summed.

```python
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn as nn

def train_model(model, train_loader, optimizer, criterion, num_epochs, device):
    model.train()
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for images, labels in train_loader:
            images, labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(images)
            loss = 0
            for i, output in enumerate(outputs):
               loss += criterion(output.squeeze(), labels[:, i])
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
        print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')
```
This training function receives the model, the train dataloader, the optimizier, the loss function, number of training epochs, and the target device for training. It iterates over the training dataloader, and performs a standard backpropagation loop. The essential piece here is the loss computation. We iterate through each output layer generated in `model(images)` and calculate loss on it by comparing it to the corresponding column within the labels. Then the accumulated loss is used for backpropagation.

In summary, the process involves building a custom dataset, designing a model with multiple output layers (the exact nature of these layers depends on your target task - classification vs regression), then defining your loss criterion.

For those interested in delving deeper, I'd strongly recommend checking out *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville for a solid theoretical grounding. Also, for PyTorch specifics, I'd suggest going through the official PyTorch tutorials, particularly those on creating custom datasets. Look into research papers dealing with multi-output learning, specifically papers that address various approaches to multi-task learning. These resources should provide a very good foundation.

The key takeaway here is that while PyTorch provides many conveniences, understanding how to adapt its fundamental structures to your needs—like using custom datasets with variable outputs—is crucial. The examples presented here are a starting point; adapt them to your precise specifications and target task.
