Alright, let's dive in. I remember back when I was developing a large-scale data aggregation service; we faced some fairly intricate challenges with managing concurrent api requests using node.js. The sheer volume of data sources we were tapping into made synchronous operations utterly impractical. What I learned then, and continue to use now, centers around leveraging asynchronous control flow mechanisms effectively. The core issue, as you’re experiencing, is how to make multiple api calls without creating bottlenecks and how to consolidate the results into a usable format. Node.js, being fundamentally single-threaded, requires an asynchronous approach to prevent the event loop from getting blocked.

The primary mechanism for this in node.js is through the use of asynchronous functions, `promises`, and the `async/await` syntax. Fundamentally, an asynchronous operation like making an http request does not execute sequentially. It’s initiated, and then the program continues without waiting for it to finish. The result, when it does become available, triggers a callback or resolves a promise. It’s crucial to understand that this process is non-blocking, which is what allows node.js to handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently. Now, onto the practical bit.

Let's first consider a scenario where we are using a library like `axios` to perform our api requests. We might start with a basic function that wraps an api call:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function fetchUserData(userId) {
    try {
        const response = await axios.get(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
        return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`error fetching user data for ${userId}:`, error);
        return null;
    }
}
```

In this example, `async` signifies that the function will return a promise. The `await` keyword pauses execution until the `axios.get()` promise resolves (successfully returning the data) or rejects (throwing an error). Notice the try/catch block; this is essential for handling potential errors during the api call gracefully. If something goes wrong, we log the error and return `null`, ensuring our program doesn't crash.

But what if we need to fetch data for several users simultaneously? Executing these functions sequentially would still be slow. This is where `promise.all` or `promise.allsettled` become essential. `promise.all` accepts an iterable of promises and returns a new promise that resolves when all input promises have resolved, or it rejects immediately if any one of the promises rejects. On the other hand, `promise.allsettled` waits for all promises to settle (either resolved or rejected) and provides the results of all the promises, including those that rejected.

Here’s how we can use `promise.all` to concurrently fetch user data:

```javascript
async function fetchMultipleUsersData(userIds) {
    const promises = userIds.map(userId => fetchUserData(userId));
    try {
        const results = await Promise.all(promises);
        return results.filter(result => result !== null); // filter out null results
    } catch (error) {
       console.error('error fetching multiple users', error);
       return []; // return an empty array on error
    }
}

// usage example
async function main(){
  const userIds = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const userDatas = await fetchMultipleUsersData(userIds);
  console.log("Fetched User Data:", userDatas);
}
main();
```

In this updated example, `userIds.map` creates an array of promises, one for each user id, each calling the `fetchUserData` function. Then, `Promise.all` waits for all these promises to resolve. The resolved value from each promise becomes part of the `results` array. The function then filters out any null results (which indicate a failed api call for that particular user) before returning the clean array of user data.

If you'd prefer to always know the status of each request, use `Promise.allSettled`:

```javascript
async function fetchMultipleUsersDataAllSettled(userIds) {
    const promises = userIds.map(userId => fetchUserData(userId));
    const results = await Promise.allSettled(promises);

    const resolvedData = results
            .filter(result => result.status === 'fulfilled')
            .map(result => result.value);

    const rejectedErrors = results
            .filter(result => result.status === 'rejected')
            .map(result => result.reason);

    console.log("Failed Requests:", rejectedErrors);

    return resolvedData; // return only resolved results
}
//usage example:
async function mainAll(){
  const userIds = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const userDatas = await fetchMultipleUsersDataAllSettled(userIds);
  console.log("Fetched User Data:", userDatas);
}
mainAll();
```

Here, instead of possibly halting on one failed promise, `Promise.allSettled` gives you an array of objects indicating the status and value for each promise. This is excellent for logging errors or performing specific error-handling logic for individual api requests. This example filters out the successful requests and the reason for the failed requests.

A few key considerations for real-world application:

*   **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of the api you’re interacting with. Many public or private apis have rate limits that can penalize you if you send too many requests too quickly. Implement rate limiting and/or exponential backoff strategies to avoid being blocked. Libraries like `bottleneck` can assist with this.

*   **Error Handling:** Always wrap your asynchronous operations within try/catch blocks. Make sure to handle errors properly rather than silently failing. Logs can be invaluable for diagnosing issues when working with asynchronous code.

*   **Efficient Data Processing:** The manner in which you process the results of your asynchronous calls matters. Avoid unnecessary operations that can affect performance.

*   **Context Management:** When making multiple requests in parallel it is important to have a way to correlate requests with responses. Each request should have a unique identifier or be tagged in a way to track it through the process. If multiple user id's are being fetched, make sure to correlate the fetched data back to the original user id.

To further deepen your understanding, I strongly recommend exploring the following resources. For a robust grasp of asynchronous JavaScript, read 'You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance' by Kyle Simpson. This book provides a solid, in-depth explanation of how asynchronous JavaScript works. For a good understanding of API best practices and error handling, study 'Building Microservices' by Sam Newman, even if you are not building Microservices. It contains general principles of designing effective APIs. Also, if your api's are getting more complex I highly recommend 'Domain-Driven Design' by Eric Evans to organize your backend implementation.

In summary, handling asynchronous api calls in Node.js is about leveraging asynchronous patterns effectively. Using `async/await`, `promise.all` or `promise.allSettled`, and appropriate error handling, you can create scalable and robust applications that handle many concurrent requests smoothly. It might seem like a hurdle at first, but with practice, it will become second nature.
