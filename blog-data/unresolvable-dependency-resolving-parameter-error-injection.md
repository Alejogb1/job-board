Okay so you've got an unresolvable dependency error with parameter injection hmm been there done that got the t-shirt Let me tell you this problem is like the common cold of software engineering it's annoying it's pervasive and it always seems to hit at the worst possible time

Alright lets break it down parameter injection specifically when it fails like this usually points to a few common culprits I've wrestled with this beast more times than I care to admit so I'm gonna lay out what I know and what worked for me in the past

First thing first is the container actually configured correctly you say you are using dependency injection so I am assuming that your container is set up with the services it needs and that it knows how to build them You know the classic scenario right You register a service with a parameter but you forget to register the parameter itself or you register it incorrectly causing the injection to fail spectacularly So for example you have a service `MyService` with a constructor that expects an `IDataReader` but if you didn't register `IDataReader` you get the dreaded unresolvable dependency error because the container doesn't know what concrete class to use when you need to create an instance of `MyService` Its kinda like trying to order a sandwich without a filling

I remember this one project I worked on like 6 years ago we were building this real-time analytics dashboard we had this awesome `DataProcessor` service and it depended on a `Logger` service and a `DatabaseConnection` service you know your usual enterprise fare Anyway we were using a pretty sophisticated dependency injection framework and for a while it was running smooth like butter but suddenly we started getting those blasted injection errors

It turned out we had a typo in our container configuration we had registered `DatabaseConnector` instead of `DatabaseConnection` the difference was very minor but it caused chaos because when the container tried to resolve `DataProcessor` it got to the `DatabaseConnection` parameter and was completely stumped because `DatabaseConnector` was a completely different type so the whole injection process crashed

Here's a bit of pseudocode to illustrate a simpler version of what happened:

```python
class Logger:
    def log(self, message):
        print(f"Log: {message}")

class DatabaseConnection:
    def execute_query(self, query):
      print(f"Executing Query: {query}")

class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, logger: Logger, db_connection: DatabaseConnection):
        self.logger = logger
        self.db_connection = db_connection

    def process_data(self, data):
        self.logger.log("Processing data...")
        self.db_connection.execute_query("SELECT * FROM data_table")
        print("Data processed")

#Incorrect Container Configuration:
# container = Container()
# container[Logger] = Logger()
# container[DatabaseConnector] = DatabaseConnector() #TyPo
# container[DataProcessor] = DataProcessor(container[Logger],container[DatabaseConnector]) #TyPo
# data_processor = container[DataProcessor]

#Correct Container Configuration:
class Container:
  def __init__(self):
    self.services = {}

  def register(self, key, service):
    self.services[key] = service

  def resolve(self,key):
    return self.services[key]


container = Container()
container.register(Logger, Logger())
container.register(DatabaseConnection,DatabaseConnection())
container.register(DataProcessor,DataProcessor(container.resolve(Logger),container.resolve(DatabaseConnection)))
data_processor = container.resolve(DataProcessor)
data_processor.process_data("some data")

```

Notice the mistake I made above It's that typo between `DatabaseConnector` and `DatabaseConnection` It might seem like a small mistake but it brings the whole system crashing down it's why careful attention to details is really important when it comes to dependency injection

So in short double check your container registrations are they all correct and also check that you are using the correct types for the parameters

Another common issue is circular dependencies it is when Service A depends on Service B and Service B depends on Service A It creates a deadlock situation and causes the dependency injection process to fail because the container just chases its own tail forever I remember banging my head on the desk for hours trying to debug a circular dependency in an email notification system

We had a `NotificationService` that needed a `UserService` to get user details and the `UserService` needed a `NotificationService` to update user notification preferences and It sounds so reasonable but it’s a total mess It’s like trying to pick up yourself by your own bootstraps that’s not gonna work

So here is how we ended up fixing it

```python
class Logger:
    def log(self, message):
        print(f"Log: {message}")

class DatabaseConnection:
    def execute_query(self, query):
      print(f"Executing Query: {query}")

class EmailService:
    def __init__(self, logger: Logger, db_connection: DatabaseConnection):
        self.logger = logger
        self.db_connection = db_connection
        self.notification_service = None #Lazy Initializaiton
    def set_notification_service(self, notification_service):
      self.notification_service = notification_service
    def send_email(self, user_id, message):
        self.logger.log(f"Sending email to user {user_id}")
        self.db_connection.execute_query("SELECT * FROM user_table")
        self.notification_service.update_notification_status(user_id)
        print(f"Email sent to user {user_id}: {message}")


class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self, logger: Logger, db_connection: DatabaseConnection):
        self.logger = logger
        self.db_connection = db_connection
    def update_notification_status(self, user_id):
        self.logger.log(f"Updating notification status for user {user_id}")
        self.db_connection.execute_query("UPDATE notification_table SET status = 'SENT'")
        print(f"Notification status updated for user {user_id}")

# Container Setup with a Lazy Injection:
class Container:
  def __init__(self):
    self.services = {}

  def register(self, key, service):
    self.services[key] = service

  def resolve(self,key):
    return self.services[key]

container = Container()
container.register(Logger,Logger())
container.register(DatabaseConnection,DatabaseConnection())
email_service = EmailService(container.resolve(Logger),container.resolve(DatabaseConnection))
notification_service = NotificationService(container.resolve(Logger),container.resolve(DatabaseConnection))
email_service.set_notification_service(notification_service) #Late injection
container.register(EmailService,email_service)
container.register(NotificationService,notification_service)

# Using the services
email_service = container.resolve(EmailService)
email_service.send_email(123, "Hello from the system")

```

We use late injection by adding a method `set_notification_service` in the `EmailService` to inject the dependency after the service is created We were not able to make dependency injection work directly here so late injection or lazy injection like this is very important and common in production systems This also broke the cycle of dependency making the problem go away

Also you also might be dealing with a parameter type mismatch it's not always about registered services but also if the parameter you're trying to inject doesn't match the expected type the container will also throw an error. I remember having this problem once when injecting some configuration settings into a component I accidentally passed a string when the component was expecting an integer the error messages were not very clear about the root cause of this issue

Here is a simplified illustration for that problem

```python
class ConfigurationSettings:
    def __init__(self, max_retries: int, timeout: int):
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.timeout = timeout


class DataFetcher:
    def __init__(self, settings: ConfigurationSettings):
        self.settings = settings

    def fetch_data(self):
        print(f"Fetching data with retries: {self.settings.max_retries} and timeout: {self.settings.timeout}")

#Incorrect Setup
#settings = {"max_retries": "3", "timeout":"100"}#Type Mismatch

#Correct Setup
settings = ConfigurationSettings(3,100)

class Container:
  def __init__(self):
    self.services = {}

  def register(self, key, service):
    self.services[key] = service

  def resolve(self,key):
    return self.services[key]

container = Container()
container.register(ConfigurationSettings,settings)
container.register(DataFetcher,DataFetcher(container.resolve(ConfigurationSettings)))

fetcher = container.resolve(DataFetcher)
fetcher.fetch_data()
```

Make sure the data type you are injecting in the container matches the parameter in the classes constructor that's very important to avoid this problem Also be cautious about the way parameters are extracted from configuration files because there is always room for type mismatches if you are using JSON files or reading data from the operating system

Alright so what to do if you are stuck There are a lot of resources that will give you a good understanding of dependency injection. I recommend you check out "Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns" by Steven van Deursen and Mark Seemann for a real deep dive. Also for a more framework specific approach you should consult the official documentation of your chosen container that is what I always do It should usually describe all possible scenarios and edge cases in detail
Also the documentation of your language should cover parameter injection very well

And one last thing be sure to test your container with automated tests it will save you from a lot of issues in production also its a good practice to use linting tools in your code to avoid common errors like type mismatches so you don't end up doing silly mistakes like injecting a string when you need an int.

I hope this helps you and I remember a famous programmer that once said: "Why did the dependency injection framework break up with the code? Because they had unresolved issues!".
Anyway good luck with your debugging I'm sure you'll nail it
