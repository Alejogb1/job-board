Alright,  I've seen this particular challenge quite a few times in my work, usually when dealing with legacy systems or specialized data formats that output images as raw disk images (.img). It's not exactly a straightforward process, but it’s certainly manageable with the right tools and techniques. The crux of the issue lies in several stages: extracting the image data from the .img file, converting it to a standard image format like .png, and then loading that .png into a NumPy array.

From my experience, the most common pitfall stems from the fact that .img files don't adhere to a standardized image structure like a jpeg or png. They're essentially raw disk images, containing blocks of data that may represent an image, but without any header metadata explicitly stating image size, bit depth, color encoding, or similar information that an image library would typically require to decode an image. Therefore, we need to make certain assumptions, based upon the known structure (or probable structure) of your original .img files.

Firstly, we need to determine the format of the original images that have been written into .img files. Knowing this detail is fundamental to properly converting these images. In one past project, I had to work with camera output stored directly onto a disk image. The camera was capturing monochrome images, specifically 8 bits per pixel, arranged row by row without padding. So it had a straightforward raw format without any color encoding and the only required parameters were the width and height. But in another project, I encountered .img files where the original data was a RGB color image, represented as three channels, 8 bit per color, stored interleaved. So depending on your source, the interpretation of the raw bytes is very different.

So, how does this process generally look? It involves using Python with libraries such as Pillow (PIL) for image handling and NumPy for array manipulation. I'll illustrate using a simple example, assuming the .img contains greyscale images. We must first determine the size of image and the bit depth. Let's assume we know, for this first example, we are dealing with 8-bit greyscale images at 1024x768 pixels. Here is the code:

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import os

def img_to_png_to_numpy_greyscale(img_path, output_dir, width=1024, height=768):
    """
    Converts a raw greyscale .img file to .png, then loads it to a NumPy array.
    Assumes the .img is an 8-bit grayscale image.
    """
    try:
        with open(img_path, 'rb') as f:
            img_data = f.read()
            img_array = np.frombuffer(img_data, dtype=np.uint8).reshape((height, width))

        png_path = os.path.join(output_dir, os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(img_path))[0] + ".png")
        image = Image.fromarray(img_array, 'L')  # 'L' mode for grayscale
        image.save(png_path)
        return img_array
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing {img_path}: {e}")
        return None

#example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    img_file = "test_image.img"
    output_folder = "output_images"
    os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)
    #Create a dummy file for the test, or replace this with the path of your real .img file
    test_image_data = np.random.randint(0, 255, size=(768, 1024), dtype=np.uint8).tobytes()
    with open(img_file, "wb") as file:
       file.write(test_image_data)

    numpy_array = img_to_png_to_numpy_greyscale(img_file, output_folder)
    if numpy_array is not None:
        print("Successfully converted image, numpy array shape is:", numpy_array.shape)

```

In this first example, `img_to_png_to_numpy_greyscale` reads the .img file, converts it to a NumPy array and saves it as a .png, assuming we know a greyscale 8 bit format at 1024x768. This is a simplification, of course. If you know the bit depth differs (e.g., 16-bit), the `dtype` in `np.frombuffer` will need adjustment (e.g. `np.uint16`). Furthermore, if your image was not 8 bit greyscale, the mode parameter in Image.fromarray will require change. This brings us to the next code example:

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import os

def img_to_png_to_numpy_rgb(img_path, output_dir, width=1024, height=768):
    """
    Converts a raw RGB .img file to .png, then loads it to a NumPy array.
    Assumes the .img is an 8-bit RGB image (interleaved channels).
    """
    try:
        with open(img_path, 'rb') as f:
            img_data = f.read()
            img_array = np.frombuffer(img_data, dtype=np.uint8).reshape((height, width, 3)) #3 channels for R,G,B

        png_path = os.path.join(output_dir, os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(img_path))[0] + ".png")
        image = Image.fromarray(img_array, 'RGB')  # 'RGB' mode for color image
        image.save(png_path)
        return img_array
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing {img_path}: {e}")
        return None

#example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    img_file = "test_image_rgb.img"
    output_folder = "output_images"
    os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)
    #Create a dummy file for the test
    test_image_data = np.random.randint(0, 255, size=(768, 1024, 3), dtype=np.uint8).tobytes()
    with open(img_file, "wb") as file:
       file.write(test_image_data)

    numpy_array = img_to_png_to_numpy_rgb(img_file, output_folder)
    if numpy_array is not None:
        print("Successfully converted image, numpy array shape is:", numpy_array.shape)

```

In this example, `img_to_png_to_numpy_rgb`, we make the assumption that the raw image data represents color images, consisting of three color channels (Red, Green, and Blue). The reshaping of the NumPy array (`reshape((height, width, 3))`) reflects this, and we use the 'RGB' mode in `Image.fromarray`. So if the images in the .img file are stored as greyscale, you use the first approach, and for color images the second.

However, there can be more complex situations. For instance, the image data might be packed in ways where you would need to manually unpack pixel data, or even have color channels stored in non-standard orders. In such a case we can resort to a manual implementation of the process:

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import os

def img_to_png_to_numpy_manual(img_path, output_dir, width=1024, height=768, bits_per_pixel=8, channels=1):
    """
    Converts a raw .img file to .png, then loads it to a NumPy array with manual handling.
    This version is flexible to other scenarios.
    """
    try:
        with open(img_path, 'rb') as f:
            img_data = f.read()
        # calculate bytes per pixel
        bytes_per_pixel = (bits_per_pixel + 7) // 8
        # total size of the array
        total_pixels = width * height * channels
        total_bytes = bytes_per_pixel * total_pixels

        if len(img_data) != total_bytes:
            raise ValueError(f"Data size mismatch. Expected {total_bytes} bytes, got {len(img_data)}")

        # Create a NumPy array based on bit depth
        if bits_per_pixel == 8:
           img_array = np.frombuffer(img_data, dtype=np.uint8)
        elif bits_per_pixel == 16:
           img_array = np.frombuffer(img_data, dtype=np.uint16)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported bit depth")

        if channels > 1:
          img_array = img_array.reshape((height, width, channels)) # reshape only if there are more channels than 1
        else:
           img_array = img_array.reshape((height, width))

        png_path = os.path.join(output_dir, os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(img_path))[0] + ".png")

        if channels == 1:
          image = Image.fromarray(img_array, 'L')
        elif channels == 3:
          image = Image.fromarray(img_array, 'RGB')
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported number of channels")
        image.save(png_path)

        return img_array
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing {img_path}: {e}")
        return None

#example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    img_file = "test_image_manual.img"
    output_folder = "output_images"
    os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)

    test_image_data = np.random.randint(0, 255, size=(768, 1024, 3), dtype=np.uint8).tobytes() # RGB 8 bit example
    with open(img_file, "wb") as file:
       file.write(test_image_data)

    numpy_array = img_to_png_to_numpy_manual(img_file, output_folder, channels=3)
    if numpy_array is not None:
        print("Successfully converted image, numpy array shape is:", numpy_array.shape)
```

This more general `img_to_png_to_numpy_manual` function introduces flexibility regarding bit depth and number of channels, allowing to create either greyscale (channels=1), color (channels=3), or other variations of the raw image data. It performs manual calculation of expected byte size based on the parameters, and offers basic support for 8-bit and 16-bit images. This method should offer you a foundation to adapt the code to more complex scenarios.

Finally, for a more in-depth understanding of image processing techniques, I highly recommend diving into "Digital Image Processing" by Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods. It is a staple in the field. For a deeper exploration of NumPy, the official NumPy documentation, along with the book "Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake VanderPlas, are excellent resources. And for anything related to image libraries, PIL’s official documentation is the best way to go. Remember, proper understanding of your data format is key. Always start by exploring the origin of the .img files, and adjusting your process based on the specifics.
