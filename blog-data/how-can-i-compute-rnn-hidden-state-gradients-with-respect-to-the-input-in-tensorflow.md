Okay, let's tackle this. You're looking to understand how to compute the gradients of an RNN's hidden states with respect to its input in TensorFlow. I remember facing a similar challenge a few years back when I was working on a sequence-to-sequence model for time-series prediction. It's a bit more involved than typical backpropagation, but definitely manageable.

The core issue lies in the recurrent nature of RNNs. Each hidden state at time *t* is dependent on the hidden state at *t-1* and the current input. Consequently, the gradient of a hidden state with respect to an input is influenced by all the previous interactions. We aren’t dealing with a straightforward, layer-by-layer computation. We have to consider the unfolding of the network over time.

TensorFlow, thankfully, provides automatic differentiation capabilities that can help us, but it requires a bit of strategic application. The key is to use `tf.GradientTape`. This allows us to track the computations that affect a chosen variable, and then automatically calculate gradients with respect to any tensors involved in those computations.

Here’s how I approached this problem during that project, and how you can adapt it:

First, the straightforward approach might not work as expected. If you try to track the computations of the final hidden state and take the gradient with respect to the input sequence directly, you'll find that the gradient reflects the *entire* sequence's influence on the final hidden state, not the individual contributions of each input at each time step. This is a classic mistake.

To get the gradients of individual hidden states with respect to their corresponding inputs, you need to iterate through the sequence and calculate each gradient separately. It's a bit more verbose, but this yields the precise results you're after.

Here's a snippet illustrating this, starting with a basic RNN setup:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model definition
def build_rnn(units, input_shape):
    return tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units, return_sequences=True, input_shape=input_shape)

# Gradient calculation function
def compute_hidden_state_gradients(rnn_layer, inputs):
  """
  Computes the gradients of RNN hidden states with respect to inputs.

  Args:
    rnn_layer: A tf.keras.layers.RNN layer.
    inputs: A tf.Tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim).

  Returns:
    A tf.Tensor of gradients with shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_dim, input_dim).
  """
  batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim = inputs.shape
  hidden_dim = rnn_layer.units
  gradients = []

  for t in range(sequence_length):
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(inputs)
        outputs = rnn_layer(inputs) # full sequence, we need to extract at timestep t
        hidden_state_at_t = outputs[:, t, :]
      grad = tape.gradient(hidden_state_at_t, inputs) # gradients will be wrt all sequence inputs, need the correct slice
      gradients.append(grad[:, t, :])
  return tf.stack(gradients, axis = 1)

# Example usage
input_shape = (None, 10) # sequence length varies, input dimension is 10
rnn = build_rnn(32, input_shape) # rnn with 32 hidden units
inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 5, 10)) # batch size 2, sequence length 5, input dim 10

# run the computation and print
grads = compute_hidden_state_gradients(rnn,inputs)
print("Shape of gradients:", grads.shape) # Shape of gradients: (2, 5, 32, 10)
```

In this first example, we create a basic `SimpleRNN` layer and a function `compute_hidden_state_gradients`. Inside this function, for each time step *t*, we create a `tf.GradientTape`. We feed the entire sequence to the RNN, which returns a series of outputs (hidden states) across all time steps. Then we retrieve the specific hidden state at time step *t*. Crucially, we use `tape.gradient` on *this* specific hidden state and the *entire* input sequence. Since we're tracking with `tape.watch(inputs)` TensorFlow keeps track of the computational graph with inputs. We then extract the gradient component which corresponds to the input at time step *t*, `grad[:, t, :]`, and append it to our gradient collection. We need to stack along the sequence length dimension after the loop finishes to obtain the full gradients tensor which are of the shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_dim, input_dim).

Now, let's consider a slightly more involved scenario. Suppose you're using an LSTM instead of a simple RNN. The principle is the same, but we'll need to tweak a little for the change in architecture. Here’s how you would adapt this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model definition, now with lstm
def build_lstm(units, input_shape):
  return tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=True, input_shape=input_shape)

# Gradient calculation function, now for lstm
def compute_lstm_hidden_state_gradients(lstm_layer, inputs):
    """
    Computes gradients of LSTM hidden states w.r.t. inputs, including cell state grads.

    Args:
      lstm_layer: A tf.keras.layers.LSTM layer.
      inputs: A tf.Tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim).

    Returns:
      A tuple of two tf.Tensors: (hidden_state_gradients, cell_state_gradients)
      with each of the shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_dim, input_dim).
    """
    batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim = inputs.shape
    hidden_dim = lstm_layer.units
    hidden_gradients = []
    cell_gradients = []

    for t in range(sequence_length):
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          tape.watch(inputs)
          outputs = lstm_layer(inputs)
          hidden_state_at_t = outputs[:, t, :]
          cell_state_at_t =  lstm_layer.cell_state
          if isinstance(cell_state_at_t, list): # handling multiple cell states
            cell_state_at_t = cell_state_at_t[0] # assuming single layer, or use all
          cell_state_at_t = cell_state_at_t[:,t,:]
      grad_hidden = tape.gradient(hidden_state_at_t, inputs)
      grad_cell = tape.gradient(cell_state_at_t, inputs)
      hidden_gradients.append(grad_hidden[:, t, :])
      cell_gradients.append(grad_cell[:,t,:])

    return tf.stack(hidden_gradients, axis=1), tf.stack(cell_gradients,axis=1)


# Example usage
input_shape = (None, 10) # sequence length varies, input dimension is 10
lstm = build_lstm(32, input_shape) # lstm with 32 hidden units
inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 5, 10)) # batch size 2, sequence length 5, input dim 10

# run the computation and print
hidden_grads, cell_grads = compute_lstm_hidden_state_gradients(lstm, inputs)

print("Shape of hidden state gradients:", hidden_grads.shape) # Shape of hidden state gradients: (2, 5, 32, 10)
print("Shape of cell state gradients:", cell_grads.shape) # Shape of cell state gradients: (2, 5, 32, 10)
```

This example builds on the previous one but now uses an `LSTM` layer. Importantly, an LSTM has two hidden states, namely the cell state and the standard hidden state. So, `compute_lstm_hidden_state_gradients` now returns two gradients: one for the standard hidden state with shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_dim, input_dim), and another for the cell state with the same shape. The process remains the same: compute the outputs at each time step, get the hidden and cell state values, and compute the gradients using `tape.gradient`.

Now, let's consider a case when the hidden state, or the cell state in the case of lstm, is not explicitly provided as output but is the `lstm_layer.cell_state` property. The following shows a modified `compute_lstm_hidden_state_gradients_property` function. Note that you might want to inspect the actual content of cell_state before using it as a tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model definition, now with lstm
def build_lstm_modified(units, input_shape):
  return tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=True, return_state = True, input_shape=input_shape)

# Gradient calculation function, now for lstm
def compute_lstm_hidden_state_gradients_property(lstm_layer, inputs):
    """
    Computes gradients of LSTM hidden states w.r.t. inputs, using the property.

    Args:
      lstm_layer: A tf.keras.layers.LSTM layer, initialized with return_state=True
      inputs: A tf.Tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim).

    Returns:
      A tuple of two tf.Tensors: (hidden_state_gradients, cell_state_gradients)
      with each of the shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_dim, input_dim).
    """
    batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim = inputs.shape
    hidden_dim = lstm_layer.units
    hidden_gradients = []
    cell_gradients = []


    outputs, hidden_state, cell_state = lstm_layer(inputs)

    for t in range(sequence_length):
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          tape.watch(inputs)
          # the layer has been evaluated, take only the hidden/cell state at timestep t
          hidden_state_at_t = hidden_state[:,:]
          cell_state_at_t =  cell_state[:,:]

      grad_hidden = tape.gradient(hidden_state_at_t, inputs)
      grad_cell = tape.gradient(cell_state_at_t, inputs)
      hidden_gradients.append(grad_hidden[:, t, :])
      cell_gradients.append(grad_cell[:,t,:])

    return tf.stack(hidden_gradients, axis=1), tf.stack(cell_gradients,axis=1)


# Example usage
input_shape = (None, 10) # sequence length varies, input dimension is 10
lstm = build_lstm_modified(32, input_shape) # lstm with 32 hidden units
inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 5, 10)) # batch size 2, sequence length 5, input dim 10

# run the computation and print
hidden_grads, cell_grads = compute_lstm_hidden_state_gradients_property(lstm, inputs)

print("Shape of hidden state gradients:", hidden_grads.shape) # Shape of hidden state gradients: (2, 5, 32, 10)
print("Shape of cell state gradients:", cell_grads.shape) # Shape of cell state gradients: (2, 5, 32, 10)
```

In this third example, the `LSTM` layer is built with `return_state=True` to output the hidden and cell states at the end of the sequence. Therefore, to obtain the gradients, we will only call the `lstm_layer(inputs)` once and loop through the sequence to obtain gradients. This example is very similar to the previous one, however it demonstrates a case where the cell and hidden states are not output as sequences alongside the layer output, but as final states as a result of the computation across the sequence length. We use `tape.gradient` with the same approach as in previous examples to obtain the gradients of the hidden and cell states with respect to the inputs across the sequence length.

For further reading, I'd recommend exploring the following resources:

*   **Deep Learning** by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. This book provides an excellent theoretical foundation on neural networks and backpropagation. Look for the chapter on recurrent networks.
*   **TensorFlow documentation**: The official TensorFlow documentation is indispensable. Pay special attention to the sections on `tf.GradientTape` and recurrent layers.
*   **"Understanding LSTM Networks"** by Christopher Olah (blog post). Though not a paper, this provides an outstanding conceptual introduction to LSTMs, which is essential for understanding how the gradients flow.

Remember that the key to mastering these gradient calculations is a strong conceptual understanding of backpropagation through time and the role of `tf.GradientTape`. It does require a bit of work and some deliberate experimentation, but once you've internalized the principles, it becomes far more intuitive. Happy coding.
