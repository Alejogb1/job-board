, let’s tackle this comparison head-on. It’s a common area of confusion, and frankly, I've seen my fair share of head-scratching moments around this topic in past projects, especially when dealing with large-scale graph neural networks where performance is absolutely critical. The difference between `dgl.DGLGraph.apply_edges` and the send/recv family – specifically `dgl.DGLGraph.send` & `dgl.DGLGraph.recv`, along with the combined `send_and_recv` – hinges on the granularity of control you need over message passing and, consequently, the flexibility you gain versus the convenience offered.

Let me start with `apply_edges`. When you use `apply_edges`, you are fundamentally saying, “I want to compute and apply edge features based on information accessible *locally* to each edge.” This means the edge feature computation function you provide to `apply_edges` operates on the data associated with the *source and destination nodes directly connected by that specific edge*. There’s no intermediate storage or aggregation stage involved implicitly on the graph object itself. You're essentially dealing with a highly optimized map function applied at the edge level. This approach is often remarkably efficient for simple, element-wise operations across nodes directly connected by the edges, where you don't need to accumulate data globally across neighborhoods.

Now, consider `dgl.DGLGraph.send` and `dgl.DGLGraph.recv`, or their combined sibling `send_and_recv`. Here, the game changes. `send` *initiates* the message passing by specifying which node features should be broadcast along the edges, and it doesn’t apply any specific function. The specified data from the source nodes flows along the connections. Then, `recv` collects these messages on the destination nodes and performs *aggregation* using a reducer function you define, often involving summing, maxing, or similar operations. `send_and_recv` neatly combines these two steps into a single method call, making it syntactically simpler. This two-step, send-then-receive process allows for considerably more sophisticated operations that depend on data from *multiple incoming neighbors*. This capability is absolutely crucial for complex graph neural network designs.

Let’s illustrate with some practical examples. First, a straightforward edge feature calculation using `apply_edges`:

```python
import dgl
import torch

# Create a simple graph
g = dgl.graph(([0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0])) # edges: 0->1, 1->2, 2->0
g.ndata['h'] = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])

# Compute edge feature as the sum of node features of incident nodes
def edge_func(edges):
  return {'e' : edges.src['h'] + edges.dst['h']}

g.apply_edges(func=edge_func)
print(g.edata['e']) # Expected: tensor([[3.], [5.], [4.]])
```

In this case, `apply_edges` calculates a sum on each edge of the features from the source and destination nodes linked by that edge. Nothing is broadcast, and no aggregation happens. The result 'e' contains the sum for each edge directly.

Now, let’s shift gears and look at `send_and_recv` doing something more complex – implementing a basic graph convolution operation:

```python
import dgl
import torch

# Create a graph (same as before)
g = dgl.graph(([0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0]))
g.ndata['h'] = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])

# Message passing function: pass along source features
def message_func(edges):
    return {'m': edges.src['h']}

# Reduce function: sum the received messages
def reduce_func(nodes):
    return {'h_updated': torch.sum(nodes.mailbox['m'], dim=1)}

g.send_and_recv(g.edges(), message_func, reduce_func)
print(g.ndata['h_updated'])  # Expected: tensor([[3.], [1.], [2.]])
```

Here, `send_and_recv` broadcasts features from the source nodes (via the `message_func`). The broadcast messages are then *aggregated* using a summation (via the `reduce_func`), generating updated node features that reflect incoming data from their neighbors. This aggregation, absent in `apply_edges`, is crucial for capturing graph structure influence on node features. Note that these resulting values depend on *all* incoming neighbors, which is a fundamental difference.

And to further highlight the flexibility with `send` and `recv`, you can explicitly control the data flow via edges:

```python
import dgl
import torch

# Create a graph with edge weights
g = dgl.graph(([0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0]))
g.ndata['h'] = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
g.edata['w'] = torch.tensor([[0.5],[0.2],[0.3]])

# Message function includes edge weights
def message_func(edges):
  return {'m': edges.src['h'] * edges.data['w']}

# Reduction remains the same
def reduce_func(nodes):
  return {'h_updated': torch.sum(nodes.mailbox['m'], dim=1)}


g.send(g.edges(), message_func)
g.recv(g.nodes(), reduce_func)

print(g.ndata['h_updated']) # Expected: tensor([[0.6], [0.5], [0.3]])
```

In this snippet, we introduce edge weights and use them within the message function, further demonstrating how `send` and `recv` enable fine-grained manipulation of message passing, making it more flexible. Note that we had to send first and recv second in this case. The combined `send_and_recv` is a more elegant alternative in such a scenario if not requiring a step in between sending and recieving.

From a practical viewpoint, I’ve found that `apply_edges` is exceptionally useful in scenarios such as computing distances between node embeddings, or applying some sort of per-edge transformation that doesn’t depend on neighbor aggregation. If I'm implementing a model that is not a Graph Neural Network, and I merely need to adjust or filter edges based on edge/node characteristics, that is a prime scenario for `apply_edges`. On the other hand, for almost any graph neural network model, especially those utilizing convolutional-type layers, you'll be working with `send` and `recv`, or more conveniently, `send_and_recv` for their message aggregation capabilities. The additional overhead in `send` and `recv` is generally outweighed by the representational power enabled by aggregation, and DGL optimizes for this specific pattern heavily under the hood.

For anyone diving deeper into this, I highly recommend reading through the core message passing implementation in the Deep Graph Library documentation carefully. Beyond that, exploring literature such as "Graph Neural Networks: A Review of Methods and Applications" by Jie Zhou et al., published in AI Open, will offer a solid theoretical foundation. You should also look at papers focusing on message passing algorithms for different types of graphs and GNN architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) as initially described by Kipf and Welling, and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) introduced by Veličković et al., to fully grasp the underlying principles and best practices. These resources will solidify your understanding of why and how each pattern is used and when it’s appropriate.

In summary, `apply_edges` is about edge-local feature computations, while `send/recv` (and `send_and_recv`) unlock neighbor-aware computations that are integral to graph neural network models through the process of message aggregation. Choosing between them depends entirely on your specific need, but the send/recv family often forms the backbone of complex graph learning processes.
