alright, so you're asking how pytorch losses actually nudge the model parameters, a pretty fundamental thing when dealing with neural networks. i've spent a good chunk of my career elbow-deep in this stuff, and it's definitely one of those things that clicks better once you've seen it in action a few times. let's break it down without getting lost in too much math jargon.

at its core, a loss function, it's just a mathematical formula. you feed it the model's predictions and the actual, correct answers, and it spits out a single number – the loss. this number represents how bad the model's predictions were. a higher loss means the model is doing a lousy job, and a lower loss means it's getting closer to the correct answers.

now, here's the crucial part: this loss isn't just a random number. it's a function of the model's parameters – all those weights and biases inside the neural net. think of it like a landscape where the height represents the loss and the x and y axes represent the parameters. our goal is to find the lowest point on this landscape, the global minimum. that lowest point represents parameters which will give you the minimum loss, so it can be generalized and can achieve a high prediction score on unseen data.

the way we navigate this landscape is through gradient descent. it's like rolling a ball down a hill. we need to figure out which way is downhill in this parameter space. that’s where gradients come in. the gradient is just a vector of partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to each of the model parameters. it tells us how much the loss will change if we make a tiny change in each parameter.

specifically, for a parameter `w`, the partial derivative `∂loss/∂w` tells you the rate of change of the loss with respect to `w`. if the derivative is positive, it means that increasing `w` a little bit will increase the loss, and vice-versa. if its negative, it means increasing `w` a bit will decrease the loss, and vice-versa. the gradient is a vector of such partial derivatives of all the parameters in your network.

in pytorch this calculation is automated. if you've got your loss calculated, and you're using a standard pytorch optimizer like `torch.optim.sgd` or `torch.optim.adam`, the `loss.backward()` call will compute these gradients for all the parameters that require gradients, which is usually all of them. it does this using the chain rule of calculus, propagating from the last layer to first layer, hence the "back" part of `backward()`.

once the gradients are computed, the optimizer takes over. it updates the parameters in the direction opposite of the gradient. this is why we use negative signs with the learning rate; it's like stepping downhill in the landscape.

so in a nutshell:

1.  forward pass: your model takes input and makes predictions.
2.  loss calculation: compare predictions to actual targets.
3.  backward pass: pytorch computes gradients of the loss with respect to parameters.
4.  optimization step: the optimizer updates parameters based on gradients.

this is repeated over many iterations, slowly nudging the model parameters towards that minimum in the loss landscape, effectively training the model.

i remember this one time where i built a small image classifier. i kept getting terrible results and at first i thought it was the data, which is always suspicious, but after cleaning the data i was still getting random results, eventually i realized i had an issue in the loss calculation, i was mixing cross-entropy and l1 loss by mistake, so it was never converging correctly, and even though the loss number was decreasing, the learning wasn't really effective, once i fixed it the model started working correctly. this always highlights how important is to verify that you have the correct loss. its the key to training in the right direction.

let's look at some code snippets to make this clearer:

**snippet 1: a simple linear model**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# dummy data
x = torch.randn(100, 1) # 100 samples, 1 input feature
y = 2 * x + 1 + 0.1 * torch.randn(100, 1) # y = 2x + 1 + noise

# simple linear model
model = nn.Linear(1, 1)

# loss and optimizer
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    # forward pass
    y_pred = model(x)
    # loss calculation
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
    # zero gradients, otherwise they accumulate
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    # backward pass
    loss.backward()
    # update parameters
    optimizer.step()

    if epoch % 10 == 0:
      print(f'epoch: {epoch}, loss: {loss.item():.4f}')


print(f'model weights {model.weight.data.item():.2f}, model bias {model.bias.data.item():.2f}')
```

in this snippet, we define a simple linear model, use mean squared error as a loss, and stochastic gradient descent as the optimizer. the `loss.backward()` calculates the gradients and the optimizer updates the model's weights and bias to minimise the loss in each iteration.

**snippet 2: a classification example**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# dummy data
x = torch.randn(100, 10) # 100 samples, 10 input features
y = torch.randint(0, 3, (100,)) # 100 samples, 3 classes

# simple multi-class classifier
model = nn.Linear(10, 3)

# loss and optimizer
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    # forward pass
    y_pred = model(x)
    # loss calculation
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
    # zero gradients
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    # backward pass
    loss.backward()
    # update parameters
    optimizer.step()
    if epoch % 10 == 0:
      print(f'epoch: {epoch}, loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

print(f'model weights {model.weight.data}')
print(f'model bias {model.bias.data}')
```

here, we use a different loss function (cross-entropy) for a classification problem and a different optimizer (adam). it's pretty similar but now the model is a multiclass classifier with the `nn.linear` returning 3 outputs, one per class, the loss calculation is then using the probability of those classes.

**snippet 3: using custom loss**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# dummy data
x = torch.randn(100, 1) # 100 samples, 1 input feature
y = 2 * x + 1 + 0.1 * torch.randn(100, 1) # y = 2x + 1 + noise


# simple linear model
model = nn.Linear(1, 1)

# custom loss function
def custom_loss(y_pred, y_true):
  squared_diff = (y_pred - y_true) ** 2
  loss = torch.mean(squared_diff) + 0.1 * torch.mean(torch.abs(y_pred - y_true)) # mean squared error + l1 loss
  return loss

# optimizer
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    # forward pass
    y_pred = model(x)
    # loss calculation
    loss = custom_loss(y_pred, y)
    # zero gradients
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    # backward pass
    loss.backward()
    # update parameters
    optimizer.step()

    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f'epoch: {epoch}, loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

print(f'model weights {model.weight.data.item():.2f}, model bias {model.bias.data.item():.2f}')
```

this snippet shows how you can define your own custom loss function, for example an average of mean squared error and l1 loss in this case. its useful for situations in which you need something different from the basic provided by pytorch. it still works in the same way that the other examples, but now with our function which has our own gradients calculations for backpropagation.

regarding resources, i'd say skip the overly simplistic online tutorials. for a proper understanding of the math behind all of this, i'd recommend "deep learning" by goodfellow, bengio and courville and "understanding machine learning: from theory to algorithms" by shai shalev-shwartz and shai ben-david. "pattern recognition and machine learning" by christopher m. bishop is also a very good resource if you prefer more details about probabilistic methods and algorithms. these resources go in depth into the math and theory. they’re not light reads but they provide a very solid foundation. you may also want to get a good textbook in calculus, preferably multivariable calculus since you will need to understand partial derivatives. a solid calculus background will serve you well. a book like "calculus" by stewart should cover it.

i had one time a colleague that thought the loss was always the accuracy of the model, we were building a recommendation system at the time, and his 'loss' function was just the recall score between recommendations, he couldn't train the model properly as you can probably imagine. after we sat down and explained all the details about how parameters are nudged by the loss function the model training went smoothly. this was kind of funny at the time.

in essence, the loss function is the teacher, and the optimizer is the student, and the model's parameters are continuously adapting based on the error (loss) signal, this process repeats itself every iteration, and eventually ideally, you reach the minimum in your loss landscape. remember also the loss landscape is multi-dimensional, so there can be multiple local minimum, but the goal is to reach the global minimum in which the model generalizes in unseen data.
