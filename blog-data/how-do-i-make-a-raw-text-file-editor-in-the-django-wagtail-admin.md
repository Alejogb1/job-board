Okay, let's tackle this. The concept of embedding a raw text file editor directly within the Wagtail admin panel is something I've actually dealt with a couple of times in past projects, and it always brings up interesting challenges. It's less about directly manipulating the file system within the browser and more about providing a safe and user-friendly way to view and modify text-based content associated with your Wagtail pages or settings.

The core issue isn't about "editing a raw file" directly in the sense of a local filesystem, but rather, providing a UI within Wagtail’s admin to handle string-based content that *represents* the content of a hypothetical text file, or potentially loads from an actual text file stored server-side. We don't want the user poking around actual files. Instead, we focus on the text, which we store in our model or settings, or pull from the file, edit, and then potentially re-save if desired.

So, forget about filesystem operations directly in the browser, it's just not going to happen securely and reliably. Instead, I’ll describe how to approach this, providing practical examples and focusing on the implementation details, drawing from my experiences.

The key considerations revolve around:

1.  **Storage:** Where will the text content reside? It can be a text field in a Django model, a Wagtail settings object, or a temporary store while being edited, ultimately saving to a file via server-side operations.
2.  **User Interface (UI):** We need a text editor component. Django forms provide basic `<textarea>` elements, but we might require something richer like a code editor with syntax highlighting for better user experience.
3.  **Backend Operations:** Saving, reading (if loading from a file), and sanitizing input safely to avoid vulnerabilities.

Let's break it down with some code examples using a `Snippet` model in Wagtail as a starting point. We’ll assume a simple case where we store the text directly in a `TextField`.

**Example 1: Basic `TextField` with a Simple `textarea` Editor**

First, let's create our basic `Snippet` model in your `models.py` in your app.

```python
from django.db import models
from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel
from wagtail.snippets.models import register_snippet

@register_snippet
class TextFileSnippet(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    content = models.TextField(blank=True)

    panels = [
        FieldPanel('title'),
        FieldPanel('content'),
    ]

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

This establishes a `TextFileSnippet` with a `title` and a `content` field. The admin interface, by default, presents a basic `<textarea>` input field for the `content`. While functional, it's quite basic for larger blocks of text or code.

**Example 2: Incorporating a Code Editor with `django-codemirror2`**

Now, let's improve the UI experience. Here, we will integrate `django-codemirror2`. This adds a code editor with syntax highlighting, enhancing the editing experience.

First, install the library:

```bash
pip install django-codemirror2
```

Now, adjust our model and our forms in `forms.py` within our app (create it if you don't already have one):

```python
from django import forms
from django.utils.html import format_html
from wagtail.admin.forms import WagtailAdminModelForm

from codemirror2.widgets import CodeMirrorTextarea

from .models import TextFileSnippet


class TextFileSnippetForm(WagtailAdminModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    class Meta:
        model = TextFileSnippet
        fields = ['title', 'content']
        widgets = {
            'content': CodeMirrorTextarea(config={'mode': 'text/plain', 'lineNumbers': True}),
        }


    def clean_content(self):
         content = self.cleaned_data.get("content")
         # Basic sanitization, could add more complex logic here
         return content

from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel
from wagtail.snippets.models import register_snippet
@register_snippet
class TextFileSnippet(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    content = models.TextField(blank=True)

    panels = [
        FieldPanel('title'),
        FieldPanel('content', widget=CodeMirrorTextarea(config={'mode': 'text/plain', 'lineNumbers': True})),
    ]

    form_class = TextFileSnippetForm


    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

This form overrides the default widget for the 'content' field and uses `CodeMirrorTextarea`. The `config` dictionary lets us set up options like `mode` for syntax highlighting and `lineNumbers`. We have also added a `clean_content` method for basic sanitization, a crucial step in any application handling user input.

**Example 3: Handling File Loading and Saving to a file**

Finally, let’s consider a more complex example where the text content is loaded from a file, edited via the admin, and then written back to that file. *Note that this example is conceptual and might require further adaptation based on your specific needs.* We introduce functions that interact with the filesystem and are wrapped in exception handling to prevent issues. We will assume your files are stored relative to your `MEDIA_ROOT` setting, in a directory we will call `text_files`.

First, we’ll adjust the model. Note that the actual text *is not* stored within the model itself, but rather the *path* to the text file.

```python
import os
from django.db import models
from django.conf import settings
from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel
from wagtail.snippets.models import register_snippet
from django import forms
from .forms import TextFileSnippetForm

@register_snippet
class TextFileSnippet(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    file_path = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True, help_text='Relative path to text file in text_files dir, e.g. my_file.txt')

    panels = [
        FieldPanel('title'),
        FieldPanel('file_path'),
    ]

    form_class = TextFileSnippetForm
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title


    def get_full_path(self):
        return os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, 'text_files', self.file_path)

    def get_text_content(self):
        full_path = self.get_full_path()
        try:
            with open(full_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                return f.read()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return ""
        except Exception as e:
           return f"Error reading file: {e}"

    def set_text_content(self, content):
        full_path = self.get_full_path()
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(full_path), exist_ok=True)
        try:
            with open(full_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                f.write(content)
                return True
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
            return False

```

And now we need to adjust the forms, this is crucial to ensure our model is safe.

```python
from django import forms
from django.utils.html import format_html
from wagtail.admin.forms import WagtailAdminModelForm

from codemirror2.widgets import CodeMirrorTextarea

from .models import TextFileSnippet

class TextFileSnippetForm(WagtailAdminModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        instance = kwargs.get('instance')
        if instance:
            self.initial['content'] = instance.get_text_content()

    content = forms.CharField(widget=CodeMirrorTextarea(config={'mode': 'text/plain', 'lineNumbers': True}), required=False)
    
    def clean(self):
       cleaned_data = super().clean()
       instance = self.instance
       if instance:
           content = cleaned_data.get('content')
           if content is not None:
               if not instance.set_text_content(content):
                   self.add_error(None, 'Error writing file.')
       return cleaned_data

    class Meta:
        model = TextFileSnippet
        fields = ['title', 'file_path', 'content']
        widgets = {
            'file_path': forms.TextInput(),
        }

```

In this modified model and form:

*   The `file_path` field stores the relative path.
*   `get_full_path` constructs the full filepath, using the `MEDIA_ROOT` for the base directory and appending the text_files folder.
*   `get_text_content` retrieves the content of the corresponding file.
*   `set_text_content` attempts to save any provided content back to the same file.
*   We override the default form widget to be a `TextInput` for the file path.
*   `clean` is used to perform the file-save operations and any extra validation

*It’s important to acknowledge that file system operations introduce significant security considerations.* Error handling and robust sanitization are absolutely essential.

**Recommended Resources**

To further your understanding of the concepts described above, I would recommend the following:

1.  **"Two Scoops of Django 3.x" by Daniel Roy Greenfeld and Audrey Roy Greenfeld:** This provides a practical, real-world approach to building Django projects. It covers many topics, including forms, models, and more general best practices.
2.  **The Django Documentation:** Always the primary source for learning Django, especially around model fields, forms, and form processing.
3.  **The Wagtail Documentation:** A great starting point and reference for learning to use the platform and integrate it effectively into your projects.
4. **Django CodeMirror2 Package Documentation**: Specific documentation on using codemirror within django including customisations.

Remember to always test your code thoroughly and handle exceptions gracefully. This is not intended to be used as production-ready code without review, modifications, and extensive testing, but serves to describe how such a system might be built. Good luck with your project!
