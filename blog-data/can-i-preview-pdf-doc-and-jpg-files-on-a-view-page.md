Okay, let’s address this. Previewing various file formats directly on a web page – specifically pdf, doc(x), and jpg – is a common requirement, and the approaches differ significantly depending on the format and the level of fidelity you’re aiming for. Over the years, I’ve tackled this challenge multiple times, and the solutions often involved a blend of client-side and server-side strategies, each with its own trade-offs. Let’s break it down.

From the get-go, understand that providing a “true” live preview, especially for complex formats like doc(x), is not trivial using client-side javascript alone. We often need to lean on browser capabilities or utilize server-side conversion processes. For pdfs, browsers have made strides, but word documents remain quite challenging client-side. And of course, images are straightforward, but sometimes require specific handling.

First, let's tackle the most straightforward one: JPG files. For images, the browser can natively render them using an `<img>` tag. Here’s how you'd do it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Image Preview</title>
</head>
<body>
  <img src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Preview of the image" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;">
</body>
</html>
```

This snippet is very simple: we use the `<img>` tag with a source attribute pointing to the location of the image. The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for accessibility and cases where the image cannot be displayed. I've included basic styling to cap the image size. The key here is that the browser does all the heavy lifting for jpgs. This just illustrates how to embed one. It's really about the *path/to/your/image.jpg* pointing to a valid and accessible image file. I’d suggest, for production environments, that you always ensure adequate error handling (e.g., the image not found) and consider resizing if necessary.

Next, let's look at PDF files. Modern browsers often support embedding pdfs using the `<embed>` tag or the `<iframe>` tag. I’ve found that the `<embed>` tag is usually the more straightforward choice for in-browser pdf viewing.

Here is the basic html structure to embed a pdf file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>PDF Preview</title>
</head>
<body>
  <embed src="path/to/your/document.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="800" height="600"/>
</body>
</html>
```

The `type` attribute indicates that the embedded content is a pdf file. The `width` and `height` attributes control the size of the preview. For pdf files, this method leverages the built-in pdf rendering capability of the browser, which relies on javascript based pdf viewer plugins available inside browser. This handles rendering the pdf and does not require server-side conversion for basic preview functionality. However, for more complex pdfs or if you require consistent behavior across different browsers, a third-party javascript pdf renderer (like pdf.js) may be a better option. It gives you better control but adds complexity. I’ve used pdf.js extensively in the past to guarantee consistent pdf rendering across all platforms. If you are dealing with sensitive documents, be sure to investigate proper authorization to prevent access to files on the server. Consider reading the documentation for pdf.js from the Mozilla project if that route becomes necessary. It's a very reliable and well-maintained option.

Now, the tricky part: word documents. Direct preview of doc(x) files in the browser is not supported natively. The issue is, unlike the jpg and pdf files, there's no consistent rendering engine available in browsers for word documents. There are some less efficient, outdated and frankly unreliable options to convert it to HTML via JS but I'd strongly recommend against them for any sort of production scenario. The recommended approach involves a server-side conversion. I’ve utilized LibreOffice or its command-line version, `soffice`, extensively for this purpose. You would typically convert the doc(x) file to a pdf or html on the server, and then serve the converted output to the client. Converting it to a PDF, then displaying it as shown above tends to be the simplest solution in my experience.

Here is a basic example using python to illustrate this server side concept:

```python
import subprocess
import os

def convert_docx_to_pdf(docx_path, pdf_path):
    """Converts a docx file to pdf using libreoffice command line."""
    try:
        subprocess.run(["soffice", "--headless", "--convert-to", "pdf", docx_path, "--outdir", os.path.dirname(pdf_path)], check=True)
        return True
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error converting docx to pdf: {e}")
        return False


if __name__ == "__main__":
    docx_file = "path/to/your/document.docx" # Replace with the path to your document
    pdf_file = "path/to/your/document.pdf"  # Replace with the desired path for the output

    if convert_docx_to_pdf(docx_file, pdf_file):
        print(f"Successfully converted {docx_file} to {pdf_file}")
        # Now you would use the embed tag as explained earlier to preview the pdf
    else:
        print(f"Failed to convert {docx_file}")

```

This Python snippet uses `subprocess.run` to execute the `soffice` command. You'll need LibreOffice installed on your server. The crucial part here is `"--convert-to", "pdf"`. It converts the docx to pdf and places it in the designated directory. In a real web application context, the server-side code would then serve this newly converted PDF, which the client-side can then display using the methods detailed earlier for pdf. You might choose a different language and method based on your tech stack, however the underlying principle of server-side conversion still applies.

In my experience, dealing with word documents can be quite involved. There are commercial solutions that exist but they often carry licensing costs. If you intend to maintain the document's precise layout, tables, and formatting, be aware that even server-side conversion may not be perfect and it’s something to test and tweak extensively. Another aspect is dealing with security. It is vital to ensure that only authorized users can access the uploaded document and the resulting pdf. I recommend having a deep read of the OWASP security guidelines, specifically related to file upload and processing, as it's absolutely vital for a secure and reliable system.

To summarise, previewing different file types requires a varied approach. Jpg files are straightforward with `<img>` tags; pdfs can leverage the browser's capabilities via `<embed>` or `<iframe>` tags, with javascript based solutions available if needed. Word documents generally require a server-side conversion step, often to pdf or html before they can be displayed, and must also have adequate security measures in place. In cases where very high fidelity doc(x) previews are needed, exploring dedicated document conversion libraries or services might be worthwhile.
