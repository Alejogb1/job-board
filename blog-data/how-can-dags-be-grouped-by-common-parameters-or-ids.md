Alright, let's tackle this one. I've spent a fair amount of time in the trenches with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and the question of how to group them based on shared parameters or identifiers is a recurring theme. It's rarely a one-size-fits-all solution, and the optimal method often hinges on the specific context of the problem you're addressing. In the past, I recall a system I was working on involved complex data processing pipelines where DAGs representing different processing workflows were being dynamically generated. Keeping track of these DAGs, and more importantly, efficiently managing and updating them, became quite the challenge without an effective grouping strategy.

Let's break this down. When we talk about grouping DAGs, we’re essentially aiming to organize these computational workflows based on specific attributes or metadata they share. This isn't merely about aesthetics; it’s about enhancing manageability, enabling targeted updates, facilitating debugging, and allowing for more granular resource allocation. The specific method we choose should, ideally, reflect the purpose and structure of our DAGs.

One of the most fundamental ways to group DAGs is by their *purpose* or *intent*. In our past project, for instance, we had DAGs associated with different types of data transformations—say, one for customer data cleansing and another for product data enrichment. A simple yet effective way to achieve this is by using a naming convention that embeds these high-level identifiers. We might name our DAGs something like “customer_cleansing_v1”, “product_enrichment_v2,” or "ml_training_v3.” This isn't a sophisticated grouping mechanism in itself, but it does lay the groundwork for more structured approaches.

A more robust method involves leveraging **metadata**. Most DAG orchestration tools allow you to attach key-value pairs to your DAGs. These metadata tags provide an ideal way to categorise DAGs based on parameters, identifiers, or any other contextual information you find useful. These can include things like data source identifiers, processing engine types, execution environments, or even the specific responsible team for a particular DAG. For example, if multiple DAGs process data from the same source, you can tag them with the source id, enabling us to easily query and identify all affected workflows when that source changes.

This approach scales considerably better than manual naming conventions, since metadata can be readily queried and modified programmatically. Further, these groupings can be dynamic and change based on a certain property, such as a date for instance.

Let’s get down to code. Imagine you are using a library to generate these DAGs, it doesn’t really matter which one, and let’s assume it's similar to how Airflow operates (although this approach would be useful no matter your library). Here are three quick examples in Python that illustrate this concept.

**Example 1: Basic Naming Convention**

This example demonstrates the most basic version of grouping which relies on naming conventions:

```python
def create_dag(dag_type, version, **kwargs):
    dag_id = f"{dag_type}_{version}"
    # Assume this function is part of your DAG creation framework
    print(f"Creating DAG: {dag_id}")
    # Add your DAG generation logic here.
    return dag_id

# Creating various DAGs using the naming convention
dag1_id = create_dag("customer_data", "v1")
dag2_id = create_dag("product_data", "v2")
dag3_id = create_dag("customer_data", "v2")

print(f"DAGs created: {[dag1_id,dag2_id, dag3_id]}")

```

**Example 2: Metadata-Based Grouping**

This approach demonstrates how to use metadata to categorize DAGs.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

dag_metadata = defaultdict(list)

def register_dag(dag_id, metadata):
   dag_metadata[tuple(sorted(metadata.items()))].append(dag_id)
   print(f"Registered DAG: {dag_id} with metadata: {metadata}")

# Registering DAGs with their metadata
register_dag("dag_1", {"data_source": "sales_db", "process_type": "cleaning"})
register_dag("dag_2", {"data_source": "products_api", "process_type": "enrichment"})
register_dag("dag_3", {"data_source": "sales_db", "process_type": "validation"})
register_dag("dag_4", {"data_source": "sales_db", "process_type": "cleaning"})

# Print DAGs grouped by their metadata
for metadata_group, dag_ids in dag_metadata.items():
    print(f"\nDAGs with metadata {dict(metadata_group)}: {dag_ids}")

```

This snippet uses a defaultdict to group DAGs by metadata. Now it's easy to find all DAGs associated with a specific data source or processing type. Note the use of tuples as keys, this is because dictionaries do not allow mutable objects to be keys.

**Example 3: Grouping Based on Dynamic Properties**

This example shows how you can implement a grouping based on a dynamic property such as a date, in this case we will be using an arbitrary number:

```python
import datetime
from collections import defaultdict

dag_groups = defaultdict(list)

def register_dynamic_dag(dag_id, value_date, metadata):
    
    group_key = value_date # This is a variable, and we expect the date to change as a parameter.
    dag_groups[group_key].append({"dag_id": dag_id, "metadata": metadata})
    print(f"Registered DAG: {dag_id} with group key: {group_key}")

register_dynamic_dag("dag_1", 1,  {"data_source": "source_a"})
register_dynamic_dag("dag_2", 2, {"data_source": "source_b"})
register_dynamic_dag("dag_3", 1, {"data_source": "source_c"})
register_dynamic_dag("dag_4", 2, {"data_source": "source_d"})
register_dynamic_dag("dag_5", 3, {"data_source": "source_e"})

#print DAGs grouped by value date
for group_key, dag_list in dag_groups.items():
    print(f"\nDAGs with group key {group_key}: {[dag['dag_id'] for dag in dag_list]}")

```

In a real-world setting, `value_date` could be a date, a version number, or any other parameter that changes dynamically. This allows to group DAGs that belong to a particular time range, or DAGs that were changed together.

These examples are of course simplified, but demonstrate the core ideas. The implementation of the `register_dag` function should be adapted to your workflow, most often the DAG objects will be created on the fly. In real systems, the metadata would ideally be stored in a database or a persistent key-value store which also makes filtering and querying more straightforward, and offers more robust querying capabilities.

As for further reading, I recommend looking into "Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow" by Bas P. Harenslak. This book covers DAG design principles and management strategies. If you're interested in a more theoretical approach to workflow management, “Workflow Management: Models, Methods, and Systems” by Wil van der Aalst, et al. provides a strong academic understanding of the concepts. Lastly, for implementation-specific guidance, exploring the documentation of your DAG orchestration framework (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, etc.) is invaluable. These frameworks almost always contain specific methods for handling metadata tags.

In practice, selecting the right grouping strategy is an iterative process and should be tailored to the specific demands of your application. Remember, well-organized DAGs are crucial to maintainable, scalable, and reliable data processing systems. By applying these techniques, you’re setting yourself up to manage your workflows more effectively, handle updates with precision, and gain better insights into your data processing environment.
