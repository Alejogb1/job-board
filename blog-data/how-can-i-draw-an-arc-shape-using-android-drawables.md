Okay, let's tackle this one. Drawing arcs with Android drawables, at first glance, might seem a bit more involved than just slapping down a rectangle or a circle. It's a task I’ve encountered several times, especially in early versions of some visualization tools I worked on. We needed to create dynamic gauges and segmented progress indicators, which required precisely drawn arcs. There are a few solid approaches, and I’ll walk you through them, focusing on what I've found works best in practice.

First, it’s crucial to understand that Android's `Canvas` class is where the magic happens when drawing custom shapes. While you *could* use an image and create your arc externally, that’s not always ideal for dynamic or programmatic arc creation. We want something that can adapt to different sizes, colors, and angular spans on the fly. The key here lies in using `ShapeDrawable` or `Paint` directly with a canvas, combined with the `RectF` class to define our bounding box for the arc. `RectF` essentially defines a rectangle that our arc will fit within.

Let's start with `ShapeDrawable`. This is arguably the simpler method, especially if you're accustomed to working with XML drawables. With a `ShapeDrawable`, you can create a custom shape, and then use its `draw()` method to draw the shape on a canvas. The advantage here is that you can easily configure it using XML and code. However, this approach requires us to subclass `Shape` to define the arc.

```java
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Paint;
import android.graphics.RectF;
import android.graphics.drawable.shapes.Shape;

public class ArcShape extends Shape {

    private final float startAngle;
    private final float sweepAngle;

    public ArcShape(float startAngle, float sweepAngle) {
        this.startAngle = startAngle;
        this.sweepAngle = sweepAngle;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw(Canvas canvas, Paint paint) {
        RectF bounds = new RectF(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight());
        canvas.drawArc(bounds, startAngle, sweepAngle, true, paint);
    }
}

```

In this first example, `ArcShape` is a custom class extending `Shape`. The constructor receives `startAngle` and `sweepAngle` (in degrees), defining the arc's extent. The `draw` method uses these angles along with the bounding box defined by `RectF` to draw the arc. Note the `useCenter` parameter passed as `true` to `drawArc`; this indicates we're drawing a pie slice style arc that goes from one end of the arc to the center of the circle. If set to false, we would draw a simple arc.

Next, let’s incorporate this into a drawable that you can use.

```java
import android.graphics.drawable.ShapeDrawable;
import android.graphics.drawable.shapes.Shape;

public class ArcDrawable extends ShapeDrawable {

  public ArcDrawable(float startAngle, float sweepAngle) {
    super(new ArcShape(startAngle, sweepAngle));
  }

  public void setStartAngle(float startAngle){
    ((ArcShape) getShape()).setStartAngle(startAngle);
    invalidateSelf(); //ensure it redraws
  }

   public void setSweepAngle(float sweepAngle){
      ((ArcShape) getShape()).setSweepAngle(sweepAngle);
     invalidateSelf();
  }

}
```

This `ArcDrawable` class extends `ShapeDrawable` and encapsulates the custom `ArcShape`. We initialize it with the start and sweep angles. This lets us dynamically adjust the start and sweep of the arc on the fly if we need, which can be beneficial for animations or other interactive features, although you would need to invalidate the drawable to trigger a redraw after making changes.

The `ShapeDrawable` method is effective for scenarios where you need a static arc or one where the arc's parameters don't need frequent, complex modifications. However, for more sophisticated drawing scenarios, using `Paint` directly on the canvas gives you more flexibility. It avoids the overhead of creating a custom shape, which might be preferable if you're drawing lots of arcs or need maximum control.

Here’s how you can draw an arc directly on a `View` by overriding its `onDraw` method.

```java
import android.content.Context;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.graphics.Paint;
import android.graphics.RectF;
import android.view.View;

public class ArcView extends View {

    private final Paint paint;
    private final RectF rect;
    private float startAngle;
    private float sweepAngle;

    public ArcView(Context context) {
        super(context);
        paint = new Paint();
        paint.setColor(Color.BLUE);
        paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);
        paint.setAntiAlias(true);
        rect = new RectF();
        startAngle = 0f;
        sweepAngle = 90f;
    }

  public void setStartAngle(float startAngle){
      this.startAngle = startAngle;
      invalidate(); //force redraw
  }

   public void setSweepAngle(float sweepAngle){
      this.sweepAngle = sweepAngle;
      invalidate(); //force redraw
  }

    @Override
    protected void onSizeChanged(int w, int h, int oldw, int oldh) {
      super.onSizeChanged(w,h,oldw,oldh);
      float padding = 20;
      rect.set(padding, padding, w - padding, h - padding); //avoiding edges
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
        super.onDraw(canvas);
        canvas.drawArc(rect, startAngle, sweepAngle, true, paint);

    }
}
```

In this example, `ArcView` is a custom `View` subclass. We initialize a `Paint` object for drawing and a `RectF` to define the bounds of our arc. We also include `setStartAngle` and `setSweepAngle` methods to allow updating the angles directly from the user of this view. The key point is that the `onDraw` method directly calls `canvas.drawArc`, passing it the rectangle bounds, start angle, sweep angle, and our `Paint` object. The `onSizeChanged` method is implemented so that the arc is redrawn if the view size changes. You'd normally set the `rect` based on the dimensions of the `View` in `onSizeChanged`, but in this example we are also including a bit of padding so that we avoid the edges of the view.

I've found that direct canvas drawing, like this, is beneficial for performance when you’re working with custom, data-driven visuals. For very detailed work, remember to leverage techniques like hardware acceleration, which is typically enabled by default for newer android devices but can be important to check on older versions.

For further reading, I would suggest examining the Android framework source code directly, particularly the classes within the `android.graphics` package. In terms of books, “Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide” provides a comprehensive overview of drawing and custom view creation. Also, researching the fundamentals of computer graphics from a general perspective can give you a better understanding, you might find something like "Computer Graphics with OpenGL" by Hearn and Baker to be useful for a broader viewpoint. I hope this helps clarify the process and provides some useful code snippets for drawing arcs in Android.
