Alright,  I've spent a fair amount of time navigating the intricacies of Rails routing, particularly when deciding between query parameters and IDs, and it's a decision that carries significant weight in terms of both functionality and maintainability. From my experience working on a large-scale e-commerce platform years back, the wrong choice could lead to performance bottlenecks and unnecessarily complicated logic, so careful consideration is paramount.

Essentially, both query parameters and IDs are mechanisms for passing data to your Rails application via the URL, but they serve fundamentally different purposes. The primary distinction lies in how they are treated by the routing system and the implied semantics of the data they represent.

Ids, typically used within the path structure itself—think `/products/123` or `/users/abc-def-456`—are designed to identify specific resources. The routing engine will almost always look for a specific controller action designed to handle this type of request. When you define a route like `get '/products/:id', to: 'products#show'`, Rails expects the `:id` to directly correspond to a record in your database (or an equivalent datastore). The implicit assumption is that the controller action (in this case, `ProductsController#show`) will utilize this `id` to retrieve a unique entity. This approach implies a hierarchical relationship within the application's data model and naturally aligns with RESTful design principles.

Query parameters, on the other hand, are appended to the end of the URL after a question mark (?). Examples include `/products?category=electronics&sort=price_asc`. They are fundamentally key-value pairs, designed to filter, sort, or provide supplemental information about a request, rather than directly identifying specific resources. They don't directly dictate which controller or action gets called but rather offer contextual information that shapes the behavior of that action. The controller receives these parameters in the `params` hash and uses them to conditionally modify the data being processed. This often involves modifying the database query or the response being generated.

The selection between the two often depends on the nature of the data and its role within the application. If you are asking for a specific entity, such as a particular user or product, an id is ideal. It is a part of the URI structure, it's generally immutable, and it directly links to an object. Conversely, for filtering, pagination, or anything else that would typically modify the underlying query, using query parameters is the preferred method.

Let's walk through some examples to solidify this.

**Example 1: Using IDs to Fetch a Specific Product**

Imagine we want to retrieve a specific product using its id. Our `routes.rb` might look like this:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/products/:id', to: 'products#show'
end
```

And our `ProductsController` might contain:

```ruby
# app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])
    render json: @product
  end
end
```

Here, the `:id` within the route directly maps to the `params[:id]` variable in the controller. The controller then uses this `id` to find a specific product in the database and then renders that product as json. This shows that the url `products/123` fetches product with id 123

**Example 2: Using Query Parameters for Filtering Products**

Now, let’s say we want to allow users to filter products based on their category. We can adapt our controller with query parameters:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/products', to: 'products#index'
end
```

And our `ProductsController` would be altered as follows:

```ruby
# app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @products = Product.all
    if params[:category].present?
      @products = @products.where(category: params[:category])
    end
    if params[:sort].present? && params[:sort] == 'price_asc'
      @products = @products.order(price: :asc)
    end
    render json: @products
  end
end
```

Here the url `/products?category=electronics&sort=price_asc` fetches products that belong to the electronics category and orders them by price in ascending order. Notice how we have reused the controller action to handle a modified request based on the query parameters. We haven't used any of our routing parameters in this action.

**Example 3: Combining IDs and Query Parameters**

Lastly, consider a scenario where we might fetch a specific user's posts, potentially filtered further using query parameters.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/users/:user_id/posts', to: 'posts#index'
end
```

And the `PostsController` :

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
     @user = User.find(params[:user_id])
     @posts = @user.posts
     if params[:status].present?
        @posts = @posts.where(status: params[:status])
     end
     render json: @posts
  end
end
```

In this case, `/users/123/posts?status=published` would retrieve the published posts for user 123. The `user_id` is part of the resource path identifying a specific user, and `status` is provided as a query parameter that modifies the data set being presented.

My experience has shown that mixing both ids and query params this way is a flexible and effective approach. The `id` forms a clear, immutable location in the application’s resource system, while the query parameters provide filtering, and paging mechanisms that fit in with the RESTful paradigm.

From a maintainability point of view, employing query params for filtering and sorting and IDs for specific resource locations, avoids the common pitfalls of overly complicated controller actions or a spaghetti of overly verbose routes. The separation of concerns inherent in this methodology helps in keeping code clean, testable, and more resilient to change. If, for instance, the filtering logic becomes more intricate, it’s easy to expand the index controller action in a modular way, without breaking the fundamental functionality of resource access.

When navigating this aspect of Rails routing, I'd recommend examining these resources for a more in-depth understanding of RESTful architecture and web application design principles:

1.  **"RESTful Web Services" by Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby:** This book is foundational to grasping REST principles and their implementation in various contexts, not just Rails. It provides a comprehensive understanding of how to model resources and manipulate them.

2.  **The Rails Guides: Rails Routing:** The official Rails Guides documentation offers a thorough explanation of the routing system, including constraints, nesting, and parameter handling. This is the definitive resource for learning the mechanics of Rails routing.

3. **"Building Microservices" by Sam Newman:** Although broader than just Rails routing, this book provides a valuable context on how to architect applications, especially in relation to microservices, which often involves making decisions about data access patterns via APIs and therefore routing methodologies.

In summary, while both IDs and query parameters are mechanisms to pass data via URLs, their purposes in Rails routes are quite distinct. IDs are for identifying specific resources, while query parameters provide filtering or additional request-specific data. Choosing correctly will help streamline the development process, keep code clean, and avoid many future headaches.
