Okay, let's tackle this. I've spent a fair amount of time wrestling with optimization in various deep learning projects over the years, and extracting the effective learning rate is a crucial step for debugging and fine-tuning models. It's not always as straightforward as accessing a single variable. You might be surprised how often this surfaces as an issue. In my experience, I've noticed a pattern: people often assume the learning rate is static, set once at the beginning, but with adaptive optimizers like Adam or those using schedulers, the actual rate applied to the weights changes dynamically.

So, what does 'effective' learning rate actually mean here? It's the actual value being used to update the weights *at a particular iteration*. This distinction is key, especially when using advanced optimization techniques. It's not just what you initialized the optimizer with; it's the value after any modifications by schedulers. Let's unpack how to obtain this in pytorch, considering both scenarios—optimizers with and without schedulers.

First, the straightforward case: if you're *not* using a learning rate scheduler, the effective learning rate is simply the base learning rate assigned to the optimizer during its instantiation. You can access this through the optimizer's `param_groups`. Let me show you some quick code:

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

# Example Model
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1)

# Initializing the optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Accessing the learning rate
learning_rate = optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']
print(f"Initial Learning Rate: {learning_rate}")
```

In this example, the output would clearly print '0.01', which is our initial and effective learning rate if you are *not* using a scheduler. But here's where things get more involved. Most realistic deep learning setups include a scheduler which changes the learning rate according to some predefined logic, like reducing it during training or using cyclical methods. In these scenarios, the optimizer’s initial learning rate is no longer the *effective* rate, but we must take the scheduler modifications into account.

Now let's examine a scenario where a learning rate scheduler *is* being utilized. We will use the commonly employed `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR` to showcase what I mean. This scheduler reduces the learning rate by a given factor at fixed intervals.

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR

# Example Model
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1)

# Optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)

# StepLR scheduler. Will reduce by 0.1 every 3 steps
scheduler = StepLR(optimizer, step_size=3, gamma=0.1)

# Let's run a few optimization steps and show how it changes
for i in range(10):
    # Step of optimization, just a placeholder
    optimizer.step()
    
    # Current effective learning rate
    current_lr = optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']
    print(f"Step {i+1}, Current Learning Rate: {current_lr}")

    # Scheduler update needs to happen AFTER the optimizer step
    scheduler.step()
```

When you execute this, you will notice that after three steps the learning rate gets reduced by the specified `gamma`. The value of `current_lr` printed each time, however, is the actual effective rate used in that particular iteration. It's not the original `0.1` anymore, and it correctly reflects the modified rate from the scheduler.

This illustrates the dynamic nature of the effective learning rate with a scheduler. The scheduler manipulates the `lr` parameter within the optimizer's `param_groups` dynamically. So that is the actual value you should inspect.

Finally, let's consider a slightly more complex scenario using a custom learning rate scheduler. Though `StepLR` and its variants are very common, creating your own schedulers gives you more fine-grained control. Here's how we would track the effective learning rate with a hypothetical custom scheduler:

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

class CustomScheduler:
    def __init__(self, optimizer, initial_lr, decay_factor):
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        self.initial_lr = initial_lr
        self.decay_factor = decay_factor
        self.current_step = 0

    def step(self):
        self.current_step += 1
        new_lr = self.initial_lr / (1 + self.decay_factor * self.current_step)
        for param_group in self.optimizer.param_groups:
            param_group['lr'] = new_lr

    def get_lr(self):
        return self.optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']


# Example model
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1)
# Optimizer
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1.0)

# Custom scheduler
custom_scheduler = CustomScheduler(optimizer, initial_lr=1.0, decay_factor=0.1)

# Running and tracking the learning rate
for i in range(5):
    optimizer.step()
    custom_scheduler.step() # Note we step the scheduler before we get the learning rate this time
    effective_lr = custom_scheduler.get_lr()
    print(f"Step {i + 1}, effective_lr: {effective_lr}")

```

In this final example, `custom_scheduler.get_lr()` is the correct method to obtain the effective learning rate as it internally looks into the optimizer's `param_groups`.

In summary, to obtain the effective learning rate in PyTorch, access the `lr` key within the optimizer's `param_groups[0]`. If you're using a scheduler, do this *after* the scheduler's `step()` method is called (and, for clarity, the optimizer's `step()`, of course). The examples above cover the most common cases I’ve encountered over the years and should serve as a strong practical base for your own exploration of optimization.

For deeper understanding of optimization techniques, I would highly recommend "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Additionally, reading the original papers on specific optimizers like Adam or RMSProp will provide very valuable context. For a more practical look into applying these optimizers, the official PyTorch documentation itself is a treasure trove of useful examples. Understanding this underlying mechanism is essential for achieving stable and performant training. Good luck, and let me know if you have any other questions.
