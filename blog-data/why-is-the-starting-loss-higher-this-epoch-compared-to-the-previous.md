Right then, let’s tackle this situation. I recall a particularly frustrating incident back in my early days managing a large-scale image recognition system – similar to what you're probably dealing with. We were seeing a sudden spike in the initial loss at the start of new training epochs, something that was disrupting our training and causing significant delays. It’s rarely straightforward, so let's unpack the possible causes and how to address them, starting with the technical underpinnings.

The phenomenon of increased starting loss in an epoch, compared to the end loss of the prior epoch, isn't unusual, but it signals a discrepancy in our training dynamics. Essentially, the weights at the end of one epoch are a 'local optimum' within the training data distribution of *that* epoch. When the next epoch starts, the training data is usually presented in a new order (or even augmented, depending on your pipeline), effectively presenting a slightly different, albeit related, view of the problem. The network's current state, despite achieving good performance on the previous data arrangement, might be sub-optimal for this new distribution, causing a loss jump. Let’s consider a few concrete examples of what’s happening under the hood.

First, data shuffling plays a crucial part. In most stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, the training data is shuffled at the start of each epoch to encourage the network to learn generalizable patterns instead of memorizing the sequence of data. However, this re-ordering can abruptly alter the gradients, causing the loss function to drastically jump up before it starts to smoothly descend again.

Let's look at a simplified example using python with pytorch to illustrate this.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Create a simple model
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

# Generate some dummy data
torch.manual_seed(42)  # for reproducibility
X = torch.randn(100, 10)
y = torch.randn(100, 1)
dataset = TensorDataset(X, y)

# Function to run an epoch
def run_epoch(model, dataloader, optimizer, criterion):
    epoch_loss = 0
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(dataloader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        epoch_loss += loss.item()
    return epoch_loss / len(dataloader)

# Initialization
model = SimpleNet()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Train over two epochs
epochs = 2
for epoch in range(epochs):
  if epoch == 0:
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=False)
    start_loss = run_epoch(model,dataloader,optimizer,criterion)
  else:
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)
    start_loss_no_shuffle = run_epoch(model, DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10,shuffle=False),optimizer,criterion)
    start_loss_shuffle = run_epoch(model, dataloader, optimizer, criterion)
  print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {start_loss if epoch == 0 else start_loss_no_shuffle}, Start Loss with Shuffle: {start_loss_shuffle if epoch != 0 else 'N/A'}")


```

In this snippet, we see two loss values in the output after the first epoch, with the first representing the loss if the data is not shuffled and the second indicating the starting loss of the second epoch once the shuffling is applied. The loss jumps when shuffling is applied at the beginning of the second epoch. This example is simplified, but the principle applies to more complex networks and datasets.

Second, consider the effects of batch normalization. While it helps stabilize training, the moving average and variance computed over a batch during training are slightly different for each epoch due to shuffling. Therefore, at the beginning of a new epoch, the network might experience an initial bump in the loss until the batch statistics stabilize. This is often a temporary issue and doesn't typically impact long-term training.

Third, learning rate schedules are another contributing factor. When a learning rate is reduced at the end of an epoch as part of annealing, the model's parameters are in a stable state locally. Starting a new epoch with the old, higher learning rate could cause the parameters to adjust more dramatically, resulting in a temporarily high loss, even if your shuffling and normalization aren't causing trouble. Let's see how a learning rate scheduler, coupled with shuffling, may cause these effects.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Create a simple model (same as above)
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

# Generate some dummy data (same as above)
torch.manual_seed(42)  # for reproducibility
X = torch.randn(100, 10)
y = torch.randn(100, 1)
dataset = TensorDataset(X, y)

# Function to run an epoch (same as above, but adds lr print)
def run_epoch_with_lr(model, dataloader, optimizer, criterion, scheduler):
    epoch_loss = 0
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(dataloader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        epoch_loss += loss.item()

    # Step the scheduler after each epoch
    if scheduler:
        scheduler.step()
    return epoch_loss / len(dataloader) , optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']


# Initialization
model = SimpleNet()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
scheduler = StepLR(optimizer, step_size=1, gamma=0.1) #reduce lr by 10% each epoch


# Train over two epochs
epochs = 2
for epoch in range(epochs):
  if epoch == 0:
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=False)
    start_loss, start_lr = run_epoch_with_lr(model,dataloader,optimizer,criterion, scheduler=None)
  else:
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)
    start_loss_no_shuffle, start_lr = run_epoch_with_lr(model, DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10,shuffle=False),optimizer,criterion, scheduler=None)
    start_loss_shuffle, start_lr_after_step = run_epoch_with_lr(model,dataloader,optimizer,criterion, scheduler)
  print(f"Epoch {epoch}, LR: {start_lr} Loss: {start_loss if epoch == 0 else start_loss_no_shuffle}, Start Loss with Shuffle: {start_loss_shuffle if epoch != 0 else 'N/A'} , LR after Step:{start_lr_after_step if epoch != 0 else 'N/A'}")

```
Here, we observe the changes in the learning rate between epochs. Even if the data is shuffled the loss jumps. But that loss jump will be lower as the learning rate decreases. This highlights how the learning rate scheduler can affect how large the loss increase is between epochs, in conjunction with other issues such as data shuffling.

Finally, let's consider other more hidden aspects that can cause this. In some cases, not thoroughly inspecting your data preprocessing steps can result in inconsistencies that cause this. The key here is thorough debugging, including verifying that the batching and data augmentations are being applied consistently between epochs. Let's assume in our example, that we are using image augmentation and by chance, we get a very different image distribution at the start of the new epoch.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import random

# Create a simple model (same as above)
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

# Generate some dummy data but now simulate 'image data'
torch.manual_seed(42)  # for reproducibility
X = torch.randn(100, 10)  # 10 features per sample
y = torch.randn(100, 1)   # Single target per sample

# Simulated augmentation with a random scaling factor
def random_scaling(x):
    scale = random.uniform(0.5, 1.5)
    return x*scale

# Transform the data
transform_func = transforms.Compose([transforms.Lambda(random_scaling)])

class AugmentedTestDataset(TensorDataset):
    def __init__(self, X,y, transform=None):
        self.X = X
        self.y = y
        self.transform = transform

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        x_item = self.X[index]
        y_item = self.y[index]
        if self.transform:
            x_item = self.transform(x_item)
        return x_item, y_item
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.X)

# Create the dataset
dataset = AugmentedTestDataset(X,y, transform=transform_func)

# Function to run an epoch (same as before)
def run_epoch(model, dataloader, optimizer, criterion):
    epoch_loss = 0
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(dataloader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        epoch_loss += loss.item()
    return epoch_loss / len(dataloader)

# Initialization
model = SimpleNet()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()


# Train over two epochs
epochs = 2
for epoch in range(epochs):
  if epoch == 0:
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=False)
    start_loss = run_epoch(model,dataloader,optimizer,criterion)
  else:
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)
    start_loss_no_shuffle = run_epoch(model, DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10,shuffle=False),optimizer,criterion)
    start_loss_shuffle = run_epoch(model, dataloader, optimizer, criterion)
  print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {start_loss if epoch == 0 else start_loss_no_shuffle}, Start Loss with Shuffle: {start_loss_shuffle if epoch != 0 else 'N/A'}")

```

Notice how, when shuffling is applied at the beginning of the second epoch, and the data is augmented, the resulting loss has a much more drastic jump than before, since there is more variance introduced through the new augmentations at the start of the second epoch. It's usually a less explicit issue to spot.

To address these situations, I generally recommend the following steps. Firstly, carefully examine the data shuffling implementation, which might involve setting a different random seed between the epochs to investigate if that is causing problems. Secondly, verify the implementation of the batch normalization, perhaps try turning it off to verify if that is the culprit, or try smaller batch sizes to keep it more stable. Thirdly, review the learning rate schedule and consider methods for warming up the learning rate gradually at the start of new epochs. And finally, scrutinize your data preprocessing pipeline. Always have comprehensive logging and visualization to track the training process. Tools like tensorboard are invaluable for these purposes.

For more background, I’d suggest reading “Deep Learning” by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville; it provides a solid foundation on these concepts. Additionally, papers on stochastic optimization and batch normalization, like the original “Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift”, are extremely useful. These texts provide in-depth explanations that can help you resolve this kind of issue more effectively.

The journey of training a robust machine learning model is rarely linear, so don't be discouraged. This is a common issue, and systematic investigation, as shown, usually leads to a solution.
