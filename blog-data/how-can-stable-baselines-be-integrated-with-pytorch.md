Alright, let's tackle this. Integration between stable baselines and pytorch can certainly present a few interesting challenges, primarily because stable baselines is inherently built on tensorflow, and pytorch has its own architecture and way of doing things. I've personally encountered this during a project involving developing a novel reinforcement learning agent for a robotics simulation environment. The initial setup used stable baselines due to its ease of use and pre-implemented algorithms, but the project's deep learning modules were already in pytorch and, naturally, we wanted to consolidate onto a single framework. Here’s the breakdown of how you can achieve this, using both practical workarounds and more involved re-implementation strategies.

First, it's vital to understand that a direct, seamless ‘plug-and-play’ integration isn't usually possible due to the core frameworks being distinct. However, you can use a layered approach, focusing on interoperability at the data and model levels. We can broadly categorize the integration into three main strategies, each with its specific use cases:

1. **Data Exchange via Numpy/Pickling:** This is the simplest approach for transferring data between stable baselines' environment interactions and pytorch's model training. In this method, instead of changing how stable baselines operates, we focus on data manipulation for our pytorch model. We extract samples (observations, actions, rewards) as numpy arrays from stable baselines’ `env.step()` outputs, or from a custom environment wrapper, and then convert them into pytorch tensors when required. Here's how this can be done, focusing on an environment wrapper:

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
import torch
from torch import nn
from stable_baselines3 import A2C

class TorchEnvironmentWrapper(gym.Wrapper):
    """Wraps a stable baselines environment and converts numpy arrays to tensors."""
    def __init__(self, env):
        super(TorchEnvironmentWrapper, self).__init__(env)

    def step(self, action):
        action = np.array(action) # Convert back to numpy if necessary
        obs, reward, done, info = self.env.step(action)
        obs = torch.tensor(obs, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)
        reward = torch.tensor(reward, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)
        return obs, reward, done, info


#Example Usage
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
wrapped_env = TorchEnvironmentWrapper(env)
model = A2C('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=0)
model.learn(total_timesteps=1000)


# In a pytorch training loop:
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

input_size = wrapped_env.observation_space.shape[0]
hidden_size = 128
output_size = wrapped_env.action_space.n
pytorch_model = SimpleModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)

# You would now extract data from the wrapped environment and
# use the pytorch model for specific policy predictions.

obs, reward, done, info = wrapped_env.step(model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)[0])
action = pytorch_model(obs) # Use pytorch model to generate an action (example)
print(action)
```

This approach works well when you have a relatively stable environment with which you are only interested in interacting. It’s less ideal when you want more control over how the model is trained, or if you’re looking to leverage pytorch’s optimization framework.

2. **Policy Network Replacement:** If you want to control the policy network training, you could replace the stable baselines’ policy network with a custom pytorch model. This involves digging into the stable baselines library internals, which may require more understanding of the library structure. The general idea is to intercept the default policy, either during or after learning, and replace it with your equivalent PyTorch implementation. This is an intermediary approach that allows you to leverage stable baselines for environment management, and then introduce pytorch for the critical parts, like the value function and policy updates. Here's a minimal example, showing just the model policy part replacement:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from stable_baselines3 import A2C
from stable_baselines3.common.env_util import make_vec_env
from stable_baselines3.common.policies import ActorCriticPolicy

class CustomTorchPolicy(ActorCriticPolicy):
  def __init__(self, observation_space, action_space, lr_schedule, **kwargs):
        super(CustomTorchPolicy, self).__init__(observation_space, action_space, lr_schedule, **kwargs)
        self.actor = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(observation_space.shape[0], 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, action_space.n)
        )
        self.critic = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(observation_space.shape[0], 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 1)
        )


  def _predict(self, observation, deterministic: bool = False):
      x = torch.tensor(observation, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)
      logits = self.actor(x)
      probs = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
      if deterministic:
        action = torch.argmax(probs).cpu().numpy()
      else:
        action = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1).cpu().numpy()
      return action, None


  def _get_value(self, observation):
      x = torch.tensor(observation, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)
      return self.critic(x)


# Create vectorized environment (for speed)
env = make_vec_env("CartPole-v1", n_envs=1)

# Use custom policy instead of default one.
model = A2C(CustomTorchPolicy, env, verbose=0)
model.learn(total_timesteps=1000)

obs = env.reset()
action, _ = model.predict(obs)
print(f"Action taken: {action}")

```

This strategy requires a deeper understanding of stable baselines but offers more control over the learning process. It is particularly useful if you want to integrate pytorch-specific functionalities, or specific training methods. It does, however, carry some complexity, as you must ensure the policy replacement is compatible with the chosen stable baselines algorithm.

3. **Full Re-implementation (Pytorch-Native RL):** This approach is the most involved, but provides full control. In this method, you bypass stable baselines altogether and write the entire reinforcement learning loop in pytorch directly. This gives you total control over policy optimization and the RL training loop, which allows for maximum flexibility. This is typically something you'd consider when developing bespoke RL systems, or want access to the lower-level details of the algorithm. This method can significantly increase the development time but offers the highest performance and customization opportunities. Here's an example of a simplified policy network class:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import gym
import numpy as np

class SimplePolicy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, hidden_dim=128):
        super(SimplePolicy, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, action_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

def train_policy(env, policy, optimizer, episodes=1000, gamma=0.99):
    for episode in range(episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        rewards = []
        states = []
        actions = []

        while not done:
            states.append(state)
            state_tensor = torch.tensor(state, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)
            action_probs = torch.softmax(policy(state_tensor), dim=1)
            action = torch.multinomial(action_probs, 1).item()
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            actions.append(action)
            rewards.append(reward)
            state = next_state
        # Implement policy gradient
        discounted_rewards = []
        for t, r in enumerate(rewards):
           discounted_rewards.append(sum(r * gamma**i for i, r in enumerate(rewards[t:])))
        discounted_rewards = torch.tensor(discounted_rewards, dtype=torch.float32)
        states = torch.tensor(states, dtype=torch.float32)
        actions = torch.tensor(actions, dtype=torch.long)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        log_probs = torch.log_softmax(policy(states), dim=1)
        selected_log_probs = log_probs.gather(1, actions.unsqueeze(1)).squeeze(1)
        loss = -(discounted_rewards * selected_log_probs).mean()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        print(f"Episode {episode}, total reward: {sum(rewards)}")
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]
action_dim = env.action_space.n

policy = SimplePolicy(state_dim, action_dim)
optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=0.001)
train_policy(env, policy, optimizer)
```

In conclusion, selecting the correct approach depends entirely on your project requirements. If all you need is data interoperability with a stable baselines system, the first method will be adequate. If you intend to leverage pytorch's core deep learning facilities in a more targeted fashion, the second may be a strong candidate. For deep customization or situations where you have full freedom of the underlying training loops, the third option may be the most suitable. Resources like the PyTorch documentation itself and the book "Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On" by Maxim Lapan are valuable resources for diving deeper into these integration strategies and implementing them effectively. Understanding these methods should allow for robust, flexible integration between stable baselines and pytorch based systems.
