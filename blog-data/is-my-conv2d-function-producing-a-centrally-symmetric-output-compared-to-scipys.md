Okay, let's tackle this. It's something I’ve definitely bumped into before, specifically back when I was optimizing some custom CNN layers for a research project. The issue of unexpected symmetry in convolution outputs can stem from several subtle differences in implementation details. It’s not always immediately apparent, so let’s break it down systematically.

Your core question, as I understand it, is whether your custom 2D convolution implementation is generating a result that exhibits central symmetry when compared to the output from `scipy.signal.convolve2d`, and specifically, if this is unintended or not. This usually points to how padding, stride, and kernel application are handled, particularly with regards to boundary conditions. SciPy's convolution function is meticulously implemented and therefore serves as a dependable benchmark.

The key to understanding a possible discrepancy lies within how both implementations treat the edges of the input matrix. If you apply padding, and particularly if your padding is *not* symmetric, or if you're using a non-standard kernel origin, you can get output that appears skewed or, as you're observing, symmetrically biased, depending on the specifics of the operations. In SciPy's `convolve2d`, the default mode is 'full', which implies output sizes larger than the input, incorporating the impact of the kernel extending beyond the original input. The default behavior includes implicit zero padding, although this can be altered. Your own implementation may, or may not, behave equivalently.

Here's a breakdown of key points to check in your code:

1. **Padding strategy:** Is your padding symmetric? Are you adding zeros, or using some form of replication, reflection, or circular padding? The 'full' mode of SciPy expands the output dimensions. Ensure your custom function does the equivalent. If you are using, say, only left-side padding, and SciPy uses balanced padding (e.g. 'same' mode, which calculates padding to return an output the same size as input for stride 1), your result *will* be different.

2. **Kernel Origin/Anchor:** This is less obvious. SciPy, like most convolution operations, assumes that the center of the kernel is the 'anchor'. If your implementation doesn't maintain the center as the anchor or if you are flipping the kernel, you would get some strange, yet deterministic, results, often symmetric, relative to what you'd expect.

3. **Stride and Dilation:** Ensure both your implementation and your reference (SciPy) are using the same stride and dilation values (if any). In the absence of any specified stride in scipy, the default is 1.

4. **Data Type Precision:** Although not a direct cause for symmetry, precision difference can create differences. SciPy uses double-precision floating point by default. Your implementation might be using single-precision. Although this is unlikely to cause symmetry, it might cause *different* results, which could *appear* symmetric with respect to the reference due to how rounding errors propagate.

Let's examine a few code snippets to help elucidate these points. I'll use Python for demonstration, as it's a language common to many of us.

**Example 1: Mismatch in Padding Strategies**

In this example, I'll simulate a custom convolution without a specific padding strategy, and compare it to Scipy's default behavior of ‘full’ mode, which implies zero padding:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import convolve2d

def custom_convolve2d_no_padding(input_matrix, kernel):
    input_rows, input_cols = input_matrix.shape
    kernel_rows, kernel_cols = kernel.shape
    output_rows = input_rows + kernel_rows -1  # size for 'full' output without explicit padding
    output_cols = input_cols + kernel_cols -1
    output_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))

    for i in range(output_rows):
        for j in range(output_cols):
            for k_row in range(kernel_rows):
                for k_col in range(kernel_cols):
                    input_row_index = i - k_row
                    input_col_index = j - k_col
                    if (0 <= input_row_index < input_rows and
                         0 <= input_col_index < input_cols):
                        output_matrix[i, j] += (input_matrix[input_row_index, input_col_index] *
                                                   kernel[k_row, k_col])
    return output_matrix

# test it out
input_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
kernel = np.array([[1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1]])
custom_output = custom_convolve2d_no_padding(input_matrix, kernel)
scipy_output = convolve2d(input_matrix, kernel, mode='full')
print("Custom Output:\n", custom_output)
print("SciPy Output:\n", scipy_output)
print("Are they equal? ", np.array_equal(custom_output, scipy_output))
```

In this scenario, `custom_convolve2d_no_padding` emulates `scipy.signal.convolve2d` when `mode='full'` using the `input_rows + kernel_rows - 1` size output and careful iteration over the kernel and the input. It shows how to implement convolution correctly if no padding is explicitly done. In particular, the size of the output reflects what the 'full' mode implies. If you were to skip creating a padded matrix, and simply iterate the kernel and input, your result will look different, often symmetrically different to this.

**Example 2: Incorrect Kernel Application**

Here, we will show an incorrect way to apply the kernel. Suppose our implementation incorrectly applies the kernel in a non-standard fashion – it’s reversed. This results in a different output, which might demonstrate an unexpected symmetry relative to SciPy's output.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import convolve2d

def custom_convolve2d_incorrect_kernel(input_matrix, kernel):
    input_rows, input_cols = input_matrix.shape
    kernel_rows, kernel_cols = kernel.shape
    output_rows = input_rows + kernel_rows - 1
    output_cols = input_cols + kernel_cols - 1
    output_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))

    for i in range(output_rows):
        for j in range(output_cols):
            for k_row in range(kernel_rows):
                for k_col in range(kernel_cols):
                    input_row_index = i - k_row
                    input_col_index = j - k_col
                    if (0 <= input_row_index < input_rows and
                        0 <= input_col_index < input_cols):
                        # Incorrect Kernel Application: reverse k row and k col indexes
                        output_matrix[i, j] += (input_matrix[input_row_index, input_col_index] *
                                                   kernel[kernel_rows-1 -k_row, kernel_cols-1 -k_col])
    return output_matrix

# test it out
input_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
kernel = np.array([[1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1]])
custom_output = custom_convolve2d_incorrect_kernel(input_matrix, kernel)
scipy_output = convolve2d(input_matrix, kernel, mode='full')
print("Custom Output:\n", custom_output)
print("SciPy Output:\n", scipy_output)
print("Are they equal? ", np.array_equal(custom_output, scipy_output))

```

Here, the core mistake is indexing the kernel in reverse `kernel[kernel_rows-1 -k_row, kernel_cols-1 -k_col]`. This makes the result mirror the expected one across the output. This is another source of symmetry issues, but this is caused by incorrect implementation and incorrect handling of the kernel coordinates, not inherent properties of the convolution operation.

**Example 3: Correct Implementation**

This is a correct, but more explicit version of the same padding and convolution strategy used by `scipy.signal.convolve2d(...,mode='full')`:
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import convolve2d

def custom_convolve2d_correct(input_matrix, kernel):
    input_rows, input_cols = input_matrix.shape
    kernel_rows, kernel_cols = kernel.shape
    output_rows = input_rows + kernel_rows - 1
    output_cols = input_cols + kernel_cols - 1

    # Explicit Zero Padding
    padded_input = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))
    padded_input[0:input_rows, 0:input_cols] = input_matrix


    output_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))

    for i in range(output_rows):
        for j in range(output_cols):
            for k_row in range(kernel_rows):
                for k_col in range(kernel_cols):
                   output_matrix[i, j] += (padded_input[i - (kernel_rows - 1 - k_row), j - (kernel_cols - 1 - k_col)] * kernel[k_row, k_col])
    return output_matrix
# test it out
input_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
kernel = np.array([[1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1]])
custom_output = custom_convolve2d_correct(input_matrix, kernel)
scipy_output = convolve2d(input_matrix, kernel, mode='full')
print("Custom Output:\n", custom_output)
print("SciPy Output:\n", scipy_output)
print("Are they equal? ", np.array_equal(custom_output, scipy_output))
```

This example highlights the need to have a good grasp of how the kernel is applied and how the size of the output is calculated, as well as the padding strategy. In fact, it is usually implemented by padding the input before applying the kernel directly in the output matrix space. Note this version uses `(kernel_rows - 1 - k_row), j - (kernel_cols - 1 - k_col)` so it is consistent with how the SciPy function behaves.

For deeper understanding, I would strongly recommend the following resources:

*   **"Digital Image Processing" by Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods:** This is a foundational text in image processing and covers convolution in detail, including the impact of different padding and boundary conditions.
*   **"Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications" by Richard Szeliski:** This offers a more comprehensive view of computer vision techniques and includes a solid overview of convolution in different contexts, focusing on practical application and implementation strategies.
*   **The documentation for `scipy.signal`:** The official documentation for SciPy provides extremely specific and accurate information on how its convolution functions operate. When in doubt, that's always a great place to look.

In conclusion, when dealing with such issues, pay close attention to the subtleties in how padding is applied, the kernel's origin and application, and the resulting output size calculation. You need to ensure that the custom and reference implementations operate on identical or logically equivalent principles, particularly with regard to boundary handling. It's often the details that make all the difference.
