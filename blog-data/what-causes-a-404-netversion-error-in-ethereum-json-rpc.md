Alright, let’s delve into this. Encountering a 404 net_version error in an ethereum json rpc call can be a bit perplexing, especially when you're expecting everything to just…work. I've spent my fair share of time debugging these, and they're rarely as straightforward as they seem. The "404" part might lead you to believe it's a typical 'not found' issue like a broken web link, but in the context of an ethereum node, it’s more nuanced. At its core, the error means the rpc endpoint you’re trying to reach either doesn't exist, or, and this is crucial, it's not enabled within the specific ethereum node’s configuration.

Let's break this down. The `net_version` rpc call is designed to return the network ID of the ethereum node you're connecting to. For example, the mainnet has a network id of 1, the ropsten testnet has 3, and goerli has 5. If you query an endpoint that either doesn't implement this call, or, as often happens, has it disabled, you'll get that infuriating 404. It isn't about the data *itself* not existing, but rather the specific rpc method not being accessible on the target node.

Now, consider a few likely scenarios I’ve faced in the past. Firstly, it could be a configuration oversight. Back in my early days with geth, I remember deploying a local development node. I'd set it up with minimal flags, focusing mainly on the core functionality. However, by default, several rpc methods are not exposed over the http or websocket interface. You have to explicitly enable them. If `net_version` isn't explicitly whitelisted, you will face this error, plain and simple. This is a security measure; you wouldn't want every rpc method exposed to the entire internet, would you?

Another situation involves using older or outdated node software. Some older client implementations might have inconsistencies in their rpc implementations. This doesn't often happen with the major clients like geth or parity/openethereum, but if you are dealing with lesser known clients or running very old versions, this is a distinct possibility. I've had a particularly memorable incident with a custom private blockchain where the rpc spec was not entirely aligned with established standards.

The third likely culprit, and this is often the trickiest to debug, is a misconfiguration at the network level. Sometimes it appears as though everything should be working locally, but the node is actually blocked or has a firewall rule that prevents external access to this specific endpoint. It is not enough for your node to be working correctly; the client attempting to connect to it also needs to be able to successfully connect *and* have access to the exposed interface.

Okay, let’s make this concrete. Here are three code examples to show these points in action, keeping it simple so we can focus on the rpc call itself.

**Example 1: Correct JSON RPC Call (Assuming the endpoint is properly configured)**

This first example shows what a correct call *would* look like, and how the response should appear, assuming the target node has the method enabled. This is using python with the `requests` library.

```python
import requests
import json

url = "http://localhost:8545" # Replace with your node's rpc endpoint
headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}
payload = {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "net_version",
    "params": [],
    "id": 1
}

try:
    response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
    if 'result' in data:
        print(f"Network ID: {data['result']}")
    elif 'error' in data:
        print(f"Error: {data['error']}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Request error: {e}")
```

A successful response would look something like:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": "1"
}
```

**Example 2: Incorrect Call - 404 Scenario (Method Not Enabled)**

Let's simulate the scenario where the `net_version` method is explicitly disabled on the node. In reality, you'd need to configure your node to disable this call. We are using the same python code but assuming this time the server will not allow the call. In this case, we'll still get a json response but it will indicate an error.

```python
import requests
import json

url = "http://localhost:8545" # Same url, but assumed configuration
headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}
payload = {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "net_version",
    "params": [],
    "id": 1
}

try:
    response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes
    data = response.json()
    print(data)

    if 'error' in data:
         if data['error']['code'] == -32601:
              print("Error: Method not found")

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Request error: {e}")

```

Here, the server will respond with a -32601 code (method not found). While this error is not strictly a 404, in practice many rpc implementations will return a standard 404 http code for a missing method, and that's what you will often see. The critical point is that the method is not recognized by the endpoint.

**Example 3: Incorrect Call - Network Issue (Node Unreachable or Firewall)**

Finally, let's simulate a network issue. This could be a firewall blocking the request or if the server is not accessible from our client.

```python
import requests
import json

url = "http://some.unreachable.host:8545" # Example unreachable address
headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}
payload = {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "net_version",
    "params": [],
    "id": 1
}

try:
    response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers, timeout=5)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes
    data = response.json()
    print(data)

    if 'result' in data:
        print(f"Network ID: {data['result']}")
    elif 'error' in data:
        print(f"Error: {data['error']}")

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Request error: {e}")
```

In this case, the exception handler will likely catch an error indicating the inability to connect to the server at the specified address. While this is not a direct 404 from the rpc, the result is a failure to access the endpoint. Again, you may see a 404 response code in the http response depending on the server configuration.

For further reading, I'd strongly suggest consulting the official ethereum json rpc documentation. While it doesn't detail every single error scenario, it provides the definitive description of each method and its expected behavior. In particular, review the official "JSON RPC API" on the ethereum.org site, for method specifications, which helps clarify if this method should be part of your client endpoint. Also, dive into the source code for your client of choice (geth, parity, etc.) as it contains the most precise details on configuration options for the rpc interface.

Debugging these sorts of issues involves carefully examining the rpc configuration of your node, checking if the rpc methods are properly enabled, verifying the node's network connectivity, and confirming that you are using the correct rpc calls. I have found that systematic troubleshooting, step-by-step, is the key to resolving these issues. Don’t assume it's a problem with your application code until you’ve ruled out the other possibilities.
