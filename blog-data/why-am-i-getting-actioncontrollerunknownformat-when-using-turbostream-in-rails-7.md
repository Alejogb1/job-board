Alright, let's dive into this. The `ActionController::UnknownFormat` exception when dealing with turbo streams in Rails 7 is a relatively common hiccup, and it usually boils down to how your controller is handling request formats. I’ve certainly encountered it a few times in my projects over the years, often when integrating with JavaScript frameworks or modifying existing applications to leverage turbo.

Fundamentally, Rails controllers are designed to respond to different request formats, such as `html`, `json`, or `xml`. When a browser makes a standard request, it typically sends an `Accept` header indicating what type of content it can handle, often defaulting to `text/html`. Turbo streams, however, introduce a new format, `text/vnd.turbo-stream.html`, which is how the server pushes updates to the client. The `UnknownFormat` error arises when your controller doesn’t know how to respond to this specific format. Essentially, you’re missing a `respond_to` block that includes the `turbo_stream` format, or your routing is misconfigured.

In my experience, the most common scenario involves a controller action designed primarily for full HTML rendering, which then gets suddenly hit by a Turbo-driven request expecting a stream. The controller simply isn’t equipped to understand the request’s format and therefore throws the error. Let me illustrate this with a couple of examples.

Let's say you have a fairly standard `PostsController` and a `create` action. Here's what a potentially problematic implementation might look like:

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @post = Post.new(post_params)
    if @post.save
      redirect_to @post, notice: 'Post was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private
  def post_params
    params.require(:post).permit(:title, :content)
  end
end
```

If you’re submitting a form via Turbo, this code will not work; it’s not set up to handle `turbo_stream` format. When Turbo performs a form submission, the browser sends an `Accept` header with `text/vnd.turbo-stream.html`, rather than `text/html`. This controller expects an `html` response and thus generates an `ActionController::UnknownFormat` error, because it doesn't know what to do with this new stream format.

To fix this, we need to modify the controller to correctly handle the `turbo_stream` format, which you can accomplish using `respond_to`. This provides a structured method for handling different mime types that is consistent with Rails conventions. Here's a corrected version:

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @post = Post.new(post_params)
    if @post.save
      respond_to do |format|
        format.html { redirect_to @post, notice: 'Post was successfully created.' }
        format.turbo_stream {
          render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.append('posts', partial: 'posts/post', locals: { post: @post })
        }
      end
    else
      respond_to do |format|
        format.html { render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity }
        format.turbo_stream { render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.replace('new_post_form', partial: 'posts/form', locals: { post: @post}) }
      end
    end
  end

  private
  def post_params
    params.require(:post).permit(:title, :content)
  end
end
```

In this revised version, the `respond_to` block checks the requested format. If it's an `html` request, the controller executes the standard `redirect_to`. But if it's `turbo_stream`, it renders a turbo stream response. In this case, after saving a new post, it uses turbo streams to append the new post to a container element with an ID of `posts`. Additionally, the rendering of the form when there are errors now also handles turbo streams, replacing the form in the page with a new form instance with the previously entered form values.

Another common scenario is when you have a controller action intended to respond with a JSON format and you’re now attempting to use turbo within that same action. You might have something like this:

```ruby
# app/controllers/api/users_controller.rb
class Api::UsersController < ApplicationController
  def update
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
    if @user.update(user_params)
      render json: { message: 'User updated successfully' }, status: :ok
    else
      render json: { errors: @user.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private
  def user_params
     params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
   end
end
```
If you try to submit a form via Turbo to update a user, you'll be met with the `UnknownFormat` exception. The code above is designed to render JSON, it isn’t prepared to render turbo streams.

To resolve this, you should add the `turbo_stream` format to the `respond_to` block, like so:

```ruby
# app/controllers/api/users_controller.rb
class Api::UsersController < ApplicationController
  def update
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
    if @user.update(user_params)
      respond_to do |format|
        format.json { render json: { message: 'User updated successfully' }, status: :ok }
        format.turbo_stream {
          render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.update(@user, partial: 'api/users/user', locals: { user: @user })
        }
      end
    else
      respond_to do |format|
        format.json { render json: { errors: @user.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity }
        format.turbo_stream {
          render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.replace('user_form', partial: 'api/users/form', locals: { user: @user })
        }
      end
    end
  end

  private
  def user_params
     params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
   end
end

```

Here, the controller will render JSON when the request has `application/json` as an accepted format, and a turbo stream when `text/vnd.turbo-stream.html` is the accepted format, updating the user's corresponding element on the page after updating the user. Similarly, if there are validation issues, the form is updated with the error messages.

To avoid confusion, especially in complex applications, it’s useful to be consistent in how you handle formats across controllers. You should also double-check your form submission configuration. If you’re manually specifying the format for submission, make sure it matches what your controller expects. For forms submitted via Turbo's `turbo_frame_tag` or `turbo_stream_from`, the format should be handled automatically, however, it's important to verify you’ve not added any manual form options that are sending incorrect headers.

For a deeper understanding, I highly recommend diving into the official Rails guides, particularly the sections on routing and `ActionController::MimeResponds`. Also, check out the documentation for Hotwire and Turbo. "Agile Web Development with Rails 7" is an excellent book that covers these concepts in detail. Furthermore, "Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide" will provide you a foundational understanding of the Ruby language and how it interacts with Rails. Also, the Rails API documentation (guides.rubyonrails.org) has a robust section on ActionController and its response strategies. Understanding these components and how they interact is key to debugging and handling format mismatches.

In summary, `ActionController::UnknownFormat` errors with turbo streams are usually a result of the controller not being explicitly configured to handle `text/vnd.turbo-stream.html` requests. Ensure your controllers utilize `respond_to` blocks to explicitly handle different formats, and double-check your request headers. With these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and keep your Turbo-powered application running smoothly.
