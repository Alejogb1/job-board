Okay, let's delve into this. From my years navigating various database architectures, I've certainly encountered this question more times than I can count, and sometimes, even scratched my head myself over specific implementations. The reason MongoDB sometimes stores date values as strings rather than using its native `Date` type often isn't about a fundamental limitation of MongoDB itself, but rather stems from a combination of factors related to data ingestion, application-level logic, and legacy system integration. It's less a “best practice” and more often a pragmatic compromise.

The simple answer is that when you're dealing with data from myriad sources, not everything arrives neatly packaged as a native date object. I’ve seen this happen repeatedly with APIs that, due to legacy constraints or other considerations, primarily output string representations of dates. Similarly, flat files, CSVs, and other data sources that might be ingested often express date and time information as text. Imagine a situation where a large enterprise application pulls data from numerous third-party services, each with its own peculiar ways of representing dates—some might use ISO 8601 strings, others might employ custom formats, and yet others might even include timezone information in unexpected places. It's a data integration challenge, and in those scenarios, it’s sometimes easier, initially, to just treat everything as a string until a later normalization step.

A core issue surfaces when you start dealing with dates that are inconsistent—meaning some are timestamps, some are in ‘mm/dd/yyyy’ format, and some are in ‘yyyy-mm-dd’. If MongoDB were to attempt a blanket conversion to its native `Date` type upon ingestion, it might fail silently or worse, might corrupt or misinterpret date values. That's a situation nobody wants. Storing these initial dates as strings at least preserves the raw data as it arrived.

Another angle to consider is the application layer's interaction with the database. If your application framework or programming language doesn't have robust, well-tested date parsing mechanisms or you're working with a mixed technology environment, it can actually be simpler and more predictable to manipulate dates as strings initially, and only convert to native date objects when strictly necessary. I once worked on a system that integrated a Python backend with a legacy Java application. Directing Java to use the string versions, then doing all datetime conversions in the python portion of the application, made the entire system less error prone during the migration.

Now, let's illustrate this with some code snippets. Note these are simplified for demonstration, but they reflect common real-world scenarios.

**Example 1: Data Ingestion from a CSV**

Let’s imagine you're ingesting data from a CSV where dates are stored in various formats.

```javascript
const csvData = [
  { id: 1, event: 'start', date: '2024-10-26' },
  { id: 2, event: 'end', date: '10/26/2024' },
  { id: 3, event: 'midpoint', date: 'October 26, 2024' }
];

const documents = csvData.map(item => ({
    _id: item.id,
    event: item.event,
    date_string: item.date // storing it as string initially
}));


// When inserting into mongo, the date remains a string.
// db.collection.insertMany(documents)
// output would be:
// [{ _id: 1, event: 'start', date_string: '2024-10-26' },
//   { _id: 2, event: 'end', date_string: '10/26/2024' },
//   { _id: 3, event: 'midpoint', date_string: 'October 26, 2024' }]

```

Here, we’re mapping the CSV data and explicitly store the date as a string, `date_string`, without any attempt to force it into a date object. This demonstrates how we can store the initial data 'as-is' before attempting later normalisation.

**Example 2: Lazy Date Conversion in Application Logic**

Let's look at how we can then convert the strings to dates at the application level, for example using javascript, while querying the database.

```javascript

const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017"; // Replace with your connection string
const client = new MongoClient(uri);

async function main() {
    try {
        await client.connect();
        const database = client.db('my_database'); // Replace with your database name
        const collection = database.collection('my_collection');

        const documents = await collection.find().toArray();
        // Process the documents.
        documents.forEach(doc => {
            if (doc.date_string) {
                let dateValue = new Date(doc.date_string);
                // now we can work with a date object
                console.log(dateValue.getFullYear()); // Access date object properties,
             }
        });
    } finally {
        await client.close();
    }
}
main().catch(console.error);
```

In this snippet, we retrieve the documents and only convert the 'date_string' to a date value when it's being used in the javascript application, demonstrating how you can move the parsing logic into your application instead of at the data ingestion level. We avoid potential parsing errors and instead implement that logic explicitly.

**Example 3: Aggregation with `$dateFromString`**

MongoDB itself provides an aggregation operator to perform conversions on strings that have a date like structure, the `$dateFromString` operator, which can be quite useful when you need to perform date based computations or filtrations, but the data was originally ingested as a string.

```javascript
// Example of using the dateFromString Aggregation operator
db.collection.aggregate([
    {
        $addFields: {
            date_object: {
                $dateFromString: {
                    dateString: "$date_string",
                }
            }
        }
    },
    {
        $match: {
            date_object: {$gte: new Date("2024-10-26T00:00:00.000Z")}
        }
    },
    {
        $project:{
            _id: 1,
            event: 1,
            date_object: 1
        }
    }
]);
// output would be:
// [{ _id: 1, event: 'start', date_object: ISODate("2024-10-26T00:00:00Z") },
//  { _id: 2, event: 'end', date_object: ISODate("2024-10-26T00:00:00Z") },
//  { _id: 3, event: 'midpoint', date_object: ISODate("2024-10-26T00:00:00Z") }]

```

This query shows how we can dynamically convert those strings to native dates for data processing and filtering within the aggregation pipeline. This way, we retain the flexibility of dealing with raw data while still gaining the power to perform date-based operations when necessary.

For further understanding, I would highly suggest exploring resources like “MongoDB: The Definitive Guide” by Kristina Chodorow and Michael Dirolf. Additionally, studying specific date handling in various programming languages you work with would be beneficial. Finally, looking into the ISO 8601 specification will help grasp the standards related to date representation.

In conclusion, while it might seem suboptimal on the surface to store dates as strings in MongoDB, it's often a strategic and necessary approach when dealing with diverse data sources. It gives you the flexibility to normalize, validate, and convert data at a suitable point in your pipeline, without risking data loss or corruption. The decision, as it so often does, comes down to balancing data integrity and operational efficiency with application-specific requirements.
