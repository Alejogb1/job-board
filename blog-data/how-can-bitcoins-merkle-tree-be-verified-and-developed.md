, let’s tackle this. I've seen a few implementations go sideways over the years, so I'm glad to walk through a structured approach to verifying and developing bitcoin’s Merkle tree. It's a critical component for the system’s scalability and security, so getting it correct is paramount.

Fundamentally, a merkle tree is a data structure used to efficiently verify data integrity. In the context of bitcoin, it’s used to summarise transactions within a block. Rather than broadcasting every transaction to every node, a single merkle root is included in the block header. This root summarises all transactions in a way that allows anyone to prove a specific transaction exists without needing the entire transaction list.

Verification, in this context, essentially means proving that a specific transaction is included in the block without needing to download every single transaction. This relies on what is commonly called a ‘merkle proof’. It's essentially a path, consisting of intermediary hashes, from your transaction hash to the Merkle root.

Let's say a simplified Merkle tree contains just four transactions (T1, T2, T3, and T4). First, you’d hash each transaction. Then, you would hash the concatenation of the first two hashes (H1,2) and likewise for the last two (H3,4). Finally, you’d hash these two resulting hashes to get the final Merkle root (H1,2,3,4).

To prove that, for instance, T1 is included, we don't need T2, T3, or T4 but rather H2, H3,4. By hashing T1 then combining that hash (H1) with H2, then combining result with H3,4 the result should equal the merkle root (H1,2,3,4).

This process is verifiable because hashing is deterministic. If any part of the data has been tampered with, the final hash will not match the stated Merkle root.

Now, for some code examples. First, let’s write a simple python function to hash using SHA256, and which is used throughout our examples:

```python
import hashlib

def hash_data(data):
    """Hashes data using SHA256 and returns hex string"""
    if isinstance(data, str):
        data = data.encode('utf-8')
    return hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
```
This helper function will be useful when constructing the next examples. It is very important for the security of bitcoin that this function is cryptographically sound and that SHA256 is not weakened.

Next we will implement a basic Merkle tree building function and one to generate the proof for a specific transaction. We’ll keep this function simplistic, using a list of string transaction IDs as input. In a live setting, you would be dealing with byte sequences for transactions, but using strings for this example makes it easier to understand. This function will recursively hash the transaction hashes into an ordered Merkle tree, producing the required merkle root:

```python
def build_merkle_tree(transactions):
    """Builds a merkle tree from a list of transactions. Returns the root and the tree."""
    if not transactions:
        return None, None

    hashes = [hash_data(tx) for tx in transactions]
    if len(hashes) == 1:
       return hashes[0], [hashes] #return the root hash if single hash

    layers = [hashes]

    while len(layers[-1]) > 1:
        layer = layers[-1]
        next_layer = []
        for i in range(0, len(layer), 2):
          if i + 1 < len(layer):
            next_layer.append(hash_data(layer[i] + layer[i+1]))
          else:
            next_layer.append(layer[i])
        layers.append(next_layer)

    return layers[-1][0], layers
```
This `build_merkle_tree` function takes the list of transaction IDs and constructs the tree bottom-up. If there are an odd number of elements in a layer, the last element is simply copied to the next layer. It is critical that the function correctly handles an odd number of elements, as this is a practical problem often missed during initial implementation. This can be seen in line 14, where we handle the case where there is only one hash in the current layer.

Finally, here is the function to provide the merkle proof of a single transaction:

```python
def get_merkle_proof(transactions, target_tx, tree):
    """Provides a merkle proof for a target transaction in the tree."""
    target_hash = hash_data(target_tx)

    proof = []
    found = False

    for layer in tree[:-1]: #Exclude the root
        try:
          index = layer.index(target_hash)
          found = True
        except ValueError:
           pass #Target not found in this layer, continue searching
        if found:
            if index % 2 == 0: # If index is even, take the hash to the right
               if index + 1 < len(layer):
                  proof.append(layer[index+1])
               else:
                  proof.append(None) # If the even number was the last, append None as there is no sibling hash to add
            else: # If index is odd, take the hash to the left
                 proof.append(layer[index-1])
            target_hash = hash_data(target_hash + proof[-1]) if proof[-1] else hash_data(target_hash) #Combine hash with proof or copy the hash if no proof
            found = False #Reset found for the next layer
    return proof
```

The `get_merkle_proof` function returns the list of intermediary hashes needed to prove the target transaction exists. This is not a copy-and-paste function, but gives a basis to build a working proofing system. It is important to note, that the function returns none where there was no sibling. This is because, in an odd-numbered list, the final node can not have a sibling.

To use these functions, you could do something like this:

```python
transactions = ['tx1', 'tx2', 'tx3', 'tx4', 'tx5']
root, tree = build_merkle_tree(transactions)
target_transaction = 'tx3'
proof = get_merkle_proof(transactions, target_transaction, tree)

print(f"Merkle Root: {root}")
print(f"Merkle Proof for {target_transaction}: {proof}")
```

This code would print the Merkle root of the transaction list as well as a list of hashes proving that `tx3` is in the merkle tree. You could then write a proof checking function that iteratively hashes until it matches the root, but that’s an exercise for another time. Note that the way proofs work in bitcoin is slightly more nuanced, as the nodes do not know the entire list of transactions and need to get the required hash from another source in the peer network.

When developing more complex implementations, I highly recommend consulting ‘Mastering Bitcoin’ by Andreas Antonopoulos for an in-depth understanding of the technology. It covers everything from the basics to advanced topics with clear explanations and real-world examples. For the mathematical aspects of cryptography used in merkle trees and other bitcoin components, ‘Handbook of Applied Cryptography’ by Menezes, van Oorschot and Vanstone, is an excellent and thorough source. I’ve seen people struggle with some of the more subtle aspects of hashing and cryptography, which these resources cover well.

In terms of practical development, remember that error handling is crucial, as is testing edge cases such as single transaction merkle trees, or merkle trees where there are a number of duplicate transactions. You should consider adding unit tests for each function to make sure they behave as expected in any given scenario. When it comes to verifying proofs, the function needs to efficiently and correctly hash each step before comparing to the known root.

Building on top of this basic example, you would want to look into the more efficient sparse Merkle trees, particularly as the number of transactions in a block grow. Also, it’s vital to validate the implementation against real transaction data from the bitcoin network, because while these functions illustrate the concepts, the real implementation has to handle large volumes of data.

I have found, in my experience, that understanding the underlying principles and meticulously testing is the most effective approach. Don't cut corners, because the security of the system ultimately depends on the integrity of these mechanisms.
