```
GitHub is a platform for hosting and managing software projects. It uses Git for version control and allows collaboration among developers.

Gist is a service offered by GitHub for sharing code snippets, notes, and other small pieces of information. It's like a simpler version of a GitHub repository, focusing on individual files rather than entire projects.

Key differences:

- **Scope:** GitHub for projects, Gist for snippets.
- **Features:** GitHub has more features like issue tracking, pull requests, and wikis, while Gist is simpler.
- **Organization:** GitHub repositories can hold multiple files and directories, while Gists are limited to single files (though multiple files can be included in a single Gist).

In summary, use GitHub for larger projects that require collaboration and extensive features, and use Gist for quick code sharing, snippets, or simple notes.
