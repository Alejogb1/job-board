Alright, let's tackle this. Duplicate records, a classic headache in relational database applications, especially when dealing with master-detail relationships. It's a problem I've confronted more times than I care to recall, typically rearing its head just when you think you've got all your ducks in a row. My experience, particularly during the initial build of a legacy system, showed just how quickly this can spiral out of control. The application allowed users to add customer orders and, within each order, add multiple items. Before we implemented adequate safeguards, it was a mess of duplicated orders and items. It's a lesson that stuck with me: prevention is far better than the painful cleanup.

The issue in MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications, specifically those with master-detail structures, is usually located at the point where data is persisted from the UI down through the layers to the database. The user interface, controller logic, and even the model itself can all play a role in introducing or allowing duplication. When we talk master-detail, we are talking about a 1-to-many relationship, where one parent (the master record) relates to multiple child records (the detail records). The user interaction patterns tend to exacerbate the situation because the user might interact with the detail records incrementally, leading to scenarios where a record might be attempted to be created several times.

So, how can we effectively address this? The strategy is multifaceted, employing techniques across different tiers of the application.

First, let's focus on the database level. We should implement constraints. Unique constraints at the database level act as your last line of defense. They're critical because no matter how foolproof your application logic might *seem*, a bug somewhere can bypass it. Relying solely on application-level checks is risky. For master records, such as orders, a unique constraint on a column like an order reference number is vital. For detail records, such as order line items, uniqueness may need to consider a compound key: for example, (order_id, product_id, line_number). This combination makes sense to identify a specific line item within an order.

Next up is business logic validation within your controller. Before you even attempt to insert records into the database, you need a robust check. This isn't just checking if a record *exists*, because in concurrent scenarios this is not reliable, but more about building your logic to be idempotent, so that multiple requests that should only result in one record created only result in one. Here are some techniques:

**1.  Checking for existing records before creation (but with idempotent behavior)**
This one feels natural but needs careful consideration. Simply checking `if (record_exists) {return;}` can be problematic under concurrency. Instead, check for existence *as part* of your insert logic. If you're using an ORM like Entity Framework, this means performing your `Add` and `SaveChanges` calls in such a way that you attempt the insert and handle any unique constraint violation appropriately. I often structure my data access layer around such operations. Here’s a simplified C# example, assuming Entity Framework Core:

```csharp
public async Task<bool> AddLineItem(int orderId, int productId, int lineNumber, string details)
{
    try
    {
        var existingLineItem = await _context.OrderLineItems
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync(li => li.OrderId == orderId && li.ProductId == productId && li.LineNumber == lineNumber);
        if (existingLineItem != null) { return false; }

        var lineItem = new OrderLineItem {
           OrderId = orderId,
           ProductId = productId,
           LineNumber = lineNumber,
           Details = details
        };

        _context.OrderLineItems.Add(lineItem);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        return true;
    }
    catch (DbUpdateException ex)
    {
        // Check if the exception is caused by a unique constraint violation.
        if (ex.InnerException is SqlException sqlEx && sqlEx.Number == 2627)
        {
            // A duplicate was already added, so we just say no, and log the issue, as it may indicate an issue
            // with the client
            _logger.LogError($"Attempted to add a duplicate OrderLineItem: OrderId: {orderId}, ProductId: {productId}, LineNumber:{lineNumber}.");
            return false;
        }
        throw; // Re-throw if not a constraint violation.
    }
}
```
In this example, if a duplicate is attempted to be added based on the unique constraint, the database operation will throw an exception, and we catch this. If it's a constraint exception, we log it and return a `false` indicating no record added, so the application can handle that appropriately. If its a different issue, we re-throw the exception. This method is more robust than a simple existence check.

**2.  Using atomic operations (if supported by your ORM or database):**
This approach attempts to perform the insert with unique checks within the same database operation, reducing the risk of concurrency issues. Depending on your ORM and database, this may take different forms. For example, SQL Server supports the `MERGE` statement for atomic conditional inserts and updates. Some ORMs also provide transaction management that can help you here, but they often depend on the specifics of database transaction modes.

**3.  Client-side validation to guide the user:**
While not a complete solution, informing users proactively can reduce duplicate requests. For instance, when a user adds an order item, you can immediately update the UI to reflect that it has been added with a visual cue, and also disable the "add" button until that operation is complete. This provides immediate feedback and prevents accidental double-clicks, improving the user experience and reducing strain on the server. We also had a requirement to display detailed feedback to users, which was crucial for error handling on the client.

Here's a very simplified javascript example:

```javascript
async function addLineItem(orderId, productId, lineNumber, details) {
    const addButton = document.getElementById('add-line-item-button'); // Assuming an 'add' button element exists
    addButton.disabled = true; // Disable the button during the request.
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/lineitems', { // Replace with your endpoint
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ orderId, productId, lineNumber, details })
        });

        if (response.ok) {
            const result = await response.json(); // assuming the backend returns something useful
            if (result.added === true) {
              //Update ui here that the line item is there, remove loading etc.
              console.log('Line item added successfully.');
            } else {
              console.error('Failed to add line item. Likely a duplicate.');
            }
        } else {
            console.error('Failed to add line item. HTTP error: ', response.status);
             //Display error to user
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error adding line item:', error);
    } finally {
        addButton.disabled = false; // Re-enable the button after request finishes
    }
}

```
This prevents users from repeatedly triggering duplicate requests because the button is disabled while the operation is in progress. The user feedback is key, and it's something we discovered was needed during the aforementioned order processing system, the users needed to see what was added.

Finally, logging is essential. Your application should meticulously log any attempts to add duplicate records, detailing the parameters of the attempted operation and any associated error codes. These logs are invaluable in diagnosing application issues and understanding user behavior. When we finally deployed robust logging and error handling, we uncovered quite a few issues we didn't know we had.

For further exploration, I’d suggest taking a look at "Database Design and Relational Theory" by C.J. Date. It dives into the fundamentals of relational database design, including constraints. For a deep dive into concurrency, the book "Concurrency in .NET" by Stephen Cleary provides a detailed overview of multithreading and asynchronous operations in a C# context, which is useful to understand the risks of race conditions. Additionally, exploring the documentation of your chosen ORM (like Entity Framework) will be invaluable in understanding how it handles transaction management and how you can best leverage database-specific features like unique constraints to your advantage.

In conclusion, preventing duplicate records in an MVC application, particularly with master-detail structures, requires a layered approach. Database constraints, careful business logic within the controller, client-side user guidance, and diligent logging are all essential for maintaining data integrity. It's a challenge, but with careful planning and implementation, it can be effectively managed.
