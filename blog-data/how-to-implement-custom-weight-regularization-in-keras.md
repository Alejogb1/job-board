Alright, let's talk about custom weight regularization in Keras. It's something I've had to delve into a fair bit over the years, particularly back when I was working on those deep learning models for anomaly detection in sensor data—required some very particular constraints on the weights to avoid overfitting. The built-in regularizers in Keras are undeniably useful, but there are cases where they simply don’t cut it. You need something tailored to your specific problem, and that’s where custom regularization comes into play.

The challenge often lies in formulating your specific regularization strategy into a callable function that Keras can understand and apply during the training process. We're essentially going to be defining a function that calculates a penalty term based on the weights of a given layer. This penalty is then added to the overall loss function, thereby influencing the optimization process.

Now, let’s consider how this works in practice. First, you need to define your regularization function. This function will take a single argument, the layer's weight tensor, and must return a single scalar tensor representing the regularization penalty. This tensor needs to be a differentiable TensorFlow tensor, since backpropagation will require it. Let's look at an example where I wanted to enforce a specific sparsity pattern on the weights, a kind of 'group sparsity' before such a concept was commonplace.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from keras import layers

def group_sparsity_regularizer(weight_matrix):
  """
    Regularizes weights to encourage sparsity in groups.
    Here's a fictional scenario, let's say each group contains 4 weights.
  """
  num_groups = tf.shape(weight_matrix)[-1] // 4 # assuming the last dimension of weights is the one with groups
  penalty = tf.zeros((), dtype=tf.float32)

  for i in tf.range(num_groups):
     group = weight_matrix[:, i*4:(i+1)*4]
     group_norm = tf.norm(group)
     penalty +=  group_norm

  return penalty

class CustomRegularizedLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, kernel_regularizer=None, **kwargs):
        super(CustomRegularizedLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.kernel_regularizer = kernel_regularizer
    
    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
            initializer="glorot_uniform",
            trainable=True,
            name = 'kernel'
        )

        self.bias = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True, name = 'bias'
        )

    def call(self, inputs):
      output = tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel) + self.bias
      if self.kernel_regularizer:
           self.add_loss(self.kernel_regularizer(self.kernel))
      return output

# example usage:
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    CustomRegularizedLayer(32, kernel_regularizer=group_sparsity_regularizer),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

model.compile(optimizer = optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['accuracy'])

# let's use some random data:
import numpy as np
X_train = np.random.rand(100,10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs = 10)

```

In this example, `group_sparsity_regularizer` calculates the sum of the L2 norms of 'groups' of weights and serves as our custom regularizer. Importantly, we create a `CustomRegularizedLayer` to actually invoke the regularization process. We’re using `add_loss()` within the layer's call function, which is Keras' way of handling regularization contributions. This approach neatly integrates the custom penalty with the standard training loop.

Another time, while developing a system for predicting stock market fluctuations (a particularly ambitious project), I needed to minimize the variance of individual neuron activations to make the model more robust. This involved penalizing large differences in weights connecting to individual neurons within the hidden layers. Here is how I implemented this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from keras import layers

def neuron_variance_regularizer(weight_matrix):
    """
    Regularizes weights to minimize variance across weights feeding into a single neuron.
    """
    variance = tf.math.reduce_variance(weight_matrix, axis=0)
    penalty = tf.reduce_sum(variance)
    return penalty

class CustomRegularizedDense(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, kernel_regularizer=None, **kwargs):
        super(CustomRegularizedDense, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.kernel_regularizer = kernel_regularizer
    
    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
            initializer="glorot_uniform",
            trainable=True,
            name='kernel'
        )

        self.bias = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True, name = 'bias'
        )

    def call(self, inputs):
      output = tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel) + self.bias
      if self.kernel_regularizer:
           self.add_loss(self.kernel_regularizer(self.kernel))
      return output

# Example Usage:
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    CustomRegularizedDense(64, kernel_regularizer=neuron_variance_regularizer),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')
])
optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
model.compile(optimizer = optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics =['mse'])
X_train = np.random.rand(100,10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100,1)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs = 10)
```

This regularizer, `neuron_variance_regularizer`, penalizes high variance in weights associated with individual neurons. It uses `tf.math.reduce_variance(weight_matrix, axis=0)` to compute the variance across input weights for each output neuron. Again, the penalty is then added to the layer's losses through `self.add_loss()`.

Finally, let's consider a scenario where we wish to penalize weights that deviate significantly from a predefined range, an approach that can sometimes stabilize training when you have prior knowledge about the sensible scale of your weights.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from keras import layers

def range_deviation_regularizer(weight_matrix, lower_bound=-1, upper_bound=1):
  """
  Regularizes weights that deviate from a specified range
  """
  penalty = tf.zeros((), dtype = tf.float32)
  # penalize weights above upper_bound
  above = tf.maximum(weight_matrix-upper_bound, 0)
  penalty += tf.reduce_sum(above**2)

  # penalize weights below lower_bound
  below = tf.maximum(lower_bound - weight_matrix, 0)
  penalty += tf.reduce_sum(below**2)

  return penalty

class CustomRegularizedDenseBounded(layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units, kernel_regularizer=None, **kwargs):
        super(CustomRegularizedDenseBounded, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.kernel_regularizer = kernel_regularizer

  def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
            initializer="glorot_uniform",
            trainable=True,
            name = 'kernel'
        )

        self.bias = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True, name = 'bias'
        )
  def call(self, inputs):
      output = tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel) + self.bias
      if self.kernel_regularizer:
           self.add_loss(self.kernel_regularizer(self.kernel))
      return output

# Example usage:
model = keras.Sequential([
      layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
      CustomRegularizedDenseBounded(32, kernel_regularizer=lambda w: range_deviation_regularizer(w, -0.5, 0.5)),
      layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')
])
optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['mse'])

X_train = np.random.rand(100,10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100,1)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs = 10)
```

Here, `range_deviation_regularizer` encourages weights to stay between specified bounds. Weights that fall outside these limits are penalized quadratically, again added via `self.add_loss()`. This example demonstrates that the regularization function can have additional parameters that affect the regularization effect.

When working with custom regularizers, several best practices should be adhered to. Firstly, thoroughly test that your regularization function is behaving as expected with a small, isolated example. Use TF's gradient tape to verify that gradients are computed correctly and are not vanishing or exploding. For advanced regularization techniques, consider studying papers on constrained optimization, such as "Constrained Optimization Using Penalty Functions" by Luenberger, or sections on regularization in "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. The "Numerical Optimization" book by Nocedal and Wright is also an excellent general reference.

Finally, be aware of how the lambda that you pass to your regularizer affects the computation graphs and memory management. If your regularizer function is unnecessarily complex or if it involves too much computation, it can slow down your training dramatically. The custom regularization is a very powerful tool, but needs to be used with care, always thinking about performance and correctness. If you follow these guidelines you should be well-equipped to implement the necessary penalties for your particular use case.
