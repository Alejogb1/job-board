, let’s tackle this. Redirecting post requests within azure, while not something you might reach for every day, can be a surprisingly common requirement when building complex web applications, especially those involving microservices or intricate backend workflows. I’ve seen this play out more often than you might think, actually, especially back in my days working on that sprawling e-commerce platform a few years back. We ended up needing to manage authentication flows and data processing across multiple services, and, unsurprisingly, post request redirection became a key architectural piece.

The short answer is that azure doesn't have a single, dedicated 'redirect post requests' button. The challenge lies in the inherent nature of HTTP redirects (301, 302, 307, and 308 status codes) and how browsers interpret them. Typically, browsers do *not* re-transmit the original POST body when following a redirect. They’ll transform the request into a GET. To effectively redirect a POST, we often need a bit of orchestration. This typically involves a combination of different azure services. I'll break down some approaches with the techniques I’ve found most effective.

Firstly, let’s consider *azure functions* coupled with *api management*. This is a common pattern for a reason. The core idea is that your initial endpoint is handled by an azure function. This function doesn’t actually process the main logic but instead crafts a new POST request and forwards it to the target endpoint. Api management then sits in front of everything and manages the public-facing api, ensuring that any requests to the initial endpoint are routed to the function.

Here's a simplified python snippet that demonstrates this within an azure function. This function receives the incoming POST request, extracts its body, and then uses the 'requests' library to make a new POST to our desired endpoint, preserving the payload and headers.

```python
import logging
import json
import requests

import azure.functions as func

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info('python http trigger function processed a request.')

    target_url = "https://target-api.example.com/endpoint"  # replace with your target endpoint
    try:
        req_body = req.get_json()
        headers = dict(req.headers)
        
        resp = requests.post(target_url, json=req_body, headers=headers)
        resp.raise_for_status() # raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        
        return func.HttpResponse(
            body = json.dumps(resp.json()),
            status_code = resp.status_code,
            mimetype="application/json"
        )

    except ValueError:
        return func.HttpResponse(
             "please pass a json payload in the request body",
             status_code=400
        )
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Error making downstream request: {e}")
        return func.HttpResponse(
            f"Error forwarding the request: {str(e)}",
            status_code=500
        )


```
This function receives a request via an HTTP trigger, grabs the request body, constructs a new POST to the designated `target_url`, and returns the response it receives. Crucially, it preserves the headers from the original request. Error handling is included as well which is always important.

The crucial part here is that the client receives the response from *our* function, not a 30x redirect. This allows us to effectively ‘redirect’ a POST while sidestepping the browser's default behavior. We are not technically redirecting the original request. We are effectively proxying or tunneling the request from one place to another. This technique provides complete control of the request and response, which is something that's difficult to do with pure HTTP redirects on a POST method.

Next up, let's explore using *azure logic apps*. Logic apps provide a more visual and declarative approach. While it may not be the best fit for all situations, it is often useful when you need integration with other systems or services that have existing connectors. I used logic apps for a system that needed to integrate with a third-party service that required very specific data transforms.

Here is an outline of a logic app workflow:
1. Receive an http request (configured with a post verb).
2. Use the http connector to send a post request. Here is where you define the target url, body and headers to be included in the new request.
3. Respond to the original requester with the data returned from the target endpoint.

This visual approach is helpful for creating the necessary workflow without relying on coded functions. You configure each step via a GUI rather than by writing python or javascript as we did in the azure function example.

Finally, we could also use *azure app gateway* with url rewrite rules. This approach is particularly useful for more advanced scenarios. It requires a more in-depth configuration, but is very powerful. If the need is to intercept certain posts and redirect them, the app gateway provides an excellent way of managing complex routing logic. You could potentially use it to perform the kind of POST redirection we've been discussing. We’d have to configure a backend pool with our target endpoint and a url rewrite rule that modifies the request. However, it’s worth noting that azure app gateway may not directly achieve the same functionality as the previous methods (specifically, preserving the post body is a key challenge). What the rewrite rules can do, however, is modify the url of the request before it reaches the backend pool, which may lead to the correct target on the target application.

For an illustration, consider this snippet (this is not code, but the kind of configuration you might define within the azure portal for app gateway's url rewrite rules):
```
   "rewriteRules": [
      {
        "name": "redirectPost",
        "ruleSequence": 100,
        "conditions": [
            {
                "variable": "var_method",
                "pattern": "^POST$",
                "ignoreCase": true
            },
             {
                "variable": "var_path",
                "pattern": "/old-endpoint.*",
                "ignoreCase": true
            }
        ],
        "actionSet": {
          "requestHeaderConfigurations": [],
          "responseHeaderConfigurations": [],
          "urlConfiguration": {
               "modifiedPath": "/new-endpoint"
           }
        }
      }
    ],
```

This (simplified) rewrite rule would look at a post request whose path starts with `/old-endpoint` and change its path to `/new-endpoint`. In this approach, the destination application should expect the request to be in the body as the original request. If you need to send the body to different endpoints, this is where the azure function approach would prove superior. App gateway is great for simple routing and modification tasks, but for more complex needs, functions offer more flexibility.

To further expand your understanding, I'd highly recommend checking out "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" by Martin Fowler for broader architectural concepts, including proxy patterns that are closely related to our function example. Also, for a deeper dive into the specific azure services, the official Microsoft Azure documentation is, as always, an excellent resource. Look specifically at the documentation for `azure functions`, `api management`, `logic apps`, and `application gateway`. These documents are generally well maintained and up-to-date.

The ‘best’ approach is always going to depend on the specific circumstances. Sometimes, a function is the perfect solution. Sometimes, the declarative power of a logic app is the better fit. And, sometimes, the traffic management features of app gateway become a real lifesaver. Thinking through your specific needs and choosing the solution that is appropriate is the key.
