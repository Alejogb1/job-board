Okay, let’s tackle this. I’ve spent a fair chunk of time working with segmentation tasks, especially in domains where we’re not dealing with just single, clear-cut labels. Multi-label edge segmentation, as you’ve asked about, throws a few more interesting complexities into the mix, compared to your standard pixel-wise classification. So, let's explore how you'd go about calculating relevant metrics in PyTorch.

The core of the issue, as i see it, boils down to how we interpret the prediction and ground truth data. In standard semantic segmentation, it’s a one-to-one correspondence: each pixel gets a single label. However, with multi-label edge segmentation, a pixel can, and often does, belong to *multiple* edge categories simultaneously. Think of it like identifying multiple overlapping object boundaries. This requires adjusting our evaluation strategy to reflect the complexity of this.

Accuracy, in its simplest form, is usually not sufficient here and can be misleading. A pixel might be classified accurately for some edge types, but not for others. Therefore, we often need to examine a set of precision, recall, f1-score (or f-beta score), and the often overlooked jaccard index (intersection over union). Moreover, we must compute these metrics per *label* and then often summarise them into a single meaningful score. Let's start with a breakdown of the components you will need, and then delve into a practical implementation in PyTorch.

First, consider how you’ve likely structured your labels. Let's assume your prediction and ground truth are both tensors of shape `[batch_size, num_labels, height, width]`. Each channel in the `num_labels` dimension represents the presence or absence of a specific edge label. For the sake of this discussion, we will assume that these are binary, meaning 0 for absence of the edge, and 1 for the presence of the edge. It is also assumed that these values are probabilities for the predictions and have been binarized.

Now, let's get into the code. We need helper functions that will calculate the four metrics that we will use: precision, recall, f1-score, and the jaccard index. These will be applied to all batches for each label, and then these results aggregated into the final scores for a complete evaluation of your model.

```python
import torch

def calculate_metrics_per_label(predictions, ground_truths, epsilon=1e-7):
    """
    Calculates precision, recall, f1-score, and Jaccard index for a batch, per label.

    Args:
        predictions (torch.Tensor): Model predictions of shape [batch_size, num_labels, height, width].
        ground_truths (torch.Tensor): Ground truth labels of shape [batch_size, num_labels, height, width].
        epsilon (float): A small value to prevent division by zero.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing precision, recall, f1_score, and jaccard index per label.
              Shape for each metric will be [num_labels].
    """

    # Ensure input tensors are boolean to properly perform the calculations.
    predictions = predictions.bool()
    ground_truths = ground_truths.bool()

    batch_size, num_labels, _, _ = predictions.shape
    metrics = {
        "precision": torch.zeros(num_labels),
        "recall": torch.zeros(num_labels),
        "f1_score": torch.zeros(num_labels),
        "jaccard_index": torch.zeros(num_labels),
    }


    for label_index in range(num_labels):
        pred_label = predictions[:, label_index].flatten()
        gt_label = ground_truths[:, label_index].flatten()


        true_positives = torch.sum(pred_label & gt_label)
        false_positives = torch.sum(pred_label & ~gt_label)
        false_negatives = torch.sum(~pred_label & gt_label)


        precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives + epsilon)
        recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives + epsilon)


        f1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall + epsilon)
        jaccard = true_positives / (torch.sum(pred_label | gt_label) + epsilon)

        metrics["precision"][label_index] = precision
        metrics["recall"][label_index] = recall
        metrics["f1_score"][label_index] = f1
        metrics["jaccard_index"][label_index] = jaccard

    return metrics
```

This function processes a single batch to produce the metrics per label, which we will then combine in the next code snippet.
Now, you might want to calculate metrics over your validation or test set. We can do this by accumulating the metrics for all the batches that go through the network.

```python
def aggregate_metrics(metrics_list):
  """Aggregates metrics from a list of dictionaries, averaging over all batches.

  Args:
      metrics_list (list of dict): List of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains
                             metrics computed per label for a single batch.

  Returns:
      dict: A dictionary containing the average precision, recall, f1_score, and jaccard index.
            Shape for each metric will be [num_labels].
  """
  if not metrics_list:
    return {}

  aggregated_metrics = {key: torch.zeros_like(metrics_list[0][key]) for key in metrics_list[0]}


  for batch_metrics in metrics_list:
    for key, value in batch_metrics.items():
      aggregated_metrics[key] += value


  num_batches = len(metrics_list)
  for key in aggregated_metrics:
    aggregated_metrics[key] /= num_batches

  return aggregated_metrics
```

This function allows us to take the per label and per batch values and then combine them into a single tensor that has each metric summarised over the entire dataset. Lastly, it might be helpful to reduce these values to a single score per metric, per batch, or in total. The following snippet uses a weighted average based on the number of true positive and true negative pixels in your training dataset.

```python
def weighted_average_metrics(metrics, ground_truths, weight_type='class_balance'):
  """
  Calculates the weighted average of metrics per label.

    Args:
        metrics (dict): Metrics per label, shape [num_labels] for each.
        ground_truths (torch.Tensor): Ground truth labels of shape [batch_size, num_labels, height, width].
        weight_type (str): Weighting type. 'class_balance' to weight based on labels in gt. or 'uniform' for equal weights.

  Returns:
        dict: Dictionary of average metrics over all labels
  """

  num_labels = ground_truths.shape[1]
  if weight_type == 'class_balance':
      label_weights = torch.tensor([torch.sum(ground_truths[:, i] == 1).float() for i in range(num_labels)])
      label_weights /= torch.sum(label_weights)  # Normalize weights

  elif weight_type == 'uniform':
        label_weights = torch.ones(num_labels) / num_labels
  else:
     raise ValueError(f"Weight type {weight_type} not supported")

  average_metrics = {}
  for metric_name, metric_tensor in metrics.items():
       average_metrics[metric_name] = torch.sum(metric_tensor * label_weights)
  return average_metrics

```
Now, we have all the pieces in place. I've used this setup in several previous projects, including a remote sensing edge detection task, and a medical imaging pipeline. The key to getting good results isn’t just about the algorithm but also ensuring you’re evaluating correctly. The 'class balance' option is vital when labels are not equally represented and provides a more realistic view of the model's performance.

It is important to remember a few things. First, always inspect the per-label performance of the model, as a weighted average alone can hide potentially poor model performance on some labels. Second, a good understanding of what your specific task requires, as different tasks will focus on different metrics, may be needed for a comprehensive evaluation. F1-score may be more critical if you have imbalanced classes or where both precision and recall are important. If you're dealing with a high-stakes application such as in the medical space, ensure you know the trade-offs of a high-precision low-recall vs low-precision high-recall setup.

For more in-depth analysis, I’d recommend checking out 'Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning' by Christopher Bishop, particularly the chapters on classification and model evaluation. Also, a highly useful resource is the "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms" by David MacKay, which provides a deep dive into statistical methods for machine learning. In addition, academic papers often provide very insightful analyses for specific topics.

Multi-label segmentation evaluation can be nuanced, but with the right approach and a solid understanding of your data and goals, it's a problem you can certainly tackle effectively using tools such as PyTorch and these metric implementations.
