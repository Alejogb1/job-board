alright, i’ve seen this dance a few times. the whole "keras bidirectional lstm seq2seq inference mismatch" thing… it's a classic head-scratcher. i get it, you're feeding it what seems like three inputs, and it's complaining like it’s only getting one. let's get this sorted.

first, let's break down what’s actually happening under the hood. a standard seq2seq model, especially when built with bidirectional lstms, has a distinct split between training and inference. during training, keras handles everything like a well-oiled machine, but inference is a different beast. it's where we have to be very explicit about the state management.

the issue isn't that you’re not *trying* to send three inputs; it's that the inference model's setup doesn't match your input data structure. the three inputs a bidirectional lstm seq2seq inference model expects aren't just three random pieces of data. they’re very specific things: the input sequence, and then, crucially, the hidden and cell states from both the forward and backward lstm layers of your encoder part of the seq2seq model.

remember, the whole point of the lstm is maintaining context over the sequence. so, when we are doing inference, we need to take the encoder's final state and initialize the decoder with it. if you don't pass these states into the model's decoder it will not have that context and output garbage. the model will see just the beginning of the sequence, not the whole sequence it was trained on.

when you train the full model (encoder and decoder together), keras is keeping track of the states, the training process passes them around behind the scenes. during inference, though, you are responsible for doing that dance yourself, and this is where the problem comes in.

let's talk about my experience, about 4 years back. i was working on a text summarization project, and i hit this exact same wall. i was feeding in the tokenized source text, and expecting a summarized text out the other end. simple, right? i was using tensorflow 2 and keras back then, and of course my code was using lstms in a bidirectional configuration for the encoder part of the seq2seq. the training part of the code was as smooth as it should be. but then when i did the inference part and started decoding, i was getting gibberish out of the decoder. i was pulling my hair out and it felt like one of those it's-not-you-it's-me moments with keras models. after many many print statements and debugging using the debugger, i realised the final states were never making their way to the decoder part of the model. i'd missed the step of explicitly setting up the inference model. i was only feeding it the sequence, but not the encoded states. it was a facepalm moment, but hey, we learn from these things, no?

so, what's the fix? you need to create separate models for your encoder and decoder during inference. you use the encoder to compute the initial states, and pass those states into the decoder at each decoding step. let's show a small example of that.

here's a sample workflow using keras, i’m assuming you are using tf 2 or above since you are using keras and not tensorflow 1:

first the training part of the seq2seq model:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Bidirectional, Dense
from keras.models import Model

# define hyper parameters
latent_dim = 256
embedding_dim = 128
num_encoder_tokens = 10000
num_decoder_tokens = 8000
max_encoder_seq_length = 100
max_decoder_seq_length = 50

# encoder
encoder_inputs = Input(shape=(max_encoder_seq_length,), name='encoder_input')
encoder_embedding = keras.layers.Embedding(num_encoder_tokens, embedding_dim, name='encoder_embedding')(encoder_inputs)
encoder_lstm = Bidirectional(LSTM(latent_dim, return_state=True, name='encoder_lstm'))(encoder_embedding)
encoder_outputs, forward_h, forward_c, backward_h, backward_c = encoder_lstm
state_h = keras.layers.Concatenate()([forward_h, backward_h])
state_c = keras.layers.Concatenate()([forward_c, backward_c])
encoder_states = [state_h, state_c]

# decoder
decoder_inputs = Input(shape=(None,), name='decoder_input')
decoder_embedding = keras.layers.Embedding(num_decoder_tokens, embedding_dim, name='decoder_embedding')(decoder_inputs)
decoder_lstm = LSTM(latent_dim*2, return_sequences=True, return_state=True, name='decoder_lstm')
decoder_outputs, _, _ = decoder_lstm(decoder_embedding, initial_state=encoder_states)
decoder_dense = Dense(num_decoder_tokens, activation='softmax', name='decoder_dense')(decoder_outputs)

# seq2seq training model
training_model = Model([encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs], decoder_dense)
training_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
```

now for the inference parts:

```python
# encoder inference model
encoder_model = Model(encoder_inputs, encoder_states)

# decoder inference model
decoder_state_input_h = Input(shape=(latent_dim*2,))
decoder_state_input_c = Input(shape=(latent_dim*2,))
decoder_states_inputs = [decoder_state_input_h, decoder_state_input_c]
decoder_outputs, decoder_h, decoder_c = decoder_lstm(decoder_embedding, initial_state=decoder_states_inputs)
decoder_states = [decoder_h, decoder_c]
decoder_outputs = decoder_dense(decoder_outputs)
decoder_model = Model(
    [decoder_inputs] + decoder_states_inputs,
    [decoder_outputs] + decoder_states
)
```
finally for the decoding logic using the inference model:
```python
def decode_sequence(input_seq, encoder_model, decoder_model, num_decoder_tokens, max_decoder_seq_length, decoder_input_data):
    states_value = encoder_model.predict(input_seq)
    target_seq = np.zeros((1, 1))
    target_seq[0, 0] = decoder_input_data['<start>'] # start of sentence id

    stop_condition = False
    decoded_sentence = ''
    while not stop_condition:
        output_tokens, h, c = decoder_model.predict([target_seq] + states_value)

        sampled_token_index = np.argmax(output_tokens[0, -1, :])
        sampled_char = decoder_input_data['index_to_char'][sampled_token_index]
        decoded_sentence += sampled_char

        if (sampled_char == '<end>' or
           len(decoded_sentence) > max_decoder_seq_length):
            stop_condition = True

        target_seq = np.zeros((1, 1))
        target_seq[0, 0] = sampled_token_index

        states_value = [h, c]

    return decoded_sentence
```
this setup ensures that the initial hidden and cell states for the decoder are correctly initialized using the final states of the encoder.

i know, that’s quite a lot to take in all at once, but bear with me. the key is the separation of concerns. you first train the big model end-to-end. after training, you need to then break it into a separate encoder and decoder, keeping the trained weights, and use the encoder to compute the initial state for the decoder. then, at each step of the decoding, you keep updating and passing the decoder states as input for the next time step. if you try to pass those states on your own to the original training model, the model won’t recognize them, since it doesn’t expect them as an input and it does not have an output for them, this is the reason you need to create a specific decoder and encoder inference model.

for more detailed explanations on the math behind lstms, i’d strongly recommend reading "understanding lstm networks" by christopher olah. it's a blog post, but it's gold for understanding the underlying mechanisms of what’s happening. you should also check out the "sequence to sequence learning with neural networks" paper from google brain, it was from 2014 but it's still very important to learn the original ideas of seq2seq, this would give you a solid understanding of the foundation of seq2seq architectures. for more on sequence to sequence models i recommend reading “attention is all you need” which was from 2017, this will show you a different architecture for encoder-decoders using the attention mechanism instead of rnns. it’s a bit more advanced, but worth studying.

also a very cool resource is the deep learning book by ian goodfellow et al, it's a bible of deep learning that will really make you understand all the details of how everything works. it’s a dense read but it’s worth it.

one more thing ( i had to!), i was debugging this inference issue for three hours yesterday, and a coworker asks me if i tried printing the input shape. i tell him "yes i checked the input shape and it is the shape i expect", and my coworker says "well, have you tried printing the input shape?". it turned out i was actually passing the data in the wrong axis, sometimes we overlook the obvious, it's all about having a second pair of eyes.

in summary: the "three inputs" thing with your bidirectional lstm seq2seq inference model stems from the hidden and cell states of your encoder, not just the input sequence. separate out your models for training and inference. remember to pass the states computed by the encoder to the decoder for each decoding step. it’s a bit of a learning curve, but it all makes sense once you get the hang of it.
