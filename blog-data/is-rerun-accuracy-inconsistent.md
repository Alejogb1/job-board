Alright, let's unpack this. The idea of "rerun accuracy" being inconsistent is something Iâ€™ve seen firsthand, particularly when dealing with complex, non-deterministic systems. It's not so much a fundamental flaw in the process of rerunning a computation, but rather the intricate interplay of factors that can lead to different outputs even with identical inputs. It's an area where you really start to appreciate the subtleties of how software interacts with its environment.

I recall a particularly challenging project a few years back. We were developing a large-scale simulation engine for financial markets. The core simulation relied on a Monte Carlo approach, which, as you likely know, involves a degree of randomness. Initially, we were puzzled by the fact that rerunning the exact same simulation, using the same seed values for the random number generator, would sometimes produce slightly different results. This wasn't just a rounding error level of difference; the variance in output could be significant enough to skew our analyses. It took a considerable amount of debugging, profiling, and deep dives into the code before we understood what was happening.

The key here is understanding that "rerun accuracy" isn't a single switch you can flip. It's a function of several interacting elements. Let's break down some of the most common culprits:

First, the most obvious suspect is, of course, the pseudo-random number generator (prng). While we generally rely on the property that given the same seed, the sequence should be identical, issues can arise. Even a minute difference in how the prng is initialized or used can cause a diverging sequence, especially after a large number of draws. Many different prng algorithms exist, each with varying statistical properties. Furthermore, the implementation of these algorithms may vary between different libraries or platforms, creating a subtle source of discrepancy. A simple example of inconsistent initialization can be seen if we use system time as the seed, which on different runs will yield different results:

```python
import random
import time

# Example of a PRNG with different seeds based on time
def generate_random_numbers_time():
    random.seed(time.time())
    return [random.random() for _ in range(5)]

# Running the function multiple times, yields different results each time.
print(generate_random_numbers_time())
print(generate_random_numbers_time())
print(generate_random_numbers_time())
```

This simple python example clearly shows that basing the seed on system time is not reliable for reruns and deterministic computation.

Next, the order of operations is critical. In computations that involve floating-point arithmetic, the order in which you perform additions and multiplications can actually impact the final result due to accumulation of rounding errors. This isn't usually significant on a small scale, but in large, complex calculations with many iterations, these rounding errors can propagate and amplify differences. This can particularly be problematic with parallel or concurrent computation. Consider the scenario where we perform a parallel reduction operation. The order in which different threads contribute to the final result might change across runs because the operating system's thread scheduler has non-deterministic behavior.

```python
import numpy as np
import multiprocessing

# Example of inconsistent floating-point additions due to ordering.
def parallel_sum(data, num_processes):
  chunk_size = len(data) // num_processes
  chunks = [data[i*chunk_size:(i+1)*chunk_size] for i in range(num_processes)]

  with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=num_processes) as pool:
    results = pool.map(np.sum, chunks)
  return np.sum(results)


data = np.random.rand(1000000)

# Running this multiple times may yield slightly different results
print(parallel_sum(data, 4))
print(parallel_sum(data, 4))
print(parallel_sum(data, 4))

```

The slight inconsistencies in the above output illustrate that parallel computing may yield different results due to scheduling randomness and associated floating-point arithmetic ordering.

Furthermore, external system dependencies can drastically affect rerun accuracy. External libraries, especially native or compiled ones, may behave differently across platforms or versions. If your simulation relies on system calls, the results can be influenced by the state of the system, which may not be exactly the same during subsequent runs. Similarly, if the simulation interacts with databases or external services, changes in those external systems will alter the outcome. Consider the following simplified example of a process that writes a file and reads it back:

```python
import os

# Example of external dependency inconsistency (file timestamp)
def file_io_operation():
    filename = "test_file.txt"
    with open(filename, "w") as f:
        f.write("some data")
    time_of_creation = os.path.getmtime(filename)
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
    os.remove(filename)
    return content, time_of_creation

# Results may differ each time due to the file modification time
print(file_io_operation())
print(file_io_operation())
print(file_io_operation())
```

While the content itself remains constant here, the modification time clearly changes, which illustrates another dimension of "inconsistency," even if functionally the results seem deterministic. This underscores that the definition of "accuracy" depends on what aspect we are observing.

These aren't just abstract theoretical issues; they have practical implications for reproducible research and engineering practices. One of the key strategies for mitigating these issues is meticulous attention to version control. Not just for your code but also for the versions of any external libraries you depend on. Additionally, using tools like docker for containerization and virtualization will ensure your software is run in an environment that is consistent across reruns. The best practice here is to specify very carefully your dependencies and their versions to avoid introducing any surprises.

In addition to ensuring environment consistency, proper prng management is crucial. You should explicitly set the seed and be wary of relying on system time as a source of entropy, especially in scenarios where deterministic results are desired. Further, in large computations, especially those involving floating-point numbers, careful attention to the numerical algorithms themselves is needed. In my experience with the financial simulation I mentioned earlier, moving to an algorithm which provided consistent results independent of floating-point arithmetic order was vital, especially with parallelized calculations.

For anyone looking to further delve into these issues, I highly recommend starting with the book "Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing," which provides great insight into numerical instability and techniques for mitigating them. Furthermore, papers discussing best practices for reproducibility in scientific computing, such as those from the Association for Computing Machinery (acm), will offer further insights into this topic. A focus on reproducible research methodology is also strongly advisable to fully explore the problem of rerun accuracy. Also, the IEEE standard 754 is a crucial read to fully understand how floating point numbers are represented and how their limitations impact mathematical computations.

In summary, "rerun accuracy" isn't inherently inconsistent, but requires careful consideration of all factors that can introduce variability, whether it be floating point arithmetic, prng initialization, external system dependencies, or software versioning. It's a multi-faceted issue and requires a disciplined approach to manage them effectively, and is an important consideration in any complex simulation or computational system.
