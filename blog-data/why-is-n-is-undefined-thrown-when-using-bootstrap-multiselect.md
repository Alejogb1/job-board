Alright, let's tackle this "n is undefined" error with Bootstrap Multiselect, something I’ve personally debugged more times than I care to remember. The error itself isn’t inherently a Bootstrap Multiselect problem in the core library; it’s typically an issue arising from how the Multiselect plugin is integrated into your specific project or how you're attempting to use it. In essence, this error suggests the plugin expects a variable named 'n' to be defined, usually within its callback or event handling, and it's not finding it. So, the core issue lies in variable scope or incorrect data passing.

The key to understanding this is realizing that Bootstrap Multiselect often manipulates lists of options within a select element. When you interact with the multiselect—checking or unchecking options—the plugin needs to iterate through these options. This is usually where 'n' pops up, commonly as an index in a loop or as a reference to a selected value. The problem emerges when that expected index or value is not passed correctly during event callbacks or when the plugin’s internal structures have become mismatched with the actual html select element.

Let’s break this down practically. I recall a project I was working on several years back. We had this complex form with multiple dynamically generated multiselects. Things worked initially, then suddenly, we were bombarded with "n is undefined" errors on random multiselect instances. What we discovered was a combination of two issues: First, we had nested loops generating the multiselects and the initialisation logic was using jQuery with some incorrect context. Secondly, on a server-side data change, we were updating the <select> elements with new options, but the Multiselect plugin was not being re-initialized on those elements, causing a mismatch.

Here's a more concrete look at what can go wrong with code examples. Let’s say you have the following initialisation and HTML:

**Example 1: Improper Initialization Context**

```html
<div id="container">
   <select id="multiselect1" multiple="multiple">
       <option value="1">Option 1</option>
       <option value="2">Option 2</option>
       <option value="3">Option 3</option>
    </select>
    <select id="multiselect2" multiple="multiple">
       <option value="4">Option 4</option>
       <option value="5">Option 5</option>
       <option value="6">Option 6</option>
    </select>
</div>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap-multiselect/1.1.20/js/bootstrap-multiselect.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap-multiselect/1.1.20/css/bootstrap-multiselect.min.css" />
<script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
      $('#container select').multiselect();
    });
</script>

```
This code seems innocuous. However, if the DOM manipulation within the multiselect plugin’s internal events don't properly scope each selection element, the 'n' variable can be affected due to closure issues within the anonymous functions of event handlers within the multiselect plugin itself. The root cause lies within the implementation details of the plugin. To resolve, ensure the correct jQuery selector is used and if the elements are dynamically generated, we should use event delegation.
Now, let's consider a scenario where you're changing the options in the select box dynamically.

**Example 2: Dynamic Option Updates Without Re-initialization**

```html
<select id="dynamicSelect" multiple="multiple">
    <option value="a">Initial A</option>
    <option value="b">Initial B</option>
</select>

<button id="updateOptions">Update Options</button>

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap-multiselect/1.1.20/js/bootstrap-multiselect.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap-multiselect/1.1.20/css/bootstrap-multiselect.min.css" />
<script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('#dynamicSelect').multiselect();

         $('#updateOptions').click(function() {
            $('#dynamicSelect').html('<option value="c">Updated C</option><option value="d">Updated D</option>');
        });
    });
</script>
```
Here, the multiselect is initialized initially. When the button is clicked, it changes the underlying html options. However, the multiselect plugin is not aware that this happened, so the internal data structures still references the prior set of options. When the plugin then tries to iterate based on user clicks, it can't find the expected internal variable, thus generating the "n is undefined" error.

The solution in this case is to *destroy* and then *re-initialize* the plugin.

**Example 3: Correct Dynamic Update with Re-Initialization**

```html
<select id="dynamicSelect" multiple="multiple">
    <option value="a">Initial A</option>
    <option value="b">Initial B</option>
</select>

<button id="updateOptions">Update Options</button>

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap-multiselect/1.1.20/js/bootstrap-multiselect.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap-multiselect/1.1.20/css/bootstrap-multiselect.min.css" />

<script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('#dynamicSelect').multiselect();

         $('#updateOptions').click(function() {
            $('#dynamicSelect').multiselect('destroy');
            $('#dynamicSelect').html('<option value="c">Updated C</option><option value="d">Updated D</option>');
             $('#dynamicSelect').multiselect();
        });
    });
</script>
```
By first calling `.multiselect('destroy')` before manipulating the html of the select element and then calling `.multiselect()` again after, we ensure the plugin is operating with the current set of options in the select element and prevent the error. This is the common correct approach when dealing with dynamic data.

For a deeper dive into these types of scenarios, I would suggest taking a look at "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" by David Flanagan. Understanding JavaScript's scope and closures is crucial in debugging issues like these. Also, referring to the specific version of the Bootstrap Multiselect plugin's source code on its repository can be incredibly insightful. I often find spending time stepping through plugin code with a debugger is very useful when I have similar problems. In particular, look at how events are handled and how option data is managed in memory. In general, this specific error almost always points to data consistency issues between the dom and the plugin's internal data, stemming from initialization, data manipulation, or scope issues. It's usually not the plugin itself that is at fault, but rather the way it interacts with your code.
