Okay, let's unpack this. I’ve certainly been down this rabbit hole myself, more times than I’d care to recount. The scenario you describe – a turbo-frame inline edit submission that seemingly vanishes into the ether – is a classic, and usually the root cause isn’t quite as esoteric as it initially seems. The underlying issue almost always stems from a mismatch in how Turbo is interpreting the server’s response versus what you’ve declared in your HTML. It’s not a bug in Turbo, but rather a discrepancy in expectations.

Let's delve into the details. You're performing an inline edit using a turbo-frame; this means you’re submitting a form (likely using a `<form>` tag) nested inside a turbo-frame element ( `<turbo-frame id="your_frame_id">` ). When that form is submitted, Turbo intercepts the request, sends it to the server via fetch, and expects a response containing another turbo-frame with the *same id*. If that frame isn't present in the response, or the id doesn't precisely match, the update fails silently. This is deliberate behavior, it's Turbo's way of ensuring it doesn't just arbitrarily swap in content. It’s all about targeted, efficient updates.

In my early days with Turbo, I spent a frustrating afternoon debugging a very similar issue. The problem, as I eventually realized, was that my server was sending back a complete layout, rather than just the modified turbo-frame. It's an easy mistake to make, especially if you're transitioning from traditional server-side rendering techniques.

Let’s look at some examples, starting with the ideal scenario and then illustrating the common pitfalls.

**Example 1: The Correct Response Structure**

Let's assume we have an initial html structure like this:

```html
<div id="container">
  <turbo-frame id="edit_item_1">
    <p>Current value: <span id="value_1">Original Value</span></p>
    <form action="/update_item/1" method="post">
      <input type="text" name="value" value="Original Value">
      <button type="submit">Update</button>
    </form>
  </turbo-frame>
</div>
```

And let's consider our server-side code, which handles the form submission. It must return *only* the updated turbo-frame. In Ruby on Rails, it might look something like this:

```ruby
# In your controller
def update
  @item = Item.find(params[:id])
  @item.update(value: params[:value])
  render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.replace("edit_item_#{params[:id]}", partial: "items/item", locals: { item: @item })
end

# In app/views/items/_item.html.erb
<turbo-frame id="edit_item_<%= item.id %>">
  <p>Current value: <span id="value_<%= item.id %>"><%= item.value %></span></p>
  <form action="/update_item/<%= item.id %>" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="value" value="<%= item.value %>">
    <button type="submit">Update</button>
  </form>
</turbo-frame>
```

This setup works perfectly. The server response consists only of the `<turbo-frame id="edit_item_1">` element, updated with the new value. This is precisely what Turbo expects, and so the frame gets seamlessly updated in the browser.

**Example 2: The Missing Turbo-Frame**

Now, let’s look at a scenario where you might encounter the missing frame problem. Let's imagine a similar initial HTML structure, but this time the server-side update response is incorrect. Let's use a generic php example for diversity in programming language.

```html
<div id="container">
    <turbo-frame id="edit_item_2">
        <p>Current value: <span id="value_2">Initial Value</span></p>
        <form action="/update_item.php?id=2" method="post">
            <input type="text" name="value" value="Initial Value">
            <button type="submit">Update</button>
        </form>
    </turbo-frame>
</div>
```

And the PHP code which is *incorrect*:

```php
<?php
// update_item.php
$itemId = $_GET['id'];
$newValue = $_POST['value'];

// In reality, update database here
// For this example, let's just output the updated content wrapped in full HTML
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Item Updated</title></head>
<body>
    <h1>Item Updated</h1>
        <div id="container">
            <turbo-frame id="edit_item_2">
                <p>Current value: <span id="value_2"><?php echo htmlspecialchars($newValue);?></span></p>
                <form action="/update_item.php?id=2" method="post">
                    <input type="text" name="value" value="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($newValue); ?>">
                    <button type="submit">Update</button>
                </form>
           </turbo-frame>
        </div>
</body>
</html>
<?php
```

In this case, the server is responding with an entire html document (including `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`), instead of just the updated `<turbo-frame id="edit_item_2">` element. Turbo doesn’t find the solitary matching turbo-frame, so it discards the response. The result: a silent failure. The page appears not to update.

**Example 3: Incorrect ID**

Let’s look at another common mistake that can trigger this issue - an incorrect turbo-frame ID.

```html
<div id="container">
  <turbo-frame id="edit_item_3">
    <p>Current value: <span id="value_3">Another Original Value</span></p>
    <form action="/update_item/3" method="post">
      <input type="text" name="value" value="Another Original Value">
      <button type="submit">Update</button>
    </form>
  </turbo-frame>
</div>
```

And now consider this server-side code (in Python with Flask as the framework):

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/update_item/<int:item_id>', methods=['POST'])
def update_item(item_id):
    new_value = request.form['value']
    # In real world, update database
    # Just render the updated frame but with the wrong id!
    return render_template("item_fragment.html", item_id = item_id, value = new_value, wrong_frame_id = 'wrong_item_id')


# In the templates/item_fragment.html file.
<turbo-frame id="{{ wrong_frame_id }}">
    <p>Current value: <span id="value_{{ item_id }}">{{ value }}</span></p>
    <form action="/update_item/{{ item_id }}" method="post">
      <input type="text" name="value" value="{{ value }}">
      <button type="submit">Update</button>
    </form>
</turbo-frame>
```

In this Python/Flask snippet, we are intentionally setting the `wrong_frame_id` in our response template instead of `edit_item_3`. Turbo will not find the frame matching id "edit_item_3" so nothing will happen and the edit operation will seem to have failed silently. The key mistake is returning an updated frame with the id `wrong_item_id` instead of `edit_item_3`.

**Key Takeaways and Solutions**

The key here is precise adherence to Turbo's expectations. When dealing with inline edits via turbo-frames, the server response *must* contain:

1.  **Only** the single turbo-frame that you're targeting. No extra html boilerplate, no full layouts.
2.  A turbo-frame element with an id that **exactly** matches the turbo-frame that originally made the request.

If you’re struggling with this, I recommend a careful inspection of the server response using your browser's developer tools. See exactly what html your server is sending back. Is it an entire page? Does it have the correct turbo-frame id?

Debugging these issues often involves scrutinizing both client-side HTML and server-side rendering logic. Ensure your server is sending the correct minimal, targeted response. If you are using rails, look into `turbo_stream` to avoid this type of error.

For deeper understanding, I'd highly recommend reading "Hotwire: Modern Web Apps with Turbo and Stimulus" by David Heinemeier Hansson. This resource gives an excellent foundation. Furthermore, the official Turbo documentation from the Hotwire project is essential and should be thoroughly reviewed. Lastly, the "Turbo 8 Primer" by Jumpstart rails is useful for more modern conventions. These should give you a solid base of knowledge to troubleshoot and move forward confidently.

This is a very common problem with clear solutions; I’m confident with this understanding, you'll be able to quickly locate and solve the issue in your project.
