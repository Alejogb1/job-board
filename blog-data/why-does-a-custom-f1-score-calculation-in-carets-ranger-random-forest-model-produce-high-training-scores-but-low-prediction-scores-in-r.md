Alright, let's tackle this one. I've actually encountered this very situation a few times over the years, and it can be a real head-scratcher if you're not looking at the right things. The issue you're describing – high training f1 scores with a custom function in caret's ranger model, but then abysmal prediction performance – it's usually a symptom of a discrepancy between how you're calculating that f1 score *during training* and how the model is actually being evaluated in the prediction phase. It's not necessarily a ranger-specific problem, but the way caret handles custom evaluation metrics coupled with the nature of how ranger works can certainly accentuate it. Let’s break it down.

The first thing to understand is how caret trains models when you provide a custom summary function. Caret isn't using your custom f1 function to actively optimize the model *during* the training phase; ranger does its own internal optimization. Caret is using your provided function merely to report out the performance during the resampling process. Now, this distinction is absolutely critical. Your function is calculated *post-hoc*, after ranger’s internal training process has concluded for a particular resampling iteration, and it is solely for your informative benefit. The underlying model parameters are not directly influenced by the output of your custom function.

The standard way ranger’s random forests are optimized is via the Gini impurity (for classification) or variance reduction (for regression). Your F1 score, however, operates on a set of predicted classes and their corresponding actual classes. This is different; it’s a post-processing classification measure, not a parameter directly informing the model tree splits.

The mismatch arises when the custom F1 calculation is inadvertently operating on data that differs slightly from the data ranger actually uses for scoring later, or if there is an implementation issue in the F1 function itself. This could stem from incorrect application of thresholds, use of incorrect actual class labels, or anything along these lines. I recall a project where I had accidentally mixed up the levels in my factor variable in the custom function, resulting in high training scores and complete garbage during testing and deployment. It’s subtle errors like this that often go unnoticed.

Let me illustrate this with code snippets.

**Snippet 1: A Basic (Potentially Flawed) F1 Calculation Function**

```R
library(caret)
library(ranger)

# Assume 'my_data' and 'my_labels' exist

my_f1 <- function(data, lev = NULL, model = NULL) {
  predictions <- factor(ifelse(data$pred[,"class1"] > 0.5, "class1", "class2"), levels= c("class1", "class2"))
  actuals <- data$obs
  cm <- caret::confusionMatrix(predictions, actuals, positive = "class1")
  f1_score <- cm$byClass[["F1"]]

  names(f1_score) <- "F1"
  f1_score

}
# example usage with some simple data setup
set.seed(123)
my_data <- data.frame(
  feature1 = rnorm(100),
  feature2 = rnorm(100),
  class = sample(c("class1", "class2"), 100, replace=TRUE)
)
my_data$class <- factor(my_data$class, levels=c("class1", "class2"))
my_labels<- my_data$class

trControl <- caret::trainControl(
  method = "cv",
  number = 5,
  summaryFunction = my_f1,
  classProbs = TRUE,
  savePredictions = TRUE
)
rf_model <- caret::train(class ~ ., data=my_data, method = "ranger", trControl=trControl)

print(rf_model$results) # examine the training scores
# Let's try a prediction
test_data <- data.frame(feature1 = rnorm(10), feature2 = rnorm(10))
predictions <- predict(rf_model, test_data, type="prob")
predicted_classes <- factor(ifelse(predictions[,"class1"] > 0.5, "class1", "class2"), levels= c("class1", "class2"))
# Then, in a real-world setting, you might be disappointed.
```

In the above code, the custom f1 score calculation might appear to function correctly; you’d get high training F1 values as part of `rf_model$results`. But remember, this F1 is applied to resampled training data and *not* during the prediction phase. So, a high value here does not mean your model is good in a general sense.

**Snippet 2: A Potential Fix – Ensuring Correct Class Level Ordering**

The issue often lies in misaligned level definitions, particularly if the class variable is a factor. Let's revise the previous example.

```R
library(caret)
library(ranger)

# Assume 'my_data' and 'my_labels' exist

my_f1_fixed <- function(data, lev = NULL, model = NULL) {
   # Correct extraction from predicted probabilities, explicitly using 'lev'
  predictions <- factor(ifelse(data$pred[,lev[1]] > 0.5, lev[1], lev[2]), levels= lev)
  actuals <- data$obs
  cm <- caret::confusionMatrix(predictions, actuals, positive = lev[1])
  f1_score <- cm$byClass[["F1"]]

  names(f1_score) <- "F1"
  f1_score
}
# example usage with some simple data setup
set.seed(123)
my_data <- data.frame(
  feature1 = rnorm(100),
  feature2 = rnorm(100),
  class = sample(c("class1", "class2"), 100, replace=TRUE)
)
my_data$class <- factor(my_data$class, levels=c("class1", "class2"))
my_labels<- my_data$class

trControl <- caret::trainControl(
  method = "cv",
  number = 5,
  summaryFunction = my_f1_fixed,
  classProbs = TRUE,
  savePredictions = TRUE
)
rf_model_fixed <- caret::train(class ~ ., data=my_data, method = "ranger", trControl=trControl)

print(rf_model_fixed$results) # examine the training scores

# Let's try a prediction
test_data <- data.frame(feature1 = rnorm(10), feature2 = rnorm(10))
predictions <- predict(rf_model_fixed, test_data, type="prob")
predicted_classes <- factor(ifelse(predictions[,"class1"] > 0.5, "class1", "class2"), levels= c("class1", "class2"))
# Now, your real-world performance should be more consistent with what you see in training.
```

Here, I've made a crucial change: I extract the positive level directly from the `lev` argument within the custom function, meaning it dynamically adjusts based on how caret sets up the problem, specifically ensuring it understands the order of class levels. This is a common source of error; when `lev` and the class probabilities are used consistently during both training summary computation and later prediction, that disconnect often vanishes. This will be reflected in more realistic and reliable predictions.

**Snippet 3: A General Approach with Threshold Optimization (More Advanced)**

For a more robust approach, one might consider optimizing the threshold for the probabilities, this will more closely reflect the behavior of other classification algorithms. It's significantly more involved, but consider this a glimpse at a highly sophisticated alternative:

```R
library(caret)
library(ranger)
library(pROC)

# Assume 'my_data' and 'my_labels' exist
optim_f1 <- function(data, lev = NULL, model = NULL) {
    actuals <- data$obs
    probs <- data$pred[, lev[1]]
    roc_obj <- roc(actuals, probs)
    coords_obj <- coords(roc_obj, x = "best", best.method="youden", best.weights=c(1,1)) # Youden's J Index
    best_threshold <- coords_obj$threshold

    predictions <- factor(ifelse(probs > best_threshold, lev[1], lev[2]), levels=lev)

  cm <- caret::confusionMatrix(predictions, actuals, positive=lev[1])
  f1_score <- cm$byClass[["F1"]]
  names(f1_score) <- "F1"
  f1_score

}


set.seed(123)
my_data <- data.frame(
  feature1 = rnorm(100),
  feature2 = rnorm(100),
  class = sample(c("class1", "class2"), 100, replace=TRUE)
)
my_data$class <- factor(my_data$class, levels=c("class1", "class2"))
my_labels<- my_data$class


trControl_opt <- caret::trainControl(
  method = "cv",
  number = 5,
  summaryFunction = optim_f1,
  classProbs = TRUE,
  savePredictions = TRUE
)
rf_model_opt <- caret::train(class ~ ., data = my_data, method = "ranger", trControl = trControl_opt)

print(rf_model_opt$results)
# Let's see how it behaves on test data
test_data <- data.frame(feature1 = rnorm(10), feature2 = rnorm(10))
predictions <- predict(rf_model_opt, test_data, type = "prob")

# Now, we must apply the same threshold calculation logic
# First, the optimal thresholds would need to be calculated per resample fold
# ...This is beyond the scope here, but it is how you would do it, ideally.
# However, let us try a simple version with a 0.5 cutoff for illustration purposes
predicted_classes <- factor(ifelse(predictions[,"class1"] > 0.5, "class1", "class2"), levels= c("class1", "class2"))
```

Here, I’ve incorporated a threshold optimization procedure using `pROC`, determining the optimal cut-off based on Youden’s J-statistic. While this makes the training process slightly more complex, it provides a more nuanced F1 calculation. The major limitation is that to make the test predictions have the same properties as the training predictions, the threshold would also have to be calculated from the test set which is a big no-no for evaluation purposes, and therefore I have applied a default 0.5 threshold in the test portion. You'll notice that you need to calculate the best threshold on each resampled fold to make a fair comparison during training and testing. That is how you would do it correctly. It’s vital this is also replicated on any new data, making the whole process more complex than using a basic threshold.

**Resources:**

For a deeper understanding, I highly recommend consulting the caret documentation itself. The documentation has sections that go into fine detail about custom evaluation metrics. Also, “Applied Predictive Modeling” by Max Kuhn (the creator of caret) and Kjell Johnson is essential. It provides the theoretical background and concrete examples of model training. For `pROC` related material, the official package documentation is the best resource. Understanding the mathematics of the F1 score and its components (precision and recall), and how these relate to confusion matrices is of paramount importance; it's crucial that the concepts are well understood as misapplication of even a single aspect will yield the problems you are experiencing.

In essence, the problem lies not in ranger or caret itself, but in how the custom evaluation function is implemented and the lack of symmetry in its application during training and testing. Carefully consider these nuances, and your model will likely perform more consistently.
