, let’s tackle this. I’ve certainly seen this phenomenon in several projects over the years, and it can be quite frustrating. You've built a custom loss function, everything seems to be working at first, but then the training starts to slow down significantly, even stall completely. This isn’t uncommon, and there are several interrelated reasons why this might occur. It’s rarely a single cause, but often a combination of factors that cumulatively impact training performance.

The root cause frequently lies in how your custom loss function interacts with the optimization algorithm, usually some variant of stochastic gradient descent (sgd). The key takeaway here is that sgd, and its more advanced relatives like adam or rmsprop, rely on smoothly varying gradients to effectively navigate the loss landscape. Your custom loss function may, inadvertently, create a very different or more difficult landscape compared to the standard loss functions these optimizers are trained on.

First, let's talk about **gradient instability**. Custom loss functions, especially those involving complex mathematical operations, can easily generate vanishing or exploding gradients. Vanishing gradients happen when the magnitude of the gradients becomes excessively small, preventing parameter updates from occurring efficiently. Conversely, exploding gradients are when the magnitudes are too large and cause parameters to jump erratically, again hindering the optimization process. It’s essentially the optimizer being unable to find the path of steepest descent because that path is no longer smooth and well-defined.

I recall a time I was working on a novel object detection system, and I introduced a custom loss function that included a very high-powered exponential term for a particular error metric. It seemed like a great idea on paper to penalize outliers aggressively. Initially, the training was smooth; everything converged quickly. However, after a few epochs, the training slowed down dramatically. Looking at the gradients' magnitudes during training confirmed my suspicion: they were exploding. The large exponential term, which was intended to be an advantage, was pushing the weights into regions of the parameter space that created massively large gradients. I ended up having to normalize the exponential term, and that improved things significantly.

Another issue often encountered is related to **non-differentiability or near-non-differentiability** of some components within your custom loss. Optimizers like sgd operate on gradients; if your loss function, even for a very small subset of the input space, doesn’t have well-defined gradients (or has gradients that are exceptionally discontinuous), then the optimization process is going to be hampered significantly. These discontinuities are, in effect, barriers for the optimizer, making progress slow and cumbersome. You don't need to completely break differentiability; even near non-differentiable parts can create plateaus or areas of very shallow gradients which cause optimization stagnation.

Finally, **computational complexity** can also play a significant role. A custom loss function, even if mathematically sound, might involve much more computationally intensive calculations than simpler, standard losses like cross-entropy or mean squared error. If your loss computation involves intricate loops, nested conditional statements, or complex matrix manipulations, it can consume significantly more resources and thus lengthen the training time substantially, particularly if not efficiently implemented. This adds processing overhead for each iteration, and while it might not necessarily degrade *convergence speed* in terms of epochs, it directly degrades the *wall clock time* taken to complete training. It also can cause a backlog in data processing, essentially making your training data unavailable at times.

Let me illustrate these points with some examples using Python and TensorFlow:

**Example 1: A custom loss with exploding gradients**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss_exploding(y_true, y_pred):
    error = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
    # Large power can lead to exploding gradients
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.exp(error*10))

#dummy test run
y_true_dummy = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
y_pred_dummy = tf.constant([1.1, 1.9, 3.2], dtype=tf.float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(y_pred_dummy)
    loss = custom_loss_exploding(y_true_dummy,y_pred_dummy)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, y_pred_dummy)
print("Gradients:",grads.numpy()) # expect very large numbers

```
In this first example, the exponential term with a multiplying factor of 10 on the error directly causes a gradient that tends towards infinity and thus will degrade the training speed.

**Example 2: A non-differentiable function component**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss_non_differentiable(y_true, y_pred):
    error = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
    # tf.maximum creates a non-smooth region around 0
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.maximum(error - 0.5, 0))

#dummy test run
y_true_dummy = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
y_pred_dummy = tf.constant([1.1, 1.9, 3.2], dtype=tf.float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(y_pred_dummy)
    loss = custom_loss_non_differentiable(y_true_dummy,y_pred_dummy)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, y_pred_dummy)
print("Gradients:",grads.numpy()) # expect 0 gradients for certain values
```

Here, using `tf.maximum` introduces a point of non-differentiability or near-non-differentiability, which can lead to stagnation of training.

**Example 3: A computationally expensive custom loss**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def custom_loss_expensive(y_true, y_pred):
    batch_size = tf.shape(y_true)[0]
    total_loss = tf.constant(0.0,dtype=tf.float32)
    for i in range(batch_size):
        # computationally expensive operation inside loop
        diff = y_true[i] - y_pred[i]
        matrix = tf.random.normal((100, 100), dtype=tf.float32)
        inner_product = tf.matmul(tf.reshape(diff,(1,1)), matrix)
        total_loss+=tf.reduce_sum(inner_product)
    return total_loss / tf.cast(batch_size, dtype=tf.float32)


#dummy test run
y_true_dummy = tf.constant(np.random.rand(10,2), dtype=tf.float32)
y_pred_dummy = tf.constant(np.random.rand(10,2), dtype=tf.float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(y_pred_dummy)
    loss = custom_loss_expensive(y_true_dummy,y_pred_dummy)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, y_pred_dummy)
print("Gradients:",grads.numpy())

```

In the third example, the nested for loop containing a computationally heavy matrix multiplication will drastically reduce the speed of your training, because that will add a large overhead per training step. The for loop structure inhibits parallel processing and further slows the calculations.

To mitigate these issues, I typically advise taking a few steps. First, *carefully review the mathematical structure* of your custom loss function. Make sure every operation is differentiable or at least nearly differentiable. You may want to smooth out areas of abrupt change. Sometimes, you may even have to replace certain components of your loss with approximations that are easier to work with. Second, monitor your gradients during training; use tools like TensorBoard to track their magnitude. Look for vanishing or exploding patterns and consider gradient clipping or other normalization methods if you observe any signs of this. Third, *profile the computation* of your loss function. Are there any obvious bottlenecks you can optimize? Replacing loops with vectorized operations using functions native to your deep learning framework (e.g., `tf.matmul` instead of loops in TensorFlow) often will provide speed gains. If possible, try to work towards using standardized loss functions or combining your custom loss with existing ones to get best results. Finally, be judicious about penalization, and remember that large penalties do not necessarily equate to better performance, and can in some cases hurt performance, so always experiment.

For further reading, I recommend checking out the classic work *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville for a thorough background on loss functions and optimization. Also, the various papers from the authors on optimization and gradient descent can be invaluable. These resources provide an understanding of the fundamental mathematics behind optimization, which will greatly help when designing your custom loss functions.

In summary, a custom loss function can be a double-edged sword. The flexibility it provides can be powerful, but the challenges it introduces often demand careful engineering to ensure your training proceeds efficiently.
