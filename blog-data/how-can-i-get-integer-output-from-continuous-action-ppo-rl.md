,  I've certainly been down this road before, especially when trying to apply reinforcement learning to robotics control where discrete actions, such as gear shifts or actuator positions, are often preferable to a continuous space. The challenge, as you’ve discovered, is that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) inherently deals with continuous action spaces – usually outputting actions as real numbers or vectors, often floating-point values. To bridge that gap and get usable integer outputs, we need to introduce some intelligent discretization and mapping mechanisms.

The core issue arises because PPO, at its heart, learns a policy function that directly outputs the parameters of a probability distribution over the action space. In the case of continuous spaces, this distribution is typically a Gaussian (or similar). This produces actions that can take any value within a specified range, and these are seldom integers. To transform this, we need a pipeline that performs the following:

1.  **Policy Output Processing**: Allow PPO to learn parameters representing the underlying continuous space.
2.  **Discretization**: Convert those parameters into discrete, integer actions.
3.  **Handling of Action Boundaries**: Ensure generated integers fall within the permissible, predefined ranges for actions.

Over the years, I’ve seen a few approaches work effectively. I’ve found that a combination of careful discretization and potential post-processing is most practical. Let's break down three specific methods I've employed.

**Method 1: Simple Rounding with Clipping**

This is often the first, and sometimes surprisingly effective, approach. We simply round the continuous action produced by the PPO algorithm to the nearest integer and then clip it to ensure it falls within the defined bounds of the discrete action space.

Here’s how you might implement this in Python, assuming your PPO implementation returns a floating-point action `action_float`:

```python
import numpy as np

def discretize_action_rounding(action_float, min_action, max_action):
    """
    Discretizes a continuous action by rounding and clipping.

    Args:
        action_float (float): The continuous action value from PPO.
        min_action (int): The minimum allowed discrete action value.
        max_action (int): The maximum allowed discrete action value.

    Returns:
        int: The discretized integer action.
    """
    action_int = int(round(action_float))
    return np.clip(action_int, min_action, max_action)


# Example usage
min_action_val = 0
max_action_val = 5
float_action = 2.7
discrete_action = discretize_action_rounding(float_action, min_action_val, max_action_val)
print(f"Continuous Action: {float_action}, Discrete Action: {discrete_action}")

float_action = -1.2
discrete_action = discretize_action_rounding(float_action, min_action_val, max_action_val)
print(f"Continuous Action: {float_action}, Discrete Action: {discrete_action}")

float_action = 6.9
discrete_action = discretize_action_rounding(float_action, min_action_val, max_action_val)
print(f"Continuous Action: {float_action}, Discrete Action: {discrete_action}")
```
This code shows how to simply take a floating point action and round it, before clipping the results to the min and max action values.

This method’s simplicity is its strength. It’s computationally inexpensive, easy to implement, and often provides an acceptable solution, especially when the underlying continuous action space learned by PPO isn’t too sensitive. However, a notable limitation is that it can be difficult to get fine-grained control near the boundaries, particularly if the PPO output ranges broadly.

**Method 2: Linear Scaling and Discretization**

A more nuanced approach involves scaling the continuous PPO output to the desired range of integers before discretizing. Instead of just directly rounding, we perform a linear transformation. Assume the raw output from PPO (which could be a value between, say -1 and 1, depending on normalization) needs to be mapped to an integer range `[min_action, max_action]`.

```python
import numpy as np

def discretize_action_linear_scaling(action_float, min_action, max_action, action_space_min=-1, action_space_max=1):
    """
    Discretizes a continuous action by linearly scaling and then rounding and clipping.

    Args:
        action_float (float): The continuous action value from PPO, assumed in [-1, 1].
        min_action (int): The minimum allowed discrete action value.
        max_action (int): The maximum allowed discrete action value.
        action_space_min(float): The minimum of the continuous action space (default = -1).
        action_space_max(float): The maximum of the continuous action space (default = 1).

    Returns:
        int: The discretized integer action.
    """

    scaled_action = ((action_float - action_space_min) / (action_space_max - action_space_min)) * (max_action - min_action) + min_action
    action_int = int(round(scaled_action))
    return np.clip(action_int, min_action, max_action)

# Example usage

min_action_val = 0
max_action_val = 5
float_action = 0.5
discrete_action = discretize_action_linear_scaling(float_action, min_action_val, max_action_val)
print(f"Continuous Action: {float_action}, Discrete Action: {discrete_action}")

float_action = -0.2
discrete_action = discretize_action_linear_scaling(float_action, min_action_val, max_action_val)
print(f"Continuous Action: {float_action}, Discrete Action: {discrete_action}")

float_action = 0.9
discrete_action = discretize_action_linear_scaling(float_action, min_action_val, max_action_val)
print(f"Continuous Action: {float_action}, Discrete Action: {discrete_action}")
```

This example shows how to linearly map the continuous action, assumed to lie between -1 and 1, to the desired integer range before rounding and clipping.

This technique often leads to a better spread of actions across the discrete space and can improve the overall learning performance over simple rounding in situations where your PPO produces values in a canonical range (e.g., [-1,1]). The scaling step helps make full use of the available action space and avoids all values tending to be at the center of the range. The effectiveness here is contingent on how well your PPO output is normalized and how the min and max values are set.

**Method 3: Using a Discrete Action Layer**

When neither simple rounding nor scaling proves sufficient, and you need tighter control, I've found it beneficial to introduce an explicit discrete action layer directly following the policy network in PPO. You modify your neural network such that the final layers output logits (unnormalized log probabilities) over a discrete action space rather than the continuous action parameters. In this approach, we modify the neural network used by PPO such that the last layer has the correct number of outputs for the number of discrete actions available. This involves an extra layer on top of the usual PPO network. The last layer maps to the size of the discrete space, before taking the argmax.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import numpy as np

class DiscretePolicy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_discrete_actions):
        super(DiscretePolicy, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_discrete_actions)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        logits = self.fc2(x)
        return logits


def get_discrete_action(logits):
    """
    Maps a set of logits from the neural network to the most likely discrete action

    Args:
      logits (tensor): The output of the neural network representing logits for each discrete action.

    Returns:
        int: The discrete action selected
    """
    probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
    action_int = torch.argmax(probs).item()
    return action_int


#Example Usage

input_size = 10  # Example input size
hidden_size = 64 # Example hidden size
num_discrete_actions = 6 # The number of discrete actions

policy = DiscretePolicy(input_size, hidden_size, num_discrete_actions)

#Assume you have input data x (tensor)
x = torch.randn(1,input_size) # Batch size 1

logits = policy(x)
action = get_discrete_action(logits)

print(f"Logits: {logits}, Discrete Action: {action}")
```
This example shows how to create a simple neural network that outputs logits for the number of discrete actions, rather than continuous values. It then shows how to obtain the action.

The advantage here is that you are now directly training the neural network to output probabilities over your discrete action set, thus moving away from the need for post-hoc discretisation. It more naturally fits into the PPO framework and generally produces much better results. It’s important to adjust the PPO loss function and update steps to correctly handle the discrete nature of the outputs, as you no longer have a continuous action distribution.

**Recommendations for Further Reading**

To delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings and alternative methods, I would suggest exploring the following resources:

*   **"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto**: This book provides a thorough grounding in the theory of reinforcement learning, including a discussion of both discrete and continuous action spaces.
*   **"Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On" by Maxim Lapan**: This provides practical insights with coding examples for various reinforcement learning techniques, including policy gradient methods like PPO.
*   **Original PPO paper (Schulman et al., 2017) "Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms"**: While the paper focuses more on continuous actions, it’s imperative to understand how the basic algorithm functions to be able to modify it. A detailed understanding of the algorithm's mechanics is often vital when tackling the more difficult task of discretisation.

These are not exhaustive, but they’ll provide a solid foundation. From my experience, understanding the principles behind these techniques is crucial.

In summary, obtaining integer outputs from a continuous action PPO involves introducing a layer that maps the PPO output to the desired integer action space. The simplest method involves direct rounding and clipping. Then scaling the values before discretising can help with coverage of the action space. For more control and better performance in many applications a direct discrete action layer can be used. Which approach to use depends heavily on the specific details of your problem and the behavior of your PPO algorithm, but by carefully considering the options described above you'll have a much better chance of successfully obtaining discrete actions for your use cases.
