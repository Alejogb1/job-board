Let's tackle this one, shall we? I’ve actually bumped into this exact scenario a few times, especially when dealing with complex data flows involving asynchronous operations. The reason your React state updates within an async function sometimes only show the initial value in your console.log, and not the updated value, stems from how JavaScript's event loop and React's state update batching mechanisms interplay. It’s not necessarily a bug; it's more about understanding the asynchronous nature of state updates in React and how they might interact with async operations like promises or async/await functions.

Think of it this way: When React encounters a `setState` call, it doesn't immediately modify the state. Instead, it schedules an update. This is a crucial aspect of React's optimization – batching multiple state updates into a single render cycle. Inside an async function, things can get a little trickier. When your async function is initiated, it's important to recognize that this function might be executed as a result of an event, for instance, a button click. When `setState` is called within this function, it doesn’t mean that React immediately updates the state for you. Instead, it signals that a re-render is needed, but React optimizes these actions and places them in a queue, essentially.

The critical part comes down to closures and JavaScript's execution context. When an async function executes, the code *inside* the function is often running at a point in time *after* the initial render cycle triggered the async action. So, the console.log you’ve placed after a `setState` may not necessarily reflect the updated value because the actual update hasn't been applied by React yet when that log is being called. In many instances, the async action concludes before the state update is even rendered.

Let's break this down with some code examples. Imagine a scenario where you're fetching data and then updating a counter.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const fetchDataAndUpdateCount = async () => {
        console.log('Initial count before fetch:', count); // Logs the initial value

        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Simulate API call

        setCount(count + 1);

        console.log('Count after set state:', count); // Often logs the initial value, not the updated
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={fetchDataAndUpdateCount}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default MyComponent;

```
In this example, when you click the "Increment" button, you'll see that the first log outputs the current count before the `setState` call. However, because the function is asynchronous and React batches the updates, the second `console.log` inside the async function will usually log the *previous* value of `count`, not the new one, as it hasn’t yet been updated in the render. The update won't be applied until after the entire `fetchDataAndUpdateCount` function completes and React re-renders based on the scheduled state update. It’s the asynchronous nature of Javascript and how React schedules these changes that explains why you're not seeing the intermediate updates.

Now, what if you need the correct value immediately after you’ve set it? The solution isn’t to try to force React to update instantly, but to understand that the state updates become a callback of sorts in a render cycle. To overcome this, there are better approaches. One common solution is to use the functional form of `setState`, which gives you the previous state as an argument. This method guarantees that you're working with the *latest* state value.

Let’s modify the example to use this.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const fetchDataAndUpdateCount = async () => {
         console.log('Initial count before fetch:', count);

         await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Simulate API call

         setCount(prevCount => {
             const newCount = prevCount + 1;
             console.log('Count in setState callback:', newCount);
             return newCount;
         });
    };

     return (
        <div>
             <p>Count: {count}</p>
             <button onClick={fetchDataAndUpdateCount}>Increment</button>
        </div>
     );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

Here, by using `setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)`, the state update is now based on the most recent version of the state. Crucially, the `console.log` within the `setState` callback will log the correct *updated* value because it is executed during the state change process and not the earlier asynchronous function. This change allows the updated value of the state to be correctly reflected. It’s a subtle change, but it fundamentally alters how React processes and updates the value, aligning with the asynchronous behavior of JavaScript.

Another case is if you require actions to run only *after* the re-render has completed based on a state update. In this circumstance, the `useEffect` hook is your go-to. `useEffect` is triggered after the rendering process is completed, so it is the appropriate location to place code that needs to run after rendering has finished.

Here's an example illustrating the use of `useEffect` to observe the state change properly.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const fetchDataAndUpdateCount = async () => {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
      console.log('Count after re-render:', count);
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={fetchDataAndUpdateCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this modified code snippet, the `useEffect` hook is employed to console log the count variable, and is only called again when that value changes based on the array parameter it is given. By using `useEffect`, you are observing the count value *after* the re-render, capturing the updated value after React has performed its necessary reconciliation. This approach will ensure that your console outputs the correct value.

To delve deeper into this, I’d highly recommend looking into the ‘Thinking in React’ documentation on the React website. Additionally, understanding the JavaScript event loop is critical, so resources such as ‘What the heck is the event loop anyway?’ by Philip Roberts and ‘You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance’ by Kyle Simpson are excellent resources. Reading about React reconciliation algorithms and state batching mechanisms can greatly help solidify understanding on the inner workings of React's update process as well.

In summary, the key here is understanding that React's `setState` is asynchronous, and React batches multiple updates. When working inside async functions, use the functional form of `setState` when you need to access the new state immediately, and if the side effects need to occur after the render, or if you want to observe the state after each render, use the `useEffect` hook. By understanding these mechanics, you can avoid common pitfalls and write more robust and predictable React applications.
