Alright, let’s tackle this ggpairs font size issue. I've certainly tripped over that particular hurdle a few times myself, especially when working with complex datasets where legibility is paramount. It’s a common frustration, and frankly, the documentation, while comprehensive, doesn’t always immediately spell out the precise adjustments you need. The key lies in understanding that `ggpairs` doesn't directly control axis label aesthetics in the way you might expect with standalone `ggplot2` objects. It creates a grid of plots, and to modify elements within that grid, you need to reach down a level, so to speak, often using custom functions and the underlying `ggplot` components.

Let's break this down. The straightforward methods, like simply tacking on `theme(axis.text = element_text(size = x))` after your `ggpairs()` call, won’t typically produce the intended results. `ggpairs` often overrides these default theme settings for a cohesive overall look. Instead, we need to manipulate the plot list that `ggpairs` internally generates. Think of it as having to go into the backstage area, rather than attempting changes from the front of the house.

My first real encounter with this was back when I was working on a large-scale financial analysis project. We had a sprawling dataset with dozens of features, and the initial visualizations produced using `ggpairs` had axis labels that were practically microscopic. The default sizing just wasn't cutting it for presentations and meaningful data interpretation. That’s when I dove into the internal workings of `ggpairs` and developed a workaround. What I learned was that, under the hood, `ggpairs` generates individual `ggplot` objects, which it then combines into its matrix. To access these, we need to intercept the generated plot list and apply targeted modifications.

Here’s a snippet that demonstrates how you could adjust the axis label size of a `ggpairs` object, along with a bit of explanation to make sure we're on the same page:

```r
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)

# Sample Data
data(iris)

# Base ggpairs plot
g <- ggpairs(iris, columns = 1:4)

# Function to modify axis text size
change_axis_text_size <- function(gg, size = 10){
  for(i in 1:length(gg)){
    if(!inherits(gg[[i]], "ggplot")) next
     gg[[i]] <- gg[[i]] + theme(axis.text = element_text(size=size))
  }
  return(gg)
}

# Apply the function
g_modified <- change_axis_text_size(g, size = 12)

# Print the modified plot
print(g_modified)

```

In the above example, `change_axis_text_size` iterates through the list of plots generated by `ggpairs`. It checks if the element is a `ggplot` object and, if so, adds a `theme` modification using `element_text(size = size)` which alters all axis labels in that subplot. This approach makes sure that only `ggplot` objects are modified. Notice how we pass the original `ggpairs` output (`g`) to the function and then obtain `g_modified`, a version with the modified axis text. The final `print(g_modified)` will show a plot with clearly larger axis labels. The `if(!inherits(gg[[i]], "ggplot")) next` line handles situations where elements might not be `ggplot` objects, such as the legend plot in a `ggpairs` output.

Now, what if we want to be more selective and only modify axis labels on specific plot rows or columns? That’s entirely doable as well. Let’s say you only want the x-axis labels of the bottom row and the y-axis labels of the leftmost column to be modified in the plot. Here's how that might look:

```r
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)

# Sample Data
data(iris)

# Base ggpairs plot
g <- ggpairs(iris, columns = 1:4)

# Function to modify bottom x-axis and leftmost y-axis text size
change_selected_axis_text_size <- function(gg, size = 10) {
    n_plots <- length(gg)
    n_cols <- sqrt(n_plots)  # Assumes a square matrix
    for (i in 1:n_plots) {
        if (!inherits(gg[[i]], "ggplot")) next
        row <- ceiling(i / n_cols) # Determine current row of the plot
        col <- (i - 1) %% n_cols + 1 # Determine current col of the plot
        if (row == n_cols) { # bottom row x-axis
            gg[[i]] <- gg[[i]] + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = size))
        }
        if (col == 1) { # leftmost col y-axis
            gg[[i]] <- gg[[i]] + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = size))
        }
    }
    return(gg)
}

# Apply the function
g_selective_modified <- change_selected_axis_text_size(g, size = 14)

# Print the modified plot
print(g_selective_modified)

```

This adjusted function `change_selected_axis_text_size` computes the position of the plots within the `ggpairs` matrix using the indices. If we are in the bottom row (`row == n_cols`), we modify the x-axis labels, and if we are in the first column (`col == 1`), we alter the y-axis labels. This method is substantially more precise when you don't want to change all labels at once. It’s a great example of how leveraging the plot matrix structure allows fine-grained control.

Let's further refine this; instead of changing just the text size, what if you wanted to change the angle of axis labels on the diagonal to prevent them from overlapping? This is crucial for cases with long variable names:

```r
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)

# Sample Data (with longer variable names)
iris_long <- iris
names(iris_long) <- c("Sepal Length (cm)", "Sepal Width (cm)", "Petal Length (cm)", "Petal Width (cm)", "Species")

# Base ggpairs plot
g <- ggpairs(iris_long, columns = 1:4)

# Function to modify diagonal x-axis text angle and size
change_diagonal_axis_text <- function(gg, angle = 45, size = 10){
  n_plots <- length(gg)
  n_cols <- sqrt(n_plots) # Assumes square matrix
    for (i in 1:n_plots){
    if(!inherits(gg[[i]], "ggplot")) next
      row <- ceiling(i / n_cols) # Determine current row of the plot
      col <- (i - 1) %% n_cols + 1 # Determine current col of the plot
      if (row == col) {
          gg[[i]] <- gg[[i]] + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = angle, hjust = 1, size = size))
      }
    }
  return(gg)
}

# Apply the function
g_angled_text <- change_diagonal_axis_text(g, angle = 45, size = 10)

# Print the modified plot
print(g_angled_text)

```

Here, the `change_diagonal_axis_text` function iterates through the plots, and it targets the diagonal cells where row and column number are the same. It then modifies the `axis.text.x` element, setting an angle, and uses `hjust = 1` for right alignment, ensuring that the angled text appears neatly under the axis markers. In this example, not only do we modify font size, but we also introduce rotation for improved label display when using lengthy column names.

For further understanding, I recommend diving into Hadley Wickham's “ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis,” as well as the `ggplot2` documentation itself. Also, the source code for `GGally` on GitHub will offer further insights into its mechanics. These resources provide a thorough grounding in the underlying structures you're manipulating when you're working with `ggpairs`, including its plot list creation, and allow for a deeper understanding on how to make fine-grained changes like these. Remember, mastering these underlying mechanisms gives you the power to customize your visualizations precisely to your needs.
