,  I’ve definitely seen my share of jailing escapades over the years, and blocking access to specific directories within a jailed environment in WHM, well, that’s a common requirement for security hardening. The good news is that it's entirely achievable, and there are a few methods we can employ, each with its nuances. My experience stems from managing hosting infrastructures for several years, where we’ve had to lock down systems with varying degrees of paranoia.

The core issue here revolves around the chroot jail environment, and how we control the filesystem visibility from within. By default, when a user is jailed, they're confined to their home directory and potentially a few other common areas, but their reach can still extend beyond what's necessary. To restrict access further, we need to leverage either `mount` commands and file system permissions or symlink manipulations. I’ll steer clear of overly complex methods involving custom PAM modules, as they can introduce unforeseen issues and have a larger attack surface.

The easiest approach in most cases, in my opinion, is using `mount --bind`. This allows us to mount one directory at a different location, essentially creating a mirror, but more importantly, it gives us control over what users see. Crucially, we don't provide access to the mount destination in the jailed environment. For example, if we have a directory `/home/shared_data` that contains data we don’t want jailed users accessing directly, here’s how we’d tackle it:

```bash
# First, create an empty directory in a location the jailed users will see, e.g., inside their chrooted environment
mkdir -p /home/username/disabled_shared_data

# Now, we bind-mount that location to /home/shared_data,
# effectively making it appear as an empty folder
mount --bind /dev/null /home/username/disabled_shared_data

# To ensure this persists after reboot, add it to /etc/fstab
# /dev/null /home/username/disabled_shared_data none bind 0 0
```

Notice I mounted `/dev/null`. This effectively makes it appear as an empty directory, thereby blocking access. After running these commands, any attempts by the jailed user to explore the `/home/username/disabled_shared_data` directory will reveal an empty structure even if `/home/shared_data` holds important files.

Remember, the above applies to individual users, denoted by `username`. So we'd ideally use a bash script to iterate through all jailed users, creating and mounting these directories for each of them, ensuring broad application across the system. There's also the more sophisticated use of directory permissions if you want to prevent any access for those specific jailed users, but mount points give us more granular control. For persistence across server restarts, the `/etc/fstab` entry is important.

An alternative approach, slightly more complex but potentially useful, involves manipulating symbolic links. Imagine you have a situation where bind mounts are insufficient, perhaps due to dynamic directory structures. In this situation, you might consider symlinking a blocked directory to `/dev/null`. The issue here, is that if the target directory exists inside of a jailed users chroot location, symlinking to `/dev/null` outside of the chroot environment may be problematic. It's more advisable to use chrooted path locations or utilize mount points if possible. However, let's say you were creating a new jail structure. Before populating the jail with files, the following could be used:

```bash
# inside the new jail environment for the user
# mkdir -p /home/username/dangerous_location
# cd /home/username/

# This might look like it grants access to /dev/null, but it's within the chroot environment,
# so it's a no-op from a user's perspective
# ln -s /dev/null  dangerous_location

#Now populate the user's folder with other files.
```

The user will see a symlink, but on following it they'll simply not see anything. Again, `/dev/null` within the jail environment is meaningless, it's the system's `/dev/null` that matters, and the jail should never allow access to it. This is why mount points are more reliable. It’s key to understand that the symlink needs to point to a location that is either empty or unavailable within the chrooted filesystem. If the target location exists within the jail, it doesn't offer any real security advantage. For example, a symlink to a writable folder would be disastrous.

Another area of interest, especially within WHM, is the potential to leverage the system’s internal mechanisms for chroot management. Often, WHM’s user management tools provide an interface to configure jail settings. However, relying solely on these UIs can be limiting, and often what ends up happening is the modification of the user’s configuration files that affect the chroot configuration. This is usually contained within a user’s configuration directory. Let's assume you've created a custom jail template. Inside the configuration for this template you could create some bash commands to add the required mount or symlink information during the creation process of the user. This could look like:

```bash
#Example configuration snippet for a jail creation process, this should reside within the whm configuration
#
# Inside the script where user jail is created, assume $user is the user to jail, and $user_home is their home location
user_home="/home/$user"
mkdir -p "$user_home/disabled_share"

mount --bind /dev/null  "$user_home/disabled_share"
# Now configure fstab to include this mount after creation.
echo "/dev/null $user_home/disabled_share none bind 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```

This example demonstrates how one might create an empty disabled share during the jail setup within the system.

It’s vital to test these changes thoroughly after implementation. Logging into the jailed user's account and trying to navigate through the supposed forbidden directories will confirm that the configuration has been applied correctly. Use `ls -al` or similar commands to assess what directories are visible and accessible to the jailed user. Furthermore, ensure that your changes persist across server reboots by reviewing your `/etc/fstab` entries.

For further reading, I'd recommend exploring the classic text "Unix System Security: A Guide for Users and System Administrators" by David A. Curry. It provides a great foundation on chroot environments and access control mechanisms. Also, dive into the `mount` man pages on your specific linux distribution; for example, `man mount` within the terminal. Understanding the nuances of the mount command will be incredibly useful. The Red Hat System Administrator's guide also offers good guidance on practical linux system security, especially for managing services that utilize jailed environments.

In closing, achieving directory access control within jailed WHM environments requires careful planning and a deep understanding of linux filesystem permissions and mount points. While there isn't a single solution, using bind mounts and symbolic link manipulation, coupled with the proper usage of WHM’s configuration settings, generally provides the most robust and manageable approach. Don't neglect thorough testing; this process helps ensure the security configuration is effective and avoids unintended access.
