Okay, let's tackle this. I've seen this scenario crop up more than a few times, typically when someone's trying to build a live, interactive application with machine learning inference. The problem – Keras model output not readily making its way across a WebSocket – usually boils down to a few key points. It's rarely an issue directly with Keras itself, but rather the way its output is being handled in the asynchronous workflow around a WebSocket connection.

First off, let's acknowledge that Keras, by itself, is a model-building and training library. It's designed to process input data through a neural network and generate predictions, typically as numpy arrays or tensors. WebSocket, on the other hand, is a bidirectional communication protocol designed for transmitting data between a client and server. They operate in entirely different domains, and thus, the bridge between them is where things can get complicated.

The heart of the issue isn't *if* the output can be sent, but *how* it’s being structured and serialized for transmission. WebSocket transmits data as frames, and these frames typically contain strings, bytes, or serialized objects. Raw numpy arrays or tensors aren’t natively compatible with that system; we need to massage them into a transmittable format. Furthermore, the asynchronous nature of WebSocket communication coupled with the often computationally intensive nature of Keras inference adds another layer of complexity.

Let me paint a picture, drawing from something I experienced a few years back when we were developing a real-time object detection system. We had a Keras model outputting bounding boxes as numpy arrays. Initially, we tried to simply pass these arrays directly to the WebSocket sending function. Surprise, it didn't work. The websocket kept spitting errors about non-string/byte data. The reason: We were trying to ship raw numerical data that the websocket couldn't handle. We needed to explicitly convert these arrays into a format suitable for transmission.

Here’s a simplified example of how this might go wrong and how we can fix it, using python:

```python
import asyncio
import websockets
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
import json

# Example setup - imagine model.predict() returns numpy array
def fake_keras_predict():
  return np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.7], [0.8, 0.1, 0.1]])

async def server_handler(websocket, path):
  while True:
      # Simulate model output (replace with actual Keras prediction)
      model_output = fake_keras_predict()

      # Incorrect - trying to send raw numpy, will cause an error
      # await websocket.send(model_output) # This is WRONG

      # Correct - serialize numpy array to JSON
      json_output = json.dumps(model_output.tolist()) # Note the tolist() call
      await websocket.send(json_output)
      await asyncio.sleep(0.1) # Simulate time

async def main():
    async with websockets.serve(server_handler, "localhost", 8765):
        await asyncio.Future() # run forever

if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())

```

This first code snippet is a simple server example demonstrating the fundamental problem. If you try to `websocket.send(model_output)` directly, you’ll find the connection will break. The fix, as demonstrated, is to serialize the output into a compatible format, such as JSON. The crucial part here is the `.tolist()` conversion when working with numpy arrays, which facilitates the transformation into standard Python lists that can be easily encoded to json.

However, let's say our output is more complex – perhaps an image tensor after some preprocessing with Keras layers or a sequence of feature vectors. The naive approach of stringifying the tensor with `str(tensor)` is not optimal. It will create a large, unwieldy string, is hard to deserialize, and is generally inefficient. A binary serialization format becomes a more appropriate choice here. The second snippet focuses on this aspect:

```python
import asyncio
import websockets
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
import pickle # for binary serialization

# Example setup - imagine model.predict() returns a tensor
def fake_keras_predict_tensor():
    return np.random.rand(28, 28, 3).astype(np.float32) # 28x28 RGB Image

async def server_handler(websocket, path):
    while True:
        model_output = fake_keras_predict_tensor()

        # Serialize using pickle for efficient binary transfer
        serialized_output = pickle.dumps(model_output)
        await websocket.send(serialized_output)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)

async def main():
    async with websockets.serve(server_handler, "localhost", 8766):
        await asyncio.Future()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Here, we employ `pickle.dumps()` to serialize our numpy array into a byte stream. This is more efficient than stringification as it encodes the raw numeric data directly. On the client end, one would use `pickle.loads()` to restore the numpy array. Note that pickle is a convenient, built-in method, however, it's essential to know that pickle may not be ideal for every use case, specifically when sharing with different programming languages or environments, where a tool such as protobuf can be more appropriate due to it's language-agnostic implementation. However, for pure Python-based systems, pickle is commonly used as a quick and efficient option.

Finally, let's look at an example that combines the serialization with the inherent asynchronous nature of websockets, utilizing async loops and task queues for optimal performance and responsiveness:

```python
import asyncio
import websockets
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
import json

# Simulate prediction and queuing output
async def predict_and_send(websocket):
    while True:
        model_output = np.random.rand(5).tolist()
        json_output = json.dumps(model_output)
        await websocket.send(json_output)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.01) # Simulate the processing time of the model, faster than typical

async def server_handler(websocket, path):
  print(f"New connection: {websocket.remote_address}")
  try:
    await asyncio.gather(predict_and_send(websocket), websocket.recv()) # Receive is a blocking call
  except websockets.ConnectionClosed as e:
      print(f"Connection closed: {websocket.remote_address} - {e}")

async def main():
    async with websockets.serve(server_handler, "localhost", 8767):
        await asyncio.Future()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

This final snippet addresses concurrency issues. By launching the prediction and sending process as an async task, we avoid blocking the server while it's waiting for client messages. Using `asyncio.gather`, we concurrently run `predict_and_send` and the `websocket.recv()` function. It is important to note that the `recv()` call is actually blocking, meaning that if no message has been sent by the client, the program will stop and wait at that call. This is why a gather is done with another asynchronous process running in order to avoid complete program blockage.

To delve deeper into this topic, I’d recommend several resources. For a solid understanding of WebSockets, familiarize yourself with the official WebSocket protocol specification, RFC 6455. To get a more profound understanding of serialization options, dive into ‘Programming in Python 3’ by Mark Summerfield, which covers various serialization techniques. Finally, to deepen your understanding of asynchronous programming, you may want to explore “Fluent Python” by Luciano Ramalho as it contains a detailed chapter on concurrent programming with asyncio.

In summary, the issue of Keras output not traversing websockets isn’t a limitation of Keras itself, but a consequence of format incompatibility and asynchronous handling. The solution lies in appropriate data serialization techniques and leveraging asynchronous workflows to prevent blocking. Pay close attention to how data is being encoded, and utilize appropriate libraries to handle the serialization and deserialization. With careful design, you can effectively bridge the gap between your Keras model and real-time client interfaces.
