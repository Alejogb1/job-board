,  I’ve bumped into this scenario a few times over the years, usually when dealing with dynamic data pipelines where certain tasks needed a bit of custom tailoring mid-flow. You're asking about overriding a task's argument within an Airflow dag, and frankly, it's a common requirement when you need a bit more control than just static configurations. It's not something Airflow directly provides as a simple "override" function, but we can achieve this behavior through a few clever methods that rely on Airflow’s templating engine and task dependencies.

First, let's establish the challenge. Typically, a task is defined with arguments that are set during dag definition and are usually meant to be constant or at least derive from dag-level parameters. Sometimes you find yourself needing to tweak these arguments for *specific instances* of a task, based on preceding task outputs, xcom values, or even external triggers. Think of it as needing a targeted exception to your task's defined behavior.

The core of the solution lies in dynamically passing information from one task to another. The first technique, and probably the most prevalent, is using XComs combined with Jinja templating. Let’s say you have a python operator with an argument that needs to change based on some condition. Imagine a situation where an upstream task performs some file analysis and needs to pass the name of the processed file to a downstream task. The upstream task would push that file name to an XCom, and the downstream task would access that XCom using jinja templating in its arguments definition.

Here’s a code snippet demonstrating that:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
from airflow.models import XCom

def analyze_file(**kwargs):
    # Pretend this does some file analysis and gets the filename
    file_name = "processed_file.txt"  # This would be dynamic in real world
    kwargs['ti'].xcom_push(key='file_to_process', value=file_name)

def process_file(file_name):
    print(f"Processing file: {file_name}")

with DAG(
    dag_id='override_argument_example_1',
    schedule_interval=None,
    start_date=days_ago(2),
    tags=['example'],
) as dag:

    analyze_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='analyze_file_task',
        python_callable=analyze_file
    )

    process_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='process_file_task',
        python_callable=process_file,
        op_kwargs={'file_name': "{{ ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='analyze_file_task', key='file_to_process') }}"}
    )

    analyze_task >> process_task
```

In this example, `analyze_file_task` pushes `file_name` into XCom under the key `file_to_process`. The `process_file_task` then uses jinja templating, `{{ ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='analyze_file_task', key='file_to_process') }}`, to pull this value from XCom and use it as the `file_name` argument for the python callable. The crucial part here is how jinja allows us to delay the argument evaluation until the task instance actually runs. This is a common technique, and it is reasonably simple and efficient.

Now, what happens if the value needs to be constructed on the fly, incorporating multiple XComs or other variables? That’s where custom python operators with lambda functions come into play. Instead of just pulling values directly, you can create functions that manipulate retrieved data before using it as input for another task.

Let's look at another code snippet which demonstrates that approach:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

def prepare_data(**kwargs):
    data1 = "abc"  # Simulating some value
    data2 = "123"  # Simulating another value
    kwargs['ti'].xcom_push(key='data1', value=data1)
    kwargs['ti'].xcom_push(key='data2', value=data2)

def process_data(arg1):
    print(f"Processed Argument: {arg1}")

def construct_argument(**kwargs):
     data1 = kwargs['ti'].xcom_pull(task_ids='prepare_data_task', key='data1')
     data2 = kwargs['ti'].xcom_pull(task_ids='prepare_data_task', key='data2')
     constructed_arg = f"{data1}-{data2}"
     return constructed_arg

with DAG(
    dag_id='override_argument_example_2',
    schedule_interval=None,
    start_date=days_ago(2),
    tags=['example'],
) as dag:

    prepare_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='prepare_data_task',
        python_callable=prepare_data
    )


    process_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='process_data_task',
        python_callable=process_data,
        op_kwargs={'arg1': "{{ task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='construct_arg_task') }}"}
    )

    construct_arg_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id = 'construct_arg_task',
        python_callable = construct_argument
    )

    prepare_task >> construct_arg_task >> process_task
```

Here, `prepare_data_task` pushes `data1` and `data2` to XCom. Then, `construct_arg_task` pulls these values and constructs a string using python. Finally `process_data_task` uses the constructed value pulled using the `task_instance.xcom_pull` function and a jinja template. This example showcases how complex logic can be integrated to define task arguments, moving far beyond just retrieving stored values.

The third method, which I found really useful in edge cases, involved dynamically generating a dag run by programmatically building the dag from configuration or metadata pulled from an external system or previous task. This approach is much more powerful, since the entire dag or a sub-dag is generated using external input, but also a lot more complicated and is better suited for those scenarios where the entire structure and parameters of the dag need to be dynamic.

Here's a simplified version of such approach:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
from datetime import datetime


def generate_task( task_id, argument):

    return PythonOperator(
        task_id=task_id,
        python_callable=print_data,
        op_kwargs={'argument': argument}
    )

def get_config_from_xcom(**kwargs):
    # Fetch configuration dynamically
     config_data = {"task1":"value_a","task2":"value_b"}
     kwargs['ti'].xcom_push(key='config', value=config_data)

def print_data(argument):
    print(f"Received argument: {argument}")


def create_dynamic_dag(dag_id):

    with DAG(
        dag_id=dag_id,
        schedule_interval=None,
        start_date=days_ago(2),
        tags=['example'],
        catchup = False #to avoid running past dagruns
    ) as dag:

        get_config = PythonOperator(
            task_id='get_config_task',
            python_callable = get_config_from_xcom
        )
        config = XCom.get_one(dag_id=dag_id, task_id='get_config_task', key='config')
        tasks_list = []
        if config:
            for task_id,argument in config.items():
              tasks_list.append(generate_task(task_id, argument))
            get_config >> tasks_list

        return dag

# This part dynamically creates a dag object for each call of this function
dynamic_dag = create_dynamic_dag("dynamic_dag")

```
In this example, `get_config_task` pushes config data to XCom. The `create_dynamic_dag` function reads this config via `XCom.get_one` and generates tasks dynamically based on the content of that config. As you can see this is a much more involved approach than just changing a task parameter, it allows for total dag and task customizability, but requires more setup and management.

These methods, while varied, share the common principle of using Airflow's features to defer argument resolution until runtime. This is crucial for dynamic pipelines where the needed parameters aren't known until prior tasks have executed.

For further reading, I’d suggest delving into the official Airflow documentation, specifically the sections covering XComs, Jinja templating, and custom operator development. A solid understanding of these areas, combined with practice, will make you proficient at handling dynamic argument passing in your Airflow pipelines. Consider the book “Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow” by Bas P. Harenslak and Julian Rutger De Ruijter for a deeper understanding of patterns and techniques. Additionally, the Apache Airflow documentation itself is a great place to learn all the intricate features it offers. Remember, dynamic parameter handling in Airflow is less about direct overriding, and more about leveraging these tools to inject the required context during task execution.
