Let's tackle the question of Airflow's behavior when its scheduler encounters a critical failure, specifically its ability to restart a job mid-execution. This isn't an abstract concern; I've been through this scenario a couple of times in previous roles, and it's where the rubber really meets the road with workflow orchestration.

The short answer is yes, under certain conditions, Airflow can indeed pick up and continue processing a job if its scheduler goes down and then comes back online. However, it's nuanced, and understanding the mechanics is crucial to relying on this behavior. It's not a magical recovery; rather, it's a sophisticated mechanism built upon careful task management and a persistent database.

Airflow’s scheduler doesn’t actively execute tasks. Instead, it monitors dag definitions and triggers tasks based on their dependencies and the schedule defined in the dag. The actual work is done by *executors* (like the LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor, or KubernetesExecutor) and these executors hand off the actual task execution to a pool of workers. The scheduler’s role is primarily to track what needs to be done and to queue those tasks. When a scheduler crashes, the key is that the executor continues to run, in some cases, and it is the *executor* that informs the scheduler about the status of running tasks.

The persistence of the Airflow metastore is critical here. All task states, log details, and dag runs are stored in this database (usually PostgreSQL, MySQL, or similar). When the scheduler restarts, it consults the database to see what the current state of affairs is, which includes running tasks, failed tasks, completed tasks, and so on. If it finds a task marked as 'running' but no corresponding heartbeat or state update within a specified interval, it understands that the task might have been interrupted, most likely because of the scheduler failure. Depending on the executor in use, Airflow can proceed differently with these tasks.

For instance, consider a case where the CeleryExecutor is in use. The tasks are typically assigned to celery workers that continue running, independent of the status of the scheduler process. When the scheduler restarts, it queries the database for tasks it previously marked as ‘running’. If a worker is still working on a task assigned before the scheduler failure, the worker continues to run. The worker then updates the database to mark the task as complete when it finishes and the scheduler picks up this status update when it polls the metastore database and moves on to the next task in the DAG. The system doesn't necessarily "restart" the task from the beginning, it simply continues the task based on the instruction it has been given. That being said, if a task was 'in flight' (e.g. an api call was made but no result stored), this may result in the task being re-run depending on how the task is implemented in your code and whether it has idempotency capabilities built-in. This emphasizes why building idempotent tasks is incredibly important in distributed processing environments like this.

However, it is not a given that Airflow will continue running these tasks. The behavior depends heavily on the type of executor in use and on how your dag is implemented. For the LocalExecutor, for example, where the tasks are run directly by the scheduler, a scheduler crash will very likely interrupt all running tasks. In the case of KubernetesExecutor, each task is run as a separate kubernetes pod, so those tasks may continue to completion even if the scheduler is unavailable. In both cases, if the task did not complete before the crash the scheduler will have to re-run the task when it comes back online.

Let’s illustrate this with some conceptual code, keeping in mind that actual Airflow task definitions involve a bit more overhead. First, let's start with a python task intended to run within the Airflow environment. Note this would be part of an operator in a dags.py file, but I am just trying to show what that task might look like without all the added Airflow code.

```python
import time
import random

def long_running_task(task_id):
    """
    Simulates a long-running task that might be interrupted.
    """
    print(f"Task {task_id}: Starting processing.")
    # Simulate 30 seconds of work
    for i in range(30):
      print(f"Task {task_id}: Work {i}/30 seconds")
      time.sleep(1)
      if random.random() < 0.1:
        print(f"Task {task_id}: Emulating a crash (simulated failure)")
        raise Exception("Simulated failure")
    print(f"Task {task_id}: Completed successfully.")

# Example call as a test for the script outside of Airflow:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    long_running_task(123)
```

In this example, we have a long running task with a simulation of a failure. Let’s pretend that instead of failing on a random number, this was interrupted by a scheduler crash. Now let's consider how airflow might respond differently with a couple of executor types. Below are examples of two dag files, illustrating the difference between the LocalExecutor and the CeleryExecutor.

```python
# Example 1: dag_local_executor.py, using the local executor
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
from airflow.configuration import conf
import os

def long_running_task(task_id):
    """
    Simulates a long-running task that might be interrupted.
    """
    import time
    import random
    print(f"Task {task_id}: Starting processing.")
    # Simulate 30 seconds of work
    for i in range(30):
      print(f"Task {task_id}: Work {i}/30 seconds")
      time.sleep(1)
      if random.random() < 0.1:
        print(f"Task {task_id}: Emulating a crash (simulated failure)")
        raise Exception("Simulated failure")
    print(f"Task {task_id}: Completed successfully.")



with DAG(
    dag_id='local_executor_test',
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
    tags=['local_executor'],
) as dag:
    task_local = PythonOperator(
        task_id='long_task_local',
        python_callable=long_running_task,
        op_kwargs={'task_id': 456}
    )
```

```python
# Example 2: dag_celery_executor.py, using the celery executor
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import os
from airflow.configuration import conf


def long_running_task(task_id):
    """
    Simulates a long-running task that might be interrupted.
    """
    import time
    import random
    print(f"Task {task_id}: Starting processing.")
    # Simulate 30 seconds of work
    for i in range(30):
      print(f"Task {task_id}: Work {i}/30 seconds")
      time.sleep(1)
      if random.random() < 0.1:
        print(f"Task {task_id}: Emulating a crash (simulated failure)")
        raise Exception("Simulated failure")
    print(f"Task {task_id}: Completed successfully.")



with DAG(
    dag_id='celery_executor_test',
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
    tags=['celery_executor'],
) as dag:
    task_celery = PythonOperator(
        task_id='long_task_celery',
        python_callable=long_running_task,
        op_kwargs={'task_id': 789}
    )
```

In the first example, if the scheduler crashes during the `long_task_local` execution and then restarts, it will see that the task did not complete and it will have to rerun the task from the start. This is because LocalExecutor runs the tasks using the same process as the scheduler, which makes the task’s continuation dependent on the scheduler’s availability. In the second example, however, using CeleryExecutor, the `long_task_celery` would keep running if the worker was working on the task when the scheduler crashed. When the scheduler restarts, it would be informed by the celery worker that the task is complete.

For a deeper dive into the specifics of Airflow internals, I highly recommend consulting the *official Apache Airflow documentation*. Specifically, the sections on “Executors” and “Scheduling” offer a lot more detail on this topic. Another useful resource is *“Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow”* by Bas Pijls and Julian Rutger de Ruiter. This book provides not just theoretical knowledge but also real-world examples that can help in understanding how Airflow behaves in various scenarios, including failure and recovery. I have found *“Designing Data-Intensive Applications”* by Martin Kleppmann very helpful for the fundamental principles of distributed systems, especially idempotency and how failure recovery strategies are used more broadly in similar systems.

In conclusion, while Airflow can resume tasks after a scheduler crash, the nature of the recovery is heavily influenced by the choice of executor. Understanding these nuances is vital for building reliable and robust data pipelines and, more importantly, anticipating and mitigating potential issues when running production systems.
