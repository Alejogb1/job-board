Okay, let's get into this. I recall a rather thorny project back in my days at [fictional company name], where we were processing a mountain of unstructured text data, all tagged with document ids. The goal? To break these often lengthy text strings down into logical paragraphs while maintaining the link back to the source document. Sounds simple, but the devil, as always, was in the details. The core challenge is accurately identifying what constitutes a paragraph, as opposed to just a series of sentences. Let’s dive into how we tackled this and how you can do it effectively.

The fundamental idea revolves around identifying patterns. We cannot just assume a newline character signifies a new paragraph, especially when dealing with varied input sources (think pdf conversions, text exports from different databases etc.). We started by observing the most common indicators of paragraph separation. These typically boil down to: multiple newline characters, indentation, or some combination of both, along with, in some scenarios, a specific marker pattern such as html-like tags or a custom convention.

Here's how I would approach this programmatically, using python for demonstration due to its versatility and readability:

First, let’s consider the simplest case: where two or more newline characters consistently separate paragraphs. This is often encountered in text files prepared for human readability.

```python
def split_text_by_newlines(text, doc_id):
    paragraphs = text.split('\n\n')
    result = []
    for paragraph in paragraphs:
        # clean up leading and trailing newlines and whitespace from each paragraph
        cleaned_paragraph = paragraph.strip()
        if cleaned_paragraph: # avoid adding empty paragraphs
            result.append({'doc_id': doc_id, 'paragraph': cleaned_paragraph})
    return result

# Example usage
text_example = """This is the first paragraph.
It spans over multiple lines.

This is the second paragraph.
It also contains multiple sentences.

And here’s the third."""

doc_id = "doc123"
paragraphs_list = split_text_by_newlines(text_example, doc_id)
for item in paragraphs_list:
  print(item)
```

This snippet utilizes python’s `split()` function, effectively breaking text into chunks wherever a double newline is encountered. Then, we add the document id and paragraph text to a dictionary, and append these to a list.  It's crucial to note the `.strip()` method, which eliminates leading and trailing white space characters, including newlines, ensuring that each resulting paragraph is clean. Empty paragraphs resulting from excessive newlines are also avoided.

However, often the real world throws curveballs. Consider texts that might use single newlines for line wrapping and actual paragraph breaks with increased indentation, a style found in some older documents or text converted from certain document formats.

```python
import re

def split_text_by_indentation(text, doc_id):
    paragraphs = []
    current_paragraph = ""
    for line in text.splitlines():
        if not line.strip():
            # empty line signals a potential paragraph break, not always
            if current_paragraph:
                 paragraphs.append({'doc_id': doc_id, 'paragraph': current_paragraph.strip()})
                 current_paragraph = ""
            continue # move to next line
        if re.match(r'\s{4,}', line) : # detect indentation of 4 or more spaces
            if current_paragraph:
              paragraphs.append({'doc_id': doc_id, 'paragraph': current_paragraph.strip()})
            current_paragraph = line.strip()
        else:
            current_paragraph += " " + line.strip()

    if current_paragraph: #catch any paragraph that was not appended due to no break at end of string.
        paragraphs.append({'doc_id': doc_id, 'paragraph': current_paragraph.strip()})
    return paragraphs

# Example usage
text_example = """    This is the first indented paragraph.
    It can also span over multiple lines.
This is a regular line.
    The second indented paragraph.
    It might have some more text.

Another non-indented line, then next paragraph.
    Here is the third indented paragraph.
"""
doc_id = "doc456"
paragraphs_list = split_text_by_indentation(text_example, doc_id)

for item in paragraphs_list:
    print(item)
```

This example utilizes regular expressions to check for leading whitespace using `re.match(r'\s{4,}', line)`, specifically looking for four or more spaces to detect an indent.  This is a heuristic, and the number of spaces can be adjusted to suit the particular formatting pattern of your data. Also, as you see, it accounts for paragraphs spread over multiple lines and adds them together, only considering the next indented line as a sign of a new paragraph.

Lastly, in a scenario where we need to handle a mixture of formats, like data sourced from different files, perhaps with html-like markers or specific tags or patterns, a more comprehensive solution incorporating both methods and a strategy for parsing specific markers becomes necessary. This will allow us to accommodate multiple formatting styles as well as edge cases.

```python
import re

def split_text_advanced(text, doc_id, marker_pattern="<p>") :
    paragraphs = []
    current_paragraph = ""
    lines = text.splitlines()

    for line in lines:
       line = line.strip()
       if not line: # skip empty lines
         if current_paragraph:
            paragraphs.append({'doc_id': doc_id, 'paragraph': current_paragraph.strip()})
            current_paragraph = ""
         continue

       if re.match(r'\s{4,}', line): #indentation check.
          if current_paragraph :
            paragraphs.append({'doc_id': doc_id, 'paragraph': current_paragraph.strip()})
          current_paragraph = line
       elif line.startswith(marker_pattern): # marker check
           if current_paragraph:
              paragraphs.append({'doc_id': doc_id, 'paragraph': current_paragraph.strip()})
           current_paragraph = line[len(marker_pattern):]
       else:
            current_paragraph += " " + line # join to the current paragraph

    if current_paragraph:
        paragraphs.append({'doc_id': doc_id, 'paragraph': current_paragraph.strip()})
    return paragraphs


# Example usage
text_example = """    This is an indented paragraph with multiple lines.
<p> This is a new paragraph tagged with <p> tag.
   And it can have multiple lines.</p>
Another regular line.
<p> Another tagged paragraph</p>
    Third Indented paragraph.
"""

doc_id = "doc789"
paragraphs_list = split_text_advanced(text_example, doc_id, "<p>")

for item in paragraphs_list:
    print(item)
```
Here, the `split_text_advanced` function introduces an optional `marker_pattern` parameter, allowing it to handle cases where paragraphs are tagged with a specific string. It integrates checks for indentation, empty lines and markers to cover multiple cases. This example assumes that the start marker (e.g., `<p>`) indicates the start of a new paragraph. You would need to modify this to suit your actual marker structure, should it be different.

For deeper insights, I'd recommend delving into the following resources. "Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin is an essential text for understanding natural language processing techniques that are relevant to text segmentation. Also, "Python Cookbook" by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones has a lot of very useful recipes for text processing. Finally, researching the specific nuances of how different types of documents (PDFs, Word documents, etc) structure text can also be helpful.

In conclusion, splitting text into paragraphs, while preserving the document id, requires a careful examination of the text structure and often a combination of strategies.  Start with simpler methods and adjust your approach based on the type of documents you're processing. Good luck!
