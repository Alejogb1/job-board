Alright so you got hit with the "relational comparison result unused" huh Classic I've seen that one pop up more times than I've had lukewarm coffee during all-nighters let me tell you

Okay so basically the compiler a picky little thing if you ask me is throwing a fit because you wrote an expression that involves a comparison like is a greater than b or is x equal to y but you didn't actually use the result of that comparison The C compiler is all about explicit actions it's like "Hey you computed something a true or false thing and now you're just letting it hang out there like it's some useless piece of trash I'm gonna warn you about it"

Now it's not technically an error it's a warning which means your code still compiles but the compiler is sending you a very strong message that says "Dude you probably messed up somewhere" And in my experience 99.9% of the time it means exactly that You missed something or your logic has a flaw

I remember when I first encountered this back in the day I was working on this image processing project I was doing some thresholding operations on pixel values basically deciding if a pixel was dark enough or not for a particular filter I was writing nested ifs and somehow in one branch I had a a > b comparison hanging out by itself because I had a typo I was so focused on this segmentation algorithm I was working on that I had missed it for 2 days then I spent another 4 hours debugging that shit it was brutal I learned my lesson though the hard way always pay attention to compiler warnings they are your friends even if they sound like the world is ending

The thing is in C a comparison isn't like a command it's an expression It evaluates to either a 1 for true or 0 for false a boolean result but if you just leave that boolean result there without any context C gets grumpy

Lets break down some of these examples that might be leading to this error lets say you're doing some simple integer comparisons

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    a > b; // Relational comparison result unused warning
    if(a > b){
        printf("A is greater than B");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this first example `a > b;` is just an expression that doesn't do anything It calculates whether a is greater than b and then throws that result to the void Because the compiler is a responsible little guy itâ€™s like "Hold on a minute what are you doing with my result? Where should I put that boolean?" So we fix it by putting an `if` condition which uses the result as a condition that the program will execute if the condition is true

Now how about another scenario something more like a filtering context

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

bool check_range(int value, int min, int max){
  value >= min; // Relational comparison result unused warning
  value <= max; // Another one

  return (value >= min && value <= max);
}

int main(){
    printf("%d", check_range(5, 3, 10));
    return 0;
}

```

See here in the `check_range` function we're doing two comparisons but not using them This is pretty classic We have this function designed to check if a number is inside a range but we are just doing the evaluations for fun apparently We were calculating and then throwing the result to trash The fix is to actually return the combined results of the two comparisons via and operation

And for a last example let's look at a loop context where you can see it easily if you are not careful

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    while(i < 10){
        i < 15; //Relational comparison result unused
        printf("i is %d\n", i);
        i++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this `while` loop we have an additional comparison that serves no purpose The `i < 15;` is a statement that is just evaluating if `i` is less than 15 without actually using this result The program continues and prints out the numbers correctly but it gets an extra evaluation that does not serve a purpose

Alright so how do we fix this whole thing well it depends on what you were *intending* to do but mostly you need to actually use the result of the comparison You can use it in an `if` statement a `while` loop or even to assign it to a boolean variable

So the general rule is pay attention to those warnings The compiler is trying to tell you something its like your code is whispering "I feel lost and abandoned please use me"

As for resources to read on this I would suggest checking out "C Programming A Modern Approach" by K N King its a solid book that covers C language fundamentals and talks about operators and expressions in a very detailed fashion also look at the book "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie a classic for a reason and it is extremely detailed on the language spec itself which will help you understand why the compiler thinks the way it does Also reading the documentation for your specific compiler like GCC Clang will give you more detailed information on the warnings it generates and how to properly configure them

One more tip if you are compiling with GCC or Clang enable compiler flags like `-Wall` which enables a lot of warnings and can catch things like this early it is a good practice and will save you hours of debugging headaches later Trust me I've been there and gotten the T-shirt

Oh and before I forget there was this one time I was fixing this issue in a system where there was 20000 lines of code it was so bad that when I found the problem I did a victory dance in the office. Everyone got mad at me since that was 3 in the morning but hey it was worth it. And then I told them "Well guys it was so bad I thought I had a relational *problem* but turns out I just had an unused one" yeah nobody laughed.

Anyway thats about it for the "relational comparison result unused" warning in C Remember to pay attention to what the compiler is telling you and use the results of your comparisons you are not going to make the compiler mad now.
