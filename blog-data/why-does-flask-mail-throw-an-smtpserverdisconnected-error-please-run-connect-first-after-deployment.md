Let’s tackle this one. I've certainly seen this issue with flask-mail rearing its head more times than I'd care to count, particularly post-deployment. It's that maddening `smtpserverdisconnected` error, prompting us to ‘run connect() first’ when we *thought* everything was configured correctly. It's not always a straightforward configuration problem; often, it's rooted in the nuances of server environments and how persistent connections are handled.

The crux of this issue generally lies in the lifecycle of the smtp connection managed by flask-mail. Specifically, the underlying `smtplib` library is making an assumption of a relatively stable and predictable execution environment. In development, often, the process handling the mail sending might be relatively persistent, a single script running, making the initial connection stay viable across multiple calls. However, after deployment, especially when employing web servers like gunicorn, uwsgi, or similar application servers in combination with load balancers, the persistence we rely on in development often disappears. Your Flask application might be handled by different worker processes or instances of your application. Each one might be attempting to use the same connection which has been closed by the server or by another worker.

In its simplest form, `flask-mail` by default sets up and tears down its connection with each mail being sent, which is a costly process. However, even this is insufficient in some cases, especially when relying on an underlying `smtplib` connection object that’s not meant to be passed across different process or threads. The 'connect()' call refers to the need to open the underlying socket connection to your smtp server. If that connection is not in place, you'll get the disconnected error message. So, you are essentially seeing this error because a previous connection has been closed or became invalid, and your flask application instance has not established a new one. This can arise from various underlying causes, such as the smtp server timing out idle connections (a very common cause, actually), or application servers or load balancers killing connections to optimize resource usage.

The typical solutions center around ensuring that smtp connection is actively managed and valid. It's not enough to configure flask-mail once and assume it will manage that connection indefinitely. We need to implement strategies to either avoid connection sharing between threads or processes, or explicitly handle connection re-establishment. I've found two general approaches to be particularly effective.

First, and my preferred approach, is to utilize flask-mail's support for connection pooling and ensure that the SMTP connection is managed within the mail sending process. This approach ensures that no connection is shared amongst workers and that a valid connection is made on demand. It often requires slightly more code but is the most consistent.

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_mail import Mail, Message

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.update(
    MAIL_SERVER='smtp.example.com',
    MAIL_PORT=587,
    MAIL_USE_TLS=True,
    MAIL_USERNAME='your_email@example.com',
    MAIL_PASSWORD='your_password'
)

mail = Mail(app)

def send_email(recipient, subject, body):
    with mail.connect() as connection:
        msg = Message(subject, sender='your_email@example.com', recipients=[recipient])
        msg.body = body
        connection.send(msg)

@app.route('/send')
def send():
    send_email('recipient@example.com', 'Test Subject', 'Test Body')
    return "Email sent!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this first example, you’ll notice we’re no longer instantiating `Message` or sending it directly on `mail`, but instead, calling `mail.connect()` which provides a context manager. Within that context manager, we’re guaranteed a fresh SMTP connection. Once we exit the context the connection will be closed properly. This is the core principle that we are trying to achieve; ensuring that each send is performed on an active connection.

The second approach involves pre-establishing an SMTP connection using signals, specifically the `request_started` signal in Flask. While this avoids some of the overhead with context managing, I find that it can be slightly more complex to maintain especially if the connection is closed by an external force such as a firewall or server timing out idle connections.
However, it can be helpful when sending large quantities of messages. Here's how it generally looks:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_mail import Mail, Message
from flask import current_app
from flask.signals import request_started
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.update(
    MAIL_SERVER='smtp.example.com',
    MAIL_PORT=587,
    MAIL_USE_TLS=True,
    MAIL_USERNAME='your_email@example.com',
    MAIL_PASSWORD='your_password'
)

mail = Mail(app)
# we are going to store the smtp connection for the current context.
app.smtp_connection = None

def create_smtp_connection(sender, **extra):
    app.smtp_connection = mail.connect()

request_started.connect(create_smtp_connection, app)

@app.teardown_request
def close_smtp_connection(exception=None):
    if hasattr(app, 'smtp_connection') and app.smtp_connection:
        app.smtp_connection.close()
        app.smtp_connection = None

def send_email(recipient, subject, body):
    try:
      msg = Message(subject, sender='your_email@example.com', recipients=[recipient])
      msg.body = body
      app.smtp_connection.send(msg)
    except Exception as e:
       logging.error(f"Error sending email: {e}")

@app.route('/send')
def send():
    send_email('recipient@example.com', 'Test Subject', 'Test Body')
    return "Email sent!"


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This example explicitly creates and closes the connection at the beginning and end of a flask request. This ensures that for every single request, there is an SMTP connection, and when it is finished the connection is closed. It is important to keep in mind that the same caveats that apply to the previously mentioned connection pooling technique still apply here. The connection needs to be created and closed properly on every request.

Finally, sometimes, your smtp provider might require specific connection options or headers. Some servers are stricter than others when it comes to things like sending too many requests over a period of time. Sometimes explicitly setting a `MAIL_SUPPRESS_SEND` value will help prevent issues while testing.

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_mail import Mail, Message

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.update(
    MAIL_SERVER='smtp.example.com',
    MAIL_PORT=587,
    MAIL_USE_TLS=True,
    MAIL_USERNAME='your_email@example.com',
    MAIL_PASSWORD='your_password',
    # this is for testing, so you don't actually send emails.
    MAIL_SUPPRESS_SEND = True
)

mail = Mail(app)


def send_email(recipient, subject, body):
    with mail.connect() as connection:
        msg = Message(subject, sender='your_email@example.com', recipients=[recipient])
        msg.body = body
        connection.send(msg)

@app.route('/send')
def send():
    send_email('recipient@example.com', 'Test Subject', 'Test Body')
    return "Email sent!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

This final example showcases how you could configure `MAIL_SUPPRESS_SEND` during testing phases, or in certain other circumstances where you do not want to actually send emails. It also shows a very similar connection pooling pattern to the first example.

To delve deeper, I’d recommend looking at “TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols” by Stevens, which covers low level networking and connection details. Also, “Flask Web Development” by Miguel Grinberg is extremely useful for understanding how Flask handles requests and signals. You might also find RFC 5321, which specifies the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, helpful in understanding some of the underlying connection principles that `smtplib` and, therefore, flask-mail relies on.

In summary, the seemingly simple “please run connect() first” error often comes down to connection lifetime management post-deployment. Explicitly managing those SMTP connections either through connection pools or using request signals, while also keeping in mind the underlying socket connections and provider requirements, is essential for robust and reliable email sending from your Flask application.
