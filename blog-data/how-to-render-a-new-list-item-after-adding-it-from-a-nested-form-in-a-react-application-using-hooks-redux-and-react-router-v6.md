,  Handling nested forms and updating a list dynamically after a submit action is a scenario I've definitely seen crop up numerous times over the years. It's a classic case where several technologies need to play nicely together, and a misstep can lead to frustrating UI inconsistencies. I remember one particular project, a project management tool with sub-tasks, where we ran into a particularly sticky version of this problem. We were initially relying heavily on component-level state for data updates, and the result was a cascading mess of prop drilling and unnecessary re-renders. We ultimately moved to Redux and it changed the game.

The core challenge you're describing essentially involves three moving parts: the nested form itself, the central state management (Redux in your case), and the navigation between different views via React Router v6. Let's break each piece down, focusing on how to ensure a seamless update when a new item is added from that nested form.

The first crucial aspect is correctly handling the form data. When you have a nested form, you're generally dealing with the need to structure the data appropriately before dispatching it to Redux. In practice, this means that within your component, you'll have state to handle the form input values. Once the user submits the form, you'll want to prepare an object which reflects your Redux store's data model. Here's a simplified snippet demonstrating this:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { addTask } from './taskSlice';

const NestedTaskForm = ({ parentTaskId }) => {
    const [taskName, setTaskName] = useState('');
    const [taskDescription, setTaskDescription] = useState('');
    const dispatch = useDispatch();

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const newTask = {
            name: taskName,
            description: taskDescription,
            parentTaskId: parentTaskId,
            status: 'pending'
        };
        dispatch(addTask(newTask));
        setTaskName('');
        setTaskDescription('');

    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
                type="text"
                value={taskName}
                onChange={(e) => setTaskName(e.target.value)}
                placeholder="Task name"
            />
            <input
                type="text"
                value={taskDescription}
                onChange={(e) => setTaskDescription(e.target.value)}
                placeholder="Task Description"
            />
            <button type="submit">Add Task</button>
        </form>
    );
};

export default NestedTaskForm;

```

Here, we use `useState` hooks to manage the form fields, `dispatch` from `react-redux` to interact with the Redux store, and we prepare the new task object before dispatching it. This `addTask` action is assumed to be a Redux action, which we will delve into next.

Secondly, Redux takes the center stage for managing the state of your application. Assuming you have correctly set up your redux store, your reducer (or slice) should handle the `addTask` action and update the state accordingly. A typical slice might look something like this:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = {
    tasks: []
};

const taskSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'tasks',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
        addTask: (state, action) => {
            state.tasks.push(action.payload);
        }
    }
});

export const { addTask } = taskSlice.actions;
export default taskSlice.reducer;
```

Here, `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit` simplifies the reducer creation. The `addTask` reducer simply pushes the new task to the existing task array. Importantly, Redux’s immutability principles are upheld by using spread syntax to create a new copy of state.  This part is crucial, because we need to trigger a re-render whenever the state is updated. The reducer should correctly reflect the desired change to the data, which then propagates through the redux hooks in the application.

Now, the final piece of the puzzle – React Router v6 and ensuring the list view is updated. In the application I mentioned earlier, we had list view components rendering directly from the redux store, typically using `useSelector`. The real magic happens automatically. Because of React's reconciliation process and the subscription that `useSelector` creates, when the state changes within the reducer (specifically in the `tasks` array, in this case), any components subscribing to those particular parts of the Redux store are re-rendered by React. We do not have to force the component to re-render, as that defeats the purpose of react’s component updates. When the list view is updated after the `addTask` action is dispatched and the state is updated in the reducer, it's important to consider whether to rerender the view, or navigate away. Here's a simplified list view that would update accordingly.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { useNavigate, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

const TaskList = () => {
  const tasks = useSelector((state) => state.tasks.tasks);
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const { parentTaskId } = useParams();

    // Filter to only show subtasks for the parent task ID
    const filteredTasks = tasks.filter(task => task.parentTaskId === parentTaskId);

  if (filteredTasks.length === 0) return (<p>No tasks here yet.</p>)

  return (
    <div>
        <h3>Sub-Tasks:</h3>
        <ul>
            {filteredTasks.map((task) => (
                <li key={task.id}>
                    {task.name} - {task.description}
                </li>
            ))}
        </ul>
        <button onClick={() => navigate(`/tasks/${parentTaskId}/new`)}>
            Add New Sub-Task
        </button>

    </div>
  );
};

export default TaskList;
```

Here, the `useSelector` hook listens for changes to the `state.tasks.tasks` slice of the Redux store. When a new task is added, `state.tasks.tasks` will be updated and our TaskList component is automatically re-rendered by React, which triggers the update in the UI. The `useNavigate` hook in the code is how we direct the user to the nested form to add a subtask, utilizing React Router v6 functionality.

As a side note, if we were implementing this same functionality using context instead of redux, the core principles would remain the same. Context would still contain our form data and would still need to implement re-renders if the underlying data changes. Instead of reducers and actions, we would use context’s methods to modify the store.

For further reading on state management in React, I would highly recommend checking out the *Redux Toolkit* documentation and the *React Router* documentation. Both are essential resources for achieving robust and maintainable data flow. Also, *Effective React* by Michel Weststrate provides great guidance on efficient rendering patterns. You might find it useful to also investigate the principles described in *Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software* by Eric Evans, specifically the section on aggregates as they can sometimes correspond to data structures in state management that must be treated as a single unit of work, especially when dealing with relationships in data.

In conclusion, implementing this functionality requires a carefully coordinated approach, combining local component state for form input, Redux for centralized state management, and React Router v6 for navigation. The code snippets here illustrate the fundamental concepts, but remember, the specific implementation can vary depending on your application's complexity. The key takeaway here is that by understanding how each of these pieces operates and how they interact, you can create a truly responsive, robust and maintainable application. It's all about understanding data flow and component rendering, and once you have that down, these kinds of problems become significantly easier to manage.
