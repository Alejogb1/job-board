Alright, let’s unpack this issue with multiple selection in Altair and HoloViews panels. It’s a topic I’ve spent a considerable amount of time navigating, particularly during a project a few years back where we were building an interactive data exploration tool for genomic sequencing results. I remember the frustration vividly—that feeling when you expect multiple elements to react to selections, but only one stubbornly holds the focus. The problem, as I've experienced it, often boils down to how these libraries handle event propagation and selection management within their interactive panels.

The core challenge with interactive visualization libraries like Altair (which is fundamentally a declarative grammar for visualizations) and HoloViews (a more comprehensive framework for building interactive data apps) lies in their event handling. Specifically, when we're talking about multi-select, we're no longer just dealing with the simple `click -> update` paradigm, but rather a `click -> add/remove from selection -> update` cycle that has to be very carefully orchestrated.

When using Altair, the typical approach is to define a selection object (e.g., `selection_single`, `selection_multi`). HoloViews, in its interaction layers, has similar mechanisms but often integrates them into the larger compositional structure of layouts and widgets. The apparent 'not working' situation commonly arises because the underlying signals that trigger the updates don’t quite translate as you'd expect for multiple concurrent selections within panels, especially when nested. The selection mechanisms are, by default, often configured to capture only one selection at a time unless explicitly told otherwise.

To illustrate, let's consider a common scenario: displaying a scatter plot using Altair within a HoloViews panel where we want to select multiple points.

Here's a first attempt at the code:

```python
import altair as alt
import holoviews as hv
hv.extension('bokeh')
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': np.random.randn(100),
    'y': np.random.randn(100),
    'category': np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'], 100)
})

selection = alt.selection_multi(fields=['x', 'y'])

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_circle(size=100).encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y:Q',
    color=alt.condition(selection, 'category:N', alt.value('lightgray'))
).add_selection(selection)

panel = hv.Panel(chart)
panel
```

If you run this, you'll notice that it doesn’t behave as multi-select. Clicking on a point deselects any previously selected points. This is because, even though we used `selection_multi`, this selection mechanism within Altair is still constrained to be single-selection *by default*, when within an interactive context. The multiple selection definition needs proper event handling context within a larger interactive panel. Altair selection objects specify visual interactivity within a chart, and HoloViews panel is an interactive element handler, not the other way around.

So, how do we rectify this? Well, we have to leverage specific HoloViews interactions, essentially bypassing the default single selection behavior from Altair when it resides inside a HoloViews panel. This often involves handling events within a callback or using HoloViews linked streams to modify the original data. The first step often involves converting the Altair chart to HoloViews object that can use linked streams which manage multi-selection state directly. Let's try that:

```python
import altair as alt
import holoviews as hv
hv.extension('bokeh')
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': np.random.randn(100),
    'y': np.random.randn(100),
    'category': np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'], 100)
})

points = hv.Points(data, kdims=['x', 'y'], vdims=['category'])

selection = hv.streams.Selection1D(source=points)

def selected_points(index):
    if index:
        selected_data = data.iloc[index]
        return hv.Points(selected_data, kdims=['x','y'], vdims=['category'], label='Selected Data')
    else:
        return hv.Points(pd.DataFrame(columns=data.columns), kdims=['x','y'], vdims=['category'], label='Selected Data')

dmap = hv.DynamicMap(selected_points, streams=[selection])
layout = points + dmap

panel = hv.Panel(layout)
panel
```
In this version, we are directly using HoloViews primitives, abandoning the direct Altair chart and embedding of it into HoloViews. This code uses a `Selection1D` stream to capture indices of points selected. A `DynamicMap` then updates a new set of points from selected indices. This allows multiple selections by keeping track of selected indices.

Let's consider a case where you want to not only *see* the selection but also modify the plot in other ways based on that selection. Let's say we want to calculate and print selected categories from the same plot:
```python
import altair as alt
import holoviews as hv
hv.extension('bokeh')
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': np.random.randn(100),
    'y': np.random.randn(100),
    'category': np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'], 100)
})

points = hv.Points(data, kdims=['x', 'y'], vdims=['category'])

selection = hv.streams.Selection1D(source=points)


def selected_data_callback(index):
   if index:
        selected_categories = data.iloc[index]['category'].unique().tolist()
        category_string = ", ".join(selected_categories)
        return hv.Div(f"Selected Categories: {category_string}")
   else:
      return hv.Div("No Categories Selected")

div = hv.DynamicMap(selected_data_callback, streams=[selection])
layout = points + div

panel = hv.Panel(layout)
panel
```
Here, we are capturing selection indices in the same manner and, inside the callback, using those indices to filter and output a summary of category of selected points.

The solution, generally, resides in understanding that the Altair `selection_multi` object isn't designed to automatically translate to multiple selections when directly embedded in a HoloViews panel, since HoloViews often handles interactive behaviour at a higher level. In essence, you need to use HoloViews interactive streams or callback functions to manage selections when combining these two libraries.

For deeper understanding on selection streams and interactive components, I'd recommend diving into the HoloViews documentation, specifically looking into how `streams` and `DynamicMap` objects are utilized. Also, a more formal treatment of interactive visual analysis, including event handling, can be found in books like "Interactive Data Visualization for the Web" by Scott Murray, which, although focused on web tech, provides foundational understanding of concepts used in these libraries. Also, look into the scientific visualization literature, which offers theoretical frameworks for building interactive visualizations. These resources help understand that the apparent 'not working' scenarios are almost always traceable to a mismatch in how interactivity is defined across different layers of the toolchain. From my experience, mastering this interplay between event streams and data transformations is crucial to crafting effective interactive visualizations.
