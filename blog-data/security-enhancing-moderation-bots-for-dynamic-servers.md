Hey so you want to make your server safer and keep things under control  right  Totally get it  Bots can be super helpful  Especially when it comes to keeping things clean  and making sure everyone is playing by the rules 

Here's how we can do it  First we need to think about the types of moderation we want to implement  Maybe we want to block certain words or phrases  Or maybe we want to  limit the frequency of messages from new users to prevent spam  We can even set up a system that automatically warns users when they break the rules

For blocking words, we can use a basic Python script  It'll check messages against a list of banned words and  automatically delete them

```python
import discord

client = discord.Client()

banned_words = ["spam", "badwords", "inappropriate"]

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if any(word in message.content for word in banned_words):
        await message.delete()
```

This is just a simple example,  you can expand this to include different types of checks and actions  For example, instead of deleting messages, we can send a warning to the user  Or even mute them for a certain period

For the frequency limitation, we can use a system that keeps track of the number of messages sent by each user within a certain timeframe  If a user exceeds the limit, we can send a warning or even mute them

```python
import discord
import time

client = discord.Client()

message_counts = {}

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author.id not in message_counts:
        message_counts[message.author.id] = 0
    message_counts[message.author.id] += 1

    if message_counts[message.author.id] > 5: # Limit to 5 messages in 1 minute
        await message.channel.send(f"{message.author.mention}, please slow down")
        time.sleep(60) # Wait 1 minute
        message_counts[message.author.id] = 0 
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to track message counts and send a warning to the user if they exceed a certain limit.  You can modify this to customize the threshold and warning message as needed.

Of course, there are more advanced techniques you can explore  Like using AI  or natural language processing to detect harmful content  There are also libraries and frameworks specifically built for discord bot development  Check out discord.py  and the discord API documentation  

The key is to find the balance between security and user experience  Don't over-moderate and make your server feel too restrictive  But at the same time,  ensure that your users feel safe and respected  

Hope this gives you a good starting point  Happy building!
