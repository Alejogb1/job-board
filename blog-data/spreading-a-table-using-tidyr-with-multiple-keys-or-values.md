Alright so you're wrestling with spreading a table using tidyr with multiple keys or values eh Been there done that got the t-shirt and the caffeine jitters to prove it This isn't exactly rocket science but tidyr can feel a bit cryptic sometimes when you’re trying to bend it to your will

Let me tell you about the time I was elbow deep in genomic data My supervisor wanted a specific data format and tidyr was my only hope I had a table that was almost there but the spread operation kept giving me headaches I was dealing with multiple keys a classic problem really but it wasn't intuitive at first

So the problem is this you’ve got a table that’s long where one or more columns should become column headers and other columns should become the values under those new headers its like pivoting but in the long to wide direction You’re not just moving one column to header status you're doing it with several variables or your values aren’t just one column they’re a couple of columns

Now tidyr's `spread()` used to be the go-to for this back in the day but that function is what we would say now legacy code so we tend to use `pivot_wider()` now its more flexible and clearer

Here's a basic example lets assume you have data that looks like this:

```r
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)

example_data <- tibble(
  group = c("A", "A", "B", "B", "C", "C"),
  variable = c("x", "y", "x", "y", "x", "y"),
  value1 = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60),
  value2 = c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600)
)

print(example_data)

# A tibble: 6 × 4
  # group variable value1 value2
  # <chr> <chr>    <dbl>  <dbl>
# 1 A     x         10    100
# 2 A     y         20    200
# 3 B     x         30    300
# 4 B     y         40    400
# 5 C     x         50    500
# 6 C     y         60    600
```
Notice that the combination of `group` and `variable` should become my headers and `value1` and `value2` are the values we want to spread out

Now with legacy spread you could get into some clunky syntax and be like why is this not working but that is why we do not use spread anymore

Here's how you can do it properly using `pivot_wider()`
```r
spreaded_data <- example_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(variable), values_from = c(value1, value2))

print(spreaded_data)
# A tibble: 3 × 5
#  group value1_x value1_y value2_x value2_y
#  <chr>    <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>
#1 A           10       20      100      200
#2 B           30       40      300      400
#3 C           50       60      500      600
```

So what’s going on here `names_from = c(variable)` specifies that the column variable will supply the column headers `values_from = c(value1, value2)` takes the values from both those columns that will fill in under each new column

In this case `pivot_wider` does exactly what we need it spread the values of `value1` and `value2` into their own columns based on the `variable` column and the `group` column is preserved as a row identifier

You can get a little more complex I saw a situation once where I had a really large dataset and needed to combine multiple key columns into the column names This required a slightly different approach but again `pivot_wider()` came to the rescue

Let me show you another example imagine a dataset like this:

```r
example_data_complex <- tibble(
  group = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B"),
  time = c("t1", "t2", "t3", "t1", "t2", "t3"),
  metric1 = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
  metric2 = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
)
print(example_data_complex)

# A tibble: 6 × 4
# group time  metric1 metric2
# <chr> <chr>   <dbl>   <dbl>
#1 A     t1        1      10
#2 A     t2        2      20
#3 A     t3        3      30
#4 B     t1        4      40
#5 B     t2        5      50
#6 B     t3        6      60
```

Here we want to create new columns from the combination of time and metric columns so for each group we get time_t1_metric1 time_t1_metric2 etc

Here’s how you would tackle that:

```r
spreaded_data_complex <- example_data_complex %>%
  unite(col = "new_cols", time, metric1, sep = "_metric1_", remove = FALSE) %>%
  unite(col = "new_cols_2", new_cols, metric2, sep = "_metric2_", remove = FALSE) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = new_cols_2, values_from = metric1, names_prefix = "metric1_") %>%
    select(-new_cols,-new_cols_2) %>%
    unite(col = "new_cols", time, metric2, sep = "_metric2_", remove = FALSE) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = new_cols, values_from = metric2, names_prefix = "metric2_") %>%
    select(-new_cols, -time, -metric1, -metric2)

print(spreaded_data_complex)
# A tibble: 2 × 7
#  group metric1_t1_metric1_10 metric1_t2_metric1_20 metric1_t3_metric1_30 metric2_t1_metric2_10 metric2_t2_metric2_20 metric2_t3_metric2_30
#  <chr>              <dbl>              <dbl>              <dbl>            <dbl>            <dbl>            <dbl>
#1 A                      1                  2                  3               10               20               30
#2 B                      4                  5                  6               40               50               60
```
In this case we used unite to create intermediary columns so that we could have columns with time and metric1 in name and then to use pivot_wider with that newly created column
It could probably be done in a more efficient manner but i think it is better to show an example that works but it is a bit clunky to show that it is also a possible way to solve that issue

Now you might be thinking what if the data isn't that clean what if you have missing values or duplicate entries Don't worry I've seen it all I was once working with some very messy survey data I swear the people collecting the data had never heard of data validation

In these situations you often have to add extra steps to your pipeline to address those inconsistencies but generally `pivot_wider` has some useful arguments

```r
example_messy_data <- tibble(
  group = c("A", "A", "B", "B", "C", "C", "A", "B"),
  variable = c("x", "y", "x", "y", "x", "y", "x", "y"),
  value = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, NA, 35)
)
print(example_messy_data)
# A tibble: 8 × 3
# group variable value
# <chr> <chr>  <dbl>
# 1 A     x         10
# 2 A     y         20
# 3 B     x         30
# 4 B     y         40
# 5 C     x         50
# 6 C     y         60
# 7 A     x         NA
# 8 B     y         35

spreaded_messy_data <- example_messy_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value,
              values_fill = list(value = 0),
              values_fn = list(value = mean))


print(spreaded_messy_data)
# A tibble: 3 × 3
#  group     x     y
#  <chr> <dbl> <dbl>
#1 A        5    20
#2 B       30    37.5
#3 C       50    60
```

Here `values_fill = list(value = 0)` fills the missing values with 0 and the  `values_fn = list(value = mean)` calculates the mean of the `value` column when duplicated columns exist

The main idea is that you are generally pivoting your data from a long to a wide format

In general the important takeaway is that `pivot_wider()` is your best bet for spreading data especially when dealing with multiple key or value columns It might take some fiddling to get it exactly right but its generally flexible and more predictable than `spread()` ever was

Also remember that while I’m showing you R remember this concept of going from long to wide format is fairly standard and similar concepts can be found in pandas in python

If you want to dive deeper into tidyr and data manipulation in R I recommend "R for Data Science" by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund It's basically the bible of data manipulation in R

And if you're in the mood for something a bit more technical you could read some papers on relational data algebra or data transformations but that can be boring if you're just trying to spread your table (I mean who needs the relational algebra equivalent of a good spread function right? haha just kidding unless you like that type of stuff)

Anyways hope that helps you out Good luck and feel free to drop another question if you get stuck again I mean debugging is half the fun isn't it well maybe not the fun part but it is part of the process
