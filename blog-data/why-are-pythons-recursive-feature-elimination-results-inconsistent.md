Okay, let’s tackle this. I've spent more hours than I care to count debugging machine learning pipelines, and inconsistencies with recursive feature elimination (rfe) in python are a recurring frustration. It's not necessarily a flaw in the implementation itself, but rather a confluence of factors, primarily tied to the nature of the algorithms involved and how rfe interacts with them. Let me break down what I've observed and how you can mitigate these issues, along with some code examples to illustrate the points.

The core problem stems from the iterative nature of rfe. Each iteration, it trains a model, evaluates feature importance, and then removes the least important feature(s). This process is fundamentally deterministic given a fixed model and training data, but, in practice, we’re not dealing with ideal situations. Small perturbations can have cascading effects, leading to different features being deemed 'least important' at each step. This inconsistency becomes amplified by how various model types interpret feature importance. Linear models might have coefficients directly translated to importance, while tree-based models rely on impurity reduction, a more complex and sensitive measure.

Furthermore, the inherent stochasticity in model training adds another layer of variability. Most gradient-based optimizers used in models have some degree of randomness, especially with initialization, which means that for the *same data*, even without rfe, you might get slightly different models. When you repeatedly train the model at each rfe iteration, this small noise builds up and can drastically shift the feature importance rankings. This is particularly noticeable when features have similar importance scores – a tiny shift can alter which feature gets eliminated.

Let's say we're working with a support vector machine (svm), which, while powerful, is not immune to these instabilities. In an early project, I tried using rfe with a linear svm to reduce the dimensionality of a high-dimensional dataset. I noticed wildly varying feature subsets depending on the random seed. This wasn't an rfe bug, per se, but rather a consequence of how small differences in the support vector construction led to different feature elimination patterns.

Here's a snippet using a `LinearSVC` and scikit-learn's `rfe` to illustrate the effect:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def run_rfe(random_state, n_features_to_select=5):
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=10, n_informative=7, random_state=42)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)


    model = LinearSVC(random_state=random_state, dual=False, max_iter=1000) #dual=false to avoid convergence problems
    rfe = RFE(estimator=model, n_features_to_select=n_features_to_select)
    rfe.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return rfe.support_


for i in range(3):
    selected_features = run_rfe(random_state=i*10)
    print(f"random_state {i*10}: Selected features: {np.where(selected_features)[0]}")
```

You'll likely see that the selected feature sets vary even though only the random state for the `LinearSVC` varies slightly. This highlights the impact of stochastic initialization on results. The `dual=False` argument helps avoid convergence issues that `LinearSVC` sometimes has, which will further amplify the variability. Standardizing the data beforehand also helps in this particular situation, but is not a magical solution that can remove all variability.

Another contributing factor is that we're essentially making a greedy choice at each step. The algorithm doesn't consider the potential downstream impacts of removing a particular feature in terms of overall performance, only the immediate reduction of a feature based on current model state. This can lead to a 'local optima' trap, where we end up with a suboptimal set of features. Removing the least important feature can mean losing information that, in combination with other features, provides additional predictive power.

Consider a situation with features that are highly correlated. RFE might select one of the correlated features, eliminating the others at subsequent steps. However, a slightly different initial model might have chosen a different, but equally good, subset of features. In a production scenario, this caused me considerable grief, as the model behavior seemed to be unstable, and model retraining would sometimes lead to unexpected feature sets being selected.

To mitigate these inconsistencies, several strategies can be applied. First, it's crucial to use robust cross-validation techniques during rfe. Instead of just running rfe once, you can use k-fold cross-validation with rfe nested in each fold and then look at the *frequency* each feature is selected across folds. This provides a much more reliable feature selection. I also found that using stratified sampling during splitting can help when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Here’s an example that implements nested cross-validation:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.base import clone
from collections import Counter

def cross_validated_rfe(X,y,n_features_to_select=5, n_splits=5, random_state=42):
    skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=random_state)
    selected_features_counts = Counter()

    for train_index, test_index in skf.split(X, y):
      X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
      y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]

      scaler = StandardScaler()
      X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
      X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

      model = LinearSVC(random_state=random_state, dual=False, max_iter=1000)
      rfe = RFE(estimator=clone(model), n_features_to_select=n_features_to_select)
      rfe.fit(X_train, y_train)
      selected_features = np.where(rfe.support_)[0]
      selected_features_counts.update(selected_features)

    return selected_features_counts

X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=10, n_informative=7, random_state=42)

feature_counts = cross_validated_rfe(X,y)

print(f"Feature selection frequencies: {feature_counts}")
```

This will provide a count of how often a particular feature was selected through multiple rounds of rfe across different folds. The higher the number, the more often that feature seems relevant.

Finally, exploring alternatives to rfe can sometimes be beneficial. Techniques like LASSO or other regularization methods embedded in model training can inherently perform feature selection as part of the model optimization process. In one project, using elastic net regularization directly within a logistic regression model produced much more stable feature subsets compared to rfe and also resulted in better performance because it was optimized with respect to the performance metric. The inherent stability and better optimization can greatly reduce the unpredictability associated with using rfe directly.

For further reading, I'd highly recommend “The Elements of Statistical Learning” by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. This will provide a much deeper theoretical understanding of both model behavior and feature selection in general. You may also find “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning” by Christopher Bishop helpful for insights into various probabilistic and machine learning algorithms which can aid feature selection processes. A good understanding of the inner workings of the algorithms is crucial for understanding the limitations of the results obtained from them.

In summary, rfe inconsistency isn't a bug but an inherent characteristic arising from the stochastic nature of models and the greedy approach of rfe itself. Addressing these inconsistencies requires a combination of careful methodology, like using cross-validation, and in some cases, a more holistic approach that involves looking at other selection methods. Understanding where these inconsistencies originate from is the first step to overcoming them.
