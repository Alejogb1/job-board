Alright, let’s tackle backpropagation local gradients. This is something I've spent quite a bit of time with, going back to some early neural net experiments I conducted while working on a machine vision project for autonomous vehicles (yes, that was as hairy as it sounds). So, let's break down the concept and then get into some concrete code examples.

The fundamental idea behind backpropagation is the chain rule of calculus. We're essentially trying to figure out how a tiny change in some weight or bias in our neural network affects the overall error of our model. The 'local gradient' is the core of this process; it's the gradient of the output of a particular layer or neuron with respect to its inputs. We calculate these local gradients step-by-step, moving backward through the network, hence 'backpropagation.' This local gradient calculation acts as the intermediate component, enabling us to link the error at the output back to the changes required at the inputs of each layer.

To begin, let’s take a look at an individual neuron. Assume we've got a neuron taking multiple inputs (let’s call them *xᵢ*) which are multiplied by corresponding weights (*wᵢ*). There’s also an addition of a bias term *b*. The weighted sum, *z*, is then passed to an activation function *σ*, resulting in an output *a*. So, we have:

*   *z = ∑(*wᵢ* *xᵢ*) + *b*
*   *a = σ(z)*

The local gradient here involves two key elements: the derivative of the output *a* with respect to the weighted sum *z* (*∂a/∂z*), and the derivative of *z* with respect to each input weight *wᵢ* (*∂z/∂wᵢ*), bias *b* (*∂z/∂b*), and input *xᵢ* (*∂z/∂xᵢ*). These are all part of the local context within the node that we must understand to understand the gradients.

The derivative *∂a/∂z* depends entirely on the specific activation function *σ*. For example, if *σ* is a sigmoid function, the derivative is *σ(z)(1-σ(z))*. If it's a ReLU, the derivative is 1 if z > 0 and 0 otherwise. It's crucial to choose a proper function and know the derivative calculation.

Next, the derivative *∂z/∂wᵢ* is simply the corresponding input *xᵢ*. Similarly, *∂z/∂b* is 1, because *z* changes by one unit for each change in *b*. And *∂z/∂xᵢ* is simply the corresponding weight *wᵢ*.

So, putting this all together, to find out how the output *a* changes with respect to a single weight *wᵢ*, we use the chain rule:

*   *∂a/∂wᵢ* = (*∂a/∂z*) * (*∂z/∂wᵢ*)

This gives us (*∂a/∂z*) \* *xᵢ*, which is essentially the local gradient of the output with respect to that weight. We will need to combine this with the *downstream* error signal to calculate how to adjust the weights correctly, but this is the local component. The same process is applied to the bias term (*∂a/∂b*) and the input (*∂a/∂xᵢ*).

Let's translate this into code using python and numpy. This is highly simplified for illustration, keeping things straightforward, not production level by any means, but clear for educational purposes.

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
  return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
  return sigmoid(x) * (1 - sigmoid(x))

def calculate_local_gradients_neuron(inputs, weights, bias):
    z = np.dot(weights, inputs) + bias
    a = sigmoid(z) #Using sigmoid for this illustration
    da_dz = sigmoid_derivative(z)
    dz_dw = inputs
    dz_db = 1
    dz_dx = weights
    
    local_gradients = {
        'da_dz': da_dz,
        'dz_dw': dz_dw,
        'dz_db': dz_db,
        'dz_dx': dz_dx
    }
    
    return local_gradients
    

# Example usage:
inputs = np.array([0.5, 0.3, 0.8])
weights = np.array([0.2, -0.1, 0.4])
bias = 0.1

gradients = calculate_local_gradients_neuron(inputs, weights, bias)

print("Local Gradients:")
for key,value in gradients.items():
    print(f"  {key}: {value}")
```

This example shows the calculation of the local gradients at a single node using a sigmoid activation function. The output shows the derivatives *∂a/∂z*, *∂z/∂w*, *∂z/∂b*, and *∂z/∂x*. It gives us the building blocks for gradient calculation.

Now let’s consider a slightly more complex scenario: a simple fully connected layer. This layer essentially does a matrix multiplication of inputs and weights, adds biases, and then usually passes through an activation function. To get the local gradients here, we need to think about matrix derivatives. The math can get a bit heavy, so I’ll illustrate it with code and explain.

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return sigmoid(x) * (1 - sigmoid(x))

def calculate_local_gradients_fully_connected(inputs, weights, biases):
    z = np.dot(weights, inputs) + biases
    a = sigmoid(z) #Using sigmoid here
    da_dz = sigmoid_derivative(z) # Derivative of output wrt Z
    dz_dw = np.expand_dims(inputs,axis=0) #Derivative of Z wrt W
    dz_db = 1 #Derivative of Z wrt b
    dz_dx = weights #Derivative of Z wrt X
    
    local_gradients = {
        'da_dz': da_dz,
        'dz_dw': dz_dw,
        'dz_db': dz_db,
        'dz_dx': dz_dx
    }
    
    return local_gradients

# Example usage:
inputs = np.array([0.5, 0.3, 0.8])
weights = np.array([[0.2, -0.1, 0.4], [0.3, 0.2, -0.5]]) # 2 output nodes
biases = np.array([0.1, -0.2])

gradients = calculate_local_gradients_fully_connected(inputs, weights, biases)
print("Local Gradients (Fully Connected Layer):")
for key,value in gradients.items():
    print(f"  {key}: {value}")
```

This example showcases how to calculate the local gradients for a fully connected layer, again utilizing the sigmoid activation. Crucially, notice that *dz_dw* is now a matrix where the inputs are used as the columns, which allows us to correctly perform downstream calculations. The shape of this is important for ensuring correct matrix multiplication during backpropagation.

Finally, let's look at the ReLU activation since it is incredibly popular. The simplicity of ReLU makes its derivative very simple, but it is critical to understand.

```python
import numpy as np

def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0,x)

def relu_derivative(x):
    return np.where(x>0, 1,0)

def calculate_local_gradients_relu_layer(inputs, weights, biases):
    z = np.dot(weights, inputs) + biases
    a = relu(z)
    da_dz = relu_derivative(z)
    dz_dw = np.expand_dims(inputs,axis=0) #Derivative of Z wrt W
    dz_db = 1 #Derivative of Z wrt b
    dz_dx = weights #Derivative of Z wrt X
    
    local_gradients = {
        'da_dz': da_dz,
        'dz_dw': dz_dw,
        'dz_db': dz_db,
        'dz_dx': dz_dx
    }
    
    return local_gradients

# Example usage:
inputs = np.array([0.5, 0.3, -0.8])
weights = np.array([[0.2, -0.1, 0.4], [0.3, 0.2, -0.5]]) # 2 output nodes
biases = np.array([0.1, -0.2])

gradients = calculate_local_gradients_relu_layer(inputs, weights, biases)
print("Local Gradients (ReLU Layer):")
for key,value in gradients.items():
    print(f"  {key}: {value}")
```

This example presents the implementation of a layer using a ReLU activation. Here the *relu_derivative* function returns 1 or 0 based on whether the input to ReLU was positive or not. The crucial point is that while the ReLU activation is non-linear, its derivative is very simple, and this simplifies our backward pass tremendously.

For a deeper theoretical understanding, I recommend checking out “Deep Learning” by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. It's a comprehensive text that covers the mathematical underpinnings of backpropagation thoroughly. Additionally, the online course materials by Stanford CS231n can also provide great insight into the practical aspects of neural network implementation, along with detailed explanations of the backpropagation process.

In my experience, focusing on the derivatives of the activation functions and the layer-specific input/output relationships is key to grasping the whole gradient calculation. Understanding the mathematical derivation and verifying it through code like the examples presented will build a solid foundation for working with deep learning frameworks. These examples illustrate what *local* gradients are, and these local gradients will be multiplied by the *downstream* gradients to get full gradient values. It’s a step-by-step process, but breaking it down like this will make backpropagation much more approachable.
