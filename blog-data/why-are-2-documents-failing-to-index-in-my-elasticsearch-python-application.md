,  Document indexing failures in Elasticsearch, particularly when they’re isolated to just a couple of cases, can be a surprisingly nuanced problem. I’ve seen this happen more times than I care to count, and it usually boils down to subtle data inconsistencies or unexpected mapping quirks. It's seldom a straight bug in the Elasticsearch cluster itself, especially if the rest of your pipeline is performing adequately.

From my experience, debugging these situations requires a systematic approach. First, don't immediately assume it’s some sort of major malfunction. We should start with the basics and methodically eliminate the common culprits. When two specific documents fail, but many others are indexed correctly, it often means those two documents contain peculiarities that are incompatible with your Elasticsearch index mapping or configuration.

Let's walk through some of the most probable reasons and how you can identify and fix them, focusing on practical examples as we go.

**1. Data Type Mismatches:**

The most frequent offender is when the data types of the fields in the document don’t align with the defined mapping in your Elasticsearch index. If, for example, you expect an integer in a field but the document contains a string that can’t be parsed as an integer, indexing will fail. Elasticsearch, in its wisdom, might provide very specific error messages, but sometimes it is vague enough that needs a deeper dive.

Consider this. Say your index mapping defines a field named 'price' as type 'integer', but the two failing documents contain something like:

```json
{
  "product_name": "Widget 42",
  "price": "10.99"
}
```

Notice that the price is a string, not an integer as required by your mapping. Elasticsearch will reject this document. To see the specific error, you'll need to inspect your Elasticsearch logs or capture the response from your python client. The way you deal with it can vary. You could either update your mapping to a 'float', 'double' or if you require the price to be an integer, you might want to sanitize your data before indexing.

Here is how you might use Python to sanitize this specific issue.

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

def sanitize_document(doc):
    try:
        doc['price'] = int(float(doc['price']))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        print(f"Unable to parse the price for {doc}, skipping conversion.")
        # You might want to handle this failure more gracefully
        pass
    return doc

# Assume 'es' is your Elasticsearch client object
def index_document(es, index, doc_to_index):
    try:
        response = es.index(index=index, document=doc_to_index)
        print(f"Document indexed successfully with ID: {response['_id']}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error indexing document: {e}")
        # Log the error in a proper manner for further analysis

documents = [
    {"product_name": "Widget 41", "price": 10 },
    {"product_name": "Widget 42", "price": "10.99"},
    {"product_name": "Widget 43", "price": 11}
]

for doc in documents:
    sanitized_doc = sanitize_document(doc)
    index_document(es, "products_index", sanitized_doc)
```
In this example, I am parsing the float to integer, if it fails for some reason, the code continues gracefully without failing the whole indexing process. You can adapt this based on your specific needs.

**2. Mapping Limitations or Dynamic Mapping Issues:**

Occasionally, it's not a simple type mismatch but a mapping restriction that's causing issues. If you’re using dynamic mapping and have very large fields or fields with high cardinality, Elasticsearch may struggle. If the two failing documents have vastly larger text fields than the others, or if they include unusual characters, dynamic mapping can either fail or produce unexpected field types.

For example, if you are using dynamic mapping and a field 'description' is included in your two failing documents and has a very long text value, it can trigger Elasticsearch to either drop the entire document (if too large), or assign an incompatible type to the index mapping. While Elasticsearch does allow you to re-index with a different mapping, a better approach is to manage your mapping in advance before you index your documents.

Let's illustrate this: Suppose one of your documents contained an extremely long string which by default Elasticsearch maps it to a text data type that is tokenized. However, this tokenization can lead to problems if the string is extremely long. Here is an example of an Elasticsearch client interaction with Python where I'm explicitly defining the mapping for the text field.

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch("http://localhost:9200") # replace with your cluster url

def create_index_with_mapping(es, index_name):
    mapping = {
        "mappings": {
            "properties": {
                "product_name": {"type": "text"},
                "description": {"type": "keyword", "ignore_above": 256}, # limits the length
                "price": {"type": "integer"}
            }
        }
    }

    try:
        es.indices.create(index=index_name, body=mapping)
        print(f"Index '{index_name}' created with custom mapping.")
    except Exception as e:
         print(f"Error creating the index '{index_name}': {e}")

    return

create_index_with_mapping(es, "products_index_fixed")

documents = [
        {"product_name": "Product 1", "description": "This is a short description", "price": 10},
        {"product_name": "Product 2", "description": "This is a very long text description that exceeds the default limits allowed by Elasticsearch and this would normally fail if dynamic mapping was enabled. However, since we are using the 'ignore_above' setting, this should now work", "price": 10},
        {"product_name": "Product 3", "description": "Another short description", "price": 10}
    ]

def index_document(es, index, doc_to_index):
    try:
        response = es.index(index=index, document=doc_to_index)
        print(f"Document indexed successfully with ID: {response['_id']}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error indexing document: {e}")
        # Log the error in a proper manner for further analysis

for doc in documents:
    index_document(es, "products_index_fixed", doc)
```

This illustrates a basic approach to controlling your index mapping and preventing issues related to dynamic mapping. You can expand on this to handle many specific needs.

**3. Document Structure Issues and Conflicts:**

Sometimes the documents themselves are simply structurally incorrect. This could mean invalid JSON, missing required fields, or having unexpected nesting or complex objects when the mapping doesn't expect it. Elasticsearch isn't terribly forgiving of these kinds of issues. In complex objects, you must check that each field and sub-field fits the specific mapping. If your object is more deeply nested than what is specified in your mapping, it can fail.

Let's consider a situation where a document might have an invalid structure:

```json
{
    "product_name": "Widget 44",
    "attributes": {
       "color": "red",
        "weight": 10,
        "details" : {
            "material": "metal"
        }
    }
}

```

And your mapping only expects "color" and "weight" within the "attributes" object. Elasticsearch will reject this document as the extra nested object is not defined. Instead, you can use a type such as 'nested' to define such hierarchical data structures.

Here's a Python example how to define the mapping for this particular scenario using the 'nested' data type and how to handle it.

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
es = Elasticsearch("http://localhost:9200") # replace with your cluster url

def create_index_with_nested_mapping(es, index_name):
    mapping = {
        "mappings": {
            "properties": {
                "product_name": {"type": "text"},
                "attributes": {
                    "type": "nested",
                    "properties": {
                        "color": {"type": "keyword"},
                        "weight": {"type": "integer"},
                         "details":{
                             "type": "object",
                             "properties": {
                                "material" : {"type": "keyword"}
                             }
                            }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    try:
        es.indices.create(index=index_name, body=mapping)
        print(f"Index '{index_name}' created with custom mapping.")
    except Exception as e:
         print(f"Error creating the index '{index_name}': {e}")

    return

create_index_with_nested_mapping(es, "products_index_nested")


documents = [
    {
        "product_name": "Widget 44",
        "attributes": {
           "color": "red",
            "weight": 10,
             "details" : {
              "material": "metal"
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "product_name": "Widget 45",
        "attributes": {
            "color": "blue",
            "weight": 12,
            "details" : {
             "material": "wood"
            }
        }
    }
]

def index_document(es, index, doc_to_index):
    try:
        response = es.index(index=index, document=doc_to_index)
        print(f"Document indexed successfully with ID: {response['_id']}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error indexing document: {e}")
        # Log the error in a proper manner for further analysis

for doc in documents:
    index_document(es, "products_index_nested", doc)

```

This example should clarify the nested data type handling in Elasticsearch.

**Debugging Recommendations:**

For deeper analysis I'd recommend a solid read-through of the "Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide" by Clinton Gormley and Zachary Tong. Specifically focus on chapters that cover mapping, dynamic mapping, data types and document structure. Also, the official documentation at elastic.co provides invaluable details on the specifics of error messages and debugging. It's crucial to thoroughly examine the response from your python client when the indexing fails, or dive into Elasticsearch’s logs to glean the detailed error reports.

In conclusion, document indexing failures, especially isolated ones, often stem from data inconsistencies or misalignment between your data and index mapping. By methodically checking data types, understanding your mappings and carefully examining document structure, you can generally pinpoint and resolve the issue effectively. Don't get too caught up in complex scenarios before checking the fundamentals first; those have served me well over the years.
