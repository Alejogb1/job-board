alright, i've seen this movie before. nested forms with self-joins in rails? yeah, that's a classic setup for infinite loops if you're not careful. let me break down what's probably happening and how to fix it, based on some personal, let's say "learning experiences", over the years. i'm sure many developers have encountered this.

the root of the problem, typically, lies in how rails handles form submissions and object creation when you've got a self-join association. essentially, you're telling rails to create or update a record, and then as part of that, to create or update related records *of the same type*, which in turn, might also trigger the same process. if your logic isn't explicitly preventing it, that can cause a cascading creation loop. i remember one time i was building a category system for a blog, with categories that could have parent categories. my code started creating categories like a toddler playing with blocks that just never stopped. it was, uh, a *memorable* debugging session to put it mildly, probably involved more caffeine than advisable.

the most common scenario is when your form is submitted, the parameters hit your controller's create/update action, and within that action you're using `accepts_nested_attributes_for` without proper safeguards or understanding of the data being passed.

let me show you a simplified setup that probably mirrors what you're doing. suppose you have a `category` model:

```ruby
class category < applicationrecord
  belongs_to :parent, class_name: 'category', optional: true
  has_many :children, class_name: 'category', foreign_key: 'parent_id', dependent: :destroy

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :children, allow_destroy: true
end
```

and then your form might look like this (erb example):

```erb
<%= form_with(model: @category) do |form| %>
  <%= form.label :name %>
  <%= form.text_field :name %>

  <%= form.fields_for :children do |children_form| %>
    <%= children_form.label :name, "child category name" %>
    <%= children_form.text_field :name %>
    <% if children_form.object.persisted? %>
      <%= children_form.check_box :_destroy %>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
  <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
```

now, the critical piece is the controller. the default approach with `accepts_nested_attributes_for` can easily cause the loop. let me demonstrate what i mean. a *bad* controller action might look like this:

```ruby
class categoriescontroller < applicationcontroller
  def create
    @category = category.new(category_params)

    if @category.save
      redirect_to @category, notice: 'category was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end
  
  private

  def category_params
    params.require(:category).permit(:name, children_attributes: [:id, :name, :_destroy])
  end
end
```

here’s what’s happening: if you submit the form to create or edit a category including nested children, rails will try to create new children or update existing ones, just as you'd expect. *however*, since there is no logic to prevent a new child category from setting another child category, and so on, it may create an infinite loop. imagine a situation where you accidentally include a new child category in the parameters that are identical to the current category. rails will treat that as a new creation when it is technically a self-reference. and it will just keep going, creating children of children of children... you get the idea.

here are ways to prevent it:

1. **limit the depth of nesting**: you can prevent your app from going to deep using logic on the client side, that way the params will be limited. i usually do it in javascript with some logic when adding new nested fields for the form, so the user does not keep adding fields and in the controller i also prevent it from going too deep, just to be certain. that way you add a simple limit to the depth. usually, i only allow 2 or 3 levels of nested data.

2. **prevent self-referencing on the model**: you can prevent a category from being its own parent via a simple validation logic. i usually just add a simple validator and it's done, it's easier to be done on the model to prevent further errors:

```ruby
class category < applicationrecord
  belongs_to :parent, class_name: 'category', optional: true
  has_many :children, class_name: 'category', foreign_key: 'parent_id', dependent: :destroy

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :children, allow_destroy: true

  validate :prevent_self_referencing

  private

  def prevent_self_referencing
    if parent_id == id
      errors.add(:parent_id, "can't be the same as self")
    end
  end
end
```

3. **carefully crafting the controller params**: if you are allowing multiple creation/updates on the nested form, always check for blank values, that is one of the main ways to create an infinite loop. you need to check if you need the logic you are doing. most of the time i just update the params so blank fields are just ignored, that saves me from most of these issues. this is an example of that logic:

```ruby
class categoriescontroller < applicationcontroller
  def create
    @category = category.new(category_params)

    if @category.save
      redirect_to @category, notice: 'category was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def category_params
    params.require(:category).permit(:name, children_attributes: [:id, :name, :_destroy]).tap do |whitelisted|
        if whitelisted[:children_attributes].present?
            whitelisted[:children_attributes].reject! do |_index, child_attributes|
            child_attributes[:name].blank? 
            end
        end
    end
  end
end
```

here we check if `children_attributes` is present, and filter out nested attributes that have a blank `name`, so we just discard the parameters that may cause the issues. with this, we are making sure that empty values that might cause a new creation are ignored, which most of the time saves you from issues.

also it is useful to understand what the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` is actually doing under the hood. i suggest you read the official rails documentation about this. the paper "understanding active record associations" may also give you some insights on how associations are handled internally within rails. "eloquent ruby" is another book that is full of good advices. "metaprogramming ruby 2" is also something i use frequently to really understand how the underlying rails code works, it also has good examples about form parameters and how to handle them efficiently. i have also read some excellent papers on database optimizations that touch on associations as well.

avoid assumptions, always inspect the params. especially in a form with nested data. printing your params is a very useful way to debug issues like this, so make sure you use `rails server` and its printing capabilities.

oh, and just to add a bit of humor: it's not a bug, it's a feature... *it just happens to be an unintentional feature* and we all have done it at some point.

in summary, prevent the possibility of self-reference on the model, add limitations on the depth of the nested params that are being created, and filter out blank data before sending it to the model. be mindful of what you are creating or updating, and you should have a well-behaved nested form without it trying to create the entire universe. if you are still having issues, you need to closely inspect your params, and i am 99% sure you will figure it out, always the details are what matters in the end. good luck!
