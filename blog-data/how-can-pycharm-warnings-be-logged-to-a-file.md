Alright, let's tackle this one. Logging PyCharm's warnings to a file isn't a feature directly exposed within the IDE's settings itself in the way you might think, where you could simply check a box and specify a path. It involves leveraging the underlying Python environment and redirecting the warnings module's output. I've definitely run into situations in the past where having these logged was incredibly useful for tracking down subtle issues within complex projects, especially when collaborating with teams. Instead of relying on intermittent IDE popups, having a dedicated log becomes quite invaluable.

My approach usually involves overriding the default `warnings` module behavior within the execution context of your Python scripts. This means we're effectively hijacking where those warning messages end up, changing them from standard error to our log file. It's not overly complicated, and once you've implemented it once, it’s straightforward to reuse in any project. We're not trying to log IDE internals, just the warnings generated by your project's code, which I feel is an important distinction.

Let's get down to implementation details. The Python `warnings` module provides a function called `warnings.showwarning` that's responsible for formatting and displaying warning messages. We can override this function with our custom logic to direct messages to a file. We’ll need to import `warnings`, `os` and `logging` for this. The `logging` module will handle the formatting and proper file handling.

Here's a very basic initial approach. We'll create a logger, set a file handler and then override the `showwarning` function. This version doesn’t cover more complex formatting, but it provides a starting point.

```python
import warnings
import logging
import os

def setup_warning_logger(log_file="pycharm_warnings.log"):
    """Sets up a logger for redirecting warnings to a file."""

    logger = logging.getLogger("pycharm_warnings")
    logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)  # Only log warnings or more severe
    file_handler = logging.FileHandler(log_file, mode='a')
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)

    def log_warning(message, category, filename, lineno, file=None, line=None):
        logger.warning(f"{category.__name__}: {message} in {filename}:{lineno}")

    warnings.showwarning = log_warning

    return logger

if __name__ == "__main__":
    logger = setup_warning_logger()

    # Example of triggering a warning
    warnings.warn("This is a test warning", DeprecationWarning)

    print("Test script executed. Check 'pycharm_warnings.log'")
```

In this example, the `setup_warning_logger` function initializes a basic logger that appends to the specified file. We then redefine the `warnings.showwarning` function to call our logger instead of printing to the console. Running this script will generate a simple deprecation warning, which will be directed to `pycharm_warnings.log`. This is a good starting point. You’ll notice that it provides the category (like DeprecationWarning), the actual message, and the file and line number where the warning originated. The `__main__` block serves as a minimal test.

However, if you are doing anything more complicated, you need to be more intentional with the logging formats. Let’s suppose we want to keep track of which module actually generated the warning, we'd need a slightly more advanced formatter. Also, if you're working in a larger project with modules spanning multiple directories, it would be beneficial to know the full path of the file. Let’s create an improved version.

```python
import warnings
import logging
import os
import inspect

def setup_extended_warning_logger(log_file="pycharm_warnings_extended.log"):
    """Sets up a logger for redirecting warnings to a file with more details."""

    logger = logging.getLogger("extended_pycharm_warnings")
    logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)  # Only log warnings or more severe
    file_handler = logging.FileHandler(log_file, mode='a')
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(module)s - %(message)s')
    file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)

    def log_warning_extended(message, category, filename, lineno, file=None, line=None):
        frame = inspect.currentframe().f_back.f_back # Get the calling frame
        module_name = inspect.getmodule(frame).__name__
        full_filename = os.path.abspath(filename)
        logger.warning(f"{category.__name__}: {message} in {full_filename}:{lineno}", extra={'module':module_name})


    warnings.showwarning = log_warning_extended

    return logger

if __name__ == "__main__":
    logger = setup_extended_warning_logger()

    # Example in a dummy module
    import dummy_module

    print("Test script with module completed. Check 'pycharm_warnings_extended.log'")

```

Now, this is a step closer to production-ready. We added `inspect` to obtain the module name and used `os.path.abspath` to get full file path. The formatted output is much more useful for pinpointing where the warnings originate. In the `log_warning_extended` function, we get the current frame and then the frame above that to determine where the warning actually originates. We then supply this via the `extra` argument so that it’s accessible to the formatter via `%(module)s`. To see this in action, it needs the simple `dummy_module.py` alongside the main script:

```python
# dummy_module.py
import warnings

def generate_dummy_warning():
    warnings.warn("This is a dummy module warning", UserWarning)

generate_dummy_warning()
```

In practical scenarios, you'll likely want to set up this logger at the entry point of your application. This approach offers granular control. When you are using packages that might trigger warnings, you can set specific modules to different logging levels. This is very useful if certain modules are producing too many irrelevant warnings. You should also take care with circular imports when setting this up; sometimes, importing the module that does this setup could trigger a warning in another module that hasn’t loaded the logging setup. You should take care to get the order of loading right, usually by putting it early in the setup process.

For larger projects, particularly those involving complex scientific computations, or if you're dealing with a team, I recommend investigating further into the Python `logging` module’s advanced features such as using rotating log files, which are especially handy for long-running processes and help prevent a single file from growing too large. You should look into the documentation of the `logging` module, especially `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler`

Finally, regarding resources, I always direct people to *The Python Standard Library by Example* by Doug Hellmann. It's an excellent deep-dive into modules like `logging` and `warnings`, providing far more depth than you'll find in the official Python documentation alone. Furthermore, the official Python `logging` module documentation at docs.python.org is a must-read, particularly regarding formatters and handlers. As for general practices for project organization, *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* by Robert C. Martin offers insights on structuring projects that can often indirectly reduce warning clutter and improve debugging.

I hope this was a comprehensive answer, drawing from my experiences. Logging warnings this way might seem like a small thing, but it can significantly improve the maintainability and debuggability of your Python projects, especially in more demanding situations.
