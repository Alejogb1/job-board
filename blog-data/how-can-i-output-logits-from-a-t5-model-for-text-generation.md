Alright, let's talk about extracting logits from a T5 model during text generation. It’s a task I've tackled quite a few times in various natural language processing projects, from experimenting with advanced decoding strategies to fine-tuning specific aspects of the model’s output distribution. You're not alone in wanting more control than just the final generated text; the logits offer a window into the model's internal calculations and can be incredibly valuable for a host of reasons.

The standard way a T5 model, or any sequence-to-sequence transformer for that matter, generates text is by taking the token with the highest probability at each step. This is essentially an *argmax* operation performed on the model's final output layer, the linear layer that converts the transformer’s internal representation into probabilities for each token in the vocabulary. However, before those probabilities, we have what are known as logits; they’re the raw, unnormalized scores coming out of the network. The logits vector for any given step holds a score for each possible token, with higher scores indicating higher confidence *prior to* normalization into probabilities.

I've found, based on my experiences, that accessing these logits often involves a slight detour in the standard `transformers` library’s generation process. The library tends to abstract away those details for ease of use, which is generally helpful but limits flexibility when you need it. Typically, it involves manipulating the model's forward pass directly, intercepting the output *before* the softmax or argmax functions are applied.

Now, here’s how I've typically approached this in practice, with some code examples to illustrate the process. We'll be using PyTorch and the `transformers` library here, as it’s the most common setup for such tasks.

**Example 1: Basic Logit Extraction During Generation**

This first example will extract logits during a basic greedy decoding generation process. We'll disable the `generate` function's default behavior and handle generation step by step to get our hands on those logits:

```python
import torch
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

# Initialize tokenizer and model
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

# Input text
input_text = "translate English to German: The cat sat on the mat."
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

# Define initial setup for generation
max_length = 30
decoder_input_ids = torch.tensor([[tokenizer.pad_token_id]], dtype=torch.long)
generated_ids = []

model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    encoder_output = model.encoder(input_ids).last_hidden_state

    for i in range(max_length):
       decoder_outputs = model.decoder(decoder_input_ids, encoder_hidden_states=encoder_output)
       lm_output = model.lm_head(decoder_outputs.last_hidden_state)
       logits = lm_output[:, -1, :] # Get logits for current token
       predicted_token_id = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1) # Greedy decoding

       generated_ids.append(predicted_token_id.item())
       decoder_input_ids = torch.cat([decoder_input_ids, predicted_token_id.unsqueeze(0)], dim=1)

       if predicted_token_id.item() == tokenizer.eos_token_id:
           break

generated_text = tokenizer.decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
print("Generated text:", generated_text)
print("Generated ids:", generated_ids)
# Example of how to print a logit vector for the first token generated.
print("Logits for first generated token:", logits[0,0,:])

```

In this snippet, I iterate through the decoding process manually. The critical step is retrieving the output of the `lm_head`, which is the layer right before the softmax, and taking only the last token's logits ( `lm_output[:, -1, :]`). I then perform a simple greedy search using `torch.argmax`, but importantly I *also* have the full `logits` vector which you can then process as needed.

**Example 2: Logit Collection with Beam Search**

Moving beyond greedy decoding, let’s look at how we can collect logits during a more sophisticated method, like beam search. This adds a layer of complexity, as we'll have multiple decoding paths to keep track of:

```python
import torch
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
from typing import List, Tuple

# Initialize tokenizer and model
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

# Input text
input_text = "translate English to French: The sun is shining brightly."
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

# Define beam search parameters
beam_size = 3
max_length = 30

model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    encoder_output = model.encoder(input_ids).last_hidden_state
    decoder_input_ids = torch.tensor([[tokenizer.pad_token_id]] * beam_size, dtype=torch.long)
    beam_scores = torch.zeros(beam_size, dtype=torch.float)
    all_logits = [[] for _ in range(beam_size)]

    for i in range(max_length):
         decoder_outputs = model.decoder(decoder_input_ids, encoder_hidden_states=encoder_output)
         lm_output = model.lm_head(decoder_outputs.last_hidden_state)
         logits = lm_output[:, -1, :]  # Shape: (beam_size, vocab_size)

         log_probs = torch.log_softmax(logits, dim=-1)  # Apply softmax for probabilities
         top_log_probs, top_ids = torch.topk(log_probs, k=beam_size, dim=-1) # Shape both are (beam_size, beam_size)

         next_beam_scores = (beam_scores.unsqueeze(1) + top_log_probs).reshape(-1)
         beam_scores, indices = torch.topk(next_beam_scores, k=beam_size, dim=-1)

         beam_indices = indices // beam_size
         next_token_ids = top_ids.reshape(-1)[indices]

         next_decoder_input_ids = []
         for idx in range(beam_size):
             next_decoder_input_ids.append(torch.cat((decoder_input_ids[beam_indices[idx]].unsqueeze(0), next_token_ids[idx].unsqueeze(0)), dim=1))
         decoder_input_ids = torch.cat(next_decoder_input_ids, dim=0)

         for beam_idx in range(beam_size):
              all_logits[beam_idx].append(logits[beam_indices[beam_idx]])

         if torch.any(next_token_ids == tokenizer.eos_token_id): # Early stopping if any beam reaches EOS
            break

# Output logits for the first beam
print("Logits for the first beam:", [tensor.tolist() for tensor in all_logits[0]])
print("Best beam sequence:", tokenizer.decode(decoder_input_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True))

```

Here, I've implemented a very basic form of beam search. This code keeps track of the `logits` for each beam at every step by accumulating them into the `all_logits` list, and using the `indices` to keep track of which decoder outputs belong to which beams. This lets you examine the full logit history for all decoding options, which is useful when investigating different choices a model made.

**Example 3: Using a Custom Generation Callback**

Finally, a slightly more complex approach I have used in the past is to leverage a custom generation callback. These can be inserted into the `generate` method, providing hooks into key moments of the decoding process. This approach avoids re-implementing the entire decoding loop:

```python
import torch
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
from transformers.generation.stopping_criteria import StoppingCriteriaList
from typing import List

class LogitsCallback:
    def __init__(self):
        self.all_logits = []

    def __call__(self, input_ids, scores, **kwargs):
        current_logits = kwargs.get("logits", None)
        if current_logits is not None:
           self.all_logits.append(current_logits.cpu().detach().numpy())

        return input_ids, scores


# Initialize tokenizer and model
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")

# Input text
input_text = "summarize: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Then the dog wags its tail."
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

# Setup logit collection
callback = LogitsCallback()


# Perform generation
generated_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_length=30,
    output_scores=True,
    return_dict_in_generate=True,
    callback=callback
)

generated_text = tokenizer.decode(generated_ids.sequences[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print("Generated text:", generated_text)
print("Collected Logits shape:", [logits.shape for logits in callback.all_logits])
```

In this case, I’ve created a simple class to collect the logits. The `__call__` method is automatically invoked at each generation step, if provided via the `callback` parameter. This is the most convenient approach I've used when trying to keep the `generate` function's functionality, while extracting the needed information.

In terms of resources for understanding these topics in more detail, I'd recommend delving into the "Attention is All You Need" paper, which introduced the transformer architecture, and also the more recent publications that delve into the theory behind various decoding algorithms. A good understanding of sequence-to-sequence models as described in *Speech and Language Processing* by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin would also be extremely useful. Finally, I'd recommend exploring the source code of the `transformers` library itself, particularly the code that implements the `generate` method, since that's where the "magic" really happens.

I hope these examples are helpful. They cover a range of complexities and should give you solid starting points for your specific use case. Remember that handling logits effectively allows for a deeper level of analysis and control over the models' behavior.
