Okay, let's tackle this. It's a frustrating situation, a successful three-way handshake only to see the connection vanish. I’ve personally spent countless hours troubleshooting scenarios like this, often under intense pressure to get systems back online. The core of the problem, nine times out of ten, isn't with the handshake itself, but what happens *after*. It's a classic case of a seemingly healthy start ending abruptly due to issues residing deeper within the system or application logic.

To clarify, the three-way handshake – SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK – is fundamentally about establishing a communication channel. It confirms that both the client (in this case, a program on your localhost) and the server (another program also often on your localhost) can indeed send and receive packets. But that’s just the doorway; it doesn't guarantee the house is in order.

The most frequent culprits, based on my experience, tend to revolve around resource constraints, application-level errors, or improper socket handling. Let’s break down the possibilities, focusing on the technical reasons why your localhost connection might fail after the handshake.

Firstly, consider *resource exhaustion*. This is an incredibly common problem. Operating systems have limits on the number of open file descriptors (which sockets are a type of) and available ports. If your server application attempts to open too many connections without properly closing them, you’ll quickly run out of these resources. When you hit these limits, new connections, even if initiated successfully via the handshake, will immediately be closed because the server can't accept further requests due to system constraints. This often manifests as a graceful close, initiated by the server. Look at your ulimit settings (`ulimit -n` on unix-like systems) for file descriptor limits and ensure your application is handling sockets correctly. The problem might not be your application but other processes running on the same machine. This scenario can be particularly tough to detect without detailed monitoring.

Secondly, *application errors*. Once the TCP connection is established, the server application needs to handle the incoming data. If the server encounters an unexpected format, a bug in its data processing logic, or any uncaught exception during the communication phase, it might terminate the connection abruptly. These failures often lead to server-side errors which are only discoverable by server logs. The connection appears to die after the handshake because the server fails almost immediately upon receiving the first application layer data. For instance, I once worked on a system where the server was parsing a request string, and a missing expected field would cause a fatal error, resulting in an instant connection drop after the connection. This is a crucial area to investigate using debugging tools and structured logging.

Finally, let’s discuss *socket handling issues*. A common mistake, particularly for developers new to networking, involves not properly closing sockets or not handling them in a non-blocking manner. If you're using blocking sockets and the data expected isn’t received immediately, it can cause the server process to hang. If this causes a timeout, or if the operating system identifies the connection is not being serviced, the connection may be terminated at OS or application level. Similarly, leaving dangling connections can lead to the resource exhaustion problem mentioned earlier. Failing to correctly shut down sockets using `shutdown()` and `close()` or equivalents in your language's socket API will cause connections to persist, eventually causing problems with new connection attempts.

Let's move on to code examples. These aren’t meant to be production-ready snippets but rather illustrative cases that might lead to the issues we’ve discussed.

**Example 1: Resource Exhaustion (Python)**

```python
import socket
import time

def create_many_sockets():
    sockets = []
    try:
        for i in range(1024 * 5): # Try to create a large number of sockets
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            s.bind(('127.0.0.1', 8080))
            s.listen(1)
            sockets.append(s)
            print(f"Socket {i} created.")
        print("Sockets created. Now waiting...")
        time.sleep(60) # Keep sockets alive for observation
    except OSError as e:
            print(f"Error creating socket: {e}")
    finally:
        for sock in sockets:
            sock.close()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_many_sockets()
```

This script attempts to create a large number of server sockets, exceeding most default limits. Running this script may result in an OSError, indicating that the system is not allowing new sockets. While it doesn't directly demonstrate a three-way handshake followed by a disconnect (as no connection attempts are made), it illustrates the issue of hitting resource limits which could cause subsequent connections to fail. This simulation shows that the socket creation fails; real resource exhaustion scenarios would show successful initial sockets, followed by failed attempts and disconnects when clients attempt to connect after the limit is reached.

**Example 2: Application Error (Python Server)**

```python
import socket

def server():
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.bind(('127.0.0.1', 8081))
    s.listen(1)

    conn, addr = s.accept()
    print('Connection address:', addr)
    try:
      data = conn.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
      # Simulate a server-side error if data is not 'hello'
      if data != 'hello':
          raise ValueError("Invalid input")
      print(f"Received: {data}")
      conn.sendall("world".encode('utf-8'))
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error processing data: {e}")
    finally:
        conn.close()
        s.close()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    server()
```

A client connecting to this server and sending anything other than "hello" will cause a `ValueError` and the connection will be terminated. The handshake will still succeed, but the error in the processing of the data causes the connection to be closed by the server.

**Example 3: Incomplete Socket Closure (Python Client)**

```python
import socket

def client():
  s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
  try:
      s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 8081))
      s.sendall("hello".encode('utf-8'))
      data = s.recv(1024)
      print(f"Received: {data.decode('utf-8')}")
  except ConnectionRefusedError as e:
      print(f"Connection error: {e}")
  finally:
      # Intentionally commented out - demonstrating an incomplete close
      #s.close()
      pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    client()
```

This client connects to the server in the prior example but it does not close the connection, which can also cause lingering problems on a busy server. It's a simplified case, but it illustrates how missing `s.close()` can contribute to problems if not handled properly server side too. In this specific case, since the server closes, it doesn't illustrate a localhost issue. However, server side not closing correctly would cause similar issues.

To diagnose these types of issues effectively, I recommend a deep dive into resources such as "TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols" by W. Richard Stevens, which is the authoritative text on TCP/IP. For practical debugging, books like “Debugging Applications” by Robert J. Robbins are invaluable, and exploring your language-specific socket programming documentation is key. For Linux systems, familiarize yourself with `lsof`, `netstat`, and `tcpdump`.

In summary, a TCP connection terminating immediately after a successful three-way handshake usually isn't a problem with TCP itself, but rather issues arising in the post-handshake phase. Thoroughly examining your resource utilization, server application logic, and socket handling techniques will usually reveal the underlying cause. Be methodical in your approach, and always start with checking server side logs – you may find the solution is right there, waiting to be discovered.
