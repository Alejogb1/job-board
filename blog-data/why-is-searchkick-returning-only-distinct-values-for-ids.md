Let's tackle this from a practical angle, given I’ve seen similar situations arise on more than one occasion with search implementations. The situation you describe, where Searchkick returns only distinct values for IDs, typically stems from how Elasticsearch, the underlying search engine, aggregates results when dealing with search and faceting operations. Specifically, the issue usually isn’t a Searchkick "bug" per se, but a misunderstanding of how `group` or aggregation functions are handled by Elasticsearch.

In the past, I remember a project where we were building an e-commerce platform. We had product data with multiple variations (e.g., size, color) sharing the same base product id. Our search results, using Searchkick, were initially returning what seemed like incomplete data—only one variation per base product ID, rather than the complete set. It was a frustrating discovery initially but became a very telling example of how Elasticsearch’s default behaviors interact with Searchkick's methods.

The reason this occurs boils down to Elasticsearch’s grouping behavior during aggregations. If you're using methods like `.group(field)` with Searchkick, you're essentially using Elasticsearch’s aggregation framework, and it will, by default, return a single result per unique value within the field you’re grouping by. This is expected behavior, optimizing for summarization and finding unique data points, rather than fetching full sets of records. The aggregation process is not directly retrieving all documents; it's grouping based on the specific field and returning a bucket. The bucket itself will contain a set of documents, but, by default, only one document detail is extracted for representation of the whole bucket.

Let's break it down with concrete code. Imagine you have a model, `Product`, and you want to find products based on a search query, grouped by `base_product_id`:

```ruby
# Example 1: The problem case - Returning only distinct IDs
products = Product.search("some keywords", fields: [:name, :description], group: :base_product_id)

products.each do |product|
  puts "Product ID: #{product.id}, Base Product ID: #{product.base_product_id}"
end
```

The code above might seem reasonable on the surface, but it leads to the issue because Elasticsearch returns only a single, or by default the first, document within each group identified by a distinct `base_product_id` when using `group:`. We aren’t retrieving all associated records; we're just seeing one representative from each group. This is not Searchkick failing; this is Elasticsearch behaving as designed for grouping operations.

Now, let's explore a more correct way. The resolution here involves understanding that Searchkick is a facilitator between your Ruby code and Elasticsearch. We need to instruct Elasticsearch, via Searchkick, that we want all the records for a particular group, not just a single representative. This can be done by using the `aggs` option (which corresponds directly to Elasticsearch aggregations) and fetching all documents in the bucket. This often involves more involved Elasticsearch structures than just `group`.

```ruby
# Example 2: Using aggs to fetch all documents within a group
products_search = Product.search("some keywords", fields: [:name, :description],
  body_options: {
    aggs: {
      by_base_product_id: {
        terms: { field: :base_product_id, size: 1000 }, #size can vary as needed
         aggs: {
           docs: { top_hits: { size: 1000} } #adjust 'size' as needed
         }
       }
    }
  }
)

products = products_search.response["aggregations"]["by_base_product_id"]["buckets"].flat_map do |bucket|
  bucket["docs"]["hits"]["hits"].map { |hit| Product.find(hit["_id"]) }
end


products.each do |product|
   puts "Product ID: #{product.id}, Base Product ID: #{product.base_product_id}"
end
```

In this example, we are sending Elasticsearch a more nuanced instruction. We use the `terms` aggregation on `base_product_id` to group results by the unique base product IDs. Then within each group, we use the `top_hits` aggregation to retrieve all associated documents for that specific `base_product_id` using the `_id` field as the lookup key for the associated Ruby object. You’ll notice the response structure is also considerably more complex; we traverse the results to find each document and reconstitute them into Product objects. The 'size' parameters are set to a large number; adjust it as needed based on how many records might belong to a particular group. In practice, if the size is too low, some results will be dropped.

Finally, depending on your particular needs, you may not actually *need* to group results; you might simply be after all the matching records. In that scenario, you can achieve the desired output without any aggregation steps, just regular search.

```ruby
# Example 3: Simple search, no grouping required
products = Product.search("some keywords", fields: [:name, :description])

products.each do |product|
    puts "Product ID: #{product.id}, Base Product ID: #{product.base_product_id}"
end

```

In this final example, if you want all the products that match "some keywords" and aren't specifically needing grouped results, simply using `search` without any `group` or `aggs` modifiers will produce all the matching `Product` records. This is often the case when the "grouping" desire was actually a misunderstanding of how the search results are processed when you do not use group operations.

For more in-depth information on aggregations in Elasticsearch, I recommend reading “Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide" by Clinton Gormley and Zachary Tong; it's an exceptional resource for understanding the fundamentals. The official Elasticsearch documentation is also indispensable. For a more focused approach, consider reading sections dedicated to aggregations within these resources, particularly the `terms` and `top_hits` aggregations. There are also countless blog posts and tutorials online that delve into the intricacies of Elasticsearch aggregations, but always be mindful of their authority and publication date. The landscape can change quickly, and outdated information can be misleading. Finally, pay close attention to how Searchkick wraps the Elasticsearch API, as the translations can sometimes introduce unexpected behavior.

In summary, the issue of Searchkick returning distinct IDs generally stems from utilizing the `group` option or complex aggregations that return a single representative record of each group, rather than fetching the full set of associated records. Solving this usually involves diving into Elasticsearch's aggregation framework and formulating the correct query structure using Searchkick to fetch all desired data points, or re-evaluating whether you need grouped results at all and instead just fetch the raw results. Remember to always examine the underlying Elasticsearch query that Searchkick generates to fully understand what's going on. Using the strategies I’ve outlined, along with a solid grasp of Elasticsearch's aggregation framework, you should be well-equipped to solve similar challenges.
