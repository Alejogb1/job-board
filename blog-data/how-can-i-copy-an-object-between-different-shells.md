Alright, let's tackle this one. Copying objects between different shell environments is a common problem, and it's nuanced enough to warrant a careful explanation. It's not as straightforward as a simple `cp` command, especially when dealing with complex data structures. I’ve run into this issue countless times over the years, particularly when needing to transfer state between different processes running in isolated containers or remote servers. The core challenge stems from the fact that shell variables and objects aren't inherently designed for inter-shell communication; they're usually specific to a given session or process. So, we need to serialize the object to a common format, transfer it, then deserialize it back on the receiving end.

The first fundamental approach, often suitable for simpler objects like strings, numbers, and basic lists or arrays, is using text-based representations. Think of converting the data into a string format that can easily be passed along, often via pipes or temporary files. The simplest of these involves using `echo` and basic variable assignment. For example, imagine I have a variable `my_string` in my current shell, and I want to pass it to a different shell.

```bash
# In Shell A
my_string="hello from shell a"
echo "export MY_STRING='$my_string'" | ssh user@remote_server bash
```

In this scenario, we are exporting a string representation of the variable via `echo` and piping it into an ssh session to a remote server, which is another shell. The remote bash session then executes the string, which includes the export command to create the variable. It's straightforward and effective for simple cases. Note the single quotes within the double quotes - that prevents any special characters within `my_string` from being misinterpreted. However, this approach quickly becomes cumbersome when dealing with more structured data. Think of nested dictionaries, complex objects, or data that can contain special characters. We need a more robust serialization technique.

A better solution for structured data involves using data interchange formats like json. The `jq` command-line json processor is an indispensable tool for this. I’ve often used it when orchestrating data transfer between microservices. Suppose you have a dictionary-like object, a key value store in the current shell:

```bash
# In Shell A
my_object='{"name": "test_object", "value": 123, "data": ["a", "b", "c"]}'
echo "$my_object" | ssh user@remote_server 'jq --raw-input --slurp \'.[0] as $x | export MY_OBJECT="$x"\''
```

Here, we are taking the `my_object` variable, which holds a json string, and piping it to ssh on a remote server. Within the remote server, `jq` processes the json input in raw mode. The output of the `jq` command is piped to the `export` command and placed within an environment variable on the remote machine. This approach is significantly more scalable, as we are transferring a structured representation of the data and leaving the parsing on the remote server for later access within its own shell context. You will find that this method of sending json objects between shells is far superior when moving objects with some complexity.

Now, what if we need to transfer objects created in languages like python? Here, we’ll need an intermediate step, usually using a script that converts our objects to json before passing it to the other shell. I’ll often use python's `json` module for that, and then use techniques described in the previous examples. Assume we have a python object.

```python
# In Shell A running a python script
import json
my_python_object = {"name": "python_object", "nested_data": {"a": 1, "b": 2}, "status": True}
json_string = json.dumps(my_python_object)
print(json_string)
```

This script outputs a JSON string representing the python object. Now we can pipe the output to another shell:

```bash
# In Shell A
python my_script.py | ssh user@remote_server 'jq --raw-input --slurp \'.[0] as $x | export MY_PYTHON_OBJECT="$x"\''
```

Here, the output of the python script, which is a json string, is piped using the technique detailed before. The remote server receives it, parses the string and then exports it to the shell environment, where it can be accessed by other scripts on that server. These methods, while effective, also have a few nuances. The most critical is the careful handling of quotes and special characters when piping or echoing data to avoid unexpected behavior during shell expansion, particularly during ssh sessions. When dealing with potentially complex json content, ensuring proper parsing and escaping within the pipelines are crucial. Also, keep in mind that using environment variables might have limits on size, especially on older systems or when transferring extremely large data blobs; in those cases, using temporary files to transfer data might be preferable.

For a deeper dive, I’d recommend looking into resources on data serialization and data transfer techniques. “Effective Serialization: Theory and Practice” by Robert Hundt provides a solid theoretical foundation, and “Unix Network Programming, Volume 1” by W. Richard Stevens is an excellent resource for understanding inter-process communication, which shares several similarities with this problem. Finally, the documentation for `jq` is invaluable for anyone regularly working with json data from the command line. These resources, together with practice, will make these techniques a part of your regular toolkit. My experience has shown that having several approaches to tackling this issue helps you navigate a wide variety of situations. It allows you to choose the method that best suits the complexity of your data and the specific limitations of the systems you're working with.
