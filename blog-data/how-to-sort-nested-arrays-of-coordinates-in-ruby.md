Alright, let’s tackle this. I remember facing a similar challenge back in the days when I was building a geospatial mapping tool. We had a ton of data coming in from different sources, and it was crucial to have those coordinate sets organized predictably. The issue wasn’t just about sorting by a single axis, but often by a combination of lat/long, or perhaps even by some custom defined metric based on their relative positions. So, how to effectively sort nested arrays of coordinates in ruby? Let’s delve into it.

The core problem is that you're not dealing with a simple list of numbers, but an array of arrays, where each inner array represents a coordinate (typically [latitude, longitude] or [x, y, z]). Standard ruby array sorting methods will not work out-of-the-box. You need a way to specify how to compare these inner arrays. Essentially, you need a comparison logic that goes beyond simple numerical comparison.

First, we need to understand that ruby’s `sort` method accepts a block that defines comparison logic. This block receives two elements from the array being sorted (in our case, two coordinate arrays) and should return a negative number if the first element is considered ‘less than’ the second, a positive number if the first element is 'greater than', and zero if they are equal.

Let’s look at an example of sorting by latitude (the first element of our coordinate):

```ruby
coordinates = [[34.0522, -118.2437], [40.7128, -74.0060], [25.7617, -80.1918]]

sorted_coordinates = coordinates.sort do |coord1, coord2|
  coord1[0] <=> coord2[0]
end

puts "Sorted by latitude: #{sorted_coordinates}"
# Expected output: Sorted by latitude: [[25.7617, -80.1918], [34.0522, -118.2437], [40.7128, -74.0060]]
```

In this snippet, `coord1[0]` accesses the latitude of the first coordinate, and `coord2[0]` accesses the latitude of the second. The spaceship operator `<=>` provides the comparison we need. This will sort in ascending order by latitude.

Now, let’s explore something a bit more complex: sorting first by latitude and, if the latitudes are equal, then by longitude. This is often needed when dealing with maps to order locations within a specific parallel of latitude:

```ruby
coordinates = [[34.0522, -118.2437], [40.7128, -74.0060], [34.0522, -117.1437]]

sorted_coordinates = coordinates.sort do |coord1, coord2|
  latitude_comparison = coord1[0] <=> coord2[0]
  if latitude_comparison == 0
     coord1[1] <=> coord2[1] #sort by longitude if latitudes are the same
  else
     latitude_comparison
  end
end

puts "Sorted by latitude, then longitude: #{sorted_coordinates}"
# Expected Output: Sorted by latitude, then longitude: [[34.0522, -118.2437], [34.0522, -117.1437], [40.7128, -74.0060]]
```

Here, we first compare the latitudes. If they are equal (the `latitude_comparison` result is 0), we then proceed to compare the longitudes. Otherwise, we directly use the latitude comparison result to determine the order.

Finally, let’s assume you need to sort based on a distance from a fixed point – let’s call it a “reference” point. This could be useful if you are rendering markers in the order of their proximity to the user. For this, we would need a distance function. I’ve seen variations of haversine formula, euclidean distance, etc.. In our case, let’s use a basic euclidean approach. Assume our coordinates represent x and y coordinates for simplicity:

```ruby
def calculate_distance(coord1, coord2)
  x1, y1 = coord1
  x2, y2 = coord2
  Math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
end

reference_point = [0, 0]

coordinates = [[1, 1], [2, 2], [1, 3], [4, 1]]

sorted_coordinates = coordinates.sort_by { |coord| calculate_distance(reference_point, coord) }


puts "Sorted by distance from origin: #{sorted_coordinates}"
# Expected Output: Sorted by distance from origin: [[1, 1], [1, 3], [2, 2], [4, 1]]
```

In this case, I employed `sort_by`, which takes a block and uses the block’s return value for sorting. It provides a simpler way to achieve sorting based on the result of a computation. We compute the euclidean distance for each coordinate from the `reference_point` and the coordinates are then sorted by this distance.

These examples illustrate fundamental approaches to sorting nested coordinate arrays. However, for complex geographical calculations or more advanced sorting requirements, you’ll find it very beneficial to explore resources focused on spatial algorithms and geocomputation. Specifically, I would strongly recommend looking at the book “Geographic Information Analysis” by David O’Sullivan and David Unwin. This text is an excellent resource for the theory behind working with spatial data. Another invaluable resource is the “Algorithms for Spatial Data” paper collection, which details efficient algorithms for various geospatial operations. Furthermore, "Programming the Geographic Web" by P. Leahy and R. Murdock offers a pragmatic perspective on working with geo-spatial data in software. These are good starting points to build further understanding in this area.

The takeaway here is not just about getting the code working; it’s about understanding the nuances of your data and crafting comparison logic that accurately reflects the order you need. It's been my experience that the most effective approaches arise from thoughtful data exploration and a deep understanding of your specific application context. The examples we've looked at are basic; the possibilities, as you might have gathered, are quite broad depending on your application needs.
