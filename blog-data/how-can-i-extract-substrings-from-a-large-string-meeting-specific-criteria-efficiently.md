Let's dive into this. I remember facing a similar challenge back in my days working on a high-volume log processing system. We had gigabytes of raw text arriving every few minutes, and the task was to efficiently extract specific data points, which were effectively substrings, that matched several rather intricate criteria. The naive approaches, as you might expect, quickly turned into performance bottlenecks. So, I've got a few techniques I’ve found invaluable, with some code snippets to illustrate the implementations.

The core challenge you're facing revolves around optimizing for two main factors: computational cost and memory usage, especially when dealing with “large strings.” The definition of “large” is relative, but when you start pushing into several megabytes and beyond, iterative string processing can become prohibitively slow.

First off, regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they can be surprisingly resource-intensive if you’re not careful. Instead of simply using `string.match()` in a loop, it's crucial to precompile the regex patterns when you're using them repeatedly. Let’s look at how this might play out in practice.

```python
import re

def extract_substrings_regex(text, pattern_strings):
    # Precompile regex patterns for better performance
    patterns = [re.compile(p) for p in pattern_strings]
    extracted_data = []
    for pattern in patterns:
      matches = pattern.finditer(text)
      for match in matches:
          extracted_data.append(match.group(0)) # Or a specific group using match.group(n)
    return extracted_data

# Example usage:
large_string = "user_id:12345|event_type:login|timestamp:2024-01-26T10:00:00Z; user_id:67890|event_type:logout|timestamp:2024-01-26T12:00:00Z; ..."
patterns_to_extract = [r'user_id:\d+', r'event_type:\w+']
extracted = extract_substrings_regex(large_string, patterns_to_extract)
print(extracted)
```
In this python snippet, I’m showcasing how precompiling the regular expressions, which I do using `re.compile`, can improve the efficiency of your solution as this operation isn't carried out every single time during the loop. This approach becomes particularly valuable when you are iterating over large datasets and applying similar regular expressions repeatedly. The function `finditer()` returns an iterator, which is more memory-efficient as it only loads matches as they are needed, rather than all of them at once, thus avoiding unnecessary memory overhead.

However, regular expressions aren’t always the optimal tool. If your extraction criteria are straightforward, relying solely on indexing and slicing can be faster than regex, especially when combined with generators for memory optimization. The key is to leverage `find()` or `index()` methods to locate known delimiters and then slice accordingly.

```python
def extract_substrings_indexing(text, start_markers, end_markers):
    extracted_data = []
    start_positions = [text.find(marker) for marker in start_markers]
    end_positions = [text.find(marker) for marker in end_markers]

    # Error handling
    if any(pos == -1 for pos in start_positions) or any(pos == -1 for pos in end_positions):
       return "Error: Start or End marker not found in the string"

    # Ensure lengths match
    if len(start_positions) != len(end_positions):
        return "Error: Start and end marker lists have different lengths"

    for i in range(len(start_positions)):
      start_pos = start_positions[i] + len(start_markers[i])
      end_pos = end_positions[i]
      if start_pos < end_pos:
        extracted_data.append(text[start_pos:end_pos])
    return extracted_data


# Example usage
large_string = "prefix_start_data1_end_suffix;prefix_start_data2_end_suffix;prefix_start_data3_end_suffix;"
start_markers_for_extraction = ['prefix_start_']
end_markers_for_extraction = ['_end']

extracted = extract_substrings_indexing(large_string, start_markers_for_extraction, end_markers_for_extraction)
print(extracted)

```

This code snippet demonstrates extraction based on delimiters. This approach is highly efficient if you’re looking to grab data between known markers in a specific order, as demonstrated here by using `find()` method to locate them. We iterate over the length of the start markers which must match the end markers for correct functionality. This avoids needing to analyze the whole string with each match, providing speed benefits. If the markers aren't available in a 1:1 relationship, the code will return an error message rather than break.

In my experience, a common situation that can hamper efficiency involves the sheer volume of data being processed. When the text string itself is truly massive, holding all of it in memory can be a limiting factor. This is where processing in chunks comes into play. Instead of loading the entire string at once, consider processing the data line-by-line or in larger chunks depending on your data structures.

```python
def extract_substrings_chunked(file_path, pattern_strings, chunk_size=1024):
    patterns = [re.compile(p) for p in pattern_strings]
    extracted_data = []

    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        while True:
            chunk = file.read(chunk_size)
            if not chunk:
                break # End of file
            for pattern in patterns:
                matches = pattern.finditer(chunk)
                for match in matches:
                   extracted_data.append(match.group(0))
    return extracted_data

#Example Usage
#Assuming there exists a file called 'large_data.txt'
file_name = 'large_data.txt'
#Create a sample text file for testing:
with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
  for i in range (0,100000):
      file.write(f'log_level:INFO|event_id:{i}|message:some data here; \n')

patterns_to_extract = [r'log_level:\w+', r'event_id:\d+']
extracted = extract_substrings_chunked(file_name, patterns_to_extract)
print(extracted)
```

Here, I demonstrate how to process a large file in manageable chunks, using the `file.read()` method. We read the file in a chunked manner and then proceed with regex pattern matching against the available data chunk, then move on to the next chunk till the entire file is parsed. This avoids loading the entire file into memory, thus enabling you to extract data from large files, efficiently. This approach was extremely effective for us when handling very large log files.

For further study, I highly recommend reviewing “Mastering Regular Expressions” by Jeffrey Friedl – a true bible for anything related to regex optimization. For a deeper dive into string processing algorithms, “Algorithms” by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne is an excellent resource. In addition, investigating literature focusing on algorithmic complexity, and in particular, string algorithms will assist you in building efficient solutions for all text processing endeavors. There are also several research papers covering streaming string algorithms, especially when the volume of data is immense, and needs real-time or near-real-time processing which would be worth investigating.

In conclusion, efficiently extracting substrings from large text bodies requires careful consideration of your data, your criteria for extraction, and the available tools. Regex is powerful but not always the fastest path. Consider leveraging indexing and slicing where applicable and always keep memory constraints in mind. Using techniques such as precompilation, generators and processing data in chunks can offer you significant performance benefits for your data processing. It's about picking the tool that best matches the task at hand – a principle I've found to be consistently rewarding in my own practice.
