hey there,

so, you're tackling spoken language detection, that's pretty cool. i've been down that road a few times, and it can get hairy. i remember back when i was working on a similar project, around 2015, we were trying to build a system for a call center to route calls correctly. it was a mess initially, lots of false positives and misclassifications. we thought, "hey, let's just throw a ton of data at it," and it ended up being a lot less straightforward than that. trust me, been there.

first off, you're going to have to deal with data. data is king, especially with language models. for a three-way classification (hindi, english, and 'other'), your dataset needs to be well balanced. this means roughly equal amounts of data for each class. also, 'other' is a real pain, since that can mean anything. so, decide what ‘other’ actually covers and, very important, try to make it the most diverse class. this will prevent the model from simply learning the characteristics of a few 'other' languages rather than general language features outside of hindi and english. consider adding languages that are phonetically distinct from english and hindi to this class like mandarin, swedish or arabic.

i'd suggest using recordings that are as "clean" as possible, meaning less background noise. audio quality is super important here. if you get recordings from real world applications, prepare to spend some considerable time cleaning and processing the audio. we learned this the hard way; our first model was performing very bad until we realized that most of our data had significant amounts of background conversation noise, traffic noise and sometimes it even had music playing. so keep that in mind. if your data source is videos, and you have extracted the audio from them, check if the source was a live recording, because they tend to have bad quality.

for feature extraction, mfccs (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) are usually a good starting point. they are basically a way to convert audio signals into a representation that is more suitable for machine learning models. we had great results with it in the past. i'm sure you're familiar with them, but in case you're not, they are basically trying to mimic human auditory system so the representation that is extracted from them is more closely related to what humans actually “hear”. there's a lot of theory behind it, and i recommend reading "speech and language processing" by daniel jurafsky and james h. martin; the chapter on acoustic phonetics should give you a good overview.

here is a simple example of how to do mfcc extraction using python and librosa:

```python
import librosa
import librosa.display
import numpy as np

def extract_mfcc(audio_file, n_mfcc=20):
    try:
        y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file)
        mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=n_mfcc)
        return mfccs
    except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error processing {audio_file}: {e}")
       return None


#example use:
file_path="test_audio.wav" #replace with your own audio file path
mfcc_data = extract_mfcc(file_path)

if mfcc_data is not None:
    print(f"shape of the mfcc data: {mfcc_data.shape}") # should be something like (20, time)
```

after you have your features you'll want to do some normalization. we found that this helps a lot with model performance. it can be simple feature scaling or more complex normalization approaches. this will prevent the model from being influenced by the range of values of some features. you might want to explore different normalization techniques such as z-score or min-max scaling. try both of them and see which one performs better for your data and model.

now, regarding the model itself, a simple model such as a multilayer perceptron (mlp) could be a good place to start for a baseline and it is actually useful to use because it helps to test that your pipeline is working ok. but, for better performance, you'll probably want to explore recurrent neural networks (rnns) like lstms or grus. these are good because they can capture the temporal nature of speech better than mlps, as speech is inherently a time-series data.

we went through a few models before finding one that worked reliably. it took a lot of hyperparameter tuning and experimentation. this process can become a pain, so it's good to automate it as much as possible. for rnns you'll need to define the number of layers, the size of hidden states, batch size, learning rate etc. and many of those parameters are dependant on the data you're using. there are many techniques like random search, grid search or bayesian optimization that can make this process easier for you.

here is how you could define an lstm using pytorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class lstmclassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_classes):
        super(lstmclassifier, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        self.lstm = nn.lstm(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=true)
        self.fc = nn.linear(hidden_size, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        h0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        c0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        out, _ = self.lstm(x, (h0, c0))
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out

#example use:
input_size = 20 # Number of mfccs
hidden_size = 128
num_layers = 2
num_classes = 3  # Hindi, English, Other
model = lstmclassifier(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_classes)

```
training can be time consuming and computationally expensive. if possible, try to use gpus, it will make your life much easier, since training with cpus might take weeks if you have a big dataset. also, remember to do proper validation, and testing of your models. you might want to split your data into train, validation and testing sets, this is standard practice. the validation set can be used to tune your model hyperparameters and the test set should be used to report the final accuracy and performance of your final trained model.

also, another thing that i recommend is to augment your data. this means applying transformations to your existing data to create more examples. for audio data, you could add gaussian noise, apply pitch shifting, or time stretching. this has helped us a lot in the past to create robust models. there is a good chapter on “data augmentation” in the book "deep learning with python" by francois chollet, you could take a look at it, it might be useful.

we also tried to incorporate pretrained models to see if that could help us speed up the training or increase the performance. these are models that are trained on very large amounts of data for similar tasks that, if used as a starting point, could reduce the amount of data and time needed to train a new model for your specific task. we had some luck with using wav2vec 2.0 models. they usually perform really well when fine-tuned for new tasks.

 here is how to load a pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model in python:

```python
from transformers import wav2vec2processor, wav2vec2forclassification
import torch

processor = wav2vec2processor.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h")
model = wav2vec2forclassification.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h",num_labels=3)


#example use:

# audio is a numpy array with the audio data
inputs = processor(audio, sampling_rate=16000, return_tensors="pt", padding=true)
with torch.no_grad():
  logits = model(**inputs).logits

#perform your prediction based on the logits
# and convert to the corresponding labels
```

finally, a tip that has always helped me is to start with a very simple model first and then increase the complexity of your model and the complexity of the pipeline as you go. it is much easier to debug a simple model and understand the behavior of your data, than trying to troubleshoot a very complex one without having a good understanding of the data or pipeline you are using. i also usually print the shapes of tensors as i process the data, just in case i'm doing something wrong along the pipeline. many times this can save you hours of work. and don't be afraid to experiment. try new techniques, change hyperparameters, check different architectures... the key is persistence and careful experimentation.

and, if you find your model is only recognizing two languages consistently and misclassifying the third as a mix of the others, it's not that your model is bad. maybe it is just confused. maybe it needs therapy. i mean, you should try debugging it a little bit more, but who knows, maybe it just needs a good break. lol

it’s a pretty iterative process, and there is no "one-size-fits-all" approach. good luck, and feel free to ask if something is not clear or you need more details.
