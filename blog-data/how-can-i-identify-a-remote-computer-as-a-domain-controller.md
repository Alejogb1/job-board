Alright, let's tackle this one. Identifying a remote computer acting as a domain controller isn't always straightforward, especially when direct access isn't an option. Over the years, I've encountered this specific challenge numerous times, ranging from initial network assessments to troubleshooting complex domain-related issues. It's a task that often requires a blend of network discovery techniques and active directory querying, avoiding actions that can trigger alerts, of course. Let's delve into some dependable methods and their implementations.

The core principle here revolves around two fundamental concepts: identifying services unique to domain controllers and querying Active Directory directly using remote tools. Simply relying on a machine's name isn't enough; a server can be named "DC01" and not actually be a domain controller. We need concrete evidence.

First, let's look at the services. Domain controllers primarily host several critical services: the domain name system (dns) server, the kerberos key distribution center (kdc), and active directory's ntds service. While others exist, these are the primary identifiers. Therefore, a rudimentary check involves scanning for open ports associated with these services. For example, dns typically uses port 53 (udp and tcp), kerberos port 88 (udp and tcp), and the active directory service typically uses the global catalog port 3268 (tcp) and ldap ports 389 (tcp) and 636 (ssl). Note the distinction between standard ldap and ldaps (ldap over ssl); both are indicators, and their use varies between environments. This initial scan is important. It's non-intrusive and provides a first indication. However, open ports are not irrefutable proof, as these services could be installed on non-domain controllers. So we need to investigate further.

Here's a python example using `socket` to check these ports. It's basic but useful for demonstrating the port scanning aspect:

```python
import socket

def check_ports(host, ports):
    open_ports = []
    for port in ports:
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.settimeout(1)
        result = sock.connect_ex((host, port))
        if result == 0:
            open_ports.append(port)
        sock.close()
    return open_ports

if __name__ == '__main__':
    target_host = "target.ip.address"  # Replace with the target's ip
    dc_ports = [53, 88, 389, 636, 3268] # DNS, Kerberos, LDAP, LDAPS, Global Catalog

    open_ports = check_ports(target_host, dc_ports)
    if open_ports:
        print(f"Open ports found on {target_host}: {open_ports}")
        print("These ports are indicative of a domain controller but not conclusive.")

    else:
        print(f"No indicative ports found open on {target_host}.")
```

This script attempts to connect to the defined ports on the target host. If the connection succeeds, it logs the open port. The presence of multiple ports here strongly suggests a domain controller. This isn't foolproof, but it's a good first step.

The second technique involves querying active directory. This requires valid domain credentials. One effective approach, if you have appropriate permissions, is to use powershell's `get-addomaincontroller` cmdlet. It provides a direct and reliable way to list domain controllers in the environment. Even when used remotely, it directly interacts with the active directory service and provides definitive results. It's a standard, reliable method. A simpler, but equally valid, method within powershell is using the following command, which is what I prefer for speed:

```powershell
Get-ADDomainController -Discover | Select-Object HostName, Domain, IsGlobalCatalog, Site
```

This retrieves essential information like hostname, domain, whether itâ€™s a global catalog, and the site of all identified domain controllers. For a target host, you can refine your query. Suppose you are not querying for domain controllers and are using a system's IP address instead; then the script below attempts to locate a host within the domain and retrieve its domain controller using ldap.

```powershell
$TargetIP = 'target.ip.address' # Replace with the target ip

try {
    $dnsRecord = [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostEntry($TargetIP)
    if ($dnsRecord -and $dnsRecord.HostName){
        $targetHostname = $dnsRecord.HostName
    } else {
        Write-Host "DNS Resolution Failed for $($TargetIP)"
        return
    }
}
catch {
    Write-Host "Error resolving DNS: $_"
    return
}

try{
    $searcher = New-Object DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher
    $searcher.Filter = "(&(objectClass=computer)(name=$targetHostname))"
    $searcher.PropertiesToLoad.Add("distinguishedName")
    $result = $searcher.FindOne()
    if($result){
        $computerDN = $result.Properties.distinguishedName
        $domController = Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter "(&(objectClass=domain)(dc=$($computerDN.Split(',')[1].Substring(3))))"
            if($domController){
                 Write-Host "Domain Controller: $($domController.Name)"
                 }else{Write-Host "No Domain Controller Found for this target"}
    } else {
        Write-Host "No object found in AD for this IP or HostName"
    }
} catch{
  Write-Host "Error connecting to AD: $_"
}
```
This script uses a reverse dns lookup to convert a given ip address into a hostname and then searches active directory for a matching computer object. After locating the computer object it obtains the domain using the distinguished name and then locates the active domain controller using the dc attribute of the domain object. The script ensures all steps are successful using try catch statements which provide robustness and helpful diagnostic information in the event of a failure.

For those interested in delving deeper into active directory internals, i highly recommend reading "active directory" by bill english. It offers invaluable insights into the structure and functionalities of AD, which is useful for more advanced discovery methods. Another worthwhile read is "mastering active directory" by brian desmet. It covers advanced topics and operational considerations, specifically valuable for diagnosing domain controller roles and configurations. Lastly, understanding network protocols is fundamental, and "tcp/ip illustrated" by w. richard stevens is a classic in the field that greatly expands one's understanding.

My personal preference, after years of use, leans heavily towards `get-addomaincontroller`. It's efficient, dependable, and requires the least amount of manual legwork. While port scanning gives an initial idea, it's crucial to confirm by directly querying active directory. This combination ensures that you accurately identify a remote machine's domain controller status with a higher degree of confidence. Remember that the reliability of the `get-addomaincontroller` approach depends on the privileges the account used to execute it possesses, so it is good practice to run such commands in privileged shells. These are all tried and true methods i've used repeatedly in different complex environments and with these techniques, you should be able to confidently identify a domain controller remotely.
