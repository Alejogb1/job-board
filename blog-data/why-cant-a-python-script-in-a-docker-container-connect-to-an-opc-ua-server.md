,  Been there, done that, quite a few times actually. The frustration of a seemingly straightforward python script failing to connect to an OPC UA server from inside a docker container is a fairly common hiccup, and usually not indicative of any deep-seated flaw in your code. It's almost always an environment configuration issue, and most often revolves around networking. I’ve debugged these scenarios in various industrial settings, from process automation in manufacturing to energy grid monitoring, so I’ve seen the patterns repeat themselves.

The root cause typically boils down to several intertwined factors, primarily network isolation, port mapping, and name resolution within the containerized environment. Let's unpack these.

First, remember that docker containers, by default, exist in their own isolated network namespace. They’re not directly attached to the host machine’s network interface. So even if the OPC UA server is accessible from the host machine where you're running docker, the container's network environment might not allow it to "see" that server directly. This is a cornerstone of Docker’s isolation model, which, while beneficial for security and reproducibility, can create hurdles for communication if not explicitly configured.

The second significant point is port mapping. Even if the container can "see" the host, it needs a mapped port to actually communicate with an external service such as an OPC UA server. These servers usually operate on a defined port, most commonly 4840. By default, Docker doesn't expose any container ports to the host or other external entities. Hence, you need to expose the port from the container and potentially also map it to a port on your host. A lack of this mapping means that any traffic destined for the port your server is listening to is essentially dropped by Docker’s network stack.

Third, and quite often overlooked, is name resolution. If your python script uses a hostname to address the OPC UA server (e.g., `opc.mycompany.com`), the container must be able to resolve that hostname to an IP address. Docker uses its own internal DNS server, which may not be configured to resolve your corporate DNS entries. This can lead to resolution failure and, obviously, a failed connection attempt.

Finally, and less commonly, firewall configurations both on the host and within the container can play a role in blocking connections, although this is often the first thing people consider, when in fact, networking issues within docker are far more often the cause.

Let's get into some specific examples. Here's a typical case where you might encounter this problem:

```python
# Example 1: Basic OPC UA connection attempt that will likely fail in a container
from opcua import Client

def connect_to_opcua_server(server_url):
    try:
        client = Client(server_url)
        client.connect()
        print("Connected to OPC UA server!")
        client.disconnect()
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    opcua_url = "opc.tcp://192.168.1.100:4840" # Assumed OPC UA server
    connect_to_opcua_server(opcua_url)
```
This very straightforward code will likely fail when run inside a container if the host IP is being used. Now, to address this, you need to consider your docker configuration. Here's the corresponding `docker run` command, showing some common issues:

```bash
# Example Docker command 1 - likely to fail without correct network setup
docker run -it --rm my-python-image python my_script.py
```
This command will likely result in failure because the container will use its own network and will not see 192.168.1.100.

To resolve the previous case, you'd usually want to expose and map the port in the docker run command, or use network host mode in some situations, and verify hostname resolution. Here's an updated example that works in many typical situations:

```bash
# Example Docker command 2 - with port mapping and assuming host network connectivity is sufficient
docker run -it --rm -p 4840:4840  --network host my-python-image python my_script.py
```

In this scenario, using `--network host` tells Docker to use the host's network stack directly, which can work if you trust the applications running in the container with access to the host’s network stack, and the OPC UA server is on the same network. However, while convenient, host networking can reduce the isolation capabilities of containers, so it should only be used if it matches your architecture and security needs.

Another example might be that your OPC UA server is not directly accessible on the same network as your host, but instead, is exposed through a different gateway or network. Then, you might have to create a new network bridge, and link the container to it.

```bash
# Example Docker command 3 -  using a dedicated network bridge
docker network create my-custom-net

docker run -it --rm --net my-custom-net --ip 172.18.0.2 --add-host opcua_server:192.168.2.100 my-python-image python my_script.py

```

In this example, we are creating a network bridge called `my-custom-net`. We then attach the container to this new network bridge, assigning it a static IP address. The `--add-host` entry allows us to resolve `opcua_server` to `192.168.2.100`. Your python script now needs to target the `opcua_server` url to connect to the server on this network. Note that in this example, we would need the network configuration in the container to be able to reach the 192.168.2.0/24 network. This would not work with the `--network host` mode. These are just some of the networking scenarios one might have to deal with when using containers with external servers.

To further your understanding, I recommend delving into resources such as "Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton for detailed coverage of docker networking. For OPC UA specifics, the official OPC Foundation documentation is crucial, along with "Practical OPC UA" by John Rinaldi, offering a more hands-on approach to implementing OPC UA. Also, familiarize yourself with basic networking concepts using classic textbooks like "Computer Networks" by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to fully grasp the principles at play. The key is to always be mindful of the layers of abstraction that Docker introduces, and how that impacts your network topology.

In short, when your Python script in a container can't connect to your OPC UA server, it's very rarely a problem with the script itself. It’s usually an intricate combination of network isolation, port exposure, and name resolution within the dockerized environment, alongside potential routing and firewall issues. Thoroughly checking each of these potential culprits systematically should almost always lead you to a resolution. I hope this is helpful, I've certainly spent my fair share of late nights wrestling with very similar problems, and I know how frustrating it can be. Keep experimenting, and you’ll soon get the hang of it.
