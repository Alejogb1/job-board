Alright, let’s unpack this particular interaction between Rails, Devise, and form submissions. It’s a nuanced area, and I've seen this trip up even seasoned developers. The core of the issue lies in how Rails processes form data and how Devise handles authentication and validation, specifically their interaction with model updates within the controller.

The scenario, as I understand it, involves a form designed to update user information, likely involving Devise’s authentication framework. Now, you'd expect, and logically so, that if Devise throws an error – let's say the user provides an incorrect password when changing their email – the controller's update action *shouldn’t* execute fully. However, in many cases, it appears to proceed, which can be misleading, particularly if you are tracking data changes or employing callbacks.

The crux of this behavior lies in how the standard Rails controller update action functions when confronted with validation failures. The update action, typically, *does* attempt to load and update the model, even if those updates are ultimately deemed invalid. Devise, being a gem layered on top of Rails, doesn't fundamentally alter this process. Instead, Devise validation errors are returned as part of the standard Rails model validation feedback mechanism.

What actually happens is that the update action receives the submitted form data. Then, before applying this data to the database, Rails instantiates the relevant model using parameters provided from the form. At this point, Devise steps in (if you’re dealing with password changes or other fields Devise handles), and applies its own validation logic alongside model-level validations.

If there's an issue, for example, the user provides an invalid current password for a change, Devise will set error messages on the model. However, even at this point, the update *method* still executes. The model object itself *is* updated with submitted params and, importantly, validation errors are stored *on that same instance*. This allows the action to return to the view and render error messages with the form.

The key here is that the `update` call on your model happens regardless, but if validations fail, *the model changes are not persisted to the database*. This is a subtle but vital distinction. The changes sit with the model object *in memory*. The controller, unaware of the impending database rollback due to validation errors, continues with the update action logic, often including any additional code within the update function after the model’s attempt to update itself and save. If you’re writing audit trails or triggering events based on the success of the model update, this could be problematic.

This behaviour isn’t a bug, but rather how Rails provides a consistent workflow for form updates and error reporting. We often use the `save` method on the model. If the save fails due to the validations, it returns `false`, but the attempt to save still occurs and errors are appended to the model. The validation process is simply a check and a failure of this check is not an exception.

To demonstrate, let's consider a user model with a `name` and `email` field, and a Devise-managed password change.

**Example 1: Basic Update Attempt**

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb

class UsersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def update
    @user = current_user
    if @user.update(user_params)
      flash[:notice] = "Profile updated successfully!"
      redirect_to profile_path
    else
      render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :current_password, :password, :password_confirmation)
  end
end

```

In this example, the `update` method attempts to update the user’s record with the provided `user_params`. Even if the user provides an invalid current password, leading to a Devise error, `@user.update(user_params)` will still execute. If it returns false due to validation errors, we re-render the edit form, which is how we get the chance to display the errors to the user.

**Example 2: Logging Attempts (illustrating the 'false' return)**

Now, let's modify that to show how, even when it 'fails,' the update still 'runs':

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def update
    @user = current_user
    updated = @user.update(user_params)
    Rails.logger.info "Update called! Result: #{updated.inspect}"
    if updated
      flash[:notice] = "Profile updated successfully!"
      redirect_to profile_path
    else
      render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def user_params
     params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :current_password, :password, :password_confirmation)
  end
end
```

Here, I’ve added a logging statement to show that regardless of whether the save succeeds or not, we enter the `update` method and execute that line, showing that the method *did* run. Even if Devise throws an invalid password error, the log will still output, showing the `update` return value of false. The important takeaway is: The code inside the `update` method gets executed, regardless of validation success or failure.

**Example 3: Ensuring Correct Error Handling**

To guard against executing certain parts of the `update` method when there’s a validation failure, you should use conditional logic based on the success of the update.

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  def update
    @user = current_user
    if @user.update(user_params)
      # Code that *only* executes after a successful save
      Rails.logger.info "User profile updated successfully."
      flash[:notice] = "Profile updated successfully!"
      redirect_to profile_path
    else
      Rails.logger.warn "User profile update failed: #{@user.errors.full_messages}"
      render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :current_password, :password, :password_confirmation)
  end
end

```

In this version, we log specifically the error that caused the failure and ensure that we only run the 'success' log after a valid save. This pattern is how you can manage additional logic after an update method, and it prevents unintended execution of code when the update was not successful.

For further understanding, I'd recommend looking into the internals of Rails’ Active Record, specifically the `ActiveRecord::Base#update` and `ActiveModel::Validations` documentation. For more comprehensive validation handling, the book *Crafting Rails Applications* by José Valim is very insightful, focusing on best practices in managing model logic. Also, the official Rails documentation on Active Record validations is an absolute must-read. For Devise-specific aspects, check out the Devise wiki and source code directly, which reveals the validation mechanics at play. Understanding how these components fit together will significantly improve your ability to debug and build robust Rails applications.
