, let’s tackle this. It's a frustrating situation, I know, especially when you're trying to integrate a dApp seamlessly with MetaMask mobile. I’ve personally debugged countless similar scenarios over the years, and the issue rarely boils down to one simple thing. Usually, it's a combination of factors conspiring against you. Let's break down the typical culprits and, crucially, how to address them.

First off, let's be clear: the wallet connect pop-up relies on a carefully orchestrated dance between your dApp and MetaMask’s mobile app. If any step falters, the pop-up won't appear. The most common reasons I’ve encountered fall into several categories: incorrect initialization of the wallet connect library, issues with the dApp’s connection handling logic, problems with the MetaMask mobile app itself (though rarer), or even something as subtle as incorrect network configuration. I'll walk you through the troubleshooting process as I have experienced it.

The initial setup, and frankly the place I've seen the most issues crop up, often revolves around the implementation of the wallet connect library. If the library isn’t initialized correctly, the mobile wallet won't get the necessary signal to trigger the pop-up. Typically, this is what I see when I’ve been troubleshooting: I’ll find code that doesn’t properly handle the various asynchronous operations involved in connecting to a wallet. The process is not always instantaneous, it requires proper error handling and a consistent way to manage state, and I've witnessed numerous times developers just not quite manage to fully nail it.

Here's an example, using a simplified version of a javascript implementation, to illustrate the pitfall I described:

```javascript
// example 1: improper promise handling

async function connectWallet() {
  const provider = await walletConnect.enable();  // might reject
  console.log("Connected!", provider); // might never get here if enable fails
}

connectWallet();
```

This code snippet looks superficially correct, but it's missing error handling around the `walletConnect.enable()` call. If this promise rejects, which can happen for a variety of reasons—like the user denying the connection or the mobile app not responding properly— the code just stops and doesn't provide user feedback.

A better approach is to incorporate a try/catch block, or use the `.then()` and `.catch()` chains, like this:

```javascript
// example 2: improved error handling

async function connectWallet() {
    try {
        const provider = await walletConnect.enable();
        console.log("Connected!", provider);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to connect:", error);
        // handle the error gracefully, maybe display to user
    }
}

connectWallet();
```

This updated version introduces error handling, ensuring that if `walletConnect.enable()` fails, the application doesn’t just freeze and logs the error, making it easier to diagnose and respond to.

Now, the next area I commonly see problems in is how the dApp handles the connection once established. It's not enough to just make the connection happen; you need to continuously monitor its status, handle connection loss, and properly handle disconnects. If your application loses connection in an unexpected way, MetaMask might not show the pop-up next time you try to initiate a connection. I’ve found that a common oversight is not listening for chain ID changes and using the correct chain ID at all times. Here is an example of listening for provider changes:

```javascript
// example 3: handling connection changes

async function initializeWallet() {
    const provider = await walletConnect.enable();
    console.log("Initial connection success: ", provider);

    provider.on("accountsChanged", (accounts) => {
        console.log("Accounts changed:", accounts);
        // update your app state
    });

    provider.on("chainChanged", (chainId) => {
        console.log("Chain changed:", chainId);
        // update your app state, possibly reconnect if not using an approved network
    });

    provider.on('disconnect', (code, reason) => {
        console.log("Disconnect:", code, reason);
        // handle wallet disconnect
    });
}

initializeWallet();
```

In the snippet above, we've added event listeners for `accountsChanged`, `chainChanged` and `disconnect`. This allows the application to be reactive to these changes. It is important to handle these events appropriately. If a user switches accounts or changes networks, you need to adjust the application logic accordingly.

Beyond code, sometimes the issue isn't within your application, but rather with the MetaMask mobile app itself. Although, in my experience this is less likely, it is still worth mentioning. Sometimes the app needs a refresh, or a simple re-installation can address internal state issues. Ensure your users are running the latest version of the MetaMask app. Very infrequently, there can be intermittent issues on the MetaMask side, which are typically resolved in subsequent updates.

Network configuration is the other common source of error that I have seen. Ensure your dApp uses the correct network chain ID and that this network is supported by MetaMask. Users sometimes attempt connections while they're on the incorrect network, which leads to a failure to connect and the dreaded lack of a popup. Double-checking the network configuration in both your application and the MetaMask mobile wallet settings will be useful.

As for resources, I'd highly recommend delving into the WalletConnect documentation itself. There, you'll find specifications, examples, and the most up-to-date instructions for initialization and connection management. Specifically, reading the “Web3 Provider API” portion of the ethereum foundation’s documentation will prove invaluable. For a deeper dive into state management best practices, especially in asynchronous scenarios, the React documentation (if you're using React) will be a good reference or any documentation for your particular framework or library. If you're working with a specific blockchain, the official documentation for that blockchain should be consulted for chain IDs and network parameters. Additionally, if you're using libraries that interact with blockchain, be sure to take advantage of any troubleshooting documents they might have.

In summary, the absence of the WalletConnect popup on MetaMask mobile is almost always a result of issues in the setup and state management of the connection process. Carefully reviewing your initialization code, ensuring you are handling connection states appropriately, and that you are using the correct network configuration, usually leads to a resolution. Always keep in mind the asynchronous nature of the interactions with a mobile wallet; properly handling errors and state changes will make these experiences much more reliable.
