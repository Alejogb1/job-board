Let's tackle this. I've certainly been down this road a few times, scratching my head at a seemingly perfectly configured system suddenly refusing to cooperate. The frustration of a non-functioning ssh key pair is, unfortunately, a fairly common experience, and it can stem from a number of distinct issues. From my experience managing several large AWS infrastructures, I've seen most of these manifest themselves firsthand. Let's break down the common culprits and what steps to take.

The first thing to understand is that key-based authentication relies on a delicate interplay between your local private key and the authorized public key on the remote EC2 instance. Any disruption in this link can cause failures. Typically, the problem isn't with the key generation itself, but with how these keys are managed and applied.

One common pitfall is incorrect permissions. In linux systems, where ssh authentication primarily resides, permissions are king. On your local machine, the private key needs to have restrictive permissions. Specifically, it *must* be readable only by the user that is attempting the ssh connection. If other users or processes have access, ssh will rightly refuse to use the key, seeing it as a security risk.

Let's look at an example of how permissions can trip you up. I recall a case where, after a system upgrade, a script I had created inadvertently altered file permissions within my `.ssh` directory. Here's how I'd confirm and correct that, using the command line:

```bash
# First, check the permissions on the private key (replace with your key name)
ls -l ~/.ssh/my_private_key

# If the permissions are not -rw-------, use chmod to correct them
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/my_private_key

# Let's be thorough and verify again
ls -l ~/.ssh/my_private_key
```

The `ls -l` command will show the permissions; what we're looking for is `-rw-------`, or 600 in octal. If it's anything else, the `chmod 600` will reset it to be read/write by the owner and nothing by others.

Now, let's shift our focus to the EC2 side. A frequent cause for key authentication failure is that the public key stored on the instance is incorrect or has been corrupted. During instance creation, or via a custom script, the public key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the desired user. Errors during the copy-paste process, unintentional modification, or the re-creation of an instance where this was not correctly propagated can lead to problems.

A critical debugging step involves checking this file directly on the instance. If you have alternative access—perhaps via the console in the AWS Management console or a previously working key–you can inspect this file:

```bash
# Log into your EC2 instance using a method that still works.
ssh -i /path/to/another_key.pem  ec2-user@your_instance_ip

# inspect the authorized keys file for the relevant user
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Examine that output carefully. It's common to find extra characters, a missing line break, or even the wrong public key altogether. If there are errors, you'll need to fix the file and restart the ssh service on the instance (although in practice a reconnection will pick up the change without a restart). If there is no entry for the correct public key at all, you'll need to add the correct one.

Remember, when troubleshooting, pay careful attention to the user specified in your connection string. That user's `authorized_keys` file is where the pertinent key needs to reside. For instance, if you are trying to connect as `ubuntu` but the key is in the `ec2-user` authorized_keys file, authentication will obviously fail.

Another scenario, more insidious, involves the use of the same key pair across different accounts or different regions within the same account. In one large deployment, an engineer accidentally used a development key pair on a production system. This immediately created a security violation, and the connection simply would not work. While you might assume it *should* work, AWS is careful to tie keys to regions and account-specific metadata, ensuring they're only used where intended.

To add more complexity, sometimes these errors are not immediately obvious. The AWS EC2 console will often show a successful instance creation even when, in the background, something went wrong. This is why I recommend always following a robust and auditable configuration process.

Let's assume, for example, you were having problems because the key wasn’t installed properly via CloudFormation or a similar tool. We can try the following, while connected using a working key, and we’ll temporarily add the new key into `authorized_keys`. To demonstrate this, I will generate a new key for demonstration, copy the public key into `authorized_keys`, and make sure you can use this key to connect.

```bash
# Firstly, on your local system, create a new key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N "" -f my_new_key

# Then copy the public key for temporary usage by the authorized_keys
cat my_new_key.pub

# On the ec2 instance (using a working connection) add this to the authorised_keys
echo 'paste_the_public_key_here' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# verify the addition
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# finally, try connecting using this key, on a new terminal window on the local system
ssh -i ./my_new_key  ec2-user@your_instance_ip
```

This process will help identify if the issue lies in the keys themselves, or with some other component of the setup.

Regarding resources, I highly recommend delving into the official AWS documentation for EC2 key pairs, which offers a solid understanding of how they are managed and stored. I also find *“Linux System Administration Handbook”* by Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, Trent R. Hein, and Ben Whaley to be an invaluable resource for deeper understanding of user management, permissions, and ssh configurations. Specific chapters on file permissions and secure shell configurations are incredibly relevant here. Furthermore, any good book on network security will provide additional context to the process. Look for works that are practical rather than just theoretical, such as *“Practical Packet Analysis”* by Chris Sanders, which, although primarily about network troubleshooting, offers a strong underlying understanding of ssh protocol interactions.

In my experience, addressing these authentication problems involves a systematic approach. Always confirm your local key permissions, carefully inspect the remote `authorized_keys` file, verify the correct key is being used, and ensure your configuration management is consistently applied. By doing this methodically, you'll usually get to the root cause of the problem and restore access in a short time.
