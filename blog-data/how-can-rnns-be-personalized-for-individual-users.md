, let’s tackle this. personalization of recurrent neural networks (rnns) for individual users is a subject I've grappled with extensively, specifically back in my days working on that predictive text input system for mobile devices. The goal then, as it is now, wasn't merely to have a single model that performed adequately for everyone but to create distinct models that adapted to each individual's unique patterns and preferences.

The fundamental challenge with rnns, especially when thinking about personalization, lies in their tendency to learn a generic representation across the entire training dataset. This means, without specific modifications, they would struggle to accurately capture the nuances of individual users whose behavior might drastically differ from the aggregate. The most effective approaches generally involve finding ways to inject user-specific information into the network architecture or its training process. Here are a few methods that I've found particularly useful:

**1. User Embeddings:**

The first method I often lean toward involves the generation of user embeddings. The core idea here is to represent each user as a dense, low-dimensional vector which encapsulates their specific behavioral characteristics. This user embedding is then incorporated as an additional input to the rnn, allowing it to condition its predictions based on the user’s individual representation. It’s akin to providing the rnn with an identifying "tag" that signals which user’s patterns it should be attending to.

This approach typically involves training a separate embedding layer alongside the rnn. During training, the user's id, or some proxy for it, is passed through this embedding layer, producing the user-specific vector. This vector is then concatenated with the input sequence or, sometimes more effectively, fed into intermediate layers of the rnn.

Here’s a simplified example in python using tensorflow. This is not intended for direct execution but rather illustrative.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def build_personalized_rnn(vocab_size, embedding_dim, rnn_units, num_users, user_embedding_dim):
  input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None,))
  user_input = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(1,), dtype=tf.int32)

  # Embedding for the input sequence
  input_embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)(input_layer)

  # Embedding for each user
  user_embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(num_users, user_embedding_dim)(user_input)
  user_embedding_reshaped = tf.keras.layers.Reshape((user_embedding_dim,))(user_embedding_layer)

  # Concatenate embeddings
  concatenated_input = tf.keras.layers.Concatenate(axis=-1)([input_embedding, tf.keras.layers.RepeatVector(tf.shape(input_embedding)[1])(user_embedding_reshaped)])


  # Rnn layer
  rnn_output = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(rnn_units, return_sequences=True)(concatenated_input)


  # Output layer
  output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')(rnn_output)


  model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=[input_layer, user_input], outputs=output_layer)
  return model
```

In this snippet, we create separate input layers for the sequential data and the user id. We also create two embeddings, one for the input sequences and one for user ids. The user embedding is reshaped, repeated and concatenated with the input embedding before being fed to the lstm. This results in an rnn that uses both sequence information as well as information about which user the sequence is associated with.

**2. User-Specific Parameters via Fine-tuning:**

Another strategy that has proven effective is to first train a general rnn model on the entire dataset. Then, for each individual user, fine-tune the model using their specific data. This leverages the general patterns learned by the model while adapting it to the user's unique quirks. It also allows for the model to benefit from the training data provided by other users, mitigating potential problems when a new user only provides very limited information.

The critical part here is to choose an appropriate fine-tuning strategy. One method involves updating all the weights of the pre-trained model, but, this can sometimes lead to catastrophic forgetting. A more stable approach involves adjusting the learning rate to be much lower or only update parameters in specific layers of the rnn or even add some regularization term to avoid drastically shifting from the base model. I tend to favor the latter, as it helps to retain generality while catering to individual deviations.

Again, a python snippet to illustrate, using pytorch this time:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class PersonalizedRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim):
        super(PersonalizedRNN, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        output, _ = self.lstm(embedded)
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output


def fine_tune_model(model, user_data, learning_rate, epochs):

    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        inputs = user_data[:, :-1]
        targets = user_data[:, 1:]

        output = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(output.view(-1, output.size(-1)), targets.view(-1))

        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    return model

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    vocab_size = 100
    embedding_dim = 64
    hidden_dim = 128

    # Initialize a base model with parameters learned from a very large collection of general-purpose data.
    base_model = PersonalizedRNN(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim)

    # simulate a user specific dataset
    user_data = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (100, 20)) # simulate 100 sequences each of length 20

    fine_tuned_model = fine_tune_model(base_model, user_data, 0.001, 5)

```

Here, we define a basic rnn and then, in the `fine_tune_model` function, a very basic example of adjusting all of its parameters based on a user-specific dataset. A more realistic scenario would require adding extra safeguards to avoid catastrophic forgetting of the base model's knowledge.

**3. Multi-Task Learning with User-Specific Heads:**

A third approach involves using a multi-task learning framework. In this setup, the model not only learns to predict the next token (or whatever the primary task is) but also learns to classify the user. This approach encourages the model to learn representations that are useful both for the primary task and for identifying individual user characteristics. We can achieve this by using user-specific "heads" which take the general rnn's output and predict a user based on it. The user-specific information is then used during inference to guide the prediction of the main task.

This encourages the model to separate shared, general knowledge from individual-specific features, leading to more tailored performance. Essentially, the model learns to 'ask itself' which user is making these requests in order to provide a more fitting response.

Here's a simplified tensorflow example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def build_multitask_rnn(vocab_size, embedding_dim, rnn_units, num_users):
  input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None,))
  # Embedding for the input sequence
  input_embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)(input_layer)
  # Rnn layer
  rnn_output = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(rnn_units, return_sequences=True)(input_embedding)
  # Output layer for main task
  main_output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax', name='main_output')(rnn_output)
  # user identification head
  user_output = tf.keras.layers.TimeDistributed(tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_users, activation='softmax'), name='user_output')(rnn_output)
  model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[main_output, user_output])

  return model
```

In this snippet, the model has two outputs, one for the main task, i.e., predicting the next word, and one to classify the user based on the sequence. Both objectives are trained together during the learning process.

**Practical Considerations and Resources:**

These are not the only approaches of course, and many variations and combinations of them exist and might be better suited depending on the specific use case. One example is to use a hypernetwork to dynamically generate weights for different users, essentially personalizing the rnn at a more granular level.

It is important to remember that the choice of method often depends on factors such as the amount of user-specific data available, computational resources, and the desired trade-off between individualization and generalization. For a solid foundational understanding of these concepts, I highly recommend looking at papers focusing on multi-task learning and personalized learning within the broader deep learning domain. Also, the "hands-on machine learning with scikit-learn, keras & tensorflow" by aurélien géron gives a great overview of these techniques within a wider machine learning context, especially if you're newer to these methods. As for more research-oriented literature, look into works by Yoshua Bengio and his group in the areas of meta-learning, which deals very much with training models able to rapidly adapt to new tasks and domains, which are very related to the topic of personalized learning.

The most crucial thing is to continuously test and evaluate the chosen approach, carefully monitoring metrics such as accuracy, personalization gains, and the overall training performance. It's often an iterative process, where adjustments are needed, and there is no single “best” answer but rather a series of tradeoffs to explore.
