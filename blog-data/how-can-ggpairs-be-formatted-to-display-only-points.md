,  I've spent a fair bit of time working with `ggpairs` in different contexts, mostly during exploratory data analysis phases on large datasets where visualizing pairwise relationships is crucial. One frequent need, precisely as you've pointed out, is to have `ggpairs` render only the scatter plots—just the points—without the additional bells and whistles like the correlation values, histograms, or density plots on the diagonals or upper triangle. It's a common customization, and fortunately, it's quite achievable with the tool's flexibility.

My experience stems from numerous data science projects where visual clarity was paramount. I remember one particular project involving sensor data; the sheer volume of data points meant that anything other than a straightforward scatter plot would quickly become visually cluttered and difficult to interpret. We had to tweak `ggpairs` significantly to make any sense of it.

Here’s the breakdown, focusing on how you’d manipulate `ggpairs` to display points alone. The key is leveraging the `lower` and `upper` arguments, along with the `diag` argument, within the `ggpairs()` function. These arguments accept function definitions that specify what's plotted in each section of the matrix.

To begin, let's assume you’re working with a data frame called `my_data`. I'll create a sample for illustrative purposes.

```R
library(GGally)

# sample data
my_data <- data.frame(
  var1 = rnorm(100),
  var2 = rnorm(100, mean=1, sd=1.5),
  var3 = rnorm(100, mean=2, sd=0.5),
  var4 = rnorm(100, mean=-1, sd=2)
)
```

**Example 1: Points Only in Lower Triangle**

Here’s how you get only the points to appear in the lower triangle, while leaving the rest blank:

```R
ggpairs(my_data,
        lower = list(continuous = "points"),
        upper = list(continuous = "blank"),
        diag = list(continuous = "blank"))
```

In this example, `lower = list(continuous = "points")` tells `ggpairs` to display scatter plots in the lower triangle of the matrix, specifically for continuous variables. The `upper = list(continuous = "blank")` argument directs `ggpairs` to plot nothing (a blank area) in the upper triangle for continuous variable pairings. Similarly, `diag = list(continuous = "blank")` ensures that nothing is displayed on the diagonal. The resulting plot will be a matrix where only the lower triangle contains the scatter plots. This can be useful when you want to keep a more focused visual on the relationships without the clutter.

**Example 2: Points Only Across the Entire Matrix**

Let's say you want to show points in all off-diagonal elements of the matrix while suppressing anything in the diagonal.

```R
ggpairs(my_data,
        lower = list(continuous = "points"),
        upper = list(continuous = "points"),
        diag = list(continuous = "blank"))
```

Here we are displaying “points” in both the `lower` and `upper` arguments for the `continuous` variable type. This will generate scatter plots for all variable pairings, while still suppressing the diagonal elements. If, for whatever reason, you want all of the diagonal elements to display scatter plots of each variable against themselves, you can replace the “blank” value in the `diag` argument with `points` as well.

**Example 3: Points with Customization**

Let’s move into more specific customization, where you might want a specific point size or color, using `ggally_points` function directly. Suppose you prefer red points and a different size.

```R
ggpairs(my_data,
        lower = list(continuous = wrap("points", size = 1.5, color = "red")),
        upper = list(continuous = "blank"),
        diag = list(continuous = "blank")
        )
```

In this case, instead of just the string "points," I've used `wrap("points", size = 1.5, color = "red")`. The `wrap` function in `GGally` allows you to pass the underlying `ggplot2` function and parameters to customize the display of individual panels. This enables fine-tuning the look and feel of the scatter plots—a useful capability when you want more control.

**Practical Considerations**

When working with very large datasets, generating these pairwise plots, even with just points, can be resource-intensive. For such scenarios, consider:

*   **Sampling:** Instead of using the entire dataset, work with a random sample. This can speed up plot generation and still give a good sense of the relationships.
*   **Data Reduction Techniques:** If the number of variables is very large, consider using dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to reduce the number of variables you need to visualize.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** For extensive exploratory analyses, consider using interactive visualization tools which may allow you to explore pairwise relationships dynamically.

**Further Learning**

For a solid theoretical grounding and more advanced techniques, I recommend a few specific resources:

1.  **"ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" by Hadley Wickham:** This book will help you understand the core principles of the `ggplot2` package, which forms the basis of `GGally`. It will empower you to customize plots beyond the basic options available in `ggpairs`.
2.  **"R for Data Science" by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund:** This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the tidyverse, including `dplyr` and other packages that can significantly improve your data manipulation and preparation workflows.
3.  **"Visualizing Data" by William S. Cleveland:** This book is a classic resource for information visualization principles, offering valuable advice on best practices for creating informative and accessible graphs. It can guide you on making informed choices while crafting visualizations.

In summary, customizing `ggpairs` to display just the points is a fairly straightforward process by manipulating the `lower`, `upper`, and `diag` arguments. You can tailor the plot to suit your specific needs, whether it’s a sparse view or a more custom-designed visualization. As always, careful consideration should be given to the dataset size and the underlying purpose of visualization. I hope this explanation, along with those code examples, provides a clear understanding of how to achieve this customization and why you might choose to do so.
