Let's tackle this—optimizing cluster size when using faiss k-means is definitely something I’ve encountered more than a few times, and it's a common challenge when working with large-scale vector embeddings. It's rarely a one-size-fits-all situation, and the “optimal” size really depends on a constellation of factors tied to your specific data, computational resources, and downstream application goals. I've found that approaching this systematically, balancing theoretical understanding with empirical experimentation, is key.

First, it’s important to understand the role of k-means in this context. In faiss (facebook ai similarity search), k-means isn't always used directly for the final search, but is crucial for tasks like clustering the data to build an inverted file index (ivf) or for codebook generation when quantizing vectors. The number of clusters, *k*, directly impacts the granularity of these processes. Too few clusters, and you risk having large, heterogeneous groups, making the subsequent search or quantization less effective. Too many, and you dilute the per-cluster concentration, increasing computational overhead and potentially exacerbating overfitting.

So, how do you find that “sweet spot?” There isn't a magic formula, but there are a few good practices we can lean on. One method I often deploy is monitoring the *distortion*, also known as within-cluster sum of squares (wcss), as a function of *k*. Typically, if you increase the number of clusters, the distortion goes down, as each cluster becomes more cohesive. However, after a certain *k*, the reduction in distortion diminishes. This point of diminishing returns is often called the “elbow” in the plot of distortion vs *k*, and the *k* value corresponding to this point is often considered a candidate for an appropriate number of clusters. The tricky part? The elbow isn’t always clear or well-defined. So you can’t rely on purely visual intuition; we need to be more rigorous.

For a better understanding, let’s look at some Python code with faiss:

```python
import faiss
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def calculate_distortion(vectors, k, niter=20):
    d = vectors.shape[1]
    kmeans = faiss.Kmeans(d, k, niter=niter)
    kmeans.train(vectors)
    _, distortion = kmeans.index.search(vectors, 1)
    return np.sum(distortion)

def find_optimal_k(vectors, k_range, niter=20):
    distortions = []
    for k in k_range:
        distortion = calculate_distortion(vectors, k, niter)
        distortions.append(distortion)
    return k_range, distortions

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Generate some dummy data
    np.random.seed(42)
    num_vectors = 10000
    vector_dim = 128
    vectors = np.random.rand(num_vectors, vector_dim).astype('float32')

    k_range = range(2, 51, 2)
    k_values, distortions = find_optimal_k(vectors, k_range)

    plt.plot(k_values, distortions, marker='o')
    plt.xlabel("Number of Clusters (k)")
    plt.ylabel("Total Distortion (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)")
    plt.title("Distortion vs Number of Clusters")
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
```

This snippet generates a set of random vectors (you'd typically be using your own embedding vectors here), then iteratively calculates the distortion for different values of *k*. By plotting the results, we can visually inspect the “elbow,” if there is a clear one. Keep in mind, this is computationally intensive on larger datasets, so consider working with a smaller subset initially.

Another approach, specifically relevant when k-means is used as a pre-processing step for building an inverted file index (ivf) in faiss, is to look at the *search speed vs. accuracy trade-off*. With ivf indexing, your vectors are assigned to a specific cluster (voronoi region) at index time, and at search time, only vectors in the top *nprobe* (number of probes) clusters are compared against the query vector. If your *k* is too small, your clusters will be large, and the initial pre-filtering step is less effective, which may lead to having to increase *nprobe* for good recall, slowing things down. Conversely, too many clusters lead to more overhead in indexing, so we need to understand the sweet spot for that. I once worked on a project with very high dimensional text embeddings, and tuning *k* and *nprobe* together was really a balance of reducing search time, while not sacrificing any accuracy.

Here’s a simple code example of how to test with ivf:

```python
import faiss
import numpy as np
import time

def create_ivf_index(vectors, k):
    d = vectors.shape[1]
    quantizer = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)
    index = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(quantizer, d, k, faiss.METRIC_L2)
    index.train(vectors)
    index.add(vectors)
    return index

def evaluate_ivf_index(index, queries, ground_truth, nprobe, top_k=10):
    start_time = time.time()
    index.nprobe = nprobe
    _, I = index.search(queries, top_k)
    search_time = time.time() - start_time

    correct_count = 0
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
       if ground_truth[i] in row:
            correct_count+=1

    recall = correct_count/len(queries)
    return recall, search_time

if __name__ == '__main__':

    np.random.seed(42)
    num_vectors = 10000
    vector_dim = 128
    vectors = np.random.rand(num_vectors, vector_dim).astype('float32')

    num_queries = 100
    queries = np.random.rand(num_queries, vector_dim).astype('float32')

    ground_truth = [np.random.randint(0, num_vectors) for _ in range(num_queries)]


    k_values = [32, 64, 128, 256]
    nprobe_values = [1,4,8]

    for k in k_values:
        index = create_ivf_index(vectors, k)
        print(f"Testing with k: {k}")
        for nprobe in nprobe_values:
            recall, search_time = evaluate_ivf_index(index, queries, ground_truth, nprobe)
            print(f"\t nprobe: {nprobe}, Recall: {recall:.4f}, Search Time: {search_time:.4f}s")
```
Here, different cluster sizes (*k*) are tested along with varying nprobe values to see the resulting accuracy and time. The selection of *k* will depend on your specific requirements in recall vs latency tradeoff.

Lastly, it is crucial to keep *scalability* in mind. If your dataset grows significantly in the future, you should test these performance characteristics with the anticipated dataset size (or a good approximation) as the cluster assignment and distortion change over size. Additionally, if you move towards a more complex quantization method like product quantization (pq), you must test different configurations including the number of subquantizers, and the number of bits per subvector. These techniques also directly impact your index construction and search time/accuracy, making the selection of *k* and related parameters a delicate balancing act.

For further reading, I'd suggest diving into the original faiss paper, “billion-scale similarity search with gpus”. Also, the book "Mining of Massive Datasets" by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, and Jeff Ullman provides a solid theoretical background, and specifically for vector quantization, consider the works of Hervé Jégou and co-authors for deeper insights. For practical implementations and some other ideas, look at the work of Matthijs Douze as he's a key author on FAISS, and has great resources available. These resources will give you a deeper understanding of the theory behind k-means and its application in large-scale search and recommendation systems, which goes beyond just faiss itself.

In summary, while it's tempting to look for a simple rule, optimal cluster size in faiss k-means is an empirical question. By monitoring distortion, evaluating search speed vs. accuracy, and always considering your data's characteristics, you can identify configurations that are both efficient and effective. It's a process of constant iteration and experimentation based on the situation at hand.
