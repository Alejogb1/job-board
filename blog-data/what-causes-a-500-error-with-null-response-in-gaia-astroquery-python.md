Okay, let's dissect this. I've seen my share of head-scratching 500 errors with astroquery, especially when dealing with Gaia data. It's a frustrating situation, that null response hanging there, mocking your perfectly crafted query. It rarely stems from a single, easily identifiable problem, but rather a confluence of factors that often involve the interplay between your code, the astroquery library itself, and the remote Gaia archive servers. Having wrestled with these things more than once, I’ve found the root cause usually falls into a few key categories, and I'll lay out what I've learned.

Firstly, let's acknowledge the nature of HTTP 500 errors. A 500 status code means the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. In the context of astroquery, this indicates something went wrong *on the Gaia server's end*, not necessarily within your code. However, the way we formulate our query and the surrounding environment can exacerbate or trigger these server-side issues. A null response, then, is the server's way of saying it utterly failed and can't even produce an informative error message. It's like the server threw its hands up.

One frequent culprit is the sheer complexity or resource intensity of a query. Gaia's dataset is enormous, and if we ask for too much information at once, or construct a query that requires extensive server-side processing, it can easily overwhelm the server's resources, leading to a 500 error. This isn't always about the *number* of objects requested, but also the nature of the filters or the types of computations required. Subsetting and judiciously applying filters are crucial. Let's examine some typical scenarios with sample code:

```python
from astroquery.gaia import Gaia
from astropy import coordinates
from astropy import units as u

# Example 1: Querying a very large volume with no filters
try:
    # This could easily trigger a 500 because no area is defined.
    # Server has to consider whole catalog to satisfy the query!
    job = Gaia.launch_job_async("SELECT TOP 1000000 * FROM gaiadr3.gaia_source;")
    r = job.get_results()
    print(f"Retrieved {len(r)} rows.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
```

In this initial example, requesting 1,000,000 objects without specifying a position or area can overload the Gaia server. I've seen this cause 500 errors and null responses on many occasions. The server struggles to process and retrieve such a large dataset without any spatial limitations.

Another common problem stems from excessively complex queries that include user-defined functions (udfs) or intricate join operations. If these are poorly optimized on the server's end, they can choke the system and trigger a 500 error. The server is doing a lot under the hood, and overly complex sql can push it into a failure state.

```python
# Example 2: Complex Query using user-defined functions that are not well optimized.
try:
    query = """
    SELECT TOP 10000
        g.source_id, g.ra, g.dec,
        g.parallax, g.pmra, g.pmdec,
       my_custom_func(g.parallax, g.pmra, g.pmdec) as derived_value
        FROM gaiadr3.gaia_source as g
    """
    job = Gaia.launch_job_async(query)
    r = job.get_results()
    print(f"Retrieved {len(r)} rows.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
```

The above illustrates the potential hazards when utilizing UDFs within astroquery. Although the 'my_custom_func' is fictional here, it emphasizes how complex or poorly performing functions that exist only in your query can be a common culprit. While Gaia allows for certain SQL functions, overly complicated, server side functions, especially those involving large cross-matches, can cause instability and lead to a 500.

Furthermore, I’ve also run into issues with query timeouts. The Gaia servers have imposed query execution time limits, often undocumented. If your query takes too long, the server will abruptly terminate the request with a 500 and no data back. This is especially true when dealing with large datasets or complex processing. It can even happen on a smaller query if the server load is high.

```python
# Example 3: Subsetting a manageable query
try:
    coord = coordinates.SkyCoord(ra=10.0*u.deg, dec=10.0*u.deg, frame='icrs')
    radius = 0.5*u.deg
    job = Gaia.cone_search_async(coord, radius)
    r = job.get_results()
    print(f"Retrieved {len(r)} rows.")
except Exception as e:
   print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
```
This third example demonstrates a cone search which is a much better approach for retrieving a subset of data from a particular area. This helps the server greatly as it does not have to consider the whole catalog.

What can we do? The key is being strategic in how we query the Gaia database. Firstly, always constrain your search to a specific area of the sky, using cone searches or box queries. Subsetting using `where` clauses in the sql is also paramount. When you are requesting data, consider reducing the number of columns requested in the `select` statement. Request only the information that you will need.

When it comes to SQL, avoid complex user-defined functions or join operations when possible. Sometimes, it is better to download two simpler data products and cross-match them on your local machine. Similarly, if you are performing complicated calculations on the data after retrieval, perhaps consider doing them client side.

To troubleshoot these problems, consider first running a much simpler, subset query to verify that you are able to communicate with the Gaia servers. If that succeeds, consider gradually increasing the complexity of the query until you locate what triggers the issue. Also consider checking the Gaia archives website for any server status reports that might mention maintenance periods or known outages. Finally, remember that if you are executing too many queries to the server within a short period, you might find yourself being throttled or rate limited. Be sure to always adhere to their usage guidelines.

For more in-depth information on optimizing your sql queries and interacting with astronomical databases I would recommend *Database Modeling and Design: Logical Design* by Toby Teorey. Furthermore, reading the original Gaia papers, particularly those concerning the data processing pipelines would also be a useful exercise. The book, *Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems* (ADASS) is also a useful resource when dealing with these issues. This topic is usually best handled by understanding the underlying structure and nature of the data, so familiarizing yourself with these resources will help.

In summary, 500 errors with null responses in astroquery when using Gaia, aren't typically a straightforward problem. They stem from the inherent challenges of querying an immense dataset on remote servers. By understanding the common pitfalls, focusing on good querying practices, and referring to helpful resources, we can usually mitigate these frustrating issues. Always start simple, test iteratively, and adhere to the published guidelines, and remember sometimes these errors can stem from issues on their end and are not necessarily your fault.
