 so you wanna know about pop stacks right Been there done that got the t-shirt literally I actually spilled coffee on one once code was fine surprisingly but the keyboard was a mess Anyway a pop stack or sometimes just called a stack yeah its a pretty fundamental data structure in computer science its basically a way to organize data where you can only add or remove items from one end this end is what we call the top think of it like a stack of plates the last plate you put on is the first one you take off thats it

It follows a LIFO or Last-In-First-Out principle This means the last element you push onto the stack will be the first one you pop off It's a really simple concept actually but very powerful you can use them in many areas like function call management parsing expressions undo redo mechanisms compiler design etc its just everywhere really

I remember back in the day when I was a newbie I spent like a whole day debugging a simple recursive function I had a stack overflow error and I was clueless the error message is a big clue right there but at the time my brain was just mush it was all because I was using a simple loop instead of properly unwinding my recursive calls and yes the function call stack is implemented as a stack under the hood so learning about this really helped me understand how recursion works and why its important to have a base case and be aware of your call stack depth yeah good times

 lets get into some code so here is how you'd typically implement it in Python for instance its quite straightforward

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        else:
            return None

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        else:
            return None

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)


# Example of usage
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
stack.push(3)

print(stack.pop()) # Output: 3
print(stack.peek()) # Output: 2
print(stack.size()) # Output: 2
print(stack.is_empty()) # Output: False
```

This Python code is a simple implementation its using a list to store the items in the stack you have methods like push to add items pop to remove items peek to see the top item without removing it is_empty to check if the stack is empty and size to get the number of items its pretty basic stuff

And lets say we want to implement this in another language lets try Javascript

```javascript
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }

  push(item) {
    this.items.push(item);
  }

  pop() {
    if (!this.isEmpty()) {
      return this.items.pop();
    } else {
      return undefined;
    }
  }

  peek() {
    if (!this.isEmpty()) {
      return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
    } else {
      return undefined;
    }
  }

  size() {
    return this.items.length;
  }
}


// Example usage
const stack = new Stack();
stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);

console.log(stack.pop()); // Output: 3
console.log(stack.peek()); // Output: 2
console.log(stack.size()); // Output: 2
console.log(stack.isEmpty()); // Output: false
```

Again a similar implementation to the Python one but this time using Javascript classes and methods the core idea stays the same list used to store items push adds items to the end of the list and pop removes items from the end the peek function access the last element without removing it

So what about a different approach lets do it in C using pointers and malloc

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

typedef struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
} Node;

typedef struct Stack {
    Node *top;
} Stack;


Stack* createStack() {
    Stack* stack = (Stack*)malloc(sizeof(Stack));
    if (stack == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    stack->top = NULL;
    return stack;
}


bool isEmpty(Stack *stack) {
    return stack->top == NULL;
}


void push(Stack *stack, int data) {
    Node *newNode = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node));
    if(newNode == NULL){
         fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
         exit(1);
    }
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->next = stack->top;
    stack->top = newNode;
}


int pop(Stack *stack) {
    if(isEmpty(stack)){
        fprintf(stderr, "Stack is empty, cannot pop\n");
        return -1;
    }
    Node *temp = stack->top;
    int data = temp->data;
    stack->top = temp->next;
    free(temp);
    return data;
}


int peek(Stack *stack) {
   if (isEmpty(stack)){
       fprintf(stderr, "Stack is empty, cannot peek\n");
       return -1;
   }
    return stack->top->data;
}


void freeStack(Stack *stack){
    while(!isEmpty(stack)){
       pop(stack);
    }
    free(stack);
}

int main() {
    Stack *stack = createStack();
    push(stack, 1);
    push(stack, 2);
    push(stack, 3);

    printf("Popped: %d\n", pop(stack)); // Output: 3
    printf("Peek: %d\n", peek(stack));  // Output: 2

   freeStack(stack);
    return 0;
}
```

 this implementation is a bit more involved its using a linked list to represent the stack We create a `Node` struct to store the data and a pointer to the next node and the `Stack` struct which holds a pointer to the top of the stack push adds a new node to the top pop removes the top node and returns its data and peek returns the data of the top node without removing it this example also includes basic error handling if the stack is empty or memory allocation failed and a basic way to free memory which is an important part when doing C development. I remember one time having memory leaks everywhere in my C code that was because I was not freeing stuff properly like my dad always said "clean up your room after playing son" memory management is that kind of chore that needs to be done otherwise it becomes a mess.

So yeah thats about it for stacks its a fairly simple data structure but its used almost everywhere if you want to go deep on data structures and algorithms I can recommend some great books "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H Cormen et al is a bible for algorithms and a good complement is "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne those two books cover all that you need to know about data structures and algorithms not to mention "Data Structures and Algorithms in Java" by Michael T. Goodrich et al (the Java one is language specific though but still relevant) these are my go-to's when i need something concrete you can also check some online courses from Stanford MIT or some websites that have open courseware.

One more thing about stacks and this is no joke just straight fact the way the memory for function calls and local variables are created during function execution is done through the call stack which is yet again another stack and yes i have also found a stack overflow error debugging javascript which uses a call stack in the V8 engine and i also have found stack overflows in C using the same memory area the same mechanism is used every where and no its not a problem with the size of the memory stack its just a problem of recursive calls not having a proper base case.

So yeah I think thats it if you have more questions or other topics you would like to learn just ask away I am more than happy to help remember to implement them in different ways using lists pointers etc and that way you can understand the implementation details better the most important part to learn is not just use the datastructure is to truly understand what it does and the implications it has on the program and that comes with different implementations so happy coding.
