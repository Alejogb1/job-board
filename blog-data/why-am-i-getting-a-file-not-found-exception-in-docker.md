Okay, let's tackle this. I've definitely spent more time than I’d like to admit tracking down "file not found" exceptions within Docker containers, and they’re rarely as simple as a typo. They can stem from a variety of places, and it’s always crucial to systematically check through the possibilities. It’s not uncommon, and through experience, I’ve learned to anticipate the usual suspects.

Fundamentally, a "file not found" exception within Docker means the process inside your container can’t locate a file it expects to exist at a specified path. The core of the problem often lies with how file paths are handled across different environments, especially the divide between your host machine and the containerized environment.

One of the most common causes, in my experience, is incorrect paths within your *dockerfile*. The dockerfile dictates the container’s structure. If you use commands like `copy` or `add` to include files, and the specified source path doesn’t correlate to where the file *is* at build time, it's going to fail. A classic scenario was a project where we rearranged our source code folders but neglected to update the relative paths in our dockerfile – the build would succeed, but the container would launch, then crash, unable to find key configuration files. Another similar instance involved a discrepancy between case sensitivity on Windows vs. Linux, a problem we encountered when building on one operating system and deploying on another. The path might seem correct, but a slight difference can make or break your setup.

Another very frequent pitfall comes from volume mounts. Volume mounts connect directories on your host to directories inside the container, but misunderstandings about how they work can be a huge source of headaches. If your container expects a file to exist at `/app/data/config.json`, and your host volume is mounted at `/host/my-data:/app/data`, then the file needs to physically be present at `/host/my-data/config.json` on your host. A missing file, or a file misnamed, will cause your process to fail. More often than not, I would initially blame my application code, when really the problem was the mounting itself.

Furthermore, consider the user context in your docker container. By default, processes usually run as root user. If you are attempting to access files created with specific permissions, a standard user might be unable to read them within your Docker container. This was particularly troublesome in one project where we were using docker volumes to share data between multiple containers and some had user context configurations and others didn't, which lead to access issues and unexpected ‘file not found’ errors.

Let's walk through some examples, which, I hope, will clarify this.

**Example 1: Incorrect Path in Dockerfile**

Let’s say you have a file named `my_config.ini` located in the same directory as your `Dockerfile`. Your goal is to copy this file into your container at `/app/config/my_config.ini`.

A *flawed* Dockerfile might look like this:

```dockerfile
from python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

copy config/my_config.ini /app/config/my_config.ini

cmd ["python", "my_script.py"]
```

The problem? It tries to copy from `config/my_config.ini`, but that subfolder doesn't exist in the *same directory* as the dockerfile itself at build time. This would fail with an error along the lines of “cannot find ‘config/my_config.ini’.”

Here's a *correct* Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
from python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

copy my_config.ini /app/config/my_config.ini
# the actual file named ‘my_config.ini’ is being referenced at the right place here

cmd ["python", "my_script.py"]
```

This assumes `my_config.ini` is directly in the docker build context, which is the same directory as your dockerfile. We also assume you've ensured that the destination folder, `/app/config` exists within the container if your script relies on that folder to exist.

**Example 2: Incorrect Volume Mount**

Imagine you have a python application that needs a data file, `data.csv`, from your local machine.

A typical, and again, flawed, docker-compose file would look something like this:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  my_app:
    image: my_app_image
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    # the current directory is mounted at the ‘/app/data’ location
```
If you execute `docker-compose up`, but only `data.csv` *was* located at `./data/data.csv`, that would work, but if the file was located outside this subfolder like `./data.csv` then you are bound to get a file not found. Remember, the `/app/data` inside the container maps exactly to the folder, './data', on your host. Nothing outside of this mapped directory is inherently visible.

Now, say you ran that command and got your ‘file not found exception’. An easy way to rectify this is changing the location on our machine to match that of the mounted volume. The correct structure here would be, a directory named `data` within the current folder with `data.csv` inside.

**Example 3: User Permissions**

Let's pretend you have a folder with generated logs `/logs`, and you created this folder with user root. Now, your application code is using another user, called `my_app_user`. If `my_app_user` doesn’t have read/write permissions to `/logs`, your application, when trying to write logs will throw an exception.

```dockerfile
from ubuntu:latest

run groupadd -r my_app_user && useradd -r -g my_app_user my_app_user
workdir /app
copy ./app/ /app/

run mkdir /logs && chown my_app_user:my_app_user /logs

user my_app_user

cmd ["python3", "my_app.py"]
```

In this case, before switching to the `my_app_user`, we first create the `logs` directory, and then set its ownership to `my_app_user`, ensuring that the application running as `my_app_user` has the required permissions to use the log directory.

**Key Resources**

While I can't link directly, I can heartily recommend several resources. For a detailed understanding of Dockerfiles, check the official Docker documentation; it’s comprehensive. *Docker Deep Dive* by Nigel Poulton is a fantastic resource for deeper insights, particularly on layers and storage. For a broad view of containerization and orchestration, *Kubernetes in Action* by Marko Lukša is extremely insightful. Also, for delving deeper into how docker permissions work I found the following resources valuable: *Understanding User Namespaces and Security* by Jessie Frazelle, for a theoretical deep dive, and a blog post called *Docker Security: Running Containers as a Non-Root User* by Ian Lewis. These will greatly improve your troubleshooting skills.

In conclusion, “file not found” exceptions in Docker are seldom trivial. You need to inspect the paths you're using in your *dockerfile*, carefully check your volume mounts, and be mindful of user contexts. Systematically going through these points is usually how I end up fixing it. By understanding how these components interact, you’ll quickly become adept at resolving these kinds of issues quickly and effectively. And as with most technical challenges, learning from your own mistakes, as I often have, is the best way to gain mastery of this area.
