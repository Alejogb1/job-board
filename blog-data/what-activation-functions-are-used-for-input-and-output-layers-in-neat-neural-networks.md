, let's get into this. Thinking back to a particularly intricate robotics project, I remember facing this very challenge – how to effectively handle input and output transformations in a neuroevolutionary context, specifically using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). We weren't dealing with simple classification tasks; our robots had to learn complex sensorimotor coordination. So, selecting appropriate activation functions wasn't just academic, it was mission-critical.

The core of the matter is this: NEAT doesn’t prescribe specific activation functions for input or output layers like a standard backpropagation-trained network might. Instead, the activation functions for those layers, like all other layers, are generally evolved as part of the network structure. It's a key feature that contributes to NEAT’s flexibility and ability to discover unconventional solutions. We don't hard-code a specific sigmoid or tanh for the final layer, for instance. Instead, we allow the evolutionary process to determine which functions are most effective at handling the outputs in relation to the fitness function we've defined.

Generally, input layers are not thought of as having ‘activations’ in the sense that hidden and output layers do. Rather, they represent the raw data entering the network. The values pass through unchanged to the first layer of the network unless you explicitly include an activation at the input layer to do something like scale the values or change the range of the input before the data is used by the first layer.

However, the output layer is a different story. We need to map the internal representations, which NEAT has evolved, to a form that's usable. How this mapping is handled depends largely on the nature of the problem. For instance, if you are dealing with a binary classification, the output node of your NEAT network might benefit from a sigmoid function, scaling the single output into the (0, 1) range, which is a common choice to represent probabilities. Conversely, in a continuous control problem, you may want your output to span a wider range of values, so a linear function, essentially no change of data, may be better. So, lets look at some practical examples.

**Example 1: Binary Classification Task**

Imagine a simple classification task where we need to determine if an object is present or absent, based on two sensor readings.

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def neat_output_binary_classification(input_values, weights, activation_function):
    # In this simplified example, we only have one output node and weights from two input nodes to one output node
    output = np.dot(input_values, weights) #dot product of inputs and weights
    return activation_function(output) #apply activation function to the output

# Example usage
input_data = np.array([0.7, 0.3])
weight_values = np.array([0.5, -0.2])
output_value = neat_output_binary_classification(input_data, weight_values, sigmoid)

print(f"Binary Classification Output: {output_value}")
```

In this snippet, we use a sigmoid function to squash the output between 0 and 1, easily interpretable as a probability, suitable for binary classification. The key here is we evolve the `weight_values` via the NEAT algorithm to produce different outputs. We aren't trying to train weights using back propagation like a traditional neural network, instead NEAT evolves the network topology and connection weights, and in this example, I am manually setting the `weight_values` as a demonstration.

**Example 2: Continuous Control Problem**

For our robotics project, a common scenario involved controlling motor speeds for precise movement. Here, we needed output values in a continuous range to directly command motor drivers. We used a linear activation function or no activation at all. In the NEAT implementation, this means the output node’s activation function is just `f(x) = x`.

```python
def linear_activation(x):
  return x

def neat_output_continuous_control(input_values, weights, activation_function):
    # again a simple example with one output node
    output = np.dot(input_values, weights)
    return activation_function(output)

# Example
input_data = np.array([0.5, -0.2])
weight_values = np.array([1.2, 0.8])
output_value = neat_output_continuous_control(input_data, weight_values, linear_activation)

print(f"Continuous Control Output: {output_value}")
```

Here, the linear activation means that the calculated sum of inputs times their respective weights, effectively scales and shifts the output based on evolved weights. The raw output value can be directly used as a control signal for a motor, for example. There is no compression or other manipulation of the raw output value.

**Example 3: Multidimensional Output**

Another common scenario we encountered was a system where we needed multiple outputs, for example control for a multi-jointed robotic arm. In this case, we had multiple output nodes where each output node potentially employed a different activation function, dictated by the evolutionary search. Let's simulate this.

```python
def tanh_activation(x):
  return np.tanh(x)

def relu_activation(x):
  return np.maximum(0, x)

def neat_output_multidimensional(input_values, weights, activation_functions):
    # Imagine three output nodes with different activation functions.
    output = np.dot(input_values, weights)
    return np.array([activation_functions[i](output[i]) for i in range(len(activation_functions))])


# Example
input_data = np.array([0.8, -0.5])
weight_values = np.array([[0.5, -0.2],
                         [0.3, 0.7],
                         [-0.1, 0.9]])
activation_functions = [tanh_activation, relu_activation, linear_activation]
output_values = neat_output_multidimensional(input_data, weight_values, activation_functions)

print(f"Multidimensional Output: {output_values}")
```

In this example, we see each output node can have its own activation. The evolutionary process determines what works best through the fitness function.

In practice, while NEAT is very good at finding different activations for different outputs, in some cases, restricting the possible activations can improve convergence. The choices are driven by empirical validation and experimentation, often involving comparing results with different pre-set constraints. You can also evolve the activation function for each node as well, however this tends to increase the complexity of the evolutionary search quite a bit. I would recommend starting without doing that unless there is a clear need.

If you’re looking to delve deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of NEAT, I recommend *Evolving Neural Networks Through Augmenting Topologies* by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen – it’s the foundational paper. For a more comprehensive look at neuroevolutionary techniques, *Neuroevolution Through Competitive Coevolution* edited by Peter J. Angeline, David B. Fogel, and L.J. Fogel provides a good overview. Additionally, *Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning* by David E. Goldberg is a classic that provides a lot of grounding in the basics of genetic algorithms, which are at the core of NEAT. These resources should give you a more complete understanding of NEAT and the considerations around activation functions.

In conclusion, in a NEAT neural network, the activation function at the output layer, rather than being predefined, is typically part of the evolutionary solution. There isn't a fixed set of choices, and the best function for the output is derived from the fitness landscape and the task at hand. The examples above will hopefully show you how the selection, application, and evolution of these functions contribute to NEAT's effectiveness in tackling a wide variety of complex problems, which is what made it the perfect approach for our robotics project back in the day. It's all about letting the problem, along with NEAT, shape the solution.
