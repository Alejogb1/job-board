Alright, let's tackle this. I remember back when I was first playing with Theano and Lasagne, I had a similar need: I needed a way to understand and manipulate the network structure not just as a series of stacked layers but as a hierarchical, traversable tree. It's incredibly useful for things like pruning, visualizing model complexity, or even implementing custom backpropagation schemes. The direct approach isn't immediately obvious, especially with Lasagne’s layer definitions. But it’s certainly doable.

The crux of the issue stems from the fact that Lasagne, while it provides a clean abstraction over Theano, internally represents models as a graph of interconnected symbolic variables. These variables are interconnected according to how you’ve defined your layers in code. It’s less of a predefined tree structure and more of a network that needs to be interpreted as one. My solution, and what I found to be the most flexible approach over time, revolves around extracting the layers and building an explicit tree-like structure by inferring parent-child relationships.

Instead of relying on some magical, inherent property of the layers themselves, we're essentially going to reconstruct the tree based on how the outputs of one layer feed into the inputs of another. This involves iterating through the layers, checking how the output of one is used by subsequent layers, and building the parent-child links explicitly. This is the core of our traversal method.

Here’s how I generally approach it, including a Python code snippet as a starting point:

```python
import lasagne
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

def build_model_tree(network):
    layer_map = {}
    for layer in lasagne.layers.get_all_layers(network):
        layer_map[layer] = {'layer': layer, 'parents': [], 'children': []}

    for layer, info in layer_map.items():
       for next_layer in lasagne.layers.get_all_layers(network):
          if layer in lasagne.layers.get_incoming(next_layer):
               layer_map[layer]['children'].append(next_layer)
               layer_map[next_layer]['parents'].append(layer)

    return layer_map

# Example usage:
input_var = T.tensor4('inputs')
network = lasagne.layers.InputLayer(shape=(None, 3, 32, 32), input_var=input_var)
network = lasagne.layers.Conv2DLayer(network, num_filters=32, filter_size=3)
network = lasagne.layers.MaxPool2DLayer(network, pool_size=2)
network = lasagne.layers.Conv2DLayer(network, num_filters=64, filter_size=3)
network = lasagne.layers.MaxPool2DLayer(network, pool_size=2)
network = lasagne.layers.DenseLayer(lasagne.layers.flatten(network), num_units=256)
network = lasagne.layers.DenseLayer(network, num_units=10)

tree = build_model_tree(network)

# Example of traversing:
def print_tree(tree, root=None, indent=0):
    if root is None:
        for layer_info in tree.values():
          if not layer_info['parents']:
            print_tree(tree, layer_info['layer'], 0)
        return

    print('  ' * indent + f"- {root.__class__.__name__}")

    for child in tree[root]['children']:
        print_tree(tree, child, indent + 1)
print_tree(tree)
```

In this example, `build_model_tree` creates a dictionary where each key is a layer, and each value is a dictionary containing its parents and children lists, based on the network. The `print_tree` function takes the created map and the root layer and traverses the tree, indenting each level. This presents the model’s topology in a visually readable way. This is a foundation to then execute other tree traversal algorithms, like pre-order or post-order, depending on your use-case.

You will find that this structure allows you to easily determine which layers depend on others. It’s particularly helpful when your network has branching or skip connections. This wasn't a trivial task in older versions of Theano, where the model structure was somewhat more opaque.

However, I encountered a scenario where this basic approach needed to be extended further: when dealing with composite layers. Layers in Lasagne, like `MergeLayer`, may have multiple input layers. These scenarios require you to understand that a layer can receive inputs from multiple layers, and you need to track all those incoming connections.

Consider a case where we use `ElemwiseSumLayer` to add the outputs of two different convolution layers:

```python
import lasagne
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

def build_model_tree_composite(network):
    layer_map = {}
    for layer in lasagne.layers.get_all_layers(network):
        layer_map[layer] = {'layer': layer, 'parents': [], 'children': []}

    for layer, info in layer_map.items():
       for next_layer in lasagne.layers.get_all_layers(network):
            incoming_layers = lasagne.layers.get_incoming(next_layer)
            if isinstance(incoming_layers, list):
                if layer in incoming_layers:
                  layer_map[layer]['children'].append(next_layer)
                  layer_map[next_layer]['parents'].append(layer)
            elif layer == incoming_layers: # Handle case where the incoming is a single layer
                layer_map[layer]['children'].append(next_layer)
                layer_map[next_layer]['parents'].append(layer)

    return layer_map

# Example usage:
input_var = T.tensor4('inputs')
network_input = lasagne.layers.InputLayer(shape=(None, 3, 32, 32), input_var=input_var)
conv1 = lasagne.layers.Conv2DLayer(network_input, num_filters=32, filter_size=3)
conv2 = lasagne.layers.Conv2DLayer(network_input, num_filters=32, filter_size=5)
merged = lasagne.layers.ElemwiseSumLayer([conv1, conv2])
network_output = lasagne.layers.DenseLayer(lasagne.layers.flatten(merged), num_units=10)

tree = build_model_tree_composite(network_output)

def print_tree(tree, root=None, indent=0):
    if root is None:
        for layer_info in tree.values():
          if not layer_info['parents']:
            print_tree(tree, layer_info['layer'], 0)
        return

    print('  ' * indent + f"- {root.__class__.__name__}")

    for child in tree[root]['children']:
        print_tree(tree, child, indent + 1)
print_tree(tree)

```

The key difference here is the handling of potentially multiple incoming layers, explicitly checking for list and non-list types of `incoming_layers`. This ensures that we capture all parents of a composite layer accurately. You'll notice how `ElemwiseSumLayer`'s output is used by `DenseLayer` while having two parents, `conv1` and `conv2`, which in turn have a common parent `network_input`. This can be visualized as a simple directed acyclic graph.

And then there are the cases where you need to modify the model’s structure by inserting new layers within the existing connections. For such cases, your tree-based structure will help you identify the appropriate locations and correctly update the layer connections.

Here is a practical example of how to modify the model based on the structure generated:

```python
import lasagne
import theano
import theano.tensor as T
import numpy as np

def insert_dropout(tree, layer_name_to_find, p_dropout=0.2):
    for layer_info in tree.values():
        if layer_info['layer'].name == layer_name_to_find:
            layer_to_modify = layer_info['layer']
            for parent_layer in layer_info['parents']:
                dropout_layer = lasagne.layers.DropoutLayer(parent_layer, p=p_dropout)
                index_to_replace=tree[parent_layer]['children'].index(layer_to_modify)
                tree[parent_layer]['children'][index_to_replace]=dropout_layer
                tree[dropout_layer] = {'layer': dropout_layer, 'parents': [parent_layer], 'children': [layer_to_modify]}
                tree[layer_to_modify]['parents'] = [dropout_layer]

    return tree


input_var = T.tensor4('inputs')
network = lasagne.layers.InputLayer(shape=(None, 3, 32, 32), input_var=input_var, name='input_layer')
network = lasagne.layers.Conv2DLayer(network, num_filters=32, filter_size=3, name='conv1')
network = lasagne.layers.MaxPool2DLayer(network, pool_size=2, name='maxpool1')
network = lasagne.layers.Conv2DLayer(network, num_filters=64, filter_size=3, name='conv2')
network = lasagne.layers.MaxPool2DLayer(network, pool_size=2, name='maxpool2')
network = lasagne.layers.DenseLayer(lasagne.layers.flatten(network), num_units=256, name='dense1')
network = lasagne.layers.DenseLayer(network, num_units=10, name='dense2')


tree = build_model_tree(network)

updated_tree = insert_dropout(tree, 'dense1', p_dropout=0.5)
# After modifications are made it's important to recompute the network
# from the updated graph to be able to train it again.
# This is just an example. In a real-case situation the output layer
# must be extracted from the tree structure and passed into `get_output`.

output = lasagne.layers.get_output(network)

# Just to demonstrate that our new network is valid
input_data = np.random.rand(1,3,32,32).astype('float32')
f = theano.function([input_var], output)
f(input_data)

def print_tree(tree, root=None, indent=0):
    if root is None:
        for layer_info in tree.values():
          if not layer_info['parents']:
            print_tree(tree, layer_info['layer'], 0)
        return

    print('  ' * indent + f"- {root.__class__.__name__}")

    for child in tree[root]['children']:
        print_tree(tree, child, indent + 1)

print_tree(updated_tree)

```

Here, we can see the `insert_dropout` function adds a dropout layer before the dense layer that has the name `dense1`. The important part is that the links are updated in the tree. Please keep in mind that it's important to recreate the output layer based on our updated model to ensure the network is valid after our modifications.

As for further reading and gaining a deeper understanding, I'd strongly recommend looking into the documentation of Theano itself, in particular, the portion that describes its symbolic expression graphs. For a broader perspective on graph traversal algorithms, 'Introduction to Algorithms' by Thomas H. Cormen et al., offers a comprehensive resource. On the more practical side, you could also explore the source code of Lasagne itself; that’s a very effective way to understand the layer connections and the underlying mechanisms.

In short, traversing a Lasagne model as a tree isn’t built-in functionality but something that can be effectively implemented by understanding the layer connections and building an explicit tree structure based on the layer inputs and outputs. This will allow you to implement more advanced techniques as you expand in the deep learning domain. I hope this helps you get a solid start.
