Alright, let’s tackle this. I remember back when we were migrating a particularly hefty legacy app to Rails 6.1, the whole Turbo view update mechanism caused us quite a few headaches initially. It wasn't just a case of flipping a switch; you really had to understand the underlying mechanics to avoid weird rendering quirks. So, you're asking about how to ensure your view reflects changes correctly when using Turbo in Rails 6.1? Let's get into the nitty-gritty, because it's not just about refreshing the whole page anymore.

The core of the issue often boils down to Turbo's morphing behavior and how it interacts with server-side renders. In essence, Turbo tries to be smart. It doesn't do a full page reload; instead, it compares the new HTML received from the server with the existing HTML in the browser. It identifies differences and morphs the DOM to reflect those changes, targeting specific elements with the `id` attribute as the key. This sounds great, and mostly it is, but sometimes things need a bit of gentle nudging.

The first and arguably most common mistake I've seen is neglecting to wrap the parts of the view that are supposed to update in the right turbo frame. Turbo frames are crucial; they define the scope of the update. If your update target isn’t enclosed in a `<turbo-frame>` with the right id, Turbo might not recognize it, resulting in a partial or failed update. In my experience, inconsistent frame ids across different parts of the application often lead to unexpected behavior.

Here's a basic illustration with some code. Let’s assume you're building a simple task management app.

```erb
# app/views/tasks/_task.html.erb
<turbo-frame id="task_<%= task.id %>">
  <div class="task-item">
    <h3><%= task.title %></h3>
    <p><%= task.description %></p>
    <%= link_to "Edit", edit_task_path(task), data: { turbo_frame: "_top" } %>
  </div>
</turbo-frame>

# app/views/tasks/index.html.erb
<h1>Tasks</h1>
<div id="tasks">
  <%= render partial: 'tasks/task', collection: @tasks %>
</div>
```

This snippet demonstrates individual tasks wrapped in their own frames. Notice the `turbo-frame` with the unique `id` based on the `task.id`. This allows individual task updates without affecting the entire list. If you were to edit a task, your controller might look like this:

```ruby
# app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb
def update
  @task = Task.find(params[:id])
  if @task.update(task_params)
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html { redirect_to tasks_path, notice: 'Task was successfully updated.' }
      format.turbo_stream { render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.replace(@task, partial: 'tasks/task', locals: { task: @task }) }
    end
  else
    render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end

```

Here we are explicitly using `turbo_stream.replace` to send an update over the wire, targeting a specific element that uses the id `task_<%= @task.id %>` in the turbo-frame mentioned before. This is often a preferred method since it offers more direct control over how updates are handled. If you neglect the `format.turbo_stream` block, the browser will attempt a full page load, which is likely not the desired behaviour in a Turbo application.

Another common pitfall involves form submissions. If a form modifies the resource, and that resource is the content inside a turbo frame, make sure that your form submission responds with a turbo stream that replaces the old content with the updated one. Here's a snippet demonstrating that:

```erb
# app/views/tasks/_form.html.erb
<%= form_with(model: task, local: false) do |form| %>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :title %>
    <%= form.text_field :title %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :description %>
    <%= form.text_area :description %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= form.submit "Update Task" %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

This form will submit via AJAX due to `local: false`, so the update action in the controller needs to handle a `format.turbo_stream`.

```ruby
# app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb
def update
  @task = Task.find(params[:id])
    if @task.update(task_params)
      respond_to do |format|
        format.html { redirect_to tasks_path, notice: 'Task was successfully updated.' }
        format.turbo_stream { render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.replace(@task, partial: 'tasks/task', locals: { task: @task }) }
      end
    else
       format.html { render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity }
       format.turbo_stream { render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.replace(@task, partial: 'tasks/form', locals: { task: @task }), status: :unprocessable_entity}
    end
end
```

The key is that within our `update` action, after we’ve updated the task, we send a `turbo_stream.replace` that contains the newly rendered content for that task. If you didn’t send this `turbo_stream`, the page would not visually update, as the morphing behaviour from turbo requires an update event to trigger the DOM changes.

Finally, don't forget about Turbo streams beyond simple `replace` actions. You can append content, prepend content, remove elements entirely, or even trigger a variety of client-side JavaScript behaviours, offering a greater level of control. It's worth becoming familiar with the different options turbo stream provides, as this is where the real power of Turbo can be harnessed. For example:

```ruby
# Example of using append to add a new task to the list
  def create
    @task = Task.new(task_params)
    if @task.save
      respond_to do |format|
        format.html { redirect_to tasks_path, notice: 'Task was successfully created.' }
        format.turbo_stream { render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.append('tasks', partial: 'tasks/task', locals: { task: @task }) }
      end
    else
       format.html { render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity}
       format.turbo_stream { render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.replace(@task, partial: 'tasks/form', locals: { task: @task }), status: :unprocessable_entity}
    end
  end
```

Here, when creating a new task, rather than replacing any existing content, we are adding a new rendered task to the `tasks` div. These simple examples illustrate some of the key issues that I’ve encountered and the specific ways to overcome them.

For further understanding, I highly recommend delving into *Hotwire: Modern Rails Apps Without the Complexity* by David Heinemeier Hansson. This is considered the definitive resource on the topic. Also, the official Rails documentation on Turbo is crucial, and often offers insight into more complicated use-cases. While some may find it verbose, the detail provided is necessary for building robust and scalable applications using Turbo. Additionally, the “Turbo Handbook” from the Basecamp team is also a very useful resource. Understanding how Turbo interacts with the underlying web protocols and the JavaScript framework it leverages will give you a deeper appreciation of the mechanics at play. Finally, do take a look at the source code for the `turbo-rails` gem. That is always the single most authoritative source of knowledge.

In conclusion, the key to effectively using Turbo for view updates is a combination of well-defined turbo frames, careful server-side rendering with turbo streams and thorough understanding of how morphing works. It's not always obvious why something isn't updating correctly, but by systematically checking your frame ids, turbo stream responses, and form behaviour you will significantly reduce headaches and build an application with fast and smooth UI updates. Keep at it, and don't hesitate to experiment – that's the fastest path to mastery in my book.
