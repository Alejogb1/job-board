Alright, let's tackle this interesting challenge. It's a common scenario, and frankly, it's something I've spent a fair bit of time configuring across various projects over the years. Accessing `subdomain.domain.com` as `domain.com/subdomain` without resorting to a redirect is entirely feasible, and it primarily revolves around clever server configurations, typically with a reverse proxy. It's not about magical tricks, but rather about understanding how requests are routed and processed at the server level.

The core issue stems from how web servers and browsers interpret URLs. `subdomain.domain.com` is interpreted as a request for a specific host within the domain, while `domain.com/subdomain` is interpreted as a resource path within the root domain. To make them effectively interchangeable for the user, we need the server to interpret the path in `domain.com/subdomain` and forward that request to the server that would traditionally handle `subdomain.domain.com`. Let's break down how to do this in practice.

The key player here is a reverse proxy – tools like Nginx, Apache, or even dedicated reverse proxy solutions. I'll focus on Nginx, as that's what I've used most often in these configurations. Imagine you've got your primary application running on port 80 (or 443 for https) that’s handling `domain.com`, and the application intended for the subdomain, let's say a blog, running on a different port or perhaps even a completely separate server. The reverse proxy will act as the front-end, intercepting the requests, evaluating them, and forwarding them as needed to the appropriate back-end servers.

The general idea is to examine the URL path for the presence of `/subdomain`, and if it exists, proxy the request to the server designated for `subdomain.domain.com`. This proxying happens internally, so from the client perspective, nothing changes in the browser address bar. There isn't a redirect involved, it's pure internal routing. This not only maintains a clean URL structure, but it can also improve perceived performance, as there's no delay from server-initiated redirects.

Here's a basic Nginx configuration that demonstrates this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name domain.com;

    location /subdomain {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;  # Assuming subdomain app runs on 8080
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location / {
        # Your main application configuration here.
        # Typically, this would be a directive to proxy_pass to the main backend
        # Example:
        # proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

In this snippet, any request that comes in with the path starting with `/subdomain` gets forwarded to the server running on `127.0.0.1:8080`. The `proxy_set_header` directives are crucial for passing the original request’s details to the backend application, which is essential for many frameworks to correctly manage context. The last location block is a placeholder for what is configured to handle `domain.com` itself. This code assumes the backend of the main app is on port 3000 but can be adjusted accordingly.

Now, if the subdomain application also needs access to parts of the original domain, or has similar shared resources, you could use more granular path locations within the `/subdomain` block. For instance, you might have the blog application served at `/subdomain`, and an api at `/subdomain/api`. This level of path routing flexibility allows you to expose multiple backend applications or services under different path prefixes on a single domain.

For a more complex scenario where you might have multiple subdomains, each with their own respective applications, you can extend the configuration by adding more `location` blocks. Imagine you also want to access another application that was previously served at `api.domain.com` via `domain.com/api`. Here's an extension:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name domain.com;

    location /subdomain {
       proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;  # Example API backend on port 9000
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }


    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

Now, not only is `domain.com/subdomain` directed to the blog application running at port 8080, but `domain.com/api` will forward to a separate api application at port 9000, all without redirects and under the same primary domain.

One of the projects I had to tackle, involved a large e-commerce platform where each store had its separate subdomain, i.e., `store1.domain.com`, `store2.domain.com`, etc. Instead of trying to manage separate subdomains for each store, we ended up configuring Nginx to route based on `/store1`, `/store2`, etc., paths. This was a game changer for management and significantly simplified deployments, especially with a large number of stores. This also streamlined the user experience by keeping it all under a single domain entry. The configuration required careful planning and testing to ensure correct routing and resource access, but the end result was far more manageable and user-friendly.

For a more intricate situation, let’s imagine that we have more than one subdomain and the applications handling them need more specific paths. For example, the blog application for subdomain, requires a /posts and /users path under the /subdomain path, and api application under /api has an /auth and /data path. In this case you can use nested location blocks and even rewrite directives for more specific mapping and control:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name domain.com;

    location /subdomain {
       proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

       location /subdomain/posts {
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/posts;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
        location /subdomain/users {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/users;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }


    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        location /api/auth {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000/auth;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
         location /api/data {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000/data;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

This level of granularity lets you configure your routes exactly the way you need them, all served under the same domain entry.

For deeper knowledge and best practices on Nginx and reverse proxying, I highly recommend delving into the official Nginx documentation. Additionally, "High Performance Web Sites" by Steve Souders is a gold mine for optimization techniques related to web performance, including leveraging reverse proxies effectively. For a more in depth look at server configuration and management, "The Practice of System and Network Administration" by Thomas A. Limoncelli, Christina J. Hogan, and Strata R. Chalup is a very solid resource. These are resources I have found particularly helpful in my own journey.

In conclusion, accessing `subdomain.domain.com` as `domain.com/subdomain` without a redirect is entirely feasible using a reverse proxy setup. With careful configuration, it’s a powerful method for simplifying URL structures and managing complex deployments. It's about understanding how requests are routed and using tools like Nginx to manipulate that routing to achieve the desired outcome. This strategy has consistently proven to be invaluable for me when developing and maintaining large web applications.
