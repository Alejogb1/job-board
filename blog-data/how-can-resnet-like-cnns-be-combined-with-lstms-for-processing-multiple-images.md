Okay, let's tackle this one. I've actually had to implement something very similar a few years back while working on a project that involved video understanding – recognizing specific actions performed by individuals within a video stream. It wasn't as simple as just feeding a stack of images through the network; the temporal dimension and inter-frame dependencies were critical. We ended up using a ResNet as the core feature extractor for each frame, then integrating those feature maps with an LSTM to capture the sequence-based information.

The fundamental concept here is to treat multiple images as a *sequence*, rather than individual inputs to a static classifier. The ResNet portion, typically a pre-trained model on ImageNet or similar, acts as a powerful feature extractor. Its deep architecture enables it to learn hierarchical representations from pixel data. Then, the LSTM processes those learned feature representations over a temporal dimension, allowing it to model the relationships and changes over the image sequence. This is especially useful when you are looking for events, actions, or changes that only become apparent over time and across different frames, or images in your case.

Now, let's break down a possible implementation, focusing on the key components and architectural choices. Think of it as an evolution from a typical image classification task to a more complex sequence modeling problem. We'll use TensorFlow/Keras here for demonstration purposes, but the core concepts are adaptable to other deep learning frameworks.

**Component Breakdown**

1.  **ResNet Feature Extractor:** We'll use a pre-trained ResNet (ResNet50, for example) and remove its classification head, treating its output as feature maps. Crucially, we *do not fine-tune* this feature extractor initially. This avoids distorting the generalized visual features it has already learned from ImageNet. Later, you can experiment with fine-tuning on your particular image data, but a good starting point is to fix the pre-trained weights.

2.  **Feature Map Flattening and Projection:** The output from ResNet will typically be a three-dimensional tensor (height, width, channels). To feed it into the LSTM, which expects sequences of vectors, we need to flatten the spatial dimensions. Following this flattening, you typically apply a fully-connected or dense layer to project the high-dimensional feature space into a smaller dimension for better memory and processing efficiency.

3.  **LSTM Network:** The core sequence processing component. The LSTM takes in the projected feature vectors and outputs a hidden state, modeling temporal dependencies. The hidden state can be used for various downstream tasks.

4.  **Downstream Task Head:** This would depend on your specific objective. For instance, if it is classification, a final dense layer followed by a softmax or sigmoid activation is common. If you want to predict a sequence of events, a sequence of dense layers could be used, possibly using a time-distributed wrapper.

Here are three illustrative code snippets that show how this setup can be created.

**Code Snippet 1: Feature Extraction with Pre-Trained ResNet**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def build_resnet_feature_extractor(input_shape, projection_dim):
    base_model = ResNet50(include_top=False, weights='imagenet', input_shape=input_shape)

    # Freeze ResNet layers initially
    for layer in base_model.layers:
        layer.trainable = False

    x = base_model.output
    x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    x = Dense(projection_dim, activation='relu')(x) #Projection

    feature_extractor = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=x)
    return feature_extractor

# Example usage:
input_shape = (224, 224, 3)
projection_dim = 128
resnet_extractor = build_resnet_feature_extractor(input_shape, projection_dim)
# input shape is individual image shape.
```

This function loads a pre-trained ResNet50, removes its classification head and adds a global average pooling layer which summarizes the feature maps over spatial dimensions, then it is followed by a Dense layer to project it to a smaller dimension `projection_dim`. Note, this outputs a vector of shape `(projection_dim)`.

**Code Snippet 2: LSTM Integration and Input Preparation**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, TimeDistributed, Reshape
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np

def build_sequence_model(feature_extractor, sequence_length, projection_dim, lstm_units, num_classes):

    input_tensor = Input(shape=(sequence_length, *feature_extractor.input_shape[1:]))  # Correct shape
    # print(f"Input tensor: {input_tensor.shape}")


    # Time-distributed application of the feature extractor
    time_distributed_feature_output = TimeDistributed(feature_extractor)(input_tensor)
    # print(f"TD output shape: {time_distributed_feature_output.shape}")

    #LSTM sequence processing
    lstm_output = LSTM(lstm_units, return_sequences=False)(time_distributed_feature_output)
    # print(f"LSTM output shape: {lstm_output.shape}")

    output_layer = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(lstm_output) #Example, classification layer

    model = Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_layer)

    return model


# Example usage:
sequence_length = 10 #Number of images in a sequence
input_shape = (224, 224, 3) # Individual image input shape
projection_dim = 128 # Output dim of the feature extractor
lstm_units = 64 # Number of units in the LSTM layer.
num_classes = 10 #Number of output classes


sequence_model = build_sequence_model(resnet_extractor, sequence_length, projection_dim, lstm_units, num_classes)
# The input shape in sequence_model must include sequence length.
```

This function takes the `resnet_extractor` and adds a `TimeDistributed` layer, which applies it to every image in the sequence. The shape is transformed to `(batch_size, sequence_length, projection_dim)`. An LSTM processes the output, and finally, a classification layer for the final output.

**Code Snippet 3: Training Preparation and Example Training Data**

```python
import numpy as np

#Assume a batch_size of 32. We need batch_size sequences of images, each of length sequence_length, and each image is (224,224,3).
# The corresponding outputs are one hot encoded labels with num_classes
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 10
input_shape = (224, 224, 3)
num_classes = 10


X_train = np.random.rand(batch_size,sequence_length, *input_shape) # Dummy data: batch_size sequences of images
y_train = np.random.randint(0, num_classes, batch_size) #Dummy labels: batch_size output labels
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes = num_classes) #Convert to one hot encoded.


#Compile and train
sequence_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
sequence_model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

```

Here's an example demonstrating how to create the training data for this setup, including random data creation to run a simple fit. This showcases what the input data format needs to be (a batch of sequences of images).

**Important Considerations and Further Study**

*   **Data Preparation:** Consistent input size and normalization of image data is critical. Ensure all images in a sequence are of the same size.
*   **Sequence Length:** Choosing the appropriate sequence length depends on the specific temporal dynamics of your data.
*   **LSTM Variants:** You can experiment with other LSTM variants such as Bidirectional LSTMs to capture dependencies from both past and future frames, or GRUs, which are computationally more efficient.
*   **Attention Mechanisms:** Attention mechanisms can help focus on the most important parts of the input sequence or across the feature map. Consider exploring self-attention, temporal attention, or attention over feature maps. The transformer architecture uses self-attention extensively, which has shown to be very effective in capturing long-range dependencies.
*   **Fine-Tuning:** Once you have a reasonable baseline, try fine-tuning the ResNet layers along with the LSTM, using a smaller learning rate. This can be helpful in adapting the learned visual features to your specific domain.

For further understanding on these concepts, I would recommend:

*   **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This book provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation of deep learning, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks.
*   **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron:** This book offers practical implementation details of deep learning concepts, including working code samples.
*   **The original ResNet paper, "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by He et al.:** Provides the original architecture description and an understanding of skip connections.
*   **The original LSTM paper, "Long Short-Term Memory" by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber:** For understanding the theoretical foundations of LSTMs.

This approach, while not exhaustive, provides a solid foundation to combine ResNet-like CNNs with LSTMs for processing multiple images. Remember to experiment with different hyperparameters, and adapt the architecture to the specifics of your problem. Good luck!
