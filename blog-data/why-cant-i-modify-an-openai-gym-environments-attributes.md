Alright, let’s tackle this. From personal experience, I've seen quite a few folks stumble over this exact issue, and it usually boils down to a fundamental misunderstanding of how OpenAI Gym environments are structured, specifically their design for safety and reproducibility in reinforcement learning experiments.

The short answer is: you're encountering this problem because gym environments are designed to be *immutable* from the outside once they are instantiated. You shouldn't be directly altering their internal attributes. It's not a bug, but rather a feature built to ensure reliable simulation of the environment state across different runs. Think of it as a safety net, preventing unintended modifications from altering the environment's intended behavior.

Now, let’s break that down into more specific technical details.

Gym environments essentially operate as state machines. They are initialized with a particular configuration and then they transition from state to state based on actions given to them using the `step()` method. Key elements like the reward function, observation space, and the internal dynamics of the environment are all defined during setup, usually in the environment’s constructor. The primary design principle is to ensure that if you pass in the same initial state and perform the same actions, the state transitions and the resulting rewards should be identical, regardless of how many times you run it, assuming deterministic environments.

This principle of reproducibility is crucial for reinforcement learning. We’re often running experiments where it is paramount to accurately trace down what modifications and hyper parameters led to better, or worse performance. Changing attributes of the environment on the fly makes it nearly impossible to have such control.

So why not just allow modifications? Well, consider a scenario where you inadvertently change a crucial attribute, such as the reward function during the course of your learning experiment. You'd effectively be training an agent in a moving target, introducing inconsistencies and invalidating the results. It would also make debugging an absolute nightmare. Imagine trying to isolate the source of a problem when the environment itself has undergone undocumented transformations mid-experiment. This is precisely the kind of headache that the immutability design of Gym seeks to prevent.

Now, let’s look at how to work *with* the Gym structure rather than against it. You have several viable alternatives to achieve what you likely desire, and these techniques align more appropriately with the intent behind Gym’s design.

Firstly, you can *extend* or *wrap* a given Gym environment. This allows you to customize its behavior without directly modifying its core attributes. This is my go-to solution in most situations where I need to change things up. This is where you create a new class that inherits from the base environment and overwrites only the methods you need. You can either overwrite methods like `step`, `reset`, or `render` or add your own logic around them.

Here's an example illustrating that, using a basic environment:

```python
import gym
import numpy as np

class ModifiedCartPoleEnv(gym.Wrapper):
    def __init__(self, env):
       super().__init__(env)
       self.custom_reward_scale = 1.5 # custom reward scale

    def step(self, action):
        observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = self.env.step(action)
        reward *= self.custom_reward_scale # apply a custom reward scaling
        return observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info

# Original Environment
env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
observation = env.reset(seed=42)[0] # Resetting with a seed to ensure consistency
modified_env = ModifiedCartPoleEnv(env) # Creating a modified environment
modified_observation = modified_env.reset(seed=42)[0]

action = modified_env.action_space.sample()
observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = modified_env.step(action)

print(f"Original Reward: {reward/modified_env.custom_reward_scale}") # Print out the original reward

```

In this example, we’ve wrapped the original cartpole environment inside the `ModifiedCartPoleEnv` class. We haven’t changed the underlying mechanics of the cartpole itself but instead, we have modified the reward given during every step. This ensures we are not changing the base `CartPole-v1` behavior, but are building on top of it, preserving the intended behaviour and our ability to replicate our results.

Secondly, you can develop a custom environment entirely from scratch. If the modifications required are extensive and cannot be easily wrapped around existing environments, it's time to create a custom gym environment. This allows a huge degree of flexibility, giving full control over how the environment functions. To implement such an environment, you inherit from `gym.Env` and override essential methods. For example:

```python
import gym
from gym import spaces
import numpy as np

class CustomEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=0, high=10, shape=(2,), dtype=np.float32) # Example observation space
        self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(2) # Example action space
        self.state = self.reset()[0] # Reset the state

    def step(self, action):
        if action == 0:
            self.state = self.state - np.array([0.1, 0.1], dtype=np.float32)
        else:
            self.state = self.state + np.array([0.2,0.2], dtype=np.float32)

        reward = np.sum(self.state)
        terminated = np.sum(self.state) > 15
        truncated = False # Example
        info = {}
        return self.state, reward, terminated, truncated, info

    def reset(self, seed=None, options=None):
        super().reset(seed=seed)
        self.state = np.array([5, 5], dtype=np.float32)
        return self.state, {}
```

In this example, we defined a simple environment that takes a discrete action and alters its internal state accordingly. The `reset` method returns the initial state, and the `step` method executes an action and moves to the next state. This method, while requiring more setup, provides complete freedom to design and control the environment's behaviour.

Thirdly, if you only need to modify aspects like random seeds or initial conditions, you can often achieve this through environment arguments or by setting seeds before each `reset()`. Gym environments usually accept `seed` parameters to allow for reproducible random events, which can be crucial when debugging and analyzing results across multiple runs. It also allows for modifying the initial state of the environment.

```python
import gym
import numpy as np

env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")

# Setting the initial state for the environment
env.reset(seed=42)
state_before_reset = env._get_obs()
print("initial state before reset : ", state_before_reset)

# Reset with a different seed:
env.reset(seed=123)
state_after_reset = env._get_obs()
print("initial state after reset : ", state_after_reset)

# Running some steps
action = env.action_space.sample()
state_1, reward_1, terminated_1, truncated_1, info_1 = env.step(action)
action = env.action_space.sample()
state_2, reward_2, terminated_2, truncated_2, info_2 = env.step(action)

print("State after one step: ", state_1)
print("State after another step:", state_2)
```
This last example demonstrates how we are not directly modifying the environment properties, but instead, through the use of seeds, we modify its behaviour. As the initial states will be different due to different seeds, you can affect the environment properties without making any direct modifications.

In summary, Gym environments are not designed to be modified on the fly. This is a conscious decision to support reproducibility and stability in reinforcement learning experiments. Trying to change the attributes directly will not work and goes against the intended structure. Instead, use the available tools of wrapper classes, custom classes or environment seeding. These alternatives will provide all the customizability and behaviour modification required in most situations, while respecting the design principles of gym environments.

For further reading, I highly recommend delving into "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton and Barto, which goes into the theoretical foundations of RL and the importance of environmental modelling. You should also look into the official OpenAI Gym documentation which explains the API design choices. Understanding the underlying design of such tools will improve your capacity to work with them more effectively. Another excellent resource is the "Stable Baselines3" documentation, which has a good section on creating custom environments. These materials should provide a solid foundation for working efficiently with OpenAI Gym and help you tackle most reinforcement learning related problems.
