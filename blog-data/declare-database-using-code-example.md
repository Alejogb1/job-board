Okay so like you wanna declare a database using code right been there done that many times So lets get this straight it's not about just waving your hands and poof a database appears We're talking actual code here not some magic trick

First off what kind of database are we talking about This changes everything You could be dealing with a relational database like PostgreSQL MySQL or something more document oriented like MongoDB or even a graph database like Neo4j And there are in-memory databases too like Redis for super fast operations So the code and the way you interact will differ greatly depending on what you wanna do

Now lets assume for now that you're after a basic relational database setup using Python since thats like the bread and butter of a lot of the stuff I have messed with This is going to use the SQL Alchemy library it's like a really popular ORM Object Relational Mapper that makes life a lot easier than writing raw SQL all the time Trust me on that I've spent too much of my time debugging messed up SQL queries in the past so yeah SQLAlchemy is a good tool

So here's the basic gist of what that looks like

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base, sessionmaker

# Define the database connection URL
# This assumes you have a PostgreSQL database locally
# You can change this to your database details of course
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your_database"

# Create the engine
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

# Declare a base class for our ORM models
Base = declarative_base()

# Define a simple user model
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users" # this is the table name in the database

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String)

# Create all tables defined in our models this is important or nothing happens
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

# Create a session to interact with the database
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

# Function to create a user in db
def create_new_user(username_given, email_given):
    session = SessionLocal()
    user = User(username=username_given, email=email_given)
    session.add(user)
    session.commit()
    session.close()

# Example Usage
create_new_user("stack_overflow_user", "test@email.com")
print("user created")
```

So basically what this does it defines the connection parameters to your database using SQLAlchemy’s create\_engine function and creates an engine object That's like the main gateway to your database It also defines what your table is gonna look like using a declarative base and a model class called User In this case we have a table called users which has three columns id username and email And yeah we create a session and the create\_new\_user just adds an user to the db easy peasy right

This snippet sets up your database using code and in a way that you could scale it up later to use in a real application

Now remember that DATABASE\_URL thing You gotta adjust that to match your database credentials You’ll need to create a database first using your database management system tools like pgAdmin for Postgres or MySQL Workbench for MySQL This script assumes you have a database already you know what I mean

Now lets dive into a more complex structure like NoSQL databases specifically MongoDB because that's what I am pretty familiar with So you don't need to deal with tables and rows you have collections and documents instead Its more flexible but it can make things harder if you're not used to it

Here’s the Python code using PyMongo its like the go to library to interact with MongoDB

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

# MongoDB connection details
# Adjust these as needed
MONGODB_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
DATABASE_NAME = "my_database" # make sure you have a database with this name

# Create a MongoDB client
client = MongoClient(MONGODB_URI)

# Get the database
db = client[DATABASE_NAME]

# Define a new document or collection
def create_new_user(username_given, email_given):
    users_collection = db.users #if it doesn't exist pymongo creates it on the fly
    user_data = {
        "username": username_given,
        "email": email_given
    }
    users_collection.insert_one(user_data)

# Example usage
create_new_user("another_stack_user", "another@email.com")
print("user document created")

```

This code connects to your MongoDB instance and creates a new collection called users and inserts a document into it A collection is like a table but for documents and a document its a JSON-like object You don’t need to define a schema like in a relational database You just throw your data in there which is both a blessing and a curse depends on the project you know

And this also assumes you have MongoDB running locally you know the drill Make sure your mongo db server is running before firing this script else it’s going to crash big time And also that you created a database with the same name as specified in the code or change it

Finally lets say you need a more specialized database like a graph database because you are modelling relationships between data that is when neo4j comes in

Here is a little example code using Neo4j’s Python driver

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# Neo4j connection details
# Adjust these to your environment
URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"
USERNAME = "neo4j"
PASSWORD = "your_password"

# Function to create nodes and relationships in the graph
def create_graph(user1_username, user2_username):
    driver = GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=(USERNAME, PASSWORD))
    with driver.session() as session:
        session.execute_write(_create_nodes_and_relationships, user1_username, user2_username)

    driver.close()

def _create_nodes_and_relationships(tx, user1_username, user2_username):
    # Create user nodes
    tx.run("CREATE (u1:User {username: $username1})", username1=user1_username)
    tx.run("CREATE (u2:User {username: $username2})", username2=user2_username)

    # Create the relationship between the user nodes this shows that user1 follows user2
    tx.run("MATCH (u1:User {username: $username1}), (u2:User {username: $username2})"
          "CREATE (u1)-[:FOLLOWS]->(u2)", username1=user1_username, username2=user2_username)

# Example Usage
create_graph("user_1", "user_2")
print("graph data created")
```

This code creates two user nodes and establishes a relationship between them It shows how you can create nodes and relationships in Neo4j The `CREATE` command creates nodes and `MATCH` and `CREATE` establish a relationship between them

For a more in depth understanding on this I would recommend the following resources: "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann is a great overall book for anyone dealing with databases at scale it has a little bit of everything from relational to noSQL and everything in between Its a hefty read but worth it

For a more specific approach SQL Alchemy documentation is always great and for MongoDB the official MongoDB docs are the best for PyMongo read up on that I also found the book "MongoDB The definitive Guide" by Kristina Chodorow pretty useful it explains very well how MongoDB actually works

And if you are into graph databases "Graph Databases" by Ian Robinson is a must it explains all the underlying concepts that you need to get into Graph databases and specifically Neo4j

So yeah its not just a matter of copy pasting code but understanding the code behind what you're trying to achieve database design and architecture it is not for the faint of heart but if you do it right you can achieve scalable and robust systems and databases It is quite a deep rabbit hole but once you learn the basics it becomes a whole lot easier its like riding a bike… a very complicated high tech bike with a lot of gears and some rockets attached but still a bike you know what I mean?

Okay I am out have fun coding those databases
