Alright, let's tackle this. It's a situation I’ve found myself in countless times, especially when juggling multi-tenant environments or migrating between services. Redirecting requests using alternate names in aws, whether for load balancing, service discovery, or simple vanity URLs, is actually quite common and has a few effective approaches, each with its own nuances. It’s more than just a simple configuration switch; understanding the underlying mechanics is crucial for robust implementation.

When we talk about “alternate names,” we're generally referring to domain names or host headers that differ from the primary or canonical name associated with a service. These might be subdomains, entirely different domain names pointing to the same application, or even just aliases within your internal network. In aws, we have multiple tools that can handle this redirection process. I'll walk through the most practical ones from my own experiences, starting with the fundamental components.

The primary workhorses for redirection in aws often boil down to two main services: elastic load balancing (elb) and route 53. elb comes in different flavors – application load balancer (alb), network load balancer (nlb), and classic load balancer (clb), with alb being the most relevant for name-based routing. route 53, being the dns service, handles the mapping between domain names and your aws resources.

Let's first consider the case with an alb. Application load balancers work by inspecting the host header of incoming http or https requests. Based on the value of the host header, it can then route the request to the appropriate target group, which might consist of ec2 instances, containers, or lambda functions. Configuring this involves defining listener rules within your alb.

Here's how you might set up a scenario: imagine we have a main application accessible through `www.example.com`, and we also want to access it using the alias `api.example.net`.

```python
# example alb listener rule configuration (simplified) - pseudocode
import boto3

elbv2 = boto3.client('elbv2')

listener_arn = 'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:listener/app/my-alb/50dc6c4571b38c78/f293a024f5e8002a'
target_group_arn = 'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-target-group/24a49735b3e2e0c1'

# rule for the primary domain
response_www = elbv2.create_rule(
    ListenerArn=listener_arn,
    Priority=1,
    Conditions=[
        {
            'Field': 'host-header',
            'Values': ['www.example.com']
        },
    ],
    Actions=[
        {
            'Type': 'forward',
            'TargetGroupArn': target_group_arn
        },
    ]
)

# rule for the alternate domain
response_api = elbv2.create_rule(
    ListenerArn=listener_arn,
    Priority=2,
    Conditions=[
        {
            'Field': 'host-header',
            'Values': ['api.example.net']
        },
    ],
        Actions=[
        {
            'Type': 'forward',
            'TargetGroupArn': target_group_arn
        },
    ]
)

print(f"Rule for www.example.com created with arn: {response_www['Rules'][0]['RuleArn']}")
print(f"Rule for api.example.net created with arn: {response_api['Rules'][0]['RuleArn']}")

```

In the above pseudocode, we create two listener rules. The first one checks if the `host-header` equals `www.example.com`, and if it does, it forwards the request to our target group. The second does the same but checks for `api.example.net`. Both essentially point to the same backend resources.

Now, let’s think about dns. Within route 53, you’d have your hosted zone for `example.com`, and you'd have an ‘a’ record or an alias record pointing `www.example.com` to the alb. Additionally, you’d set up another hosted zone for `example.net`, and also have an ‘a’ record or an alias record pointing `api.example.net` to the exact same alb endpoint. It's about aligning the dns configuration with the load balancer's routing rules. I often recommend using alias records as they handle changes to the alb’s ip addresses more transparently than a straight ‘a’ record.

Often, you might not be working with entirely different domain names but rather subdomains or internal aliases. For example, within a microservices environment, you might want `service-a.internal.example.com` and `service-b.internal.example.com` to point to different target groups behind the same alb. This is handled similarly with listener rules, but with different host header values and target group arns.

```python
# example alb listener rule configuration for internal subdomains (simplified)
import boto3

elbv2 = boto3.client('elbv2')

listener_arn = 'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:listener/app/my-alb/50dc6c4571b38c78/f293a024f5e8002a'
target_group_a_arn = 'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/service-a-tg/24a49735b3e2e0c1'
target_group_b_arn = 'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/service-b-tg/98b32d5f48cf93a7'

# rule for service-a.internal.example.com
response_service_a = elbv2.create_rule(
    ListenerArn=listener_arn,
    Priority=1,
    Conditions=[
        {
            'Field': 'host-header',
            'Values': ['service-a.internal.example.com']
        },
    ],
    Actions=[
        {
            'Type': 'forward',
            'TargetGroupArn': target_group_a_arn
        },
    ]
)

# rule for service-b.internal.example.com
response_service_b = elbv2.create_rule(
    ListenerArn=listener_arn,
    Priority=2,
    Conditions=[
        {
            'Field': 'host-header',
            'Values': ['service-b.internal.example.com']
        },
    ],
    Actions=[
        {
            'Type': 'forward',
            'TargetGroupArn': target_group_b_arn
        },
    ]
)

print(f"Rule for service-a created with arn: {response_service_a['Rules'][0]['RuleArn']}")
print(f"Rule for service-b created with arn: {response_service_b['Rules'][0]['RuleArn']}")

```

This example illustrates how, within the same listener, different rules handle incoming requests to unique internal subdomains. In this scenario, you'd have a hosted zone for `internal.example.com` in route 53, with ‘a’ or alias records pointing each subdomain to the load balancer.

There’s another use case: sometimes you might want to redirect users from an old domain to a new one. While this can be done via route 53 with some limitations, the preferable way is often to handle it at the alb or an edge service such as cloudfront. For example, you might want users coming to `old.example.com` to be redirected to `new.example.com`. Here's how it might work within an alb, using a redirect action.

```python
# example alb listener rule configuration for redirecting old domain
import boto3

elbv2 = boto3.client('elbv2')

listener_arn = 'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:listener/app/my-alb/50dc6c4571b38c78/f293a024f5e8002a'

# rule for old.example.com redirect
response_redirect = elbv2.create_rule(
    ListenerArn=listener_arn,
    Priority=1,
    Conditions=[
        {
            'Field': 'host-header',
            'Values': ['old.example.com']
        },
    ],
    Actions=[
        {
            'Type': 'redirect',
            'RedirectConfig': {
                'Protocol': 'HTTPS', # or 'HTTP' if needed
                'Host': 'new.example.com',
                'Port': '443', # if https, might be 80 if http
                'StatusCode': 'HTTP_301' # or 'HTTP_302' based on your needs
             }
         },
    ]
)

print(f"Rule for old.example.com redirect created with arn: {response_redirect['Rules'][0]['RuleArn']}")

```

The above setup forwards requests to `old.example.com` to the new domain, while keeping the path and query params, using a http 301 redirect which indicates the moved is permanent.

As for further reading on these topics, I'd recommend looking into "aws certified solutions architect - associate study guide" by ben piper and david clark; it provides in depth insight on aws infrastructure and networking. In addition, the aws documentation itself on elb, specifically alb routing rules and route 53, is indispensable and usually kept up to date with any changes. For more nuanced control over routing, especially in complex applications, you should look into service mesh implementations and dns-based service discovery.

In summary, redirecting using alternate names involves a combination of dns configuration using route 53, and load balancing strategies with elastic load balancers, specifically using the 'host-header' condition and the redirect action. Getting this right can significantly simplify application management and improve user experience. The devil’s in the details, of course, and there are many ways to skin this cat, but these core principles and examples should get you started on a solid foundation.
