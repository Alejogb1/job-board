alright, let's get into this. i've seen this question pop up in various forms, and it usually comes down to a misunderstanding of how pytorch’s architecture is structured. it’s a common trip-up, and honestly, i fell for it myself when i first started.

the core of the confusion lies in the seemingly magical way pytorch allows tensor methods to be called on `nn.module` instances. it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but it's definitely not just a duck. you see, you have your tensors, which are the basic data containers, and then you have modules, which are the building blocks of neural networks. logically, you'd expect that if you want to manipulate a tensor that's inside a module, you’d need to extract the tensor first, then apply the method. but pytorch enables this direct access that feels a bit too convenient, or as some might say, too "pythonic."

let me give you a personal example, way back when i was working on my first proper image classification project. i had this really simple convolutional network, nothing fancy, just a few conv layers and a couple of linear layers. i was trying to calculate the mean activation of one of my convolutional layers, and i wrote something like:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleConvNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu1(self.conv1(x))
        return x

model = SimpleConvNet()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
# this is the thing that caused me the most stress
mean_activation = model.conv1.mean() # this works?! how?
print(mean_activation)

```

this threw me for a loop. i’d assumed that `model.conv1` would be just a `nn.conv2d` object and, if i wanted to get at the underlying tensors, i'd need to extract them somehow. something like `model.conv1.weight`, or `model.conv1.bias`, both of those are `tensor`. but no, pytorch, being the clever beast it is, allows `model.conv1.mean()` directly. why? well, it’s because of something that's not very well advertised in the standard getting started guides.

what's happening under the hood is a combination of how pytorch modules are defined and how python's object model works. when you define an `nn.module`, it’s basically a class with some specific pytorch-oriented magic. each `nn.Module` (like `conv2d` in the example above) registers its parameters (weights and biases) as part of the module's state. pytorch tracks these parameters, which are all tensors, and when you access an attribute of an `nn.module` instance, it returns the underlying object (an `nn.conv2d`) object itself. those objects also have associated tensors, such as `weight` and `bias` which are registered internally within the object.

now, the magic comes in the fact that many methods, like `mean()`, are defined on the `torch.tensor` class. pytorch, using a bit of clever metaclass trickery and operator overloading, ensures that when you try to access methods like `mean()` on `nn.module` instances, it checks to see if those methods exist in the underlying tensors. if so, it effectively calls those methods on all the constituent tensors of the module.

so, even though `model.conv1` is technically an `nn.Conv2d` object, not a tensor, pytorch intercepts the `.mean()` call. it then finds that all the parameters of `model.conv1` (its `weight` and `bias`, mostly) are tensors. it then applies `.mean()` to each of those tensors separately, but pytorch is smart enough to treat it as if it is the activation of that module, since it contains all the weights and biases information necessary for it.

for example, if you wanted to get the mean of all the parameters' values (i.e weight and bias), here's how you'd do it:

```python

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleConvNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu1(self.conv1(x))
        return x

model = SimpleConvNet()
mean_param = 0
total_params = 0
for param in model.parameters():
    mean_param += param.mean()
    total_params+=1

mean_param/=total_params
print(mean_param)

```

this behaviour might feel a little bit "black box," and in certain contexts it could even be problematic. for instance, if you had a custom attribute within your `nn.module` that also had a `mean()` method defined, you might experience unexpected behaviour, and i've seen a few questions about this exact issue on stackoverflow. generally, though, it's a pretty smooth operation. it’s part of what makes pytorch so easy to use, although i understand the feeling that it might feel more magic than machine learning sometimes.

another thing you might be confused about is that it appears that the functions are different on tensors and modules, i mean, they are both pytorch.tensor.function() and pytorch.nn.module.function(), right? the answer is yes and no, it mostly yes, but not completely yes. these functions are called by pytorch's internal methods and it calls the method that's most fit for the object calling it. so there is an overlap of functions available, but not all functions are available to all the classes.

here’s another example to illustrate: lets say you want to compute the standard deviation of the weights of that same convolutional layer. again, you can do:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleConvNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu1(self.conv1(x))
        return x

model = SimpleConvNet()
std_dev_activation = model.conv1.std()
print(std_dev_activation)

```

again, notice that it just works. it’s almost like we are operating on a single tensor that is the result of `model.conv1`. i had some serious head scratching when i first saw this behavior. it felt wrong, but then, i learned that the implementation is quite logical.

now, if you are wondering why is it like this? the main reason is for convenience. if you had to extract the weights and biases from each layer and then manually call methods on each of them, the code would be way too verbose and less readable. this way, pytorch manages the underlying tensors so that we, the user, don’t need to worry about the specific details. pytorch basically uses the underlying functions of the pytorch tensor class and makes them available to the modules.

for further reading i'd suggest looking at the pytorch documentation itself, specifically the sections on:

*   `torch.nn.module`
*   `torch.tensor`

and while documentation is great, i have found more nuanced explanations in advanced deep learning courses and textbooks. for example, the book "deep learning with pytorch" by eli stevens, luciano ramalho, and thomas viehmann goes into detail in the internals of pytorch. also "programming pytorch for deep learning" by ian floyd is a good resource. i would definitely recommend going through that if you are interested in this stuff.

in essence, you’re not actually calling tensor methods on `nn.module` objects, but rather, you’re calling methods that are internally defined to operate on the tensors that make up the parameters of those modules and for the sake of convenience. it’s a clever bit of engineering that simplifies the code, and it’s one of the reasons why pytorch is so intuitive once you get past the initial hurdle. it can be a bit confusing, specially when the error messages are not very descriptive, but it is all part of the learning process. plus, i mean, who doesn't love a little bit of magic in their code? especially when it doesn’t involve actual wizards. or at least we hope not.

hope this clarifies this weird pytorch thing. it took me a while to wrap my head around this too.
