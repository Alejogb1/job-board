Okay, let's tackle this. Thinking back to a project involving predicting energy consumption for a large industrial facility several years ago, I distinctly remember the struggles we faced with choosing the "right" activation functions for our hidden layers. It wasn’t just about raw performance; stability and convergence played massive roles, too. So, diving into which activation function *best* suits hidden layers in regression neural networks, it’s less about a single perfect answer and more about a nuanced understanding of trade-offs.

When you’re dealing with regression, you’re generally aiming to predict a continuous output – a numerical value, rather than a class or category. This immediately shifts our perspective from activation functions often used in classification, like sigmoid or softmax. These functions tend to squash outputs into specific ranges, and that's counterproductive when we need a full, unrestricted range. Hidden layers, the layers between your input and output, are primarily responsible for learning complex non-linear relationships in your data. Thus, selecting activation functions that facilitate this is key.

The most common, and often a very solid starting point, is the **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** family of functions. Now, ReLU itself is incredibly simple: `f(x) = max(0, x)`. Below zero, the output is zero; above, it's the input value. This simplicity is, paradoxically, one of its strengths. It’s computationally cheap, and it alleviates the vanishing gradient problem (a massive headache with earlier activation functions, as I painfully remember from older projects). However, ReLU isn’t perfect. Its "dead neuron" problem where neurons can get stuck outputting zeros if they never receive a positive input is a consideration. This is often handled by using variants.

Let’s illustrate with some python code:

```python
import numpy as np

def relu(x):
  return np.maximum(0, x)

# Example usage
x = np.array([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2])
output = relu(x)
print(f"ReLU output for {x}: {output}")

```

As you can see, anything below zero gets floored to zero, while positive values pass through. The simplicity, combined with efficiency, makes it a compelling choice.

To address the dead neuron issue, we often employ variants like **Leaky ReLU** or **parametric ReLU (PReLU)**. Leaky ReLU introduces a small, non-zero slope for negative inputs: `f(x) = ax if x < 0 else x` where `a` is a small constant (e.g., 0.01). PReLU takes it a step further by making `a` a learnable parameter. This avoids the hard zero output for negative inputs, giving the network a chance to recover if neurons end up in the negative range.

Let’s see Leaky ReLU in action with code:

```python
def leaky_relu(x, alpha=0.01):
    return np.where(x > 0, x, alpha * x)

# Example Usage:
x = np.array([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2])
output = leaky_relu(x)
print(f"Leaky ReLU output for {x}: {output}")

```

The result shows how the negative values aren’t flattened to zero, allowing information to propagate. The choice between Leaky ReLU and PReLU comes down to the complexity we're willing to introduce into our model; both have served me well in the past, though I’ve found that the extra learnable parameter in PReLU can be beneficial for larger, more complex models, at the cost of some training overhead.

Another contender, less common but certainly worth considering (and I’ve occasionally used with success), is **tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**. It outputs values between -1 and 1. While it suffers from the vanishing gradient problem, the recent advancements in batch normalization and proper weight initialization largely alleviate these concerns. Sometimes, the mean-centering effect of tanh can be beneficial in regression problems, though its performance varies significantly depending on your data and model architecture. While it doesn’t resolve the issues as well as ReLU’s family, It's important to recognize, tanh, and in some cases sigmoid, can be effective for particular tasks if you have a deep network with very good initialization and are very careful about your learning rate and other training strategies

Here's a basic tanh example:

```python
def tanh(x):
   return np.tanh(x)

# Example usage
x = np.array([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2])
output = tanh(x)
print(f"Tanh output for {x}: {output}")

```

It is crucial to understand that the choice isn’t just about which activation function *generally* performs best. It’s deeply intertwined with your data, the specific network architecture, and your training strategy. No matter the activation function, we also need proper weight initialization, batch normalization, and a robust optimization algorithm such as Adam or RMSProp to get good results.

My usual workflow, gleaned from years of experience, involves starting with ReLU (or a variant, particularly Leaky ReLU), then experimenting with PReLU if I am dealing with a complex network. Tanh can be useful on particular problems that might require the output to be in a mean-centered space. I almost never use sigmoid or softmax for hidden layers in regression due to the limited output range. It is also worthwhile to track the activation function usage, by inspecting histograms of neuron activations, if you notice dead neurons (all outputs tending to zero) or neurons with a lot of saturated (near 1 or -1) outputs. This can help you to adjust your learning rate, batch size, or choice of activation function.

As for deeper technical resources, I highly recommend reviewing the original papers introducing each activation function. For ReLU, the seminal work is "Deep sparse rectifier neural networks" by Xavier Glorot, Antoine Bordes, and Yoshua Bengio. For Leaky ReLU, consult "Rectifier Nonlinearities Improve Neural Network Acoustic Models" by Andrew L. Maas et al. And, for an in-depth analysis of activation functions, I suggest reading the book "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville – it's a fantastic resource for anyone serious about neural networks.

In closing, there's no single activation function that's universally “best” for hidden layers in regression networks. It's a process of experimentation, observation, and careful tuning, with ReLU (or a variant) often being the most reliable starting point. Remember to consider your specific requirements and always keep an eye on how the model behaves during training, and don’t be afraid to pivot if needed.
