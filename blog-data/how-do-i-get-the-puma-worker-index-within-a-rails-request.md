Alright, let’s tackle this. I've actually run into this exact scenario more than a few times, particularly when dealing with background job processing tied to specific application instances and needing to ensure resource locality. Getting the puma worker index within a rails request isn't immediately obvious, but it's definitely doable with a few different approaches. The trick is understanding how puma sets up its environment and how that information can be accessed within a rails context.

Essentially, puma utilizes process forking to create multiple worker processes from a single master process. Each of these worker processes handle incoming web requests, and sometimes, we need to know which specific worker is currently handling a request. This can be essential for tasks like targeted caching, distributed locks, or worker-specific data management.

The most straightforward method involves accessing puma’s environment variables, which are set when each worker is spawned. Puma exposes an environment variable named `PUMA_WORKER_ID`. This variable contains the zero-based index of the current worker. You can access this variable within your rails application using the standard `ENV` object. Let's break down the code:

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  private

  def puma_worker_index
    ENV['PUMA_WORKER_ID']&.to_i
  end
end

# app/controllers/some_controller.rb
class SomeController < ApplicationController
  def index
    worker_id = puma_worker_index
    if worker_id
        Rails.logger.info "Request handled by Puma worker: #{worker_id}"
        render plain: "This request was processed by Puma worker #{worker_id}."
    else
        Rails.logger.warn "Puma worker ID not found."
        render plain: "Puma worker ID not found."
    end
  end
end
```

In this initial example, we’ve added a `puma_worker_index` private method to `ApplicationController`. This method accesses the `PUMA_WORKER_ID` environment variable, converting it to an integer, or returning `nil` if the environment variable isn’t present. A controller action within `SomeController` shows how to retrieve and use the index, logging it and using it in the view output. This approach is simple, reliable, and typically sufficient for most scenarios. However, there are times when you'd need more control or want to abstract away the environment lookup.

Now, what if you need this information frequently across your application or want to encapsulate this process? A better practice might involve a custom middleware. Here's an example of how to implement that:

```ruby
# lib/middleware/puma_worker_id_middleware.rb
class PumaWorkerIdMiddleware
  def initialize(app)
    @app = app
  end

  def call(env)
    worker_id = ENV['PUMA_WORKER_ID']&.to_i
    env['puma.worker_id'] = worker_id if worker_id
    @app.call(env)
  end
end

# config/application.rb
module YourAppName
  class Application < Rails::Application
      # ...
      config.middleware.use PumaWorkerIdMiddleware
      # ...
  end
end

# app/controllers/some_controller.rb
class SomeController < ApplicationController
  def index
      worker_id = request.env['puma.worker_id']
      if worker_id
          Rails.logger.info "Request handled by Puma worker (middleware): #{worker_id}"
          render plain: "This request was processed by Puma worker (middleware) #{worker_id}."
      else
          Rails.logger.warn "Puma worker ID not found (middleware)."
          render plain: "Puma worker ID not found (middleware)."
      end
  end
end
```

Here, we’ve created a custom middleware, `PumaWorkerIdMiddleware`, that extracts the worker id from the environment and places it into the `env` hash under `puma.worker_id`. This way, you avoid directly interacting with `ENV` everywhere in your application, and access it through `request.env`, which is a more idiomatic way to access request-specific information in rails. We then insert the middleware into the request processing chain within `config/application.rb`. The controller now accesses the value via `request.env`.

This second approach has a few advantages: it is more organized, easier to test, and keeps logic contained in one place. This approach also makes it slightly easier to abstract away the details of how the index is obtained, if needed.

Sometimes, for more advanced use cases, you might even want to inject the worker id into the parameters of a request. This might be helpful when debugging or logging different processes, where the request parameter can be easily included into logging messages. Here's how that might work:

```ruby
# lib/middleware/puma_worker_param_middleware.rb
class PumaWorkerParamMiddleware
    def initialize(app)
      @app = app
    end

    def call(env)
      worker_id = ENV['PUMA_WORKER_ID']&.to_i
      if worker_id
        env['action_dispatch.request.request_parameters'] = env['action_dispatch.request.request_parameters'] || {}
        env['action_dispatch.request.request_parameters']['puma_worker'] = worker_id
      end
      @app.call(env)
    end
  end

# config/application.rb
module YourAppName
  class Application < Rails::Application
      # ...
      config.middleware.use PumaWorkerParamMiddleware
      # ...
  end
end

# app/controllers/some_controller.rb
class SomeController < ApplicationController
    def index
        worker_id = params[:puma_worker]
        if worker_id
            Rails.logger.info "Request handled by Puma worker (parameter): #{worker_id}"
            render plain: "This request was processed by Puma worker (parameter) #{worker_id}."
        else
            Rails.logger.warn "Puma worker ID not found (parameter)."
            render plain: "Puma worker ID not found (parameter)."
        end
    end
end
```

In this final snippet, the middleware places the worker id directly into the `action_dispatch.request.request_parameters` hash, making it available as a standard request parameter. This approach makes it simple to log the worker id or utilize it in other parts of your application that consume parameters.

As far as resources go, I'd recommend taking a close look at "The Linux Programming Interface" by Michael Kerrisk. Although not directly related to ruby or rails, it gives you a fundamental understanding of process management, which helps a lot when understanding how puma works. Additionally, the official puma documentation is invaluable for understanding its configuration and how it manages workers. I’d also recommend reading "Effective Ruby" by Peter J. Jones, as this helps hone the best practices for Ruby coding, which are always applicable, regardless of context. Finally, having a good grasp of the rails guides, specifically those on middleware, will always serve you well in situations like these.

In summary, accessing the puma worker index within a rails request is typically done by accessing the `PUMA_WORKER_ID` environment variable. The direct method, while effective, can lead to code repetition, so wrapping that process within a middleware is beneficial. The final example shows how it can even be injected into request parameters. Understanding these approaches will help you create a more robust application when working within a multi-process environment like puma. Pick the method that best suits your specific requirements and application’s architecture.
