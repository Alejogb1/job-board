Let’s tackle that. Conditioning a PyTorch autoencoder on time is a fascinating problem, and one I’ve encountered a few times in my professional projects, usually when dealing with sequential data. The core challenge, as you probably already suspect, revolves around incorporating time-series information into the latent space that the autoencoder learns. A standard autoencoder is primarily concerned with compressing and reconstructing its input; introducing a temporal dimension requires a modified architecture.

My experience leans towards two main approaches: the first involves treating the time component as an explicit input to the encoder and decoder, and the second leverages recurrent layers to handle time sequences. We'll explore both, including code examples to solidify these concepts.

First, let's look at explicit conditioning. Imagine you're processing video data, and you want to encode frames based on their chronological order. Instead of treating each frame as independent, you need the model to understand how the frames relate to one another temporally. Here, we can concatenate the time index to the input of the encoder. For a simple example, suppose you have time indices ranging from 0 to t and input data with dimension 'd'. Your input becomes (d + 1) dimensional, with the last dimension holding the time index (suitably scaled). This approach doesn't handle dependencies between time steps inherently, but it adds a conditional layer to the model based on time.

Here's a concise snippet demonstrating this approach:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TimeConditionedAutoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, latent_dim, time_dim=1):
        super(TimeConditionedAutoencoder, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim + time_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, latent_dim)
        )
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(latent_dim + time_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, input_dim)
        )
        self.input_dim = input_dim
        self.time_dim = time_dim

    def encode(self, x, t):
        # Reshape t if necessary to match batch dimension.
        t_input = t.view(-1, self.time_dim)
        encoded = self.encoder(torch.cat((x, t_input), dim=1))
        return encoded

    def decode(self, z, t):
        #Reshape t if necessary to match batch dimension.
        t_input = t.view(-1, self.time_dim)
        decoded = self.decoder(torch.cat((z, t_input), dim=1))
        return decoded


    def forward(self, x, t):
        z = self.encode(x, t)
        x_hat = self.decode(z, t)
        return x_hat

# Example usage:
input_dimension = 10
latent_dimension = 5
batch_size = 32
time_points = 10

# Generate random data and time indices.
input_data = torch.randn(batch_size, input_dimension)
time_indices = torch.linspace(0, 1, steps=time_points)
time_batch = time_indices.repeat(batch_size,1)[:,0]

model = TimeConditionedAutoencoder(input_dimension, latent_dimension)
reconstructed = model(input_data, time_batch)
print("Shape of reconstructed output:", reconstructed.shape)

```

In this first snippet, the `TimeConditionedAutoencoder` takes the input data 'x' and a time input 't' and concatenates the two along the feature dimension. The encoder and decoder both then process this combined representation. This structure allows the model to be influenced by time when compressing and reconstructing the input. Note how the 't' is reshaped using `.view(-1, self.time_dim)`. This ensures the dimensions match during concatenation. It’s vital to consider the scale of 't' - often normalizing or scaling it is needed to avoid numerical instability or undue influence on the model.

Next, let’s consider the scenario where time dependencies between steps are essential. For this, we can integrate Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTMs or GRUs. In essence, the encoder’s output isn’t simply fed into the decoder but instead each time step of the encoded sequence is passed through the LSTM layer before being fed into the decoder. This enables the model to encode temporal dependencies in the latent space which are important for time-series modelling.

Here’s an example showcasing this approach:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TemporalAutoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, latent_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers):
        super(TemporalAutoencoder, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, latent_dim)
        )
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(latent_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers, batch_first = True)
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, input_dim)
        )
        self.latent_dim = latent_dim
        self.hidden_dim = hidden_dim
        self.num_layers = num_layers


    def forward(self, x):
        # Input x is expected to be a sequence.
        batch_size, seq_len, input_dim = x.size()

        #Encode each step
        encoded_sequence = []
        for t in range(seq_len):
            encoded_sequence.append(self.encoder(x[:,t,:]))
        encoded_sequence = torch.stack(encoded_sequence, dim = 1)


        #Pass through LSTM
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(encoded_sequence)

        #Decode each output
        decoded_sequence = []
        for t in range(seq_len):
          decoded_sequence.append(self.decoder(lstm_out[:,t,:]))
        decoded_sequence = torch.stack(decoded_sequence, dim = 1)

        return decoded_sequence


# Example usage:
input_dimension = 10
latent_dimension = 5
hidden_dimension = 20
num_lstm_layers = 2
sequence_length = 15
batch_size = 32


# Generate random sequence data
input_sequence = torch.randn(batch_size, sequence_length, input_dimension)

model = TemporalAutoencoder(input_dimension, latent_dimension, hidden_dimension, num_lstm_layers)
reconstructed_sequence = model(input_sequence)
print("Shape of reconstructed sequence:", reconstructed_sequence.shape)
```

This `TemporalAutoencoder` example now directly processes a sequence. The input `x` is of the shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_dimension). Each step of the input is encoded and then passed through an LSTM which helps to encode time dependencies. The output of the LSTM is then passed through a decoder resulting in a reconstruction of the input sequence. Note here that the final layer is a linear layer. Depending on your needs, this could easily be replaced with a more complex decoder. This approach is particularly effective for capturing patterns in temporal data.

Finally, consider a variation of the first method where instead of directly concatenating the time-steps you embed it in a learned manner. This allows the model to capture more complex relationships between the time indices and the input data.

Here is a code snippet demonstrating this:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TimeConditionedAutoencoderEmbedding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, latent_dim, time_dim, embedding_dim):
        super(TimeConditionedAutoencoderEmbedding, self).__init__()

        self.time_embedding = nn.Embedding(time_dim, embedding_dim)

        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim + embedding_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, latent_dim)
        )
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(latent_dim + embedding_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, input_dim)
        )
        self.input_dim = input_dim
        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim


    def encode(self, x, t):

        t_embedded = self.time_embedding(t)
        encoded = self.encoder(torch.cat((x, t_embedded), dim=1))
        return encoded

    def decode(self, z, t):

      t_embedded = self.time_embedding(t)
      decoded = self.decoder(torch.cat((z, t_embedded), dim=1))
      return decoded

    def forward(self, x, t):
        z = self.encode(x, t)
        x_hat = self.decode(z, t)
        return x_hat


# Example usage:
input_dimension = 10
latent_dimension = 5
num_time_steps = 10
embedding_dimension = 10
batch_size = 32

# Generate random data and time indices.
input_data = torch.randn(batch_size, input_dimension)
time_indices = torch.randint(0, num_time_steps, (batch_size,))

model = TimeConditionedAutoencoderEmbedding(input_dimension, latent_dimension, num_time_steps, embedding_dimension)
reconstructed = model(input_data, time_indices)
print("Shape of reconstructed output:", reconstructed.shape)

```

Here the time-steps are first passed through a learnable embedding before being concatenated with the input. This allows for a more sophisticated representation of the temporal information. This can be useful when the time information is discrete or doesn’t have a linear relationship with the data. Note that the `t` is no longer a float as in the first example. It is an integer value representing each time step.

In all scenarios, it’s crucial to think about your data’s characteristics and the nature of time-dependence you need to capture. There isn’t a “one-size-fits-all” solution. The effectiveness of each approach varies greatly. Experimentation is essential to finding the optimal structure for your specific use case.

For a more in-depth theoretical understanding of sequence modelling and recurrent neural networks, I highly recommend "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Additionally, research papers focusing on time-series analysis with deep learning can provide further insights. Specifically, I would recommend looking into any papers on temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), these are often used as alternatives to RNNs and can be more computationally efficient.

Hopefully, this clarifies how to condition a PyTorch autoencoder on time. Feel free to follow up with any further questions as you dive deeper into these techniques!
