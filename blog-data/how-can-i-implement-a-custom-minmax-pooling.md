, let’s tackle custom min-max pooling. It's a frequent requirement when you move beyond standard neural network architectures or need to finely control data flow in specialized applications. I remember facing this exact challenge a few years back while working on a project involving highly granular time-series analysis; standard max pooling was simply too aggressive, losing important low-frequency details. Min pooling, on its own, wasn't sufficient either, hence the need for a custom hybrid. The good news is that it's not nearly as daunting as it might initially appear.

Essentially, min-max pooling isn’t a built-in operation in most common deep learning libraries, which means we have to craft our own implementation. The crux of it lies in combining two fundamental operations: *minimum* extraction within a local region and *maximum* extraction, also within a similar local region. The specific behavior, though, is really in our hands - we get to define the neighborhood size, stride, and even the pooling mechanism itself, offering greater flexibility than you’d get with standard max or average pooling.

Let’s break down a potential implementation with concrete examples. I'll demonstrate in python with numpy, because it's both relatively low-level and widely understood in our field. While not the most performant way to do this for large-scale deep learning, it will cleanly show the logic, and you can easily adapt this to a GPU-accelerated framework like tensorflow or pytorch with similar underlying principles.

First, let’s define a basic function to apply min or max pooling on a 1D array:

```python
import numpy as np

def pool_1d(arr, window_size, stride, pool_type):
    output = []
    for i in range(0, len(arr) - window_size + 1, stride):
        window = arr[i:i+window_size]
        if pool_type == 'max':
            output.append(np.max(window))
        elif pool_type == 'min':
            output.append(np.min(window))
        else:
            raise ValueError("pool_type must be 'max' or 'min'")
    return np.array(output)

```
This is a fundamental building block; it handles either max or min pooling on a 1-dimensional sequence. To make it more useful, let's add some handling of multidimensional data such as matrices, which is often more what you have when working with images or feature maps from convolution operations. Here, I'll handle a 2-dimensional example; you'd need to generalize further for higher-dimensional data, but that's outside the scope of this response.

```python
def pool_2d(matrix, window_size, stride, pool_type):
    rows, cols = matrix.shape
    output_rows = (rows - window_size) // stride + 1
    output_cols = (cols - window_size) // stride + 1
    output = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))

    for i in range(0, rows - window_size + 1, stride):
        for j in range(0, cols - window_size + 1, stride):
            window = matrix[i:i+window_size, j:j+window_size]
            if pool_type == 'max':
                output[i//stride, j//stride] = np.max(window)
            elif pool_type == 'min':
                output[i//stride, j//stride] = np.min(window)
            else:
                raise ValueError("pool_type must be 'max' or 'min'")
    return output
```
This function, `pool_2d`, does the same as the 1D function, but now considers two dimensions and produces an appropriate output matrix. We need to iterate over all the windows in the matrix, performing the operation based on the `pool_type` argument. Note that this version uses integer division (`//`), which helps keep the output matrix size correct as it is based on the number of strides that can be applied with the specific `window_size`.

Now we can combine these ideas to do the custom min-max pooling. The typical idea here is to apply both operations on the same window independently, and then combine them in some way. In many cases, I have found concatenating their output or averaging these results (after possibly rescaling to a standard range) is effective. Let's do concatenation here since it's the simplest and is easily followed.

```python
def minmax_pool_2d(matrix, window_size, stride):
   min_pooled = pool_2d(matrix, window_size, stride, 'min')
   max_pooled = pool_2d(matrix, window_size, stride, 'max')
   return np.concatenate((min_pooled.flatten(), max_pooled.flatten()))
```
This final piece of code is where we perform our custom min-max pooling on a 2-dimensional matrix. It reuses the `pool_2d` function we defined previously to independently generate the min-pooled and max-pooled versions. We then flatten and concatenate them, returning a single feature vector. Depending on the type of data you are working with, concatenating these values, using a weighted sum, or even taking a difference of these pooled outputs could prove valuable. It all comes down to careful evaluation.

I have found it useful, on occasions, to apply an activation function to the concatenated result before passing it on to further layers. This can increase non-linearity and give the network more expressive power. If I were you, I'd keep an eye out for this during your experimentation phase, but let's not add it now as it moves further from the core idea.

Regarding further study, I highly recommend exploring "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville; it provides the theoretical underpinning for many pooling concepts. A good resource for practical implementations on GPUs would be the official documentation of TensorFlow or PyTorch. If you're working with time series data, as I was in that past project, "Time Series Analysis and Its Applications" by Shumway and Stoffer is a must-read.

Remember, this custom min-max pooling, like most other technical challenges, often requires iteration and experimentation. Don't be afraid to tweak the `window_size`, `stride`, or even the combination methodology to find the best configuration for the task at hand. Consider the potential loss of information with each pooling operation and be mindful of your data distribution. The key is always to experiment and tailor your approach to the specifics of your project. This is how I, and many others I work with, generally tackle these things, with a heavy emphasis on experimentation and understanding the fundamentals.
