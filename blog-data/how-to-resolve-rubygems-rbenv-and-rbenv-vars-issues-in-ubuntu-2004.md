Alright, let's talk about the often-encountered, and frankly, sometimes frustrating trifecta of RubyGems, rbenv, and `rbenv-vars` on Ubuntu 20.04. I've spent my share of late nights untangling the spaghetti these tools can sometimes create, and I've learned a few things along the way, so I hope my experience will help you navigate these waters. It's a common source of headaches, particularly when you're juggling multiple ruby versions across different projects.

The core problem generally stems from the way these tools interact with each other and the environment, specifically in the context of Ubuntu 20.04's rather particular setup. `rbenv` is designed to manage ruby versions, RubyGems manages packages, and `rbenv-vars` is a handy plugin for setting project-specific environment variables. The trouble often arises from environment path conflicts, incorrect ruby version selection, or misconfigured gems. Let’s break down these individual components and common issues.

Firstly, consider rbenv. Its strength lies in isolating different ruby installations, preventing global gem clashes. The way it operates is by shimming, or intercepting, your commands. When you type `ruby`, `gem`, or `bundle`, rbenv checks which version of ruby is active for the current directory (or globally) and directs that call to the correct ruby executable. This requires proper shell integration, and issues typically arise when this integration is incomplete. I recall one project where the developer had installed rbenv but had failed to add `eval "$(rbenv init -)"` to their `.bashrc` (or equivalent shell configuration). This meant rbenv wasn’t actually shimming the calls, leading to bizarre behavior – gems installed with one ruby version were not accessible under another and confusing error messages relating to missing executables.

The first step to diagnosing issues is to verify that `rbenv` is actually active in your shell. Open a terminal, and type `type ruby`. If it doesn't point to a location within your rbenv directory, for example something similar to `/home/<user>/.rbenv/shims/ruby`, then the shims are not working correctly, and rbenv is not actually managing ruby versions.

Here's the first code snippet: a simple diagnostic.

```bash
# Diagnostic check: Ensure rbenv is correctly integrated
type ruby
type gem
type bundle
echo $PATH | grep .rbenv
```

If the output indicates that the shims are not being used and `.rbenv` paths are absent, you need to revisit your shell configuration. I'd recommend reading the rbenv documentation closely; it explains the required setup thoroughly. Adding the line mentioned earlier to your shell config and then sourcing the file (`source ~/.bashrc` for example) will often resolve most integration problems.

Once rbenv is correctly set up, the next area where troubles often arise involves managing RubyGems and associated gems for different projects. Imagine a scenario where you have project "A" requiring a specific version of the 'rails' gem while project "B" needs a different version, or a different ruby version, altogether. This is where rbenv shines. First ensure that you have installed the required Ruby version through `rbenv install <ruby_version>`.

Let's say I've had a situation where a project had a Gemfile specifying `gem 'rails', '~> 5.2.0'` but the project, during execution, was failing with errors suggesting a more recent rails gem was being used. The issue was that another project I’d been working on with Ruby 3.0.0, which required Rails 6.1.0, was accidentally interfering.

This is where `rbenv local` comes to our aid. To isolate a project's ruby and gem dependencies, navigate to that project directory and use `rbenv local <ruby_version>`. This creates a `.ruby-version` file in that project's directory, telling rbenv to use that specific ruby for the project. Then install gems for that project's Ruby.

Here’s the second example.

```bash
# Project A Setup (ruby 2.7.6, rails 5.2.x)
cd /path/to/project_a
rbenv local 2.7.6
gem install bundler
bundle install # this installs project-specific gems
bundle exec rails -v # Verifying rails version

# Project B Setup (ruby 3.0.0, rails 6.1.x)
cd /path/to/project_b
rbenv local 3.0.0
gem install bundler
bundle install # this installs project-specific gems
bundle exec rails -v # Verifying rails version
```
This guarantees that each project uses its own specific ruby and gem versions, eliminating cross-project conflicts and ensuring build stability. `bundle install` uses the Gemfile for project dependencies. `bundle exec` prefixes any execution with the correct gem paths for the project, preventing the wrong versions from being invoked.

Now, let’s discuss `rbenv-vars`. This plugin is incredibly useful for managing project-specific environment variables without polluting your global environment. However, there are times when `rbenv-vars` can appear to malfunction. Problems typically arise from incorrectly created `.rbenv-vars` files or incorrect syntax within those files. I recall a situation where a developer had misplaced the `.rbenv-vars` file in the parent directory instead of in the root of the project directory. It was failing silently because the rbenv hook to parse the file was not triggered for that specific project, leading to variables not being available. The file should always be placed at the same level as `.ruby-version`.

The most reliable approach is to ensure the `.rbenv-vars` file uses correct syntax. It is usually a simple list of `KEY=VALUE` pairs. Verify your variable is set by echoing it after navigating to your project root, as the hook will execute whenever you cd into the root directory of a project using `rbenv-vars`.

Here is a final example.

```bash
# Example of .rbenv-vars file (located in /path/to/project_c)
# File content:
# MY_API_KEY=secretkey123
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database

# Testing the variables
cd /path/to/project_c
echo $MY_API_KEY
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

If the environment variables aren't being picked up as expected, ensure the `.rbenv-vars` is located correctly within the project directory, that `rbenv-vars` plugin is installed correctly and enabled, and verify that the syntax is correct.

Troubleshooting these kinds of setups often boils down to systematic checks: verifying your rbenv installation, ensuring ruby version selection is correct for each project, and paying careful attention to placement and syntax within `.rbenv-vars`. For deeper understanding I would highly recommend reading the 'rbenv' documentation on GitHub. Additionally, the book "The Ruby Programming Language" by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto gives a very solid foundation on Ruby's environment and package management, and complements this practical understanding very well. Understanding the 'why' behind the tooling will often lead to a much quicker resolution than just randomly throwing solutions at the problem. Don't be discouraged; these things can be complex but are often due to small configuration oversights. With careful attention to the setup and a bit of patience, the Ruby environment should be tamed.
