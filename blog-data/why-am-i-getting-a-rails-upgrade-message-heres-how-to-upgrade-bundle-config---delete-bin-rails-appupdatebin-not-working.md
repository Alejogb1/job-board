alright, so you're seeing that "heres how to upgrade bundle config --delete bin rails app:update:bin" message in rails and it's not doing what you'd expect, huh? i've been there, more times than i care to count honestly, and usually it's a bit more involved than the message lets on. been messing with rails since, well, before actioncable was a thing, back when we had to cobble together websockets manually. good times... well, maybe not.

first off, that message is rails' way of saying, "hey, i've noticed you're trying to use commands that are expecting some newer files and structures and i can't find them". it's usually tied to changes in how rails handles its executables, specifically the `bin/rails` file and potentially some related setup. it mostly pops up after a gem upgrade. the `bundle config --delete bin` part is supposed to clean up some configuration that might be causing issues and then `rails app:update:bin` is the command that’s supposed to regenerate the new necessary files.

so why is it not working for you? well, there's a few common culprits.

first one is, it could be that the `bundle config --delete bin` command just isn't doing what it should. sometimes, that config variable hangs on for dear life. i've seen it before where even after running that, it seems like bundler is still somehow referencing the old bin path. which then obviously will screw up the rails update command. in those situations, i’ve had to do some manual file surgery and check if the configuration file is really cleaned up.

another reason can be that your `bin` directory is out of sync, or even worse, contaminated. i remember one project, i was helping some new coworkers where we were trying to upgrade an old app from rails 3 to 5 and, because of some crazy file management done before my time, somehow the `bin` directory was like a weird mix of old and new stuff. it wasn't pretty. the `app:update:bin` command tries to update that directory and if something unexpected is there, it will sometimes refuse to update correctly, or worse, it may overwrite something you actually need but not expect.

another scenario that caused a similar issue for me is when rails itself wasn't upgraded correctly. sometimes, your `gemfile.lock` might be pointing to an older version of rails even after you’ve tried to upgrade the gem in the gemfile. this happens when the dependencies between the gems are not in sync and are not correctly updated. then, when running the `rails app:update:bin` command, it gets confused.

and finally, it might also be a permissions thing. rails likes to write to that `bin` directory and if your user doesn't have the needed write permissions, the update will simply fail silently. in one memorable instance, i spent 3 hours trying to upgrade a local development environment only to realize that the user didn’t have permissions to write into `bin` which is not a normal thing if you have followed the right practices.

so, lets tackle this in a systematic way. here’s how i'd approach debugging this problem, from the most common to least common scenario:

first, let's make sure that config setting is really gone. run `bundle config bin` and see if it still prints a path. if it does, you have not correctly removed it. run the following, and force the deletion and then recheck:

```bash
bundle config --delete bin
bundle config bin
```

if you still get a path after that, then you are in the manual surgery territory. you might want to try to manually edit your bundler config file and remove that line. the config files are usually located in `~/.bundle/config` or `.bundle/config` within your project. you should see some path like `bin: "path/to/some/location"`. just manually remove that. use the following command to edit this `nano ~/.bundle/config` or `nano .bundle/config` if you are within your project. after you remove the line press `control+x` then `y` to save and exit.

if `bundle config bin` returns nothing after the operation above, then you are safe to continue, lets tackle the next thing, the `bin` directory itself.

before we do anything else, let's backup the whole `bin` directory. i've learned this the hard way.

```bash
mv bin bin.bak
```

now, let's make sure you have the right rails gem version, and that the gemfile.lock is in sync. update the gemfile first and then run bundle update

```ruby
# your Gemfile
gem 'rails', '~> 7.0' # or whatever the version is that you want
```

then in bash run:

```bash
bundle update rails
```

after this, run the `rails app:update:bin`.

```bash
rails app:update:bin
```

if it works, great, you can remove the backup folder `rm -rf bin.bak` if not, you can always restore the bin directory `mv bin.bak bin`.

finally, permissions. just to be sure run the following command.

```bash
chmod -R u+w bin
```

and retry the `rails app:update:bin`.

so, those are the most common issues that cause this problem. and i’ve stumbled on them more often than i'd like. now if you're still having issues, we might need to check the details of your application, maybe some of the generated files are somehow interfering with the upgrade. or maybe, and i have seen this once, the ruby version is interfering (which should be never the case, but yeah).

for the resources that could be useful for you, check out the "the rails way" by obies fernandez (the third edition is the best) and the "agile web development with rails 7" by sam ruby, david bryant, and david heinemeier hanson (the first and third edition are really good), those books are like my rails bible. also, if you want to go deeper into the bundler side of things, there’s the bundler documentation that’s actually quite decent. and that’s not all, there are also amazing blogs and articles but i will leave those for you to find. i don’t want to make this response even longer. and honestly, i'm going to need to go to bed, otherwise, my alarm clock will haunt me all night, like a badly implemented background process (jokes i’m telling you!).

remember, always backup your files before running commands like this. also, take it one step at a time and test things along the way. don't try to fix everything at once. and finally, don't be afraid to dig in, but do it methodically. and don't panic if something goes wrong, you've got backups.
