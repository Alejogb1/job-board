Alright,  The need to pause between sftp `put` commands isn’t uncommon, and it usually surfaces when dealing with rate limiting, server resource constraints, or attempting to manage network congestion. I recall a particularly nasty incident a few years back when I was pushing large datasets to a legacy system. We were essentially hammering the server, causing it to reject subsequent connections. We needed to throttle back our transfer rate, and implementing pauses between `put` operations became critical.

Essentially, `sftp` by itself doesn't have a built-in mechanism to automatically pause after each `put`. The shell, not `sftp`, controls the timing of command executions. Therefore, we need to use shell scripting capabilities or programming language integrations to introduce these delays. We’ll explore some pragmatic approaches.

The first, and probably the simplest, is incorporating a `sleep` command within a shell script. This method works well for basic sequential file uploads. Let’s consider a scenario where you need to upload a few log files: `log1.txt`, `log2.txt`, and `log3.txt`, pausing 2 seconds between each transfer. Here's how you might approach that:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sftp user@sftp.example.com << EOF
put log1.txt
sleep 2
put log2.txt
sleep 2
put log3.txt
bye
EOF
```

In this script, the shell executes each `put` command, followed by a `sleep 2` command, which introduces a 2-second delay. The `<< EOF ... EOF` syntax is a here-string, providing a series of `sftp` commands directly to the `sftp` process. While straightforward, this method is somewhat inflexible, especially if the number of files to upload is dynamic or if you need more sophisticated control over the delay duration, like basing it on file size.

For more sophisticated control, we can iterate through files and implement dynamic delays. Let's consider a situation where you have files in a directory that you need to upload, and you want to pause for 1 second after each upload but also monitor transfer times (which can sometimes be helpful if you're troubleshooting network issues). Using `find` to locate files, and a basic `awk` calculation, you can dynamically assess the upload time and add a basic delay.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

SFTP_HOST="user@sftp.example.com"
UPLOAD_DIR="/path/to/local/files"
REMOTE_DIR="/remote/target/directory"

find "$UPLOAD_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f | while IFS= read -r file; do
    start_time=$(date +%s%N)

    sftp "$SFTP_HOST" << EOF
        cd "$REMOTE_DIR"
        put "$file"
    bye
EOF
    end_time=$(date +%s%N)

    duration=$(( (end_time - start_time) / 1000000000)) #in seconds
    sleep_duration=1
    echo "Uploaded file: $file in ${duration}s, pausing for ${sleep_duration}s."
    sleep "$sleep_duration"

done
```
In this script, `find` searches for files in the local directory. The loop reads each file path into the `file` variable and then executes the `sftp` command. The timestamps allow us to assess, in seconds, how long the transfer took. After each transfer, a fixed 1-second delay is introduced via the `sleep` command. This demonstrates how you can incorporate dynamic information, in this case upload time (though in this example it doesn’t change sleep time), into the control flow of your transfer process.

Moving beyond shell scripting, programmatic solutions using languages like python offer even finer-grained control. The `paramiko` library, a commonly used library for secure connections, allows explicit control over the sftp process. This would be my preferred approach if the sftp interaction needed to be embedded into a larger application or needed more robust error handling. Here is an example:

```python
import paramiko
import time
import os

def upload_with_pauses(hostname, username, password, local_directory, remote_directory, delay=1):
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

    try:
        ssh.connect(hostname, username=username, password=password)
        sftp = ssh.open_sftp()

        for filename in os.listdir(local_directory):
            local_path = os.path.join(local_directory, filename)
            if os.path.isfile(local_path):
                remote_path = os.path.join(remote_directory, filename)
                print(f"Uploading {filename}")
                sftp.put(local_path, remote_path)
                print(f"Uploaded {filename}. Pausing for {delay} second(s).")
                time.sleep(delay)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

    finally:
        if sftp:
            sftp.close()
        ssh.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Replace with your actual details
    HOST = 'sftp.example.com'
    USER = 'username'
    PASS = 'password'
    LOCAL_DIR = '/path/to/local/files'
    REMOTE_DIR = '/remote/target/directory'
    DELAY = 2  # Delay between uploads in seconds

    upload_with_pauses(HOST, USER, PASS, LOCAL_DIR, REMOTE_DIR, DELAY)

```

This python script utilizes `paramiko` to handle the sftp connection, it iterates over files in the specified local directory, uploads them and applies a defined delay after each file upload. This approach makes it easier to handle complex situations, such as catching errors and logging events associated with individual file transfers. In a real-world application, you could expand this to handle retries, adjust the delay dynamically based on file sizes, monitor upload rates, etc.

For further learning on `paramiko`, the official documentation is invaluable, specifically the sections on SFTP. The "TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1" by W. Richard Stevens will provide an excellent foundation for understanding the underlying network protocols relevant to sftp. Also, the *OpenSSH* documentation will explain the underlying mechanics of sftp connections.

In summary, while `sftp` lacks inherent pausing mechanisms, incorporating `sleep` commands in shell scripts, or employing programming languages with libraries such as `paramiko`, allows you to effectively introduce pauses between `put` commands. The choice depends on the scale and complexity of your needs. These solutions have, in my experience, provided reliable throttling mechanisms for sftp transfers in various environments. Choose the method that best fits your situation and always prioritize good error handling.
