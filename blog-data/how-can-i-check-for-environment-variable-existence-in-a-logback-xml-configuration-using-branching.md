Let's tackle this. I’ve definitely been down this rabbit hole myself, more than once, when trying to wrangle complex logging setups. Conditional logging based on the existence of environment variables within a logback.xml configuration is, frankly, a common necessity in production environments, especially when dealing with multiple deployments or configurations. You're aiming for a way to make your logging dynamically adapt to different contexts, and that's a very valid objective.

The core challenge here is that logback's xml configuration language isn't inherently designed for complex conditional logic as you'd find in a typical programming language. We’re essentially trying to inject a small dose of procedural behavior into a declarative setting. Fortunately, logback provides ways to achieve this, primarily utilizing its scripting capabilities and the power of JNDI lookups.

Let’s break down how this works, incorporating some specific examples based on experiences I’ve had in the trenches.

**The Foundation: JNDI Lookups and Conditional Evaluation**

Logback allows us to access JNDI resources through its configuration, which is the key here. Environment variables are often exposed as JNDI resources by the application server or environment itself. We can then check for their existence by attempting to look them up. The crucial part is using this within the scope of a `<if>` and `<then>` configuration to control whether or not certain appenders or loggers are enabled.

Here's a step-by-step explanation along with examples:

**Example 1: Simple Appender Enabling Based on Environment Variable**

In this scenario, I had a situation where debug-level logging to a separate file was only necessary in a development environment. We needed to selectively activate that debug appender only if a specific environment variable, say, `DEBUG_MODE`, was set. Here's how I did it:

```xml
<configuration>
  <property name="logDir" value="logs"/>

  <if condition='isDefined("DEBUG_MODE")'>
    <then>
      <appender name="DEBUG_FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
        <file>${logDir}/debug.log</file>
        <encoder>
          <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
      </appender>

      <root level="DEBUG">
          <appender-ref ref="DEBUG_FILE" />
      </root>
    </then>
  </if>

  <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder>
      <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>


  <root level="INFO">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
  </root>
</configuration>
```

The `isDefined("DEBUG_MODE")` condition is where the magic happens. If the environment variable `DEBUG_MODE` is present as a JNDI resource, the whole `<then>` block gets executed, activating the `DEBUG_FILE` appender and setting the root log level to debug which further routes all DEBUG logs to the appender. Otherwise, the `<then>` block is skipped and the logging remains at the standard `INFO` level using only the `STDOUT` appender.

**Example 2: Using Property Substitution with a Fallback**

Sometimes, you don't want just on/off. You might need different logging destinations or formats based on specific environment variables. I once encountered a setup where we wanted to route logs to different files based on an environment variable indicating the deployment environment - `DEPLOYMENT_ENV`, defaulting to a shared "default" location.

```xml
<configuration>
    <property name="logDir" value="logs"/>
    <property name="deploymentEnv" value="${jndi:DEPLOYMENT_ENV:-default}"/>

    <appender name="DEPLOYMENT_FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
        <file>${logDir}/${deploymentEnv}.log</file>
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="DEPLOYMENT_FILE" />
    </root>

</configuration>
```

In this example, `property name="deploymentEnv" ...` uses the JNDI lookup `jndi:DEPLOYMENT_ENV`. The `:-default` part provides a default value if `DEPLOYMENT_ENV` isn't found. If the environment variable is present, the value will be used; otherwise, the logs will go into a file called `default.log`. This approach elegantly avoids the complexities of nested `<if>` conditions for multiple environments. It shows that logback can dynamically resolve file paths using properties, which simplifies the configuration considerably.

**Example 3: Complex Branching using Groovy Scripts**

For really complex cases, where you need a conditional logic beyond the basic `isDefined`, logback allows using a `<script>` tag leveraging languages like Groovy. This gives more control over the branching behaviour. Let’s say you wanted to activate specific appenders based on a combined condition of the existence and value of multiple environment variables. Here's an illustrative example:

```xml
<configuration>
  <property name="logDir" value="logs"/>

  <script language="groovy">
     def shouldActivateSpecificAppenders() {
        def var1 = System.getenv("FEATURE_A_ENABLED");
        def var2 = System.getenv("ENV_TYPE");

        if(var1 == "true" && var2 == "production") {
           return true;
        }
        return false;
     }
  </script>

    <if condition='script{shouldActivateSpecificAppenders()}'>
      <then>
          <appender name="FEATURE_A_FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
              <file>${logDir}/feature_a.log</file>
              <encoder>
                  <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
              </encoder>
          </appender>
          <root level="INFO">
              <appender-ref ref="FEATURE_A_FILE" />
          </root>
      </then>
    </if>

    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
      <encoder>
        <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
      </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
    </root>

</configuration>
```

This snippet defines a Groovy script function `shouldActivateSpecificAppenders` which retrieves values for `FEATURE_A_ENABLED` and `ENV_TYPE` environment variables, and returns true if specific condition is fulfilled. Based on this function return, the `<if>` block with specific appenders is either activated or skipped. Groovy scripting opens up many possibilities for more intricate logic.

**Important Considerations and Recommendations:**

1. **JNDI Configuration:** Ensure your application server or environment properly exposes environment variables as JNDI resources. How exactly this is done often varies by the environment. Typically, for tomcat, you may need to modify server.xml or context.xml file.

2. **Performance Implications:** Complex scripting using languages like Groovy might have a minor performance impact during the initialization of logback configuration. Keep this in mind when dealing with highly performant applications. For most use-cases, the impact is negligible, but it's a good thing to consider.

3. **Error Handling:** Pay attention to potential `NullPointerExceptions` when fetching environment variables or JNDI lookups. The property substitution syntax with `:-default` as shown in Example 2 can greatly help to handle missing values. Scripting with groovy allows you to implement try/catch error handlers but add to the complexity.

4. **Testing:** Thoroughly test all branches of your conditional logging configuration. Using unit tests and integration tests to verify the desired logging output is highly recommended.

5. **Resources:** For a deeper dive, I’d highly recommend consulting the official logback documentation, specifically the sections about configuration, JNDI access, and scripting capabilities. “*Logback: The Definitive Guide*” by Ceki Gülcü (the creator of logback) provides in-depth explanations and a great understanding of how the underlying mechanisms work. Also, reading the relevant sections in your application server’s documentation can help to understand the JNDI access patterns.

Implementing conditional logging with logback using the outlined methods isn't an incredibly complex task once you understand the fundamentals. It’s a worthwhile pursuit to control and adapt logging to different contexts. I hope this extensive explanation and my practical approach, learned from past experiences, help you with your setup. Let me know if you run into any specific issues.
