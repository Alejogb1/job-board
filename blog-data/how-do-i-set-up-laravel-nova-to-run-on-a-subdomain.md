Okay, let's tackle this. Setting up Laravel Nova on a subdomain can initially feel a little intricate, but it’s absolutely manageable with the proper approach. I've personally navigated this setup several times in previous projects, facing similar challenges, and I can certainly guide you through the process. The key lies in understanding the interplay between your server configuration, your Laravel application, and Nova's routing.

The core issue isn’t about Nova being inherently difficult to configure on a subdomain; it's about how you correctly direct web traffic to the Nova panel specifically. Essentially, we're manipulating the routes that Laravel uses for our application. When you install Nova normally, it assumes you're running it at the root level of your main domain. We need to specifically tell it—and your server—that the Nova panel lives at a subdomain address instead.

First, let's consider the server configuration. In an environment like Nginx or Apache, you would need to create a new virtual host configuration for your subdomain. Let’s assume your main domain is `example.com`, and you want to host Nova on `admin.example.com`. Here's a fundamental Nginx configuration snippet (it's important to note that this is a simplified version, and a full configuration may require additional adjustments):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name admin.example.com;
    root /path/to/your/laravel/public;  # ensure the correct path
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock; #adjust php version if different
    }

  location ~ /\.ht {
      deny all;
    }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/laravel/public` with the actual path to your Laravel public directory. Also, make sure you are using the correct php-fpm socket configuration based on your server setup. Apache configurations would be similarly established, although the syntax differs. These virtual host configurations are essential because they ensure web requests coming to `admin.example.com` are correctly directed to your Laravel application.

Now for the Laravel side. We can't just move Nova's routes directly; we need to tell Laravel's router to operate differently when dealing with requests on this subdomain. Nova's `routes` function inside the `NovaServiceProvider` is where the initial routes are registered. We'll modify that slightly, and for clarity, I'm providing the essential logic here. Instead of directly changing the `NovaServiceProvider`, we'll create our own service provider that extends the base `NovaServiceProvider` to ensure we can extend without directly modifying third-party packages:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use Laravel\Nova\NovaServiceProvider as BaseNovaServiceProvider;

class NovaServiceProvider extends BaseNovaServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
       parent::boot();
    }

    /**
     * Register the Nova routes.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    protected function routes()
    {
        Route::middleware(['web'])
             ->domain('admin.example.com')
             ->prefix('/')
             ->group(function () {
                 $this->loadRoutesFrom(__DIR__.'/../../vendor/laravel/nova/routes/routes.php');
              });
    }

    /**
     * Register the application's Nova resources.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    protected function resources()
    {
       //
    }
}

```

This code snippet is important. Here's what's happening: we create a new provider which extends the default nova provider. Within the `routes` method, we use Laravel's `Route` facade to establish a route group specifically for `admin.example.com` domain. We are not changing the location of route file itself, but rather telling the router that everything that came to `admin.example.com` domain should use this route definition. After, we are still loading the standard Nova routes from vendor path. The `prefix('/')` makes sure all routes inside the default routes file don't have any additional prefixes. Finally, be sure to adjust `App\Providers\NovaServiceProvider` within your `config/app.php` as appropriate.

However, there's another subtle but crucial change we need to make. Nova's default configuration often generates URLs without considering the subdomain. This will break assets and links in the Nova panel. We need to force Nova to generate URLs that include the subdomain when creating links to resources or asset paths. This involves adjusting the Nova configuration through the `config/nova.php` file. Add or edit the `asset_url` entry:

```php
'asset_url' => env('NOVA_ASSET_URL', 'https://admin.example.com'),
```

Then, within your `.env` file, you would set:

```env
NOVA_ASSET_URL=https://admin.example.com
```

By using `asset_url` in your `nova.php` configuration and the `NOVA_ASSET_URL` environment variable, we are making sure all assets paths will correctly resolve.

Now, let's walk through an example step-by-step using the given configuration:

1.  **Server Configuration:** First, you set up your `admin.example.com` virtual host using the provided nginx example or an equivalent configuration with your server of choice. Make sure it’s pointing to the correct public directory and using the appropriate php version.

2.  **Laravel Service Provider:** The extended service provider above, with the specified `routes()` method should be placed in the `app/Providers/` folder and registered in your `config/app.php` by replacing the default Nova service provider declaration.

3.  **Asset URL Configuration:** The environment variable `NOVA_ASSET_URL` is set to ensure that Nova's asset and link generation includes the subdomain.

After completing these steps, Nova should become accessible on `admin.example.com`. Note that DNS records for `admin.example.com` must point to your server IP address for this to work.

It's worth noting that these are the core components. However, you might encounter other edge cases depending on your specific setup. For instance, if your main application also uses subdomains for other features, you may need to adjust your routing configuration accordingly.

For a deeper dive, I would recommend looking into the official Laravel documentation on routing and service providers. The "Laravel From Scratch" series by Jeffrey Way from Laracasts is a valuable practical resource that covers topics like these in detail. Additionally, understanding the underlying mechanism of virtual hosts in Nginx (or Apache) is crucial, and the official documentation for these services will give you the most concrete understanding of server configuration. Finally, for specific details about Laravel Nova’s configuration options, review the official Laravel Nova documentation. Good understanding of these resources will not only assist in setting Nova up on a subdomain, but also help with many future challenges in the Laravel and server setup domains.

These resources, along with the code snippets above, should get you across the finish line and allow you to effectively deploy Laravel Nova on a subdomain. This approach has worked reliably for me, and I hope it proves as effective for you.
