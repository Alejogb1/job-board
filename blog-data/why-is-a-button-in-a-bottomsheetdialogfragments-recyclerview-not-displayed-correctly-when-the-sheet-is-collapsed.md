Ah, that’s a familiar scenario, one I recall troubleshooting extensively a few years back during a project migrating a legacy android app. The problem of a button within a recycler view inside a bottom sheet dialog fragment not displaying correctly, or even disappearing entirely, when the sheet is collapsed stems from the complex interplay of layout constraints, view lifecycles, and the bottom sheet's inherent behavior. It isn't a bug per se, but rather a consequence of how views are measured and drawn, and how the bottom sheet interacts with them during its animation cycles.

Let's break it down methodically. The heart of the issue often resides in how the `BottomSheetDialogFragment` handles layout updates. When it’s expanded, the views within the RecyclerView are given sufficient space, and things generally appear as expected. However, during the collapse, the layout constraints imposed by the bottom sheet take precedence. The key here is understanding that the bottom sheet mechanism dynamically adjusts its own size and position, which directly affects its child views.

Specifically, the recycler view and its internal viewholders (which contain the button in question) may find themselves partially or fully obscured by the bottom sheet’s reduced height. It's not that the button vanishes; it's more accurate to say that it is rendered outside the visible bounds or is covered up. This effect is compounded by a couple of factors: the RecyclerView's inherent need for a fixed size or a known parent dimension to calculate layout correctly and the bottom sheet's animated transitions.

The initial measurement pass, performed during the layout phase, might not account for the collapsed state, especially if the initial height is calculated based on the expanded view. This leaves views positioned where they were calculated to be in the expanded state. Then, during the collapse animation, the view hierarchy moves, and the button can end up outside the visible portion of the screen or masked behind other views in the dialog. This is usually because during the collapse animation, the actual layout of the recycler view and its child items may not be recalculated according to the new reduced size of the sheet.

The problem might also be exacerbated if you're using a custom layout manager that isn't carefully designed to work with dynamic size changes or nested scrolling. Some layout managers perform their calculations only once and are not responsive to layout changes that happen during animations. A standard linear layout manager will often behave correctly because it is simple and built with dynamic layouts in mind, but you might run into trouble with custom or complex ones.

Here's the approach I’ve generally found successful in diagnosing and resolving this. It’s a bit more involved than a quick fix, but it covers the bases. First, verify that all of your parent layout dimensions are correctly configured. Ensure the root layout of your item view is set up to accommodate dynamic height changes correctly. Often, a simple linear layout will work effectively as it calculates dimensions every time its views are re-laid out but nested `ConstraintLayouts` can introduce complexities with measuring, so it is important to be careful with their constraints. Also, make sure your recycler view uses a correctly configured layout manager; `LinearLayoutManager` works fine most of the time, but be careful if you are using a custom one.

Second, check your RecyclerView’s adapter implementation. There may be a problem with the logic, especially if the data used to populate your adapter changes after the bottom sheet is displayed and before it's collapsed.

Third, look into explicitly handling the bottom sheet's state changes. By implementing a `BottomSheetCallback`, you can gain insight into the animation’s progress and take corrective action. When the bottom sheet transitions, you may need to trigger a re-layout of the recycler view to ensure the children are displayed correctly. The code examples below illustrate some of these steps.

**Code Example 1: Setting Up the BottomSheetDialogFragment with a RecyclerView**

```kotlin
import android.os.Bundle
import android.view.LayoutInflater
import android.view.View
import android.view.ViewGroup
import androidx.recyclerview.widget.LinearLayoutManager
import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
import com.google.android.material.bottomsheet.BottomSheetDialogFragment

class MyBottomSheetDialogFragment : BottomSheetDialogFragment() {

    private lateinit var recyclerView: RecyclerView
    private lateinit var adapter: MyAdapter

    override fun onCreateView(inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?): View? {
        val view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_bottom_sheet, container, false)
        recyclerView = view.findViewById(R.id.recycler_view)
        recyclerView.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(requireContext())
        adapter = MyAdapter(listOf("Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4", "Item 5"))
        recyclerView.adapter = adapter
        return view
    }

     // Assume you have a simplified MyAdapter here. For brevity purposes I'm not including all of the boilerplate for a viewholder.
     private inner class MyAdapter(private val items:List<String>) : RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerView.ViewHolder>() {
         override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
               val view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context).inflate(R.layout.list_item, parent, false)
               return object: RecyclerView.ViewHolder(view) {}
           }

           override fun getItemCount() = items.size
           override fun onBindViewHolder(holder:RecyclerView.ViewHolder, position:Int) {
                // here you could configure the views of the list_item layout
               // typically, you’d set the content of the button here etc
           }
     }


     companion object {
        fun newInstance(): MyBottomSheetDialogFragment {
            return MyBottomSheetDialogFragment()
        }
    }
}
```

This snippet sets up the basic bottom sheet with a recycler view using a basic linear layout manager. This will likely work, but it doesn't account for the animation callbacks.

**Code Example 2: Handling BottomSheetCallback to force a RecyclerView update**

```kotlin
import android.os.Bundle
import android.view.LayoutInflater
import android.view.View
import android.view.ViewGroup
import androidx.recyclerview.widget.LinearLayoutManager
import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
import com.google.android.material.bottomsheet.BottomSheetBehavior
import com.google.android.material.bottomsheet.BottomSheetDialogFragment

class MyBottomSheetDialogFragment : BottomSheetDialogFragment() {

    private lateinit var recyclerView: RecyclerView
    private lateinit var adapter: MyAdapter

    override fun onCreateView(inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?): View? {
        val view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_bottom_sheet, container, false)
        recyclerView = view.findViewById(R.id.recycler_view)
        recyclerView.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(requireContext())
        adapter = MyAdapter(listOf("Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4", "Item 5"))
        recyclerView.adapter = adapter

        return view
    }

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)
        dialog?.let {
            val bottomSheet = it.findViewById<View>(com.google.android.material.R.id.design_bottom_sheet)
            val behavior = BottomSheetBehavior.from(bottomSheet)

            behavior.addBottomSheetCallback(object : BottomSheetBehavior.BottomSheetCallback() {
                override fun onStateChanged(bottomSheet: View, newState: Int) {
                   // We might want to update the adapter based on the different state changes.

                    if (newState == BottomSheetBehavior.STATE_COLLAPSED) {
                        //  force a re-layout of the RecyclerView
                         recyclerView.requestLayout()
                     }
                }

                override fun onSlide(bottomSheet: View, slideOffset: Float) {
                }
            })
        }
    }


    // the adapter remains the same
     private inner class MyAdapter(private val items:List<String>) : RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerView.ViewHolder>() {
         override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
               val view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context).inflate(R.layout.list_item, parent, false)
               return object: RecyclerView.ViewHolder(view) {}
           }

           override fun getItemCount() = items.size
           override fun onBindViewHolder(holder:RecyclerView.ViewHolder, position:Int) {
                // here you could configure the views of the list_item layout
               // typically, you’d set the content of the button here etc
           }
     }



    companion object {
        fun newInstance(): MyBottomSheetDialogFragment {
            return MyBottomSheetDialogFragment()
        }
    }
}
```

This illustrates using the bottom sheet callback. Here, when the sheet is collapsed, the recycler view will be forced to request a layout. This simple but effective method handles most of these problems.

**Code Example 3: Handling Layout Issues in the Item View**
```xml
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:padding="16dp">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/item_text"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:textSize="16sp"
        />


    <Button
         android:id="@+id/item_button"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="My Button"
        android:layout_gravity="center_horizontal" />
</LinearLayout>
```

Here, I’ve ensured the parent layout is a simple LinearLayout, and the button is using `wrap_content`, making it easier for the layout manager to position them dynamically. Make sure that you don't have specific heights or other constraints set on your button that would cause it to render incorrectly in the collapse state. Be mindful of potential conflicts with layouts. Also make sure you use the most simple and robust layout possible to render the individual item. Complex layouts often have problems when being rendered under dynamic changes.

For further understanding, I highly recommend “Android UI Fundamentals” by Jason Clark. He delves deeply into how Android's view system works, which provides a solid base for tackling these layout challenges. Also, explore the documentation of `BottomSheetDialogFragment` and `BottomSheetBehavior` directly on the Android Developer site; the insights they offer are invaluable for practical application. Lastly, for a more formal mathematical treatment of layout algorithms, the graphics gem series "Graphics Gems I-V" edited by Andrew Glassner, and the book "Real-Time Rendering" by Tomas Akenine-Moller et al. are excellent resources that provide a solid understanding of the underlying layout systems and algorithms.

By systematically approaching the layout issues, handling callbacks, and choosing simpler layouts in conjunction with well-defined view adapters, you can create bottom sheet interactions that are both smooth and predictable, even under the dynamic conditions that a bottom sheet brings with it.
