Okay, let's tackle this. It's a question I’ve bumped into a few times, especially when architecting more complex neural network topologies within Vertex AI’s training pipelines. The challenge, as I understand it, isn’t about *if* you can define a list of `hidden_units`, but rather *how* to correctly feed it into the framework such that it’s interpreted as an architectural definition rather than some misconstrued parameter.

Often, we encounter this issue because, by default, many Vertex AI training interfaces (like the `CustomJob` or even specific pre-built estimator classes) expect a single integer for `hidden_units` when referring to the number of neurons in a single hidden layer. Specifying a *list* becomes pertinent when you’re building multi-layer perceptrons or similarly structured models where each layer might have a different number of units. You can’t simply pass `hidden_units = [128, 64, 32]` directly into, say, a standard `tf.keras.layers.Dense` setup *within* the training configuration. Instead, you've got to architect your model construction process to consume this list as the intended blueprint for layer structure.

Let me explain this with specific examples, drawing from experiences in previous projects where we were pushing the limits of the platform. The first scenario I often see is a naive attempt at overriding a configuration parameter without touching the model creation function, leading to errors as the system expects a simple integer, and we’re providing a list. Let's consider a simplified Keras model definition:

**Example 1: The Incorrect Approach (for demonstration purposes)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def build_incorrect_model(hidden_units):
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_units, activation='relu'), # Expects an int, receives a list
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])
  return model

# Later, in your Vertex AI training script
# Here, a list is used, leading to errors
hidden_units_list = [128, 64]

try:
    model = build_incorrect_model(hidden_units_list)
    model.summary()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this simplified snippet, the intent is clear: create a model with a first hidden layer of, say, 128 units, and a final output layer. The `build_incorrect_model` expects a single integer for `hidden_units`. Passing a list like `[128, 64]` to it throws an error because it doesn’t align with the function's expectations. This highlights a fundamental issue: we must explicitly interpret that list within our model creation.

Now, let’s move into a practical, and correct way, to achieve the desired outcome of varying the number of units in multiple hidden layers using `hidden_units` as a list. Here are two examples:

**Example 2: The Correct Approach with a Simple Loop**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def build_correct_model_loop(hidden_units):
  layers = []
  for units in hidden_units:
      layers.append(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='relu'))
  layers.append(tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
  model = tf.keras.Sequential(layers)
  return model

# In Vertex AI training script
hidden_units_list = [128, 64, 32]

model = build_correct_model_loop(hidden_units_list)
model.summary()

```

This code presents the proper approach. The `build_correct_model_loop` function now accepts the list `hidden_units` and iterates through it, creating a `Dense` layer for each element in the list. The output layer remains fixed at 10 units for this example. This structure now correctly interprets a list of integers, producing the desired multi-layered architecture.

However, what if you have more complex architecture requirements where you need different activation functions or need to add batch norm between layers? A common requirement, then, might be to utilize a more extensible approach.

**Example 3: Flexible Hidden Layers Using List Comprehension**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def build_flexible_model(hidden_layer_specs):
    layers = [tf.keras.layers.Dense(spec['units'], activation=spec.get('activation', 'relu'))
              for spec in hidden_layer_specs]
    layers.append(tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
    model = tf.keras.Sequential(layers)
    return model

# In Vertex AI training script, providing a configuration spec.
hidden_layer_specs = [
    {'units': 128, 'activation': 'relu'},
    {'units': 64, 'activation': 'tanh'},
    {'units': 32, 'activation': 'relu'}
]

model = build_flexible_model(hidden_layer_specs)
model.summary()
```

In Example 3, I’ve moved to use a list of dictionaries rather than a simple list of integers, `hidden_layer_specs`. This permits even greater flexibility. Now, for each hidden layer, you can specify the number of units *and* the activation function. I’ve added a `.get('activation', 'relu')` method to demonstrate optional activation functions with a fallback to 'relu' if none are specified, further solidifying robustness of the design. This design easily handles both the case where you only want a standard multi-layer perceptron with variable units *and* the case where you desire different activation functions per layer. You can easily expand this to encapsulate even more fine-grained layer specifications, such as using dropout, batch norm and others.

In terms of incorporating these into your Vertex AI setup, you'll typically define the model-building function within your training script, and then within the definition of your training pipeline parameters (often in a python dictionary or within a `training_input` configuration for `CustomJob`), you'd pass either `hidden_units_list` (Example 2) or `hidden_layer_specs` (Example 3) to your model creation function. The key insight is this: the model creation function needs to parse this list, it isn't something that Vertex AI will automatically interpret in a magical way.

To deepen your knowledge, I’d suggest consulting:

1.  **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This textbook provides the foundational theory needed to truly understand neural network architectures.
2.  **The Tensorflow API Documentation:** Specifically, the documentation pertaining to `tf.keras.layers` will be invaluable in mastering flexible layer construction.
3.  **Papers on Hyperparameter Optimization:** While not directly related to hidden unit specification, research on efficient hyperparameter tuning will often include discussion about varying network architectures. Pay attention to any papers that touch on neural architecture search (NAS) to further your understanding.

In summary, you don't directly set `hidden_units` as a list in Vertex AI. Instead, you structure your model building logic to *consume* a list of unit configurations, whether that's a simple list of integers or a list of dictionaries detailing specific configurations. It’s about building your model correctly to take in the list and interpret it for layer construction, rather than hoping that Vertex AI knows what to do with a list directly. The above methods, in my experience, form a strong and adaptable solution for a wide array of model architectures.
