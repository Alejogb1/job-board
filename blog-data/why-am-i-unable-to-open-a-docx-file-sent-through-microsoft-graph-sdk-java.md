Alright, let's break down why you might be encountering issues opening a docx file received via the Microsoft Graph SDK for Java. I've certainly tripped over this specific scenario a few times in my years, and the devil, as they say, is often in the details. The problem isn't usually with the graph api itself, but rather in how the data is being handled and interpreted on the java side.

First off, it’s crucial to understand what you’re actually receiving from the Graph API when requesting file content. You're not getting a raw file stream in the traditional sense. The Graph API often returns file contents as a byte array, which needs to be correctly processed into a usable file format. Let's say you're calling the `/me/drive/items/{item-id}/content` endpoint. The response's body doesn't automatically materialize into a `docx` file. Instead, it’s a stream of bytes you must handle appropriately. This step, the transformation from bytes to file, is where most of the common problems arise. This particular transformation demands careful attention to input/output streams, potentially alongside some error handling.

One of the primary problems i’ve encountered is mishandling the response's content type, especially if it’s not strictly defined as `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`. This lack of a strict content type might occur due to the internal workings of the MS Graph API, or specific configurations, but whatever the reason, if you don't verify this you may be trying to save a blob as a file with a `docx` extension that it is not. While often the header will be correct, it is a good habit to check and ensure. In several cases, i've also found that intermediaries, such as poorly configured proxies, can corrupt the data, so confirming this is also a good troubleshooting step. Another major culprit is not properly flushing or closing streams which can leave incomplete data written to your file. This is where proper exception handling and using try-with-resources can help you keep a handle on your input/output stream management.

To illustrate the proper handling, let me share some examples. Consider the following snippet where I've specifically dealt with content streams in past projects when working with the graph api and files:

```java
import com.microsoft.graph.models.DriveItem;
import com.microsoft.graph.requests.GraphServiceClient;
import com.microsoft.graph.core.ClientException;

import okhttp3.Request;
import okhttp3.ResponseBody;
import okio.BufferedSink;
import okio.Okio;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;


public class GraphFileDownloader {

    private final GraphServiceClient graphClient;

    public GraphFileDownloader(GraphServiceClient graphClient) {
        this.graphClient = graphClient;
    }

    public void downloadFile(String itemId, String filePath) throws IOException {
        try {
            DriveItem driveItem = graphClient.me().drive().items(itemId).buildRequest().get();

             Request request = graphClient.me().drive().items(itemId).content().buildRequest().getHttpRequest();

            okhttp3.Response response = graphClient.getHttpProvider().getHttpClient().newCall(request).execute();

            if (!response.isSuccessful()){
                  throw new IOException("Failed to download file. HTTP Status: " + response.code());
             }

            try (ResponseBody responseBody = response.body()){

              if (responseBody == null){
                   throw new IOException("Response body is null.");
               }

               Path path = Paths.get(filePath);
              try (BufferedSink sink = Okio.buffer(Okio.sink(Files.newOutputStream(path)))) {
                    sink.write(responseBody.bytes());
                }

             }


        } catch (ClientException ex) {
            System.err.println("Error downloading file: " + ex.getMessage());
            throw new IOException("Failed to download file: " + ex.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, instead of directly trying to read a generic input stream, I am leveraging the okhttp library's features for the lower-level request execution and response body handling which provides better handling of bytes.  This method also performs essential checks for a successful response code and verifies the response body isn't null, preventing common exceptions. Further, i am using the `Okio` library to perform I/O operations for byte handling, which gives you a lot of flexibility and guarantees that stream processing will be effective.

Another common issue comes when handling large files. Loading entire byte arrays into memory can be problematic. In such cases, one must use streaming techniques to process the data incrementally. You can adapt the previous snippet by writing to disk directly as the response body stream comes in. Consider this improved example, which incorporates streaming and the use of try-with-resources for safer IO handling:

```java
import com.microsoft.graph.models.DriveItem;
import com.microsoft.graph.requests.GraphServiceClient;
import com.microsoft.graph.core.ClientException;


import okhttp3.Request;
import okhttp3.ResponseBody;
import okio.BufferedSink;
import okio.Okio;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.io.InputStream;


public class StreamingGraphFileDownloader {

    private final GraphServiceClient graphClient;

    public StreamingGraphFileDownloader(GraphServiceClient graphClient) {
        this.graphClient = graphClient;
    }

   public void downloadFile(String itemId, String filePath) throws IOException {
       try {
            DriveItem driveItem = graphClient.me().drive().items(itemId).buildRequest().get();

             Request request = graphClient.me().drive().items(itemId).content().buildRequest().getHttpRequest();

            okhttp3.Response response = graphClient.getHttpProvider().getHttpClient().newCall(request).execute();

            if (!response.isSuccessful()){
                throw new IOException("Failed to download file. HTTP Status: " + response.code());
            }

            try (ResponseBody responseBody = response.body()){

               if (responseBody == null){
                   throw new IOException("Response body is null.");
               }

                Path path = Paths.get(filePath);

                try (InputStream inputStream = responseBody.byteStream();
                       BufferedSink sink = Okio.buffer(Okio.sink(Files.newOutputStream(path)))){
                   sink.writeAll(Okio.source(inputStream));
                 }

              }
           } catch (ClientException ex) {
              System.err.println("Error downloading file: " + ex.getMessage());
             throw new IOException("Failed to download file: " + ex.getMessage());
        }
   }
}
```

The key difference here is the usage of `sink.writeAll(Okio.source(inputStream))`. This approach uses `Okio` to efficiently read from the input stream as it becomes available and write it to the sink, preventing large file buffering in memory and reducing the chances of an `OutOfMemoryError` exception.

Lastly, you might encounter problems due to file corruption if the file has been modified on the cloud and not yet fully synced across Microsoft's systems, or if the graph api has not fully committed the file write. Although less likely, I have observed this to occur in the wild, and the only solution is to retry the read after a short delay to ensure consistency of the data. This example demonstrates retrying the file download:

```java
import com.microsoft.graph.models.DriveItem;
import com.microsoft.graph.requests.GraphServiceClient;
import com.microsoft.graph.core.ClientException;
import okhttp3.Request;
import okhttp3.ResponseBody;
import okio.BufferedSink;
import okio.Okio;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class ResilientGraphFileDownloader {

    private final GraphServiceClient graphClient;
    private final int maxRetries = 3;
    private final long retryDelayMillis = 1000; // 1 second

    public ResilientGraphFileDownloader(GraphServiceClient graphClient) {
        this.graphClient = graphClient;
    }

    public void downloadFile(String itemId, String filePath) throws IOException {
        int retryCount = 0;
         while (retryCount < maxRetries) {
          try {

            DriveItem driveItem = graphClient.me().drive().items(itemId).buildRequest().get();

             Request request = graphClient.me().drive().items(itemId).content().buildRequest().getHttpRequest();

            okhttp3.Response response = graphClient.getHttpProvider().getHttpClient().newCall(request).execute();

            if (!response.isSuccessful()){
                  throw new IOException("Failed to download file. HTTP Status: " + response.code());
             }

            try (ResponseBody responseBody = response.body()){

                if (responseBody == null){
                     throw new IOException("Response body is null.");
                }

                 Path path = Paths.get(filePath);
                 try (InputStream inputStream = responseBody.byteStream();
                        BufferedSink sink = Okio.buffer(Okio.sink(Files.newOutputStream(path)))){
                    sink.writeAll(Okio.source(inputStream));
                }
            }
             return; // Successful download, exit loop
           } catch (IOException ex) {
            retryCount++;
            if (retryCount >= maxRetries) {
                 System.err.println("Max retries exceeded, error downloading file: " + ex.getMessage());
               throw new IOException("Failed to download file after multiple retries: " + ex.getMessage());
            }

              try {
                  Thread.sleep(retryDelayMillis);
              } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                  Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    throw new IOException("Download interrupted during retry: " + ex.getMessage());
              }

            System.out.println("Retrying download, attempt: " + retryCount);
         }
         }

       }

}
```

This improved example will ensure that file system I/O is as robust as possible.

To delve deeper into these issues, I'd recommend taking a close look at "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch, specifically the sections on resource management and exception handling. For an understanding of streaming and I/O best practices, the official Java documentation and the “Java I/O and NIO” section from “Java Concurrency in Practice” by Brian Goetz and associates can be exceptionally helpful. For an in-depth understanding of REST APIs including aspects related to the microsoft graph, check out "RESTful Web Services" by Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby. This will provide you with the theoretical foundation needed to understand what is going on with your API interactions and responses, and make better use of them.

In summary, problems opening a `docx` file from the Microsoft Graph SDK often boil down to improper handling of the response body and streams. By using `Okio`, paying close attention to streams, error checking, and proper retry logic, you'll be able to greatly reduce the instances of encountering an unusable file.
