Okay, let's tackle this. Having seen this particular headache pop up in a variety of projects over the years, especially when transitioning from development environments to production-like setups, I can definitely shed some light on why your Flask session might be playing hide-and-seek when using Waitress as your WSGI server. It's not always immediately obvious, and it often stems from a subtle misalignment in how Waitress handles things compared to Flask's built-in development server.

The root of the issue predominantly revolves around how session cookies are managed and how their scope, particularly the domain, is interpreted. The Flask development server is often forgiving. It implicitly defaults to settings that work smoothly on `localhost`. When you switch to Waitress, especially if you're deploying to a server with a specific hostname or behind a proxy, you're in a different ballgame, and the cookie attributes become crucial.

My first encounter with this was during a project where we were rapidly prototyping a web application using Flask. Everything worked flawlessly locally with Flask's `app.run()`. However, upon deploying using Waitress, we noticed that the session data wasn’t persisting. Users were logged out after every request, and the application felt broken. The problem was not the Flask code itself, but rather, how the `Set-Cookie` header was being generated and interpreted by the browser, with differences stemming from the change in server.

Let's unpack the common pitfalls:

1.  **The `SERVER_NAME` Configuration:** When Flask generates session cookies, it needs to know the hostname or domain for which the cookie is valid. Flask often infers this from the incoming request’s host header. When you run `app.run()`, the host is usually 'localhost'. Waitress, on the other hand, typically doesn't make assumptions about hostname. If your `SERVER_NAME` is not set, Flask might use a generic default that may not match your server's hostname, leading to session cookies not being sent back by the browser. The `SERVER_NAME` needs to precisely match the domain where your Waitress server is running, or, if behind a proxy, the public facing domain.

    Here's an example where the session will likely fail on a typical server with Waitress:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, session

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key' # Ensure a strong secret key is set.

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        session['username'] = 'testuser'
        return 'Session set'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True) # Problematic when moving to Waitress without changing the server name.
    ```

    This code will work with Flask's built-in development server due to its implicit assumptions. But deploy this with Waitress, and session storage will be iffy.

2. **Cookie Domain and Path Settings:** Flask’s default session cookie is often scoped to the root path `/` of the domain that is served by waitress. This can be problematic if your application is deployed under a subdirectory of the host or if you have a more complex setup. Waitress, operating on a port, doesn't offer the default behaviour of the `app.run` when it comes to cookie management. To fix this, you must control the cookies directly with Flask's configuration. Specifically, the `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` and the `SESSION_COOKIE_PATH`. These are essential to correctly define the scope of your session cookie. If these are not configured explicitly, they might default to values that don't match the domain on which your application is accessible.

    Here's an example illustrating the explicit configuration that will usually resolve this issue:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, session

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'
    app.config['SERVER_NAME'] = 'yourdomain.com' # Replace with your actual domain
    app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN'] = 'yourdomain.com' # Ensure these match
    app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_PATH'] = '/' # or specify if under a subdir

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        session['username'] = 'testuser'
        return 'Session set'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from waitress import serve
        serve(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080) # Run with Waitress

    ```
    Note here the specific waitress `serve` function and configuration of `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`.

3.  **HTTPS Considerations:** Finally, if your application is served over HTTPS, you'll need to make sure you are explicitly setting the `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` to `True` to make sure the browser will allow the cookies to be set and sent. Additionally, if you use a proxy, such as Nginx, you must configure it properly to forward HTTPS headers. Failure to set these will prevent the session cookie from being sent over HTTPS, and session data will not persist. This is one of the most common reasons I've seen for this issue in a production setting.

   Consider this example which incorporates these security best practices:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, session

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'
    app.config['SERVER_NAME'] = 'yourdomain.com'
    app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN'] = 'yourdomain.com'
    app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_PATH'] = '/'
    app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE'] = True # Secure cookie for HTTPS
    app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY'] = True # Prevent access from JavaScript

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        session['username'] = 'testuser'
        return 'Session set'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from waitress import serve
        serve(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
    ```

    In this final example, we're setting `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, making it mandatory to use `https` for cookies to be sent and `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` to help prevent XSS vulnerabilities by making cookies inaccessible through Javascript. These are critical when working with live production systems.

To truly grasp these nuances and best practices, I'd recommend checking out the following resources. Firstly, the official Flask documentation is a must; it has dedicated sections on session management and configuration, and understanding these is paramount. Secondly, a deeper read into the HTTP specification on cookies (RFC 6265) will give you a better understanding of the low-level mechanics. Finally, if you are deploying behind a proxy, the Nginx documentation for setting the header forwarding settings for `X-Forwarded-Proto` is a very useful read. They’ll give you a solid grounding to approach these issues confidently.

In conclusion, while the Flask development server does its best to make development as smooth as possible, transitioning to a production-like environment with Waitress requires careful consideration of cookie configuration settings. By explicitly defining `SERVER_NAME`, `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`, `SESSION_COOKIE_PATH`, and handling security aspects using `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` you can effectively ensure your Flask sessions persist as intended, thus saving hours debugging. I’ve been there, and these are the core elements that will get you running successfully.
