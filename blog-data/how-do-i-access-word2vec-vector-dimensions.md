Let’s tackle this word2vec dimensionality question head-on. It's something I've navigated on several occasions, often finding myself explaining the nuances to junior colleagues. The heart of the matter is understanding how word2vec, or similar embedding techniques, translate words into numerical vectors and then how you can access and manipulate those resulting vector representations. This isn’t about vague interpretations, but rather about concrete methods, grounded in practical coding.

Word2vec, in essence, is a neural network that learns to predict words based on their context (or vice-versa, depending on the chosen architecture - CBOW or Skip-gram). The 'vector' part comes from the weights of the hidden layer in this network; these weights, when learned, become the numerical representation of a word. The number of elements in this vector—the dimensionality—is a hyperparameter you set during the model training phase. It significantly impacts the quality and computational cost of your embeddings. Typically, you'll see values between 100 and 500, though some applications might go lower or higher. The key is balancing semantic representation power with resource efficiency. Choosing too low a dimensionality might not capture the subtleties in word relationships, whereas excessively high dimensionality can be computationally expensive and might lead to overfitting.

Now, accessing these dimensions isn't some arcane, hidden trick. It's about querying the model after training. Here's where familiarity with the implementation matters. I'll demonstrate using Python with `gensim`, which is a widely-used library for topic modeling and natural language processing and a frequent tool in my projects.

Let’s begin with a basic example. I'll show you how to train a simple word2vec model and then how to peek into the vector dimensions:

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import numpy as np

# Sample sentences for training
sentences = [
    ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"],
    ["jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"],
    ["the", "fox", "is", "quick"]
]

# Train the Word2Vec model
model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, sg=0)

# Access the vector for the word 'fox'
vector_fox = model.wv['fox']
print(f"Shape of 'fox' vector: {vector_fox.shape}") # Output: Shape of 'fox' vector: (100,)

# Access an element of the vector, for example, the 20th dimension.
print(f"20th dimension of 'fox' vector: {vector_fox[19]}") # Output will vary depending on trained model

# You can also directly access the dimensions of other words.
vector_lazy = model.wv['lazy']
print(f"Shape of 'lazy' vector: {vector_lazy.shape}")  # Output: Shape of 'lazy' vector: (100,)

# Inspect a sample dimension in numpy array
print(f"55th dimension of 'lazy' vector: {vector_lazy[54]}")  # Output will vary depending on trained model

```

In this snippet, you first define a basic set of sentences, which will be used to train our `Word2Vec` model. Crucially, `vector_size=100` sets the dimensionality of the embedding space to 100. The `model.wv` attribute gives you a collection of all words with their respective vectors and we access them by directly using the word as an index, which returns a NumPy array (which we've referred to here as vector_fox, vector_lazy etc.). The `.shape` attribute allows you to see the size of the vector, confirming that we have 100 dimensions, and we also can access specific elements through index notation. This is the fundamental mechanism for accessing any dimension. The values shown will vary from run to run because the weights are randomly initialized and training involves randomness.

Now, what happens if we need to examine the entire vector space, not just individual words? Let’s say you’re analyzing patterns in the vector space. You’d want the embedding matrix itself.

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import numpy as np

# Sample sentences for training (reusing the previous)
sentences = [
    ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"],
    ["jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"],
    ["the", "fox", "is", "quick"]
]

# Train the Word2Vec model
model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, sg=0)

# Get the entire vocabulary
vocabulary = model.wv.index_to_key

# Initialize an empty matrix for our embeddings
embedding_matrix = np.zeros((len(vocabulary), model.vector_size))

# Populate matrix with embeddings for each word
for i, word in enumerate(vocabulary):
  embedding_matrix[i] = model.wv[word]

# Lets view the shape of this matrix:
print(f"Shape of Embedding Matrix: {embedding_matrix.shape}")  # Output: Shape of Embedding Matrix: (8, 100)

# Inspect the values of a specific row (word) and dimension
row_number = 4 # for example
dimension_number = 10 # for example
print(f"Value at row {row_number}, dimension {dimension_number}: {embedding_matrix[row_number][dimension_number]}") # Output will vary depending on trained model
```

Here, we obtain the vocabulary (all the unique words) from the model. Then, we create a `numpy` matrix to store the vectors for each word using `model.vector_size` to get the dimension of vector of each word. The dimension of this embedding matrix is equal to the size of vocabulary multiplied by the size of each embedding (100 in our case). From here you can inspect the values in various rows (words) and columns (dimensions)

Finally, you might need to use these vectors in more complex calculations. Let’s say you want to determine the cosine similarity between two words:

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
from numpy import dot
from numpy.linalg import norm

# Sample sentences for training (reusing the previous)
sentences = [
    ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"],
    ["jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"],
    ["the", "fox", "is", "quick"]
]

# Train the Word2Vec model
model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, sg=0)

# Function to compute cosine similarity
def cosine_similarity(vec_a, vec_b):
    return dot(vec_a, vec_b) / (norm(vec_a) * norm(vec_b))

# Get the vectors for 'fox' and 'dog'
vector_fox = model.wv['fox']
vector_dog = model.wv['dog']

# Calculate cosine similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity(vector_fox, vector_dog)
print(f"Cosine similarity between 'fox' and 'dog': {similarity}")  # Output will vary depending on trained model
```

This last example builds upon earlier points, demonstrating how you can readily use the vectors for downstream tasks, such as cosine similarity, a core technique for evaluating semantic similarity. If the calculated value is near 1.0, it suggests the vectors (and thus words) are very similar while a value near -1.0 would indicate dissimilarity.

If you are seriously venturing into embeddings beyond the toy examples I’ve presented here, I highly recommend spending time with the original `word2vec` paper, "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" by Mikolov et al. They provide the theoretical framework for understanding the model. Also, the textbook "Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin provides extensive coverage of natural language processing concepts, including word embeddings, within a broader theoretical context. Additionally, “Natural Language Processing with Python” by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper is very practical and will help you with hands-on approaches to manipulating textual data, including working with word vectors.

These resources will ground you not only in the practicalities I've outlined here but also in the underlying theory, enabling you to navigate more nuanced situations as you advance in this domain. In essence, accessing word vector dimensions is not about hidden tricks, but about leveraging the established methods within the chosen library or framework. The key is to understand how the vectors are stored and how to access them.
