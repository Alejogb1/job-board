Okay, let’s tackle this. I’ve certainly seen my share of convoluted model architectures over the years, and the need to surgically alter a cnn by removing its input layer isn’t as uncommon as one might think. I remember a project back at 'TechFlow Innovations' where we were dealing with a pre-trained model, meant for image classification, but we needed it to act as a feature extractor for an entirely different kind of data—specifically, time series. The input layer was completely unsuitable. Here’s how we approached the challenge, and some general methods I've used since:

The core issue when wanting to remove a cnn's input layer lies in modifying the model's architecture to accept a tensor with different dimensions than the initial designed input shape. The input layer itself, typically a `tf.keras.layers.Input` layer in tensorflow/keras or an equivalent in other frameworks, serves to define the expected tensor shape that feeds into the network. To “remove” it, in essence, means bypassing this initial layer and directing input directly to a subsequent layer. It's less about deleting code and more about redefining connection points.

Here's how one might approach this depending on how your model is structured:

**Scenario 1: Sequential Model**

If the cnn is built using `tf.keras.models.Sequential`, it's typically straightforward. The input layer is essentially the first layer in the stack. You'd need to construct a new sequential model starting from the layer *after* the input.

Let’s assume we have a sequential model `original_model` and its structure is something like this (simplified for demonstration):

```python
import tensorflow as tf

original_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 3)), # Input layer, 28x28 RGB images
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

To remove the input layer, we simply start with the second layer onwards:

```python
# Extract the layers after the input layer
layers_to_use = original_model.layers[1:]

# Construct the new model, starting with the first relevant layer
new_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(layers_to_use)

# Since there’s no explicit input layer, we now need to specify input dimensions when calling the new model
# For example, if we are using this model to extract features from a convolutional layer:
sample_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 26, 26, 32)) # Assuming output of first conv layer is (26, 26, 32)
output = new_model(sample_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}") # The new output would be based on the model defined by the remaining layers

```

In this example, `new_model` no longer has an explicit input layer and expects a tensor matching the output dimensions of the preceding layer in `original_model`, in this case (26, 26, 32). The important change here is that there is no implicit input shaping, which would happen with the tf.keras.layers.Input layer.

**Scenario 2: Functional API Model**

The Functional API in Keras offers more flexibility, so removing an input layer there requires a slightly different approach, typically by grabbing the output of the desired 'new' input layer. Assume `original_model` was defined using the functional API:

```python
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 3))
x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_tensor)
x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
output_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

original_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
```

To create a new model without the initial input layer, we effectively use the tensor that was output from the initial convolutional layer and declare it as the input to our new model:

```python
# Locate the output of the first convolutional layer. In our case this is called ‘x’
# Here we use the functional API to create the new model:

new_input_tensor = original_model.layers[1].output # Extract the second layer’s output
new_output_tensor = original_model.output # The last layer’s output
new_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=new_input_tensor, outputs=new_output_tensor)

# Sample usage:
sample_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 26, 26, 32)) # Output of the Conv2D layer, (26x26 with 32 channels after the first convolution)
output = new_model(sample_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")

```

Here, we’re essentially “re-wiring” the model to take a specific tensor as its new input. The `original_model.layers[1].output` grabs the symbolic output tensor of the first convolution layer and we use that as the input to the new model we are creating.

**Scenario 3: Subclassed Models**

If the model was created using a custom class that subclasses `tf.keras.Model`, things get a bit more granular. The structure depends entirely on how you've written the `call` method. We'd need to examine your code to determine precisely how to skip the initial layers but, in general, you'd need to adjust how you are performing the forward pass and ensure that you are beginning your processing from the desired tensor location within the network. Let’s look at a simplified example:

```python
class CustomCNN(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')
        self.pool = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))
        self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')


    def call(self, inputs):
      x = self.conv1(inputs)
      x = self.pool(x)
      x = self.flatten(x)
      return self.dense(x)

original_custom_model = CustomCNN()
# Sample input for the original model:
sample_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 28, 28, 3))
original_output = original_custom_model(sample_input)
print(f"Original output shape: {original_output.shape}")

```
To remove the input layer you will need to override the `call` method of this model to begin from the output of the `conv1` layer:
```python
class ModifiedCustomCNN(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, original_model):
    super(ModifiedCustomCNN, self).__init__()
    self.original_model = original_model
    self.pool = original_model.pool
    self.flatten = original_model.flatten
    self.dense = original_model.dense

  def call(self, inputs): # We can ignore our initial layer and instead begin with the output of the layer conv1
    x = self.pool(inputs)
    x = self.flatten(x)
    return self.dense(x)

modified_model = ModifiedCustomCNN(original_custom_model)

# Sample input that begins with the output of the conv1 layer (26, 26, 32) as input:
new_sample_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 26, 26, 32))
modified_output = modified_model(new_sample_input)
print(f"Modified output shape: {modified_output.shape}")

```
In this example, we are taking the original model and creating a new model which overrides the `call` method so that it begins from the desired layer by calling the `pool` layer of the original model. Effectively, this means we are bypassing the input tensor that would be implied in the custom model class in the original `original_custom_model` and we are directly passing in an input which would represent the output of the `conv1` layer.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Input Shape Matching:** When removing the input layer, ensure that the input to the new model matches the expected tensor shape based on the structure of the layer you are starting from. Failure to do this will result in dimension mismatch errors.
*   **Weight Transfers:** When you remove an input layer, you're generally retaining all weights, but you're changing the *input* expected to flow through the network. No weights are actually being deleted as a part of this.
*   **Debugging:** Debugging this kind of manipulation can be challenging if your network is large. Using `model.summary()` or similar tools to inspect layers is very helpful to verify tensor shapes at various stages of a model’s flow.
*   **Framework variations**: The actual syntax might differ slightly if you're using pytorch rather than tensorflow, but the basic principle remains the same: you're re-routing data flow to start at a later stage within your pre-existing model.

**Further Reading:**

For an in-depth understanding of the keras Functional API I would recommend the Keras documentation directly. Another very useful general resource when dealing with issues such as this is the deep learning textbook by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville, which you can find online as a pdf. Specifically chapters 6 and 12 would be very helpful, but the entire book is essential for any serious practitioner.

In conclusion, while "removing" a cnn input layer might sound like a significant change, it's essentially about redefining the starting point of the model's data processing. By understanding how models are built and utilizing framework specific methods you can surgically alter a model to fit your specific needs. It's an operation I've found immensely beneficial in various real-world projects, and these examples should put you on the right path.
