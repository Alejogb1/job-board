,  I recall a particularly gnarly project back in 2018, a scraping endeavor for a legacy e-commerce site – you wouldn't believe the markup they were using – where we faced precisely this issue. Extracting multiple text elements based on partial `href` values is a common scraping hurdle, and it demands a blend of precise selection and robust error handling. Fundamentally, we’re talking about situations where the anchor tags don't have unique, easily predictable `href` attributes, and we need to leverage substring matching to target our desired content. It's more intricate than just simple `querySelector` usage.

The core problem stems from the structure of many websites. Rather than having perfect, predictable `href` patterns, we often encounter links like `/product/detail/12345`, `/product/detail/67890`, etc. If you only want product names from a subset of these pages, perhaps where the identifier begins with `1` or `2`, you can't simply target by full `href`. So, partial matching becomes essential.

My preferred approach, and the one I've found to be most consistently reliable, revolves around using XPath or similar selector mechanisms that allow for substring checks. While CSS selectors are convenient, they often fall short when needing this level of granularity. I prefer to use tools that interact directly with the document object model (dom) as much as possible. And frankly, in the wild, not all HTML is perfectly valid, hence dom-aware parsing rather than simple regex-based selection often pays off.

Let's break this down into some practical examples. For this first example, let's use the browser’s native capabilities, as JavaScript will be our primary workhorse.

**Example 1: Using JavaScript’s Native DOM Manipulation with `querySelectorAll` and `startsWith`**

Here, we'll use `querySelectorAll` combined with `startsWith` string operation to filter based on partial `href` matches. This method avoids external libraries and is straightforward to implement for simpler cases:

```javascript
function extractTextByPartialHref(partialHref, parentElement = document) {
  const elements = Array.from(parentElement.querySelectorAll('a')); // Convert NodeList to Array
  return elements.filter(el => el.href.startsWith(partialHref))
                 .map(el => el.textContent.trim());
}

//Example Usage:
// Assuming a HTML structure that contains anchors, something like this
//  <a href="/product/detail/12345">Product One</a>
//  <a href="/product/detail/23456">Product Two</a>
//  <a href="/category/list/78901">Category One</a>
//  <a href="/product/detail/18901">Product Three</a>
//  <a href="/blog/post/23456">Blog Post</a>

const partialMatch = "/product/detail/1";
const productNames = extractTextByPartialHref(partialMatch);

console.log(productNames); // Output: [ "Product One", "Product Three" ]
```

In this example, the function iterates through all `<a>` elements in the document, filters those whose `href` starts with the provided partial match, and returns an array of trimmed text contents from matching elements. The explicit conversion to an array allows use of the standard JavaScript array methods, which increases efficiency compared with directly iterating through a NodeList.

This method works reasonably well for relatively simple cases. However, I've often encountered situations where the `href` structure is less consistent, perhaps with URL parameters appended. In such scenarios, we might need regular expressions. Let's consider that next.

**Example 2: Using JavaScript with Regular Expressions**

Here’s how you might tackle more complex `href` patterns using regular expressions:

```javascript
function extractTextByRegexHref(regexPattern, parentElement = document) {
  const elements = Array.from(parentElement.querySelectorAll('a'));
  const regex = new RegExp(regexPattern);
    return elements
           .filter(el => regex.test(el.href))
           .map(el => el.textContent.trim());

}

//Example Usage:
// Using same HTML as in Example 1

const regexMatch = "/product/detail/\\d{1,2}"; // regex to find product details that start with /product/detail/ and contains 1 or two digits at the end
const filteredNames = extractTextByRegexHref(regexMatch);
console.log(filteredNames); // Output: ["Product One", "Product Two", "Product Three"]
```

This approach introduces the flexibility of regular expressions. By defining a pattern, I can accommodate variations in `href` formatting. For instance, `/product/detail/\\d{1,2}` allows us to find all product detail pages with an identifier comprising one or two numerical digits. It's important to craft your regex carefully. I've lost count of the hours spent debugging edge cases with overly permissive or overly specific regex patterns; its essential to test your regex patterns thoroughly.

However, these javascript based solutions are not always suitable, especially for server side scraping or automated tasks in other programming languages. Therefore, for my next example, let’s move out of the browser and into the land of Python with the `lxml` library, a very solid piece of technology for parsing XML and HTML.

**Example 3: Python with lxml and XPath**

For robust server-side scraping, I've always found `lxml` and XPath to be a potent combination. It allows for significantly more specific queries against the DOM structure. I usually prefer it as the most solid solution. This is how I would tackle the same partial href match problem in Python:

```python
from lxml import html

def extract_text_by_partial_href_xpath(html_content, partial_href):
    tree = html.fromstring(html_content)
    xpath_query = f'//a[starts-with(@href, "{partial_href}")]/text()'
    text_elements = tree.xpath(xpath_query)
    return [text.strip() for text in text_elements]

# Example Usage:
html_content = """
  <a href="/product/detail/12345">Product One</a>
  <a href="/product/detail/23456">Product Two</a>
  <a href="/category/list/78901">Category One</a>
  <a href="/product/detail/18901">Product Three</a>
  <a href="/blog/post/23456">Blog Post</a>
"""

partial_match = "/product/detail/1"
product_names = extract_text_by_partial_href_xpath(html_content, partial_match)
print(product_names) # Output: ['Product One', 'Product Three']
```

This Python example showcases the power of XPath. The XPath expression `//a[starts-with(@href, "{partial_href}")]/text()` directly targets `<a>` elements whose `href` attribute starts with our desired partial value, and then selects its text content. It’s a very precise method that I have found incredibly reliable over the years. Also, using the `f` strings of python adds more flexibility.

For further exploration, I highly recommend delving into resources on XPath, such as "XPath: A Programmer's Guide" by Michael Kay, which offers comprehensive coverage of the language. For parsing and scraping in Python, "Web Scraping with Python" by Ryan Mitchell is also an invaluable reference. For more general web standards, especially how the Document Object Model works, the official documentation from the W3C is a must read. These resources provided the solid foundations for my practical work.

In summary, while extracting text elements using partial `href` values can appear complex, using the correct tools and techniques makes the process efficient and manageable. The examples above are very real-world, and reflect the sort of problems I've faced countless times when dealing with imperfect real-world HTML. The chosen approach often hinges on the complexity of the `href` patterns and the specific requirements of your task. Each strategy presented here provides different benefits, from the straightforwardness of JavaScript `startsWith` to the expressive power of XPath. It’s about picking the right tool for the job.
