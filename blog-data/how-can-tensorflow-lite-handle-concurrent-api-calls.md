Alright, let’s tackle this. Concurrent api calls with tensorflow lite, particularly when it comes to the mobile and embedded space, can present a few interesting challenges. I’ve seen this issue play out on a few different projects, notably a real-time object detection app targeting low-power devices and a separate project involving edge inference for sensor data. Both required careful consideration of how we manage multiple requests against a single tflite interpreter.

The core problem arises from the fact that a standard tflite interpreter instance, as typically created, isn't inherently thread-safe. This means that attempting to simultaneously run inference from multiple threads against a single interpreter object will often result in undefined behavior, race conditions, and, quite frequently, crashes. I’ve debugged this type of scenario enough to confidently say that avoiding shared mutable state is paramount here.

To clarify, the ‘standard’ approach, which I've seen many junior developers fall into, is to instantiate a single `tf.lite.Interpreter` and then call `invoke()` across multiple threads. This seems efficient on the surface but creates an almost guaranteed mess. Instead, we have to consider alternative strategies, and there are primarily two effective avenues I've employed: creating individual interpreters per thread, or managing access with a proper synchronization mechanism when sharing a single interpreter.

The first approach, creating individual interpreters, is usually the simpler one. Each thread essentially gets its own private interpreter object, eliminating any risk of race conditions. The downside, naturally, is the increased memory consumption and initialization overhead. When dealing with complex models, and a high degree of concurrency, these factors can become significant. Here's a quick code example illustrating this, using a very basic model creation for demonstration purposes:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import threading

def create_dummy_model():
  #dummy model for example
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
  return model

def run_inference(tflite_file):
  interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path=tflite_file)
  interpreter.allocate_tensors()

  input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
  output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()

  input_data = tf.random.normal(input_details[0]['shape'], dtype=tf.float32)
  interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], input_data)

  interpreter.invoke()

  output_data = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0]['index'])
  print(f"Output from thread: {output_data}")

def main():
  model = create_dummy_model()
  converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
  tflite_model = converter.convert()

  with open("dummy.tflite", "wb") as f:
      f.write(tflite_model)

  threads = []
  for _ in range(3):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=run_inference, args=("dummy.tflite",))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

  for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This example creates a simple tflite model, writes it to file, and then starts several threads, each creating their own `tf.lite.Interpreter` instance and invoking it concurrently. Each interpreter, having no shared mutable state, works without risk of race conditions. If, for example, i tried to share the same interpreter created in main() and passed it into the `run_inference()` method, we'd encounter errors.

Now, let’s consider the alternative: a single interpreter with controlled access. This is more memory-efficient and avoids the overhead of creating multiple interpreters, especially if it's a large or complex model. The approach requires us to employ a locking mechanism, generally using python’s `threading.Lock`. This ensures only one thread can access and interact with the shared interpreter at any given time. Here's the adjusted code example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import threading

def create_dummy_model():
  #dummy model for example
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
  return model

def run_inference_locked(interpreter, lock):
    with lock:
        input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
        output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()

        input_data = tf.random.normal(input_details[0]['shape'], dtype=tf.float32)
        interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], input_data)

        interpreter.invoke()

        output_data = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0]['index'])
        print(f"Output from thread: {output_data}")

def main():
    model = create_dummy_model()
    converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
    tflite_model = converter.convert()

    with open("dummy.tflite", "wb") as f:
        f.write(tflite_model)

    interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="dummy.tflite")
    interpreter.allocate_tensors()

    lock = threading.Lock()
    threads = []
    for _ in range(3):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=run_inference_locked, args=(interpreter, lock))
        threads.append(thread)
        thread.start()

    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Here, we create the single interpreter outside the threads, and then pass a lock object. Each thread acquires the lock before invoking the interpreter and releases it afterwards, thus ensuring exclusive access and preventing conflicts. Note the use of `with lock:`, which automatically handles acquisition and release and protects us from forgetting to release the lock. The performance impact here will be noticeable depending on the nature of the model and the level of concurrency. If threads are frequently waiting on the lock, throughput suffers, although memory consumption is reduced compared to the former implementation.

The third approach, while not a core part of the TensorFlow Lite library, involves using a thread pool coupled with a queue for processing incoming inference tasks. You can use python’s `concurrent.futures` to accomplish this and is often useful for higher-volume requests without overloading a single core with thread context switching. While it may not strictly manage concurrent api calls directly against the interpreter itself, it acts as an abstraction layer for distributing inference tasks, preventing resource contention, and often leading to a smoother application performance. The example below illustrates this technique:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import concurrent.futures
import queue

def create_dummy_model():
    #dummy model for example
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model


def process_inference_task(tflite_file, task_queue):
    interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path=tflite_file)
    interpreter.allocate_tensors()

    while True:
        try:
            input_data = task_queue.get(timeout=1)
        except queue.Empty:
            break

        input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
        output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()

        interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], input_data)

        interpreter.invoke()

        output_data = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0]['index'])
        print(f"Output from thread: {output_data}")

        task_queue.task_done()



def main():
    model = create_dummy_model()
    converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
    tflite_model = converter.convert()

    with open("dummy.tflite", "wb") as f:
        f.write(tflite_model)


    task_queue = queue.Queue()
    for _ in range(10):
        input_data = tf.random.normal((5,), dtype=tf.float32)
        task_queue.put(input_data)


    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(process_inference_task, "dummy.tflite", task_queue) for _ in range(3)]

    task_queue.join() # Wait until all tasks are done

    for future in futures:
        future.result()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this final example, a queue acts as the input buffer, feeding data into the inference task. Multiple worker threads are then created using `ThreadPoolExecutor`, each running its own interpreter instance, pulled from the same file. Task queue allows the asynchronous distribution and consumption of tasks and the `task_queue.join()` method ensures the program doesn't exit before all inferences are complete.

The best choice between these approaches depends on your application’s specifics. If you have a small model and need high concurrency, the multiple interpreter approach might be acceptable. For large models and a moderate degree of concurrency, using a lock often provides the memory efficiency that's needed. Finally, the thread pool approach offers scalability for higher-volume requests and manages resources in a controllable way.

In terms of further reading, I’d recommend examining the TensorFlow Lite documentation very carefully, particularly the sections on interpreter initialization and execution. Also, a solid resource on general concurrency and threading is “Operating System Concepts” by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne. While that book isn't specific to TensorFlow, understanding the underlying principles of concurrent programming is crucial for handling these kinds of problems effectively. “Programming Concurrency on the JVM” by Bryan Goetz et al. also dives into concurrency problems, and the principles discussed are broadly applicable, even outside the jvm world. These are great resources to solidify the principles discussed. Good luck on your project.
