Okay, let’s tackle this. I’ve seen this particular problem crop up more times than I care to count, usually in projects that started small and then exploded in complexity. The redundancy of database models is a classic pitfall, leading to maintenance nightmares, inconsistencies, and performance hits. My experience, particularly with a large e-commerce platform a few years back, hammered home the importance of smart data modeling from the outset – something we learned the hard way. We essentially had several teams working in silos, each creating their own version of similar entities, ending up with nearly identical tables across different parts of the system. It was a mess.

The key to avoiding this is a combination of solid planning, adherence to normalization principles, and a conscious effort to identify and abstract common data elements. It’s not a magic bullet, but a disciplined approach. Let's break down the strategy, focusing on how we can design a data storage workflow that is robust and, crucially, *not* redundant.

First off, let's acknowledge that the temptation to quickly create a new model is often strong, particularly when under pressure to deliver a feature. But this impulse, while understandable, is often a shortcut to a larger problem down the road. Instead, what's critical is a **thorough analysis of your data domains.** You need to identify entities and their relationships carefully. This is often best achieved through data modeling workshops involving all relevant stakeholders. This upfront investment will pay massive dividends down the line. We did this on another project I worked on, where we were redesigning a CRM system. Before we wrote a single line of code, we sketched out every potential entity and relationship on a massive whiteboard. It felt slow at the time, but it saved us months of rework.

One of the core principles is to embrace **database normalization**. Essentially, this means organizing data in a way that reduces redundancy and dependencies. This involves several normal forms, but for practical purposes, focusing on the third normal form (3NF) is generally sufficient for most applications. 3NF dictates that data should be stored in tables such that each table describes a single entity, attributes within a table depend solely on the primary key, and non-key attributes do not depend on each other.

Another key element is **data type standardization**. Ensure that similar attributes across different entities are consistently typed and formatted. This prevents the creation of nearly identical fields that, because of minor variations in type or format, are treated as completely different data points. For example, if you have a timestamp field, choose a single standard (like UTC milliseconds since the epoch) and stick with it everywhere. This is fundamental for maintaining data integrity.

Now, let’s illustrate this with some simple, but practical, code snippets. We’ll focus on conceptual database schemas rather than specific SQL variations, given the diversity of database systems in use today. The core concept is what matters most.

**Example 1: Redundant models (What to avoid)**

Imagine we have a user management system and a separate order management system, and they both need to store address information. A common pitfall is to create independent tables with almost identical columns:

```
-- User Address Table
CREATE TABLE user_addresses (
    address_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    street VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(50),
    zip_code VARCHAR(20),
    user_id INT,
    -- other user specific data ...
);

-- Order Address Table
CREATE TABLE order_addresses (
    address_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    street VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(50),
    zip_code VARCHAR(20),
    order_id INT,
    -- other order specific data ...
);
```

As you can see, the schema is almost identical, except for the foreign key. This redundancy means updates to address formatting, validation rules, or even just adding a new address field (like country) would require multiple code changes across systems.

**Example 2: Centralized Address Model (Better approach)**

A better approach would be to create a centralized 'addresses' table and link it to both user and order tables with foreign keys:

```
-- Centralized Address Table
CREATE TABLE addresses (
    address_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    street VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(50),
    zip_code VARCHAR(20),
    country VARCHAR(50) -- added field
);

-- User Table (Simplified)
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    -- other user details ...
    shipping_address_id INT,
    billing_address_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (shipping_address_id) REFERENCES addresses(address_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (billing_address_id) REFERENCES addresses(address_id)

);

-- Order Table (Simplified)
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     -- other order details
    shipping_address_id INT,
    billing_address_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (shipping_address_id) REFERENCES addresses(address_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (billing_address_id) REFERENCES addresses(address_id)
);
```

Now, any updates to address fields only require changes in one place, simplifying maintenance and ensuring consistency.

**Example 3: Generic Attribute Table for highly flexible entities**

In scenarios where you need to store attributes that can change or may be highly variable, using a separate, generic attribute table can help avoid adding columns to the main table, leading to more maintenance. This is a more advanced technique, use with care!

```
-- Main Product Table
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT
);

-- Attribute Table
CREATE TABLE product_attributes (
  attribute_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT,
  attribute_name VARCHAR(255),
  attribute_value TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

-- Data example
-- Product: product_id = 1, name='Laptop', desc='...'
-- Attribute: product_id = 1, attribute_name='RAM', attribute_value = '16GB'
-- Attribute: product_id = 1, attribute_name='CPU', attribute_value = 'Intel i7'

```

This pattern allows for flexibility without requiring schema changes to the `products` table every time a product needs a new or different property. This method is best used for situations where the attributes are not known ahead of time or might change often. Be aware of potential query performance impact and use it when appropriate.

Moving past the examples, keep in mind this isn't just a database design issue, it's also about your application architecture. Using a data access layer or ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) is beneficial, as it allows you to abstract the data storage details away from your business logic. These layers can also assist in data validation and type mapping, reinforcing consistency.

For deeper dives, I’d highly recommend checking out “Database Design for Mere Mortals” by Michael J. Hernandez and John L. Viescas for a more in-depth understanding of relational database theory and normalization. Also, "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" by Martin Fowler will be useful as well when you need to integrate those data models into your software. For a more theoretical, mathematical view, “Principles of Database and Knowledge-Base Systems, Vol. I” by Jeffrey D. Ullman is a goldmine (albeit dense).

In conclusion, eliminating redundant database models requires careful planning, a thorough understanding of normalization principles, consistent use of data types, the use of centralized tables for common data entities, and thoughtful application of tools like ORMs. It might take a bit more time upfront, but the long-term benefits in terms of reduced maintenance, increased data consistency, and improved performance are absolutely worth it. I've been through the pain of not following these principles, and I can assure you, the effort invested early will save you a tremendous amount of headache later.
