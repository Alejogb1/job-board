, let’s tackle this one. This kind of shape mismatch with lstms in tensorflow is something I've definitely run into a few times, especially when trying to combine different feature sources or building more complex network architectures. It's frustrating, I get it, but usually there's a clear path once we dissect the problem. The core issue here, as you've stated, involves multiple inbound nodes – which essentially means multiple inputs – into an lstm layer, and these inputs happen to have inconsistent output shapes. Tensorflow, being very strict about dimensions, will naturally throw an error. The lstm layer expects all incoming tensors to have compatible time dimensions. This often stems from different processing pipelines applied to the inputs before they reach the lstm, especially in cases involving sequence data with varying lengths or different features.

Let's break down how this unfolds and, more importantly, how to resolve it. The fundamental concept revolves around ensuring that all inputs going into an lstm share the same 'time' dimension. This isn't about the actual time in real life, but rather the sequence length as seen by the lstm. You'll often see this represented by the first dimension in a tensor of shape `(batch_size, time_steps, features)`. If you have different source data, the time_steps part can vary causing issues if you directly try to merge them for an lstm.

Here's what I've seen as common culprits that lead to this shape discrepancy:

1.  **Varied Input Sequence Lengths:** Raw input data often has different sequence lengths. For instance, one feature might be derived from a short segment of a time-series signal, whereas another feature could be computed from the whole signal. Padding and masking techniques are important tools in this case.

2.  **Differing Pre-processing:** Some inputs might go through pooling or convolutional layers, effectively altering their time dimension. For example, a 1D conv layer with strides might reduce the number of time-steps.

3.  **Incorrect Batching:** Sometimes the data loading pipeline might not be correctly batching the inputs, resulting in variable lengths even within a single batch. While less frequent this can happen due to improper batch creation.

So, let's get into the fixes, and I'll show you some code snippets in tensorflow (using keras API).

**Solution Approaches**

The strategy revolves around bringing the time dimensions of all your inputs to a common ground before passing them to the lstm. Here are a few techniques that I usually find myself using:

1.  **Padding and Masking:** When dealing with variable-length input sequences, this is the first technique you should consider. I would pad shorter sequences to match the length of the longest sequence. TensorFlow provides tools like `tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences`. You will also need to create a mask to let the lstm ignore the padded values. This approach preserves the original information while allowing you to input varied length sequence into the lstm.

2.  **Truncation:** If you have overly long sequences that are leading to computational overhead, you can truncate sequences to a specific length before padding. However, be mindful when doing that, as this could result in loss of important information.

3.  **Time-Distributed Layers:** If some input is already encoded in time, but in a different way such as from a conv layer or a pooling layer, you need to replicate that dimension, i.e. change the feature dimension. Then merge it with other inputs. You might want to learn about tf.keras.layers.TimeDistributed.

4.  **Feature Engineering and Resampling:** If the time dimensions actually mean something different for your input sources, it might be necessary to resample the data so that all inputs have compatible time steps. This can involve resampling to a common frequency or recomputing feature values with a consistent time window across the different input streams.

Let's get practical with code. Here's the first example, focusing on the padding/masking method:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Embedding, Masking
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
import numpy as np

# Sample data with variable sequence lengths
input_data_1 = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
]
input_data_2 = [
    [12, 13, 14],
    [15, 16, 17, 18],
    [19, 20]
]

# Convert to numpy arrays
input_data_1 = [np.array(seq) for seq in input_data_1]
input_data_2 = [np.array(seq) for seq in input_data_2]

# Determine max sequence length across both inputs
max_len_1 = max(len(seq) for seq in input_data_1)
max_len_2 = max(len(seq) for seq in input_data_2)

# Pad sequences
padded_input_1 = pad_sequences(input_data_1, maxlen=max_len_1, padding='post')
padded_input_2 = pad_sequences(input_data_2, maxlen=max_len_2, padding='post')

# Create masking layers
masking_1 = Masking(mask_value=0)
masking_2 = Masking(mask_value=0)

masked_input_1 = masking_1(padded_input_1)
masked_input_2 = masking_2(padded_input_2)


# Define Input layers
input_1 = Input(shape=(max_len_1,))
input_2 = Input(shape=(max_len_2,))

# Embedding layers before merging inputs
embed_1 = Embedding(input_dim=21, output_dim=8)(masked_input_1)
embed_2 = Embedding(input_dim=21, output_dim=8)(masked_input_2)


# Correcting time dimensions of input_2 for merging.
input_1_lstm_ready = embed_1
input_2_lstm_ready = tf.keras.layers.Reshape(target_shape=(1,max_len_2*8))(embed_2)
input_2_lstm_ready = tf.keras.layers.TimeDistributed(tf.keras.layers.Dense(max_len_1*8))(input_2_lstm_ready)
input_2_lstm_ready = tf.keras.layers.Reshape((max_len_1,8))(input_2_lstm_ready)


# Merge the inputs by concatenation or averaging
merged = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([input_1_lstm_ready, input_2_lstm_ready], axis=-1)

# LSTM Layer
lstm_output = LSTM(units=16)(merged)

# Model definition
model = Model(inputs=[input_1, input_2], outputs=lstm_output)

# Print the summary
model.summary()

#dummy training example
dummy_output = model.predict([padded_input_1,padded_input_2])
print(dummy_output)
```

In the example above, I've created a simple lstm with two inputs having different sequence lengths. I also demonstrated how the second input sequence needs to be changed in its time dimension so that it can be merged with the first one. First we pad the inputs, then we create a mask. Then input 2 time dimension was changed and projected to the length of the first input, we can see that the model summary now is free of errors and will be compatible with lstm layer. Here's a second example demonstrating how you could use TimeDistributed layers in order to match shapes when the time dimension is handled by preprocessing layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense, TimeDistributed, Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, concatenate
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np

# Sample input data
input_shape_1 = (10, 1)  # Sequence length 10, 1 feature
input_shape_2 = (20, 2)  # Sequence length 20, 2 features

# Generate random data
input_data_1 = np.random.rand(32, *input_shape_1)  # 32 is batch_size
input_data_2 = np.random.rand(32, *input_shape_2)

# input layers
input_1 = Input(shape=input_shape_1)
input_2 = Input(shape=input_shape_2)

# First processing pipeline
processed_1 = Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', padding='same')(input_1)
processed_1 = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)(processed_1) #shape becomes (5,32)


# Second processing pipeline
processed_2 = Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', padding='same')(input_2) #shape becomes (20,32)
processed_2 = TimeDistributed(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2))(processed_2) #Shape becomes (10,32)

# Changing dimensions of input_1 for merging,
processed_1 = TimeDistributed(Dense(units=32))(processed_1)

# Merge both inputs
merged = concatenate([processed_1, processed_2], axis=1) #Shape becomes (10, 64)


# LSTM layer
lstm_output = LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=False)(merged)


# Dense layer and output
output = Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')(lstm_output)


# Build the model
model = Model(inputs=[input_1, input_2], outputs=output)

# Print the model summary
model.summary()

#dummy training example
dummy_output = model.predict([input_data_1,input_data_2])
print(dummy_output)
```

Here, we preprocess two input streams differently. The first one undergoes convolution and max pooling. We also do the same thing for the second input and using `TimeDistributed` in a slightly different way, showing a different use case. Then we merged the inputs using concatenation. Because the shape difference was in the `time_step` and not in the `feature` space, the concatenation occurs along the time dimension.

Finally, let’s consider the case where different feature sampling rates need to be handled which will change the time dimension, This example has a very common scenario in audio signal processing. In such a scenario it will be important to re-sample different feature inputs so that they have compatible time dimensions:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense, concatenate
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import resample

# sample input signals.
sample_rate_1 = 100  # Sampling rate of input 1
sample_rate_2 = 200  # Sampling rate of input 2
duration = 2  # Duration in seconds

time_1 = np.linspace(0, duration, int(sample_rate_1 * duration), endpoint=False) #generate time
time_2 = np.linspace(0, duration, int(sample_rate_2 * duration), endpoint=False) # generate time
input_data_1 = np.random.rand(32, len(time_1), 1)  # input 1 shape: (batch_size, time steps, 1 feature)
input_data_2 = np.random.rand(32, len(time_2), 2)  # input 2 shape: (batch_size, time steps, 2 features)

# Re-sample input 2 for matching time dimension, this is where the magic happens.
target_length = int(sample_rate_1 * duration)
resampled_input_2 = np.array([resample(seq, target_length) for seq in input_data_2])


# Input layers
input_1 = Input(shape=(len(time_1), 1))
input_2 = Input(shape=(target_length, 2))

# Merge Inputs
merged = concatenate([input_1, input_2], axis=-1) # Shape becomes (batch_size, time_steps_1, 3)

# lstm layer
lstm_output = LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=False)(merged)

# final output
output = Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')(lstm_output)

# build the model
model = Model(inputs=[input_1, input_2], outputs=output)

# Print model summary
model.summary()

#dummy training example
dummy_output = model.predict([input_data_1,resampled_input_2])
print(dummy_output)
```

In this last example, two input data are collected using different sample rates. To fix the issue, I've used resample function from `scipy.signal` to re-sample input 2 to a target length so it would match the time dimension of the first signal before feeding them to the lstm model.

**Recommendations**

For deeper dives, I highly recommend:

*   **"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:** This is the go-to reference for understanding the underlying concepts of deep learning including recurrent neural networks and how they process sequences. Pay special attention to the sections on recurrent networks and sequence modeling.
*   **TensorFlow Documentation:** Always refer to the official TensorFlow documentation for the latest API details and best practices. Search for sections on `tf.keras.layers.LSTM`, `tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences`, and `tf.keras.layers.Masking`
*   **"Speech and Language Processing" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin:** If you are working on natural language, this book covers sequence processing using various techniques and is a very comprehensive reference.

In conclusion, shape errors involving lstms and multiple input nodes with differing time dimensions stem from fundamental misalignments between how input sources are processed. By employing padding, masking, TimeDistributed layers or resampling, combined with a thorough understanding of your data, you'll be well equipped to build complex sequence models that work correctly. Just remember, time dimension is key.
