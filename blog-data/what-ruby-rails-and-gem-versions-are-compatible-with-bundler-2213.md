, let’s tackle this. Compatibility with a specific Bundler version like 2.2.13 isn’t as straightforward as a simple matrix, primarily because it involves interactions across three different ecosystems: Ruby itself, the Rails framework, and the myriad gems pulled in via your Gemfile. I've personally navigated many a dependency conflict over the years, often having to meticulously backtrack and pinpoint the exact problematic combination of versions. This is far from an isolated issue; it’s a common challenge in maintaining large Rails applications.

Instead of thinking about direct compatibility with just Bundler 2.2.13, we really need to focus on what constraints Bundler itself supports and how those relate to your Ruby, Rails, and gem choices. Bundler, at its core, manages dependencies. Version 2.2.13, while older at this point, was still quite capable, but its behavior regarding allowed ruby and rails versions depends heavily on the gemspecs of the gems you want to use.

Essentially, Bundler relies on the `gemspec` files within each gem package to determine compatibility. These files specify minimum ruby versions, potential dependencies, and more. A gem can declare a minimum ruby version, such as ‘>= 2.7’, and Bundler will ensure it’s not installed into an environment running anything older than Ruby 2.7. The same logic applies to specific Rails versions and other gem dependencies.

Here's the thing: Bundler itself doesn't force a minimum or maximum ruby/rails version. It's the gems that do. The gems you depend on are the deciding factor, not necessarily what Bundler 2.2.13 "allows." Bundler 2.2.13 is very effective at enforcing those constraints declared by gem maintainers.

So, practically speaking, you don’t ask, "What ruby and rails versions work with Bundler 2.2.13?" instead you should be asking: "What ruby and rails versions do my *gems* work with, and is Bundler 2.2.13 able to satisfy those dependencies?"

This brings us to the need for a methodical approach: reading gem documentation and understanding `gemspec` files. In practice, I found that starting with `gem outdated` to see potential issues with the current versions and working through each reported conflict based on its `gemspec` details is the most reliable strategy.

Let's illustrate with some scenarios. Imagine a project where I encountered these situations:

**Example 1: Ruby version constraint:**

Assume I had the following in my `Gemfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '5.2.4.4'
gem 'nokogiri', '~> 1.10'
gem 'puma', '~> 3.12'
```

And let's say `nokogiri` version 1.10.x had a `gemspec` that declared `ruby ">= 2.5"`. If I were running Ruby 2.4.9, Bundler 2.2.13 would *not* be happy. It would throw an error, telling me that `nokogiri` is not compatible, and it would be correct:

```ruby
# Ruby 2.4.9 - Bundler 2.2.13
# Running `bundle install` would produce output similar to:

# nokogiri (1.10.10) requires ruby >= 2.5. The current ruby version is 2.4.9.
# bundle install failed.
```
This example demonstrates how bundler is not the issue, it's the gem's specific requirements. Bundler is just the messenger, here. It's acting as it's meant to, enforcing versioning rules defined in the gem.

**Example 2: Rails version dependency:**

Let’s assume another gem, let's call it `my_custom_auth_gem`, that I've worked on in the past that is declared like this in my `Gemfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '~> 6.0' # explicitly rails 6.x
gem 'my_custom_auth_gem', '~> 1.2'
```
and inside `my_custom_auth_gem.gemspec` it has:
```ruby
  spec.add_dependency "rails", ">= 6.0", "< 7.0"
```
If the installed Rails version was 5.2, Bundler (2.2.13) would recognize the incompatibility:
```
# rails version 5.2 - Bundler 2.2.13

# The requested rails version (>= 6.0 and < 7.0) is not compatible with the current rails version 5.2
# bundle install failed.
```

This shows how the gems themselves determine compatibility. Bundler is simply there to manage those stated constraints.

**Example 3: Complex dependency graph:**

Often, gem compatibility isn’t just about a direct dependency. Let's introduce `another_gem` with its own dependency requirements. Imagine a setup like this:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '6.0.0'
gem 'my_feature_gem', '~> 2.0'
gem 'another_gem', '~> 1.0'

```

Where `my_feature_gem.gemspec` declares `add_dependency 'another_gem', '~> 0.9'` and `another_gem.gemspec` declares `add_dependency 'rails', '>= 5.0', '< 6.0'`

This shows a case where `another_gem` requires Rails version 5, while our Gemfile specifically requires rails 6.0, resulting in a conflict.
```
# rails version 6.0.0 - Bundler 2.2.13

# Could not satisfy all dependencies
# The gem another_gem requires rails (>= 5.0, < 6.0) while rails version 6.0.0 is active

# bundle install failed.
```
Bundler, once again, is just reporting that we have a problem: not that Bundler itself has an incompatibility but that the constraints defined in the gem specs do not match the overall environment.

**Key Takeaways and Further Reading**

To address your initial question, there's no simple, universal answer. The compatibility of Ruby, Rails, and gems with Bundler 2.2.13 is completely dictated by the `gemspec` files of the gems you include in your `Gemfile`. The version of Bundler simply *enforces* these constraints.

Here's how you should approach this going forward:

1.  **Examine your `Gemfile.lock`:** This file provides the exact versions of all gems installed on your system, and it is the ultimate truth about your dependencies as resolved by your bundler. If you need to modify this or move to newer versions, you need to start carefully examining what is causing the incompatibility.

2.  **Check gem documentation:** Refer to the individual gem documentation for version-specific compatibility information. Usually, their documentation or `README` will outline compatible versions of Ruby and Rails.

3. **Inspect `gemspec` files:** While it isn't usually necessary, if you need to understand *exactly* what's happening, examining `gemspec` files is often invaluable. These files are within each gem folder and outline the dependencies.

4. **Use `bundle outdated`:** Use this to identify outdated gems. Then you can assess if upgrading a gem would solve the problem or potentially create new ones. This can help to uncover conflicts.

5.  **Gradual Upgrade:** If you are upgrading anything in your Gemfile, do it incrementally. This approach makes it much easier to isolate problematic versions. Upgrade one or two gems, test, and then continue if all seems good.

For further reading, I'd recommend the following:

*   **"The Ruby Programming Language" by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto**: This provides deep knowledge of Ruby, essential for understanding its interaction with gems.
*   **"Agile Web Development with Rails" by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson**: While primarily focused on Rails, it also provides insights into the gem ecosystem and dependency management.
*   **Bundler documentation:** The official Bundler documentation is excellent and has detailed descriptions of its workings. A thorough understanding of that documentation is helpful when tackling intricate dependency problems.

In summary, Bundler 2.2.13 isn't the restriction point here; it's the dependency rules defined within the gems you are working with. Understand these constraints by checking the `gemspec` files of your gems or their documentation, and you’ll have much better success with navigating this complex ecosystem. I hope this helps your journey into Rails dependencies and versioning; good luck with your project!
