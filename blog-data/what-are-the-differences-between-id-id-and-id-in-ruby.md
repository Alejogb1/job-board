Alright, let’s tackle this. Having spent a fair chunk of time navigating the intricacies of Ruby, I've often encountered the nuances of `:id`, `id:`, and simply `id` in various contexts. These seemingly minor variations can, and often do, lead to vastly different interpretations and behaviours within the language. It's crucial, therefore, to understand their distinctions. Let me break it down from my experience, focusing on the technical aspects with a bit of practical colour.

First off, when we see `:id`, we're dealing with a symbol. Symbols in Ruby are immutable strings, essentially lightweight identifiers often used as keys in hashes or as method names. They are not variables, and they always evaluate to themselves. Their immutability offers performance advantages, especially in situations where a string would be repeatedly allocated and garbage collected. They are part of the core fabric of Ruby's object model and are widely used under the hood. For example, when defining attributes in Active Record, they are represented as symbols. This is also very clear in Rails routing configurations.

Now, `id:` introduces a slightly different beast. This notation is typical of keyword arguments within a method definition or method invocation. It essentially creates a hash-like structure where 'id' becomes the key, and whatever follows it after the colon is its associated value. This is a feature of Ruby that enables a more descriptive and readable syntax, making method calls less reliant on the positional order of arguments and more explicit about the function of each argument. The associated value, which comes *after* the colon, can be anything: a string, a number, an object – whatever data is contextually required by the method receiving the argument. This has the practical benefit of making the code more maintainable as it reduces the chances of passing the wrong arguments in the wrong order.

Finally, `id` on its own, without any preceding colon or trailing colon, represents a variable. This variable could be a local variable scoped within a method or block, an instance variable within a class (denoted as `@id`), or a constant (denoted as `ID`). When the context does not specify one of the previous possibilities `id` is a method call if a method called `id` is defined in the scope of the execution. In the case of instance variables and methods, if none is defined, then the method lookup will try to find one through inheritance chain. Its behaviour will then depends on which `id` method is being called (the default, which returns the object id, or the one overridden by user). It will resolve to whatever value is assigned to that variable or returned from that method. The value of this identifier is subject to modification and can vary depending on the program's flow.

To make this clearer, let’s delve into some code examples, which I think will solidify the concepts.

**Example 1: Symbols and Hashes**

```ruby
def process_data(options)
  puts "Processing with id: #{options[:id]}, name: #{options[:name]}"
end

data = { id: 123, name: "Example Data" }
process_data(data) # Note the symbol :id here

# And demonstrating that symbols are immutable
string_key = "id"
symbol_key = :id
puts string_key.object_id
puts symbol_key.object_id
string_key = "id"
puts string_key.object_id
puts symbol_key.object_id
puts :id.object_id
puts :id.object_id
```

In this snippet, `:id` within `options[:id]` is used to access the value associated with the symbol `:id` key within the `options` hash. The immutability of the symbol is demonstrated by printing the object ids which don't change after variable reassignment. The string object id is different and changes when a new string is created.

**Example 2: Keyword Arguments**

```ruby
class Product
  attr_accessor :id, :name
  def initialize(id:, name:)
    @id = id
    @name = name
  end

  def describe_product(id:, description:)
    puts "Product with id #{id} is described as: #{description}."
  end
end

product = Product.new(id: 101, name: "Widget")
puts product.id
product.describe_product(id: 101, description: "A useful gadget.")
```

Here, `id:` within the `initialize` and `describe_product` method definitions specifies that these parameters are keyword arguments. When we create a `Product` instance and invoke `describe_product`, we utilize `id:` notation to pass in the relevant value. This form clarifies exactly which values are being associated with which parameters. Without the keywords, the method caller could mix the order of arguments and lead to logical problems or an incorrect object state. In this example, you see both `id` attributes and method, both are clearly defined with the attribute accessor and method definition, and the correct one is used based on the context (attribute for object state, method to perform an action).

**Example 3: Variable and Method Scope**

```ruby
id = 999 # a global variable
class DataProcessor
  def process(id) # method argument
    @id = id #instance variable @id
    local_id = id * 2 # local variable
    puts "Method's id: #{id}, Local id: #{local_id}, instance id: #{@id}"
    puts self.id # invoking object method id
  end

  def id # object method id
    1000
  end
end

processor = DataProcessor.new
processor.process(id) # Here 'id' is calling the global variable

```

In this final piece, we have three different instances of `id`. Outside of any classes, `id` is a global variable initialized to 999. Inside the `DataProcessor` class, the `process` method's parameter `id` acts as a local variable within the scope of that method. When we assign `@id = id`, we are creating and instance variable that holds the parameter's value which was assigned during the method call. In the same method `local_id` is a local variable within the method scope. Finally, self.id uses the `id` method of the `DataProcessor` class. This example shows the difference between local, instance, global variables and methods and helps demonstrate how the same identifier `id` can behave in different ways based on its context.

To further your understanding, I would highly recommend examining "Programming Ruby" by Dave Thomas, which delves deeply into the nuances of symbols and object interaction. Additionally, "Effective Ruby" by Peter J. Jones offers more insights into practical applications and best practices for keyword arguments and method definitions. Another invaluable source is the official Ruby documentation, which you can find on the ruby-lang.org website; this provides the ultimate source of truth. Also, examining the Ruby source code itself on GitHub will provide an even deeper understanding of the mechanics of symbol use and variable resolution.

In essence, the distinctions between `:id`, `id:`, and `id` are foundational to Ruby programming. They dictate how data is referenced and manipulated, how arguments are passed to methods, and how variables are scoped within the execution context. Understanding their individual behaviors and interplay is critical for anyone writing effective Ruby code and avoiding common pitfalls. My practical experience shows that even small confusions about these elements can lead to a lot of debugging, which can be avoided by making sure we get this right.
