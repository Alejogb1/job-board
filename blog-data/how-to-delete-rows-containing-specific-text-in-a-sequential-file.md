Let's tackle this issue of removing rows with specific text from a sequential file; it's something I've encountered quite a few times in my career, particularly when dealing with legacy systems or raw data feeds. The fundamental challenge lies in efficiently scanning each line, identifying the unwanted text, and then reconstructing the file without those lines. It might sound simple, but the intricacies of performance and error handling can quickly become complex, especially with larger files. My experience stems from a project years ago involving a massive log file from a telecommunications switch. We had to filter out specific diagnostic messages to make the data analysis process manageable. This wasn't just a one-off script, it needed to be robust enough to handle varying input sizes and different text patterns.

The core concept is straightforward: we read the file line by line, check if each line contains the unwanted text, and if not, we write it to a new (or temporary) file. Once completed, we replace the original file with this modified version. This ensures we're working on a sequential basis, which is important for file handling. The primary consideration here is efficiency. We need to avoid loading the entire file into memory, especially for very large files. Instead, we want to process it chunk-by-chunk, or rather, line-by-line. Let’s explore this with some code examples in different languages I've used extensively.

**Example 1: Python**

Python is often my go-to for quick scripts, and its built-in libraries make file manipulation relatively simple. Here’s how I would typically approach this:

```python
import os
import tempfile

def remove_lines_containing_text(filepath, text_to_remove):
    try:
        temp_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False)
        with open(filepath, 'r') as file_read:
            for line in file_read:
                if text_to_remove not in line:
                    temp_file.write(line)
        temp_file.close()
        os.replace(temp_file.name, filepath)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing file: {e}")
    finally:
      if 'temp_file' in locals() and hasattr(temp_file, 'name'):
        try:
           os.remove(temp_file.name)
        except FileNotFoundError:
           pass # ignore if temp file has been already cleaned up



# Example Usage
file_path = "example.txt"
text_to_find = "ERROR"
# Create sample file if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "w") as f:
        f.write("This is a normal line.\n")
        f.write("This line contains ERROR.\n")
        f.write("Another normal line.\n")
        f.write("Something with ERROR here too.\n")
        f.write("And a final clean line.\n")

remove_lines_containing_text(file_path, text_to_find)

with open(file_path, 'r') as file_read_updated:
    print("Modified File Content:\n", file_read_updated.read())
```

This code first creates a temporary file, then reads the original file line by line. If the line *does not* contain the target text, it’s written to the temporary file. Finally, the original file is replaced with the temporary file. Crucially, we use a `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` and carefully manage its cleanup using a `finally` block to avoid leaving orphaned files. The use of `os.replace` provides an atomic file replacement operation, which is preferable to deleting and recreating, especially in environments where file integrity is critical. The `try...except` block is important for handling potential exceptions, like file not found or permission errors. This approach avoids loading the entire file into memory, making it suitable for large datasets.

**Example 2: Java**

In Java, I find myself needing to be a bit more verbose, especially with exception handling. The following example demonstrates how I typically would approach this same task:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class RemoveLines {
    public static void removeLinesContainingText(String filePath, String textToRemove) {
        File inputFile = new File(filePath);
        File tempFile = null;
        BufferedReader reader = null;
        BufferedWriter writer = null;

        try {
            tempFile = File.createTempFile("temp", ".tmp");
            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(inputFile));
            writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(tempFile));

            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                if (!line.contains(textToRemove)) {
                    writer.write(line);
                    writer.newLine();
                }
            }

            reader.close();
            writer.close();


            if (!inputFile.delete()) {
                System.out.println("Could not delete original file.");
                tempFile.delete();
                return;
            }

            if (!tempFile.renameTo(inputFile)){
                System.out.println("Could not rename temporary file.");
                tempFile.delete();
                return;
            }

        }
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error processing the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        finally {
            // ensure resources are cleaned
            try { if (reader != null) reader.close(); } catch (IOException ex) {}
            try { if (writer != null) writer.close(); } catch (IOException ex) {}
           if (tempFile != null && tempFile.exists()) {
                tempFile.delete();
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "example.txt";
        String textToRemove = "ERROR";
        // Create sample file if it doesn't exist
          File file = new File(filePath);
          if (!file.exists()) {
            try (BufferedWriter fileWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath))){
                fileWriter.write("This is a normal line.\n");
                fileWriter.write("This line contains ERROR.\n");
                fileWriter.write("Another normal line.\n");
                fileWriter.write("Something with ERROR here too.\n");
                fileWriter.write("And a final clean line.\n");
                } catch (IOException e){
                 System.out.println("Error during setup."+e.getMessage());
              }
           }

        removeLinesContainingText(filePath, textToRemove);

        try (BufferedReader fileReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))){
          System.out.println("Modified File Content:");
           String line;
          while ((line = fileReader.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(line);
          }
        } catch (IOException e) {
          System.out.println("Error during printing the modified file." + e.getMessage());
         }

    }
}
```

Here, the Java code operates very similarly. It opens the input file with a `BufferedReader`, creating a `BufferedWriter` for the temporary file. Error handling, including resource cleanup in `finally` blocks, is particularly crucial in Java. We use `File.createTempFile` to create a temporary file, then perform deletion and renaming operations to swap the files, again to ensure that our output is a replacement operation. Each operation is carefully checked and errors are reported in the console, making this code very robust. This code is also memory efficient by processing line by line.

**Example 3: Bash Scripting**

Sometimes a simple bash script is the quickest way to tackle a text-processing task, particularly if it's part of a larger system administration workflow:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file_path="example.txt"
text_to_remove="ERROR"

# Create sample file if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -f "$file_path" ]; then
    echo "This is a normal line." > "$file_path"
    echo "This line contains ERROR." >> "$file_path"
    echo "Another normal line." >> "$file_path"
    echo "Something with ERROR here too." >> "$file_path"
    echo "And a final clean line." >> "$file_path"
fi

# Process the file using grep and redirect to the same file after renaming.
temp_file=$(mktemp) # Create temporary file with mktemp
grep -v "$text_to_remove" "$file_path" > "$temp_file"
mv "$temp_file" "$file_path"

echo "Modified file contents:"
cat "$file_path"
```

The bash script utilizes `grep -v` which excludes lines containing the specified text, redirects that output to a temporary file created with `mktemp`, and then overwrites the original file with the content of the temporary file. This is often the fastest and simplest option for quick filtering, and it handles very large files efficiently, as `grep` does not load everything into memory.

**Key Considerations**

When you’re working with real-world data, remember that character encodings are essential. Always ensure that you're reading and writing using the correct encoding to prevent data corruption. For example, you may need to specify `encoding="utf-8"` when you open your files, especially when dealing with non-ASCII characters. Furthermore, in larger systems where concurrency is a factor, use file locks to avoid data corruption while reading and writing the files if concurrent file operations are expected. It’s critical to understand that file operations are inherently I/O bound, meaning they are often the performance bottleneck in these processes. For optimization, you can look into asynchronous operations to not block on file reads and writes.

For further exploration, “*Modern Operating Systems*” by Andrew S. Tanenbaum provides deep insights into file systems and I/O operations, and is highly recommended. The *POSIX standards* document, when working with linux environments, is also very crucial to understand low-level file operations. Additionally, depending on your primary programming language, looking up the performance considerations section in the official file operation documentation is vital to develop deeper understanding and perform efficient, reliable operations.

In my practical experience, these solutions have been reliable and robust for managing various types of sequential files. Remember that robust error handling, proper cleanup of resources and careful attention to the nuances of your environment are keys to successful processing of sequential files. The examples above provide a good starting point that you can adapt and build on, depending on your specific requirements and context.
