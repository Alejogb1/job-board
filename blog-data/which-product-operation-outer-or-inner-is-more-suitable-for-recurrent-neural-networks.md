Let's delve into this, shall we? It's a question that often surfaces when you're dealing with the nuances of sequence data and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). I recall a particular project, some years back, involving predictive maintenance for complex machinery. We had sensor data coming in time series – temperature, vibration, pressure, you name it. The task was to build a model that could anticipate potential failures. That's where the inner and outer product operations with RNNs came under real scrutiny for us.

The short answer? There isn't a universally "better" product operation. It's very much context-dependent on what information you're trying to capture, specifically in the interplay between the recurrent states and the input data. However, focusing the conversation towards the operations within *most commonly used* RNN architectures, I'd lean towards emphasizing the **inner product** as being the core operation within the recurrent steps. Let's break this down.

First, to clarify, an *inner product*, in the context of vectors, is essentially the sum of the products of corresponding entries. Mathematically, if you have two vectors, *a* and *b*, both of the same length, their inner product is *a•b* = ∑ *aᵢbᵢ*. The *outer product*, on the other hand, produces a matrix where every element is the product of elements from two vectors. With *a* and *b* again, the outer product results in a matrix where element (i, j) is *aᵢbⱼ*.

Now, within standard RNNs, such as simple RNNs or more complex architectures like LSTMs and GRUs, the core recurrent calculation revolves around an inner product. The incoming input *xₜ* at timestep *t* and the previous hidden state *hₜ₋₁* are typically projected into a new vector space via linear transformations. The inner product is fundamental to merging these transformed representations into the new hidden state *hₜ*. We typically have matrices, say, *Wₓ* and *Wₕ*, which are multiplied with input *xₜ* and previous hidden state *hₜ₋₁* respectively to produce intermediate vectors. These resulting vectors are then combined, typically by adding them. The sum is then often passed through an activation function (like tanh or sigmoid).

The key here is that the **transformation matrices** *Wₓ* and *Wₕ* act on the input and hidden state *before* any inner product operation is performed. The *inner product* is what follows as part of the core operation for computing the new hidden state for the current step.

Let me illustrate with simplified python code. For simplicity we'll use numpy for the operations:

```python
import numpy as np

def simple_rnn_step(x_t, h_prev, W_x, W_h, b):
  """A basic RNN step calculation."""
  # Project input and previous hidden state to a new space using matrix multiplication.
  x_transformed = np.dot(W_x, x_t)
  h_transformed = np.dot(W_h, h_prev)
  
  # Combine the transformed vectors. Core inner product operations are at play here within matrix multiplications.
  combined = x_transformed + h_transformed + b
  
  # Apply the activation function. tanh here
  h_next = np.tanh(combined)
  return h_next


# Example Usage
input_size = 3
hidden_size = 4
x_t = np.random.rand(input_size)  # Input at time t
h_prev = np.random.rand(hidden_size) # Previous Hidden state
W_x = np.random.rand(hidden_size, input_size) # Input weight matrix
W_h = np.random.rand(hidden_size, hidden_size) # Hidden weight matrix
b = np.random.rand(hidden_size) # Bias

h_t = simple_rnn_step(x_t, h_prev, W_x, W_h, b)
print(f"Next hidden state h_t: {h_t}")
```

Here, while the operations appear simple, notice the role of the matrix multiplication, which under the hood involves series of inner products. The projection matrices, *Wₓ* and *Wₕ*, are what allow the input and hidden state to be combined to build up an internal state.

Contrast this with a hypothetical scenario where we might employ an outer product. An outer product, if directly applied *within* the core recurrent computation itself, tends to generate a very high-dimensional representation, which often leads to a blow up of parameters to train. The outer product combines *all* dimensions of the vectors and could be useful if you're looking for patterns in the **joint representation** of the input and previous hidden state. For instance, if the interaction between two aspects of the input and the hidden state matters greatly, the outer product would encode that relationship explicitly. However, typical RNN architectures focus on a learned projection using *W* matrices that reduce to an inner product via matrix multiplication. Let’s illustrate how an outer product would look in the step, keeping the other code parts same for direct comparison:

```python
import numpy as np

def hypothetical_rnn_step_outer(x_t, h_prev, W_x, W_h):
    """A hypothetical RNN step calculation using outer product"""
    x_transformed = np.dot(W_x, x_t)
    h_transformed = np.dot(W_h, h_prev)
    
    # Outer product here
    outer_prod = np.outer(x_transformed, h_transformed) # Shape will be (hidden_size, hidden_size)

    h_next = np.tanh(outer_prod) # This isn’t how it’s usually done but to illustrate outer product
    return h_next

# Example Usage (keeping the dimensions as before)
input_size = 3
hidden_size = 4
x_t = np.random.rand(input_size)  # Input at time t
h_prev = np.random.rand(hidden_size) # Previous Hidden state
W_x = np.random.rand(hidden_size, input_size)
W_h = np.random.rand(hidden_size, hidden_size)


h_t_outer = hypothetical_rnn_step_outer(x_t, h_prev, W_x, W_h)
print(f"Next hidden state h_t with outer product example: {h_t_outer}")
```

Note that in this example, *we are not directly adding the vectors* and instead forming a matrix from the outer product. The *shape* of the output also differs from the inner product approach. The output is no longer a simple vector of size 'hidden_size', but a matrix. This can be useful in capturing richer interaction between input and hidden states. However, as mentioned, this also introduces complexity and a larger number of parameters to train. This is why it's less common for basic RNNs. The inner product combined with learned transformation weights has shown to be more efficient for most sequential modeling tasks.

Furthermore, there are specific cases where you might see variations. For example, in some models attempting to capture more complex relationships, attention mechanisms might be used. These often involve a calculation that superficially looks like a series of *dot* products (essentially inner products), but it serves an entirely different purpose: it determines *which* parts of the input sequence to focus on at a given step, rather than to directly update the core recurrent state. The hidden state and the context vector produced are then used to predict next step in the sequence. Let’s see an example:

```python
import numpy as np

def simple_attention(query, keys, values):
    """A simplified attention mechanism."""
    # Compute scores via dot product
    scores = np.dot(query, keys.T)
    
    # Apply softmax to get attention weights
    attention_weights = np.exp(scores) / np.sum(np.exp(scores), axis=1, keepdims=True)
    
    # Weighted sum of values based on attention weights
    context_vector = np.dot(attention_weights, values)
    return context_vector, attention_weights
    
# Example Usage
query = np.random.rand(1, 4) # Shape for a single query.
keys = np.random.rand(5, 4)  # multiple keys
values = np.random.rand(5, 6) # multiple values
context_vector, attention_weights  = simple_attention(query, keys, values)
print(f"Context vector : {context_vector}")
print(f"Attention weights : {attention_weights}")
```

Here, the core operation for computing attention *scores* uses a dot product, a form of inner product. However, it's important to remember that the *purpose* here is completely different. It isn't about updating the recurrent hidden state like in the first example, but about generating weights which when applied to some values give context vector.

In summary, while *outer products* could be used in modified RNN architectures, they aren't the norm within the most common implementations due to their computational overhead. The most critical operations within standard recurrent steps leverage inner products via the matrix multiplications with the learned weights, for effective integration of the current input and the previous state. And even within attention mechanisms, a form of the inner product, dot product, is crucial, but with the distinct purpose of determining attention weights.

For further reading, I recommend diving into the seminal paper on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, often cited as "Long Short-Term Memory" (1997), along with the more recent "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017). Understanding the core equations in the cited research papers and having hands-on experience through coding exercises are invaluable resources to solidify this knowledge. You can also look into books, such as "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow et al, for a deep dive into mathematical formulation and practical application of RNNs and other deep neural networks. Don’t just read the theory, code and experiment and this will solidify your understanding.
