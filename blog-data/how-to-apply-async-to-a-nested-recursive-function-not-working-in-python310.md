well, this looks familiar. i’ve definitely been down this rabbit hole before, the async recursive function pitfall. seeing that "not working" part always makes me feel a little shiver. i’ve spent way too many late nights staring at python tracebacks, let me tell you. so, lets tackle this.

the core problem here usually boils down to how python’s async/await model interacts with recursion. by default, just making a recursive function `async` isn't going to magically parallelize anything. it'll still execute mostly sequentially, and you might end up with a stack overflow if the recursion goes too deep, a classical problem. the "not working" you are experiencing is likely from it not behaving as expected, it’s not that it's simply failing to run.

the trick is that async functions need to actually `await` something that relinquishes control to the event loop, to allow actual concurrent execution. when a recursive async function keeps calling itself directly, it's not giving the event loop much opportunity to schedule other tasks. it stays in the same call stack. it’s kind of like being in a single lane of a highway, no matter how many cars we put in there, they are all going one by one.

so, here's the general pattern i've found successful, and some approaches i’ve personally used when dealing with this issue.

**the problem: depth-first recursion in async**

let's say you have a recursive function designed to, for example, traverse a nested structure, maybe like a json object or a hierarchical file system.

something like:

```python
import asyncio
async def process_item(item):
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # simulate some io operation
    return f"processed: {item}"

async def recursive_process(items):
    results = []
    for item in items:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            results.extend(await recursive_process(item))
        else:
            results.append(await process_item(item))
    return results

async def main():
    data = [1, [2, 3, [4, 5]], 6]
    results = await recursive_process(data)
    print(results)
    # expected:['processed: 1', 'processed: 2', 'processed: 3', 'processed: 4', 'processed: 5', 'processed: 6']
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

this code will technically *run*, but it won't be very concurrent. it's mostly just going to go down each branch, one after another, even if the `process_item` has some `await`. the waiting is not letting the event loop do concurrent work. it’s like making sandwiches, if you finish one before starting the other, that won’t be parallel, although you can wait a lot while the bread toasts.

**solution: task groups (or similar)**

the solution involves introducing a mechanism that allows the event loop to schedule the concurrent processing of sub-branches. one excellent way to accomplish this in modern python is with `asyncio.taskgroup`.

here's the adjusted code:

```python
import asyncio
async def process_item(item):
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return f"processed: {item}"

async def recursive_process(items):
    results = []
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        for item in items:
            if isinstance(item, list):
                task = tg.create_task(recursive_process(item))
                results.append(task)
            else:
                results.append(tg.create_task(process_item(item)))
        
    return [await task for task in results]

async def main():
    data = [1, [2, 3, [4, 5]], 6]
    results = await recursive_process(data)
    print(results)
# expected:['processed: 1', 'processed: 2', 'processed: 3', 'processed: 4', 'processed: 5', 'processed: 6']
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

what happened? we created a `taskgroup`. this lets us schedule async work as tasks and then await their completion *concurrently*. we create tasks for both processing items and processing sublists, and then gather the results. we have changed from waiting to start to start a process and go to the next, to start a process, schedule it, and go start the next process. this results in concurrent work and improved performance, because it doesn’t need to wait for the result to start the next task.

**alternative approach: semaphores**

sometimes you might want to control the degree of concurrency, specially if the parallel work might exhaust some resources. if you're worried about too many concurrent calls or want to manage the resource usage, a semaphore can be your friend. a semaphore can act like a traffic light, controlling access to shared resources. i once made a bad move with a similar situation trying to process a ton of files. i nearly crashed my local system (it was a learning experience!). this was before python had taskgroups, a semaphore was the way i had. let me show you.

```python
import asyncio
async def process_item(item, semaphore):
    async with semaphore:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        return f"processed: {item}"

async def recursive_process(items, semaphore):
    results = []
    for item in items:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            results.extend(await recursive_process(item, semaphore))
        else:
            results.append(await process_item(item, semaphore))
    return results

async def main():
    data = [1, [2, 3, [4, 5]], 6]
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(5) # limit to 5 concurrent tasks
    results = await recursive_process(data, semaphore)
    print(results)
# expected:['processed: 1', 'processed: 2', 'processed: 3', 'processed: 4', 'processed: 5', 'processed: 6']

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

here we initialized a semaphore, setting a limit to the number of concurrent executions of `process_item`. notice we did not change the structure of the function. this can be done when you do not have sub tasks to process. a taskgroup should be preferred if that was the case, but a semaphore can be easier to add to old codebases without large modifications.

**key takeaways**

*   **async is not magic concurrency:** just declaring a function `async` doesn't make it automatically parallel. you need `await` calls that give up control to the event loop.
*   **taskgroups are your friends:** for managing related tasks concurrently within the async context. the good thing about them is that they wait for all tasks to finish.
*   **semaphores for throttling:** use them to limit the concurrency, useful when dealing with resource constraints.
*   **recursion and async can be tricky:** keep an eye on your call stack. you should always do tests for depth to avoid stack overflow.

i’ve learned over the years that this is one of the trickier parts of async programming. it’s a common mistake to think that `async def` solves every concurrency problem, and i understand your question, been there. it requires a more explicit understanding of how the event loop and coroutines interact. i also like to keep in mind that all those async operations are using a single thread, so if you are doing heavy math calculations instead of i/o bound operations, you will not see improvement.

**resources**

rather than specific links, i’d suggest diving into these resources for a more in-depth understanding:

*   **python's official `asyncio` documentation:** the standard library documentation is always a good place to start. it goes into the concepts in detail.
*   **"fluent python" by luciano ramalho:** this book has a great section on concurrency and coroutines that can help solidify the concepts. the book, in general, is excellent for the intermediate python developer.
*   **"effective python" by brett slatkine:** another great book that contains many examples of real-world usage of the async concept.

i hope this helps! let me know if you have other questions. and by the way, did you hear about the programmer who was stuck in the shower? he kept reading the shampoo bottle because the instructions said "lather, rinse, repeat."
