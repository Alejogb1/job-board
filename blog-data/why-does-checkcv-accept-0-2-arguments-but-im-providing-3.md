 It's a common frustration when you're expecting a function to behave one way and it's clearly doing something different. I remember back during a project involving a complex data ingestion pipeline, I ran headfirst into this exact issue – a function that was surprisingly flexible, or seemingly broken, depending on how you looked at it. The `check_cv()` function you're encountering, accepting zero to two arguments when you're providing three, strongly suggests that the function's logic is designed to handle optional parameters using default values or variable argument lists. Let's break down why this happens and how it's implemented in code.

The core issue here is parameter handling within the function's definition. Rather than a fixed signature requiring a specific number of arguments, `check_cv()` is designed to adapt. This flexibility is often achieved through a couple of mechanisms, and understanding them is key to solving your problem.

The most straightforward way to allow optional arguments is by specifying default values in the function signature itself. For example, if we define a function like this in Python:

```python
def check_cv(arg1=None, arg2=None):
    if arg1 is not None:
        print(f"Argument 1: {arg1}")
    if arg2 is not None:
         print(f"Argument 2: {arg2}")

    print("Function execution complete.")

# calling the function
check_cv()
check_cv(10)
check_cv(10,20)
```

In this case, the function `check_cv()` can be called with zero, one, or two arguments, because `arg1` and `arg2` default to `None` if no values are passed during the call. When you call `check_cv()` with three parameters, Python doesn’t know what to do with that third parameter and would generate a `TypeError`, complaining about too many positional arguments. This is not the same flexibility we are talking about in your question.

However, this isn't the mechanism I think is at play based on your original question because with default values, it wouldn't accept *more* parameters, just fewer than specified. What is likely happening is the use of variable positional arguments using `*args` which enables function to handle variable length argument lists.

Here's a slightly modified version that demonstrates this:

```python
def check_cv(*args):
    print(f"Received {len(args)} arguments:")
    for i, arg in enumerate(args):
        print(f"Argument {i + 1}: {arg}")
    print("Function execution complete.")

# calling the function
check_cv()
check_cv(1)
check_cv(1,2)
check_cv(1,2,3)
```

Notice that in this case, we can call the function with zero, one, two or even three arguments, all without throwing an error. Inside the function, `args` is a tuple containing all the positional arguments passed during the function call. This gives the function significant freedom in how it processes incoming data. Now, this starts to resemble the behavior you described in the question.

A third mechanism that's relevant, especially in more complex scenarios, is the use of keyword arguments denoted with `**kwargs`. Here's an illustration, building on the previous example:

```python
def check_cv(*args, **kwargs):
    print(f"Received {len(args)} positional arguments:")
    for i, arg in enumerate(args):
        print(f"Positional Argument {i + 1}: {arg}")

    print(f"Received {len(kwargs)} keyword arguments:")
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"Keyword Argument {key}: {value}")

    print("Function execution complete.")


#calling the function
check_cv(1, 2, param1="value1", param2="value2")
check_cv(1,2)
check_cv(param1="value1", param2="value2")
check_cv()
```

Here, `*args` collects any positional arguments (like `1`, `2`) as before, and `**kwargs` collects any keyword arguments (like `param1="value1"`) into a dictionary. If `check_cv()` uses `**kwargs`, it allows users to pass named parameters beyond the core arguments it might expect, which can make code much more expressive, and sometimes this flexibility might seem counterintuitive if you aren’t aware of it. The output of the first function call `check_cv(1, 2, param1="value1", param2="value2")` demonstrates this very flexibility. It demonstrates how all three arguments (`1, 2,` and the two keyword arguments) are captured within the function and handled accordingly.

So, based on your description, it seems like your `check_cv()` function is most likely implemented using `*args`, maybe in combination with default values or `**kwargs`, which makes it able to handle different numbers of arguments.

Now, how do you approach fixing this when it is unexpected behavior? Well, the core issue isn’t necessarily with `check_cv()`, but in the way you are attempting to call it. You’re feeding the function three arguments when it's designed to handle two or fewer. If you know you need to provide three specific pieces of data, the `check_cv` function may not be the appropriate method to use or it needs to be modified.

To resolve the issue, the first thing I’d suggest is to examine the documentation or source code for `check_cv()`. If it's a library function, its documentation should define the required input parameters and any optional arguments that can be supplied. Understanding this will illuminate which arguments are actually expected, and this allows you to correctly use `check_cv`.

If it's a function you have control over, I recommend re-evaluating the function’s signature. If you consistently need three arguments, refactor the function signature to require three mandatory parameters (without defaults) or use keyword arguments and validate the input. If the third argument you're providing should be treated as an optional, you should consider implementing your function to either ignore extra arguments or use it correctly, perhaps using *args and checking the length of the args tuple.

For more in-depth coverage of this topic, I recommend consulting "Effective Python" by Brett Slatkin. It provides excellent guidance on parameter handling and function design best practices. Additionally, "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho is an excellent resource that delves into Python's more intricate features, including function argument unpacking and manipulation. Finally, for a formal approach, the official Python documentation regarding function definitions and variable positional arguments is an invaluable resource. It contains a wealth of knowledge on how functions are defined in Python and how arguments are managed and accessed.

In summary, the ability of your `check_cv()` function to accept zero to two arguments while you’re providing three points to flexible argument handling within the function, using *args or potentially default values, and/or **kwargs. It’s not a bug, but a design choice that requires a deeper understanding of how the function operates and whether you are calling it correctly. Reviewing function definitions, documentation, and using the sources mentioned above are key in resolving this type of situation.
