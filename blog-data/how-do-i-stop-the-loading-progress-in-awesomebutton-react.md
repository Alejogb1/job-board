Right then, let's tackle this. You're looking to halt the loading progress of an `AwesomeButton` component in React. I've been down that road myself, more times than I care to count, and it’s usually tied to some asynchronous operation that didn’t quite play nice with the UI. The core issue isn’t usually the button component itself, but rather how you're managing the loading state and triggering the reset. The key is to have fine-grained control over your loading logic. It's not just about stopping, but about graceful transitions.

The `AwesomeButton` component, like many other UI libraries, relies heavily on state management. The "loading" or "progress" state is generally tied to a boolean or a numerical value, and toggling that usually controls the visual cues of a loading indicator or similar. When you want to stop the loading prematurely, you are essentially looking to directly manipulate this state variable.

Let's dissect how I usually approach this. First, remember that the `AwesomeButton` typically accepts a `loading` prop (or something similar depending on the specific variation). This prop’s value directly dictates the component’s visual state, and I've found it's crucial to tie it to a local component state that is manageable, particularly during asynchronous operations. If you’re passing a directly from the global store or prop it makes it harder to deal with edge cases. This is where controlled components become paramount.

The approach breaks down into these primary parts: initiating the loading state, managing asynchronous operations, and then crucially, resetting the loading state when necessary. This could be upon successful completion of the asynchronous task, encountering an error, or a user-initiated abort signal. The crucial part that directly addresses your issue involves the latter two. You need a mechanism to explicitly reset the component's loading state regardless of the outcome of the asynchronous task.

Let’s dive into the first example to illustrate this. Let's assume you've got a button that sends a request to the server and you are tracking the loading state in the `loading` variable.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import AwesomeButton from 'awesome-button-react'; // Assuming this is the import path

function MyButtonComponent() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);

  const handleClick = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/data'); // Example API call
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
      }
      const data = await response.json();
      setResult(data);

    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error during fetch:', error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);  // Crucial: Reset loading state in the finally block
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
        <AwesomeButton
            type="primary"
            loading={loading}
            onPress={handleClick}
        >
          { loading ? 'Loading...' : 'Fetch Data' }
        </AwesomeButton>
        {result && <p>Data received: {JSON.stringify(result)}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyButtonComponent;
```

In this snippet, the `finally` block ensures that the loading state is set back to `false` no matter if the promise in the `try` block resolves successfully or throws an error. This is a common way of cleaning up the state and enabling the button. This is the first basic pattern you should be thinking about.

Now, let's consider a scenario with an abort signal to interrupt an ongoing request. The ability to abruptly stop an operation might be a response to a user action or other application logic.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';
import AwesomeButton from 'awesome-button-react'; // Assuming this is the import path

function AbortableButton() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);
  const abortController = useRef(null);

  const handleClick = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    abortController.current = new AbortController();

    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/long-running-task', { signal: abortController.current.signal }); // Example API call
      if (!response.ok) {
         throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
       }
      const data = await response.json();
      setResult(data);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.name !== 'AbortError') { // Only log actual errors, not aborts
        console.error('Error during fetch:', error);
      }
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
      abortController.current = null;
    }
  };

  const handleAbort = () => {
     if (abortController.current) {
      abortController.current.abort();
    }
  };

  return (
      <div>
          <AwesomeButton
              type="primary"
              loading={loading}
              onPress={handleClick}
          >
              { loading ? 'Loading...' : 'Start Long Task' }
          </AwesomeButton>
          { loading && ( <AwesomeButton
            type="secondary"
            onPress={handleAbort}
            >Abort</AwesomeButton>)}
          {result && <p>Data received: {JSON.stringify(result)}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default AbortableButton;
```

Here, we've introduced `AbortController` to handle the interruption. If `handleAbort` is called while a fetch is running, the `fetch` is stopped, and the loading state is reset in the `finally` block. Note the check for `AbortError` within the `catch` clause; we only want to report actual network or server side issues, not client-initiated aborts. This is vital for a good user experience.

Finally, let’s address the edge case where the `AwesomeButton` component does not have direct support for a loading prop (or it’s malfunctioning). In such a case, we can directly control the `AwesomeButton` rendering by introducing our own state flag. We can manually disable the button when the operation is running. This ensures the user can not trigger additional network requests while loading.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';
import AwesomeButton from 'awesome-button-react'; // Assuming this is the import path


function MyFallbackButton() {
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
    const [result, setResult] = useState(null);
    const buttonRef = useRef(null);

    const handleClick = async () => {
      if(buttonRef.current.props.disabled) return;
        setLoading(true);
        buttonRef.current.props.disabled = true;

       try {
           const response = await fetch('/api/data'); // Example API call
           if (!response.ok) {
              throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
          }
          const data = await response.json();
           setResult(data);
        } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error during fetch:', error);
        } finally {
            setLoading(false);
            buttonRef.current.props.disabled = false;
        }
    };

    return (
       <div>
            <AwesomeButton
                type="primary"
                onPress={handleClick}
                ref={buttonRef}
            >
                { loading ? 'Loading...' : 'Fallback Fetch Data' }
            </AwesomeButton>
            {result && <p>Data received: {JSON.stringify(result)}</p>}
        </div>
    );
}


export default MyFallbackButton;
```

This approach uses a `ref` to interact directly with the underlying button's props. It's crucial to note this can be brittle, as library internals might change. However, in situations where the prop control isn’t working as expected, it provides a workaround until the issue is fixed in the dependency.

For deep dives into the principles underlying these examples, I’d recommend reviewing Eric Elliott's "Composing Software" which emphasizes composable architecture and asynchronous flow control, and also Dan Abramov’s blog, particularly the articles on controlled components and state management in React which provide in depth information and examples. Understanding these general concepts ensures we create resilient and reliable applications.

In summary, stopping the loading state in `AwesomeButton` (or similar components) is primarily about ensuring you control and manage the loading flags. These strategies, combined with a solid understanding of asynchronous operations in JavaScript and React’s rendering model, have always helped me manage loading states gracefully and effectively. Remember to address both success and failure cases in your asynchronous operations, and always consider the user experience when designing your component interactions.
