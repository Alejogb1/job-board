Alright, let's tackle this. I've spent quite a bit of time crafting visualizations with altair, and I've certainly encountered situations where the defaults just don't cut it. Your request to remove axes, connect points with lines, and apply opacity to the legend is a common scenario, and achieving it is pretty straightforward once you understand the underlying principles of altair's declarative approach.

To begin, remember that altair works by composing marks (like points, lines, bars) and encoding channels (like x, y, color, size). When you see a chart with axes, it's a consequence of altair's default configuration for those encodings. Removing axes essentially boils down to overriding those defaults.

**Removing Axes**

The key here is using `axis=None` within the encoding for the specific axis you wish to remove. For example, if you had a scatter plot with a conventional x and y axis, and you wanted to get rid of the x-axis, you’d specify `axis=None` in the `x` encoding. Let me walk you through a scenario I had with some sensor data – imagine tracking humidity and temperature readings where the actual values weren't as important as the relationship between them:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'humidity': [45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75],
    'temperature': [20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32]
})

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x=alt.X('humidity', axis=None),
    y=alt.Y('temperature')
)

chart.show()
```

In this code, I've used `axis=None` in the `x` encoding. The result is a plot with points still present, but the x-axis and its labels are completely removed. If you wanted to remove both axes, you'd apply `axis=None` to both `x` and `y` encodings.

**Connecting Data Points with a Line**

Connecting data points with a line is achieved by using a `mark_line` instead of `mark_point`. It’s crucial to have an x-axis in place (even if we hide it later) that altair can use to determine the order in which to draw the line. This is often a temporal variable, but it could be any ordinal variable that defines the sequence. Here's how this translates in the real world – think of plotting server load over time:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'time': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    'load': [10, 15, 12, 18, 22, 20, 25]
})

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_line().encode(
    x=alt.X('time', title='Time (Hours)'),
    y=alt.Y('load', title='Server Load'),
)

chart.show()
```

This snippet generates a line chart. Now, the points are implicitly connected by the line, making it very clear how the server load varies over the given time period. If your data points are not naturally ordered by an x-axis value, you'd probably need to first sort the data within pandas before passing it to altair.

**Adding Opacity to the Legend**

Altering the opacity of a legend isn’t directly accomplished by manipulating legend settings but by modifying the opacity of the *marks* that the legend represents. To explain, a legend in Altair doesn’t have its own independent opacity. It reflects the visual properties of the data. We need to apply an opacity to all the marks in the chart to alter the legend's apparent opacity, then optionally change the opacity of certain marks. Here's an example using multiple lines with different opacities – this could simulate, for example, visualizing different communication channels over the same timeline:

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'time': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    'channel_a': [10, 15, 12, 18, 22, 20, 25],
    'channel_b': [5, 8, 6, 10, 12, 11, 13]
})

chart = alt.Chart(data).transform_fold(
    fold=['channel_a', 'channel_b'],
    as_=['channel', 'load']
).mark_line().encode(
    x=alt.X('time', title='Time (Hours)'),
    y=alt.Y('load', title='Load'),
    color='channel:N',
    opacity=alt.value(0.6) # Apply overall opacity to lines and legend
)

chart.show()

```

In this example, I've added an `opacity` encoding, setting it to 0.6. This applies the transparency to the line *and* also to how it's shown in the legend. If you just want a faded legend, but not faded marks, there isn't a direct, built-in way to do that. You would have to manually create a legend with custom markers using something other than altair (or create custom mark encodings using conditional logic which can be complex).

**Further Exploration**

For a deeper dive into altair's specifics, I strongly recommend having a look at the official documentation, specifically the sections on encodings and marks. For a more conceptual understanding of declarative visualization, the book "Interactive Data Visualization for the Web" by Scott Murray provides excellent foundational knowledge. Another insightful resource for thinking about data visualization in general is "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" by Edward Tufte, although it isn't specific to altair, its principles are universal. The Vega-Lite documentation will also be useful, as altair is a high-level api for that library.

Keep experimenting, and you'll find altair's declarative approach becomes quite powerful for a wide array of visualization tasks.
