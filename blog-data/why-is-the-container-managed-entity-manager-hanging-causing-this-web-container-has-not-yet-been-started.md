Ah, the dreaded "this web container has not yet been started" message, coupled with a hanging entity manager. I've seen this particular flavor of frustration more times than I care to recall, often when dealing with intricate enterprise applications. Let's unpack what's likely happening, moving beyond the surface symptoms to the underlying causes.

Essentially, what we're seeing is a breakdown in the delicate dance between the application server’s lifecycle management and your application’s persistence layer – specifically, the entity manager within a container-managed context. The error message itself, "this web container has not yet been started," is a bit of a misnomer or, at least, an oversimplification. It doesn't necessarily mean that the application server literally hasn't started at all; rather, it’s typically an indication that the *context* in which the entity manager is operating hasn't been initialized *properly* or *completely*. Think of it like an actor trying to deliver lines on a stage that hasn't been properly set yet. They're there, but the environment isn't.

My experiences, particularly in architecting large-scale financial platforms, have repeatedly shown this stems from a few interconnected areas. The most frequent culprit, in my book, is related to transaction management in conjunction with the dependency injection framework. The container (like Glassfish, JBoss EAP, or Tomcat) is responsible for injecting the entity manager and managing the transactions when we use a container-managed approach, such as when we're using `@PersistenceContext`. This works incredibly well when all the components adhere to the transaction boundaries established by the container. The problem occurs when operations involving the entity manager are attempted outside of a valid transaction context, or when the transaction context itself is not properly initialized.

Consider this scenario: an EJB timer service, operating outside of the web request/response cycle, attempts to invoke a method that utilizes an injected entity manager. If the timer's execution context isn’t properly propagated with a transaction, the entity manager will effectively be "orphaned," and the underlying persistence context might not even exist. Similarly, if a singleton or application-scoped bean attempts to access an entity manager outside of a request context, you run into the same issue. It’s a classic case of trying to use a resource that's not yet ready for use in the current execution scope.

Another significant area to examine is related to resource configuration within the application server. Misconfigured data sources, connection pools, or insufficient resources allocated to the container can lead to timeouts and hang situations when the application is unable to establish a connection to the database backend or can’t complete its database interactions in the allotted time. In such cases, the initial connection attempt may be valid, but subsequent attempts will fail, exhibiting the "has not yet been started" behavior, particularly during application startup. The entity manager's injection point could be valid, the transaction could even be present, but the fundamental connectivity is the problem. I've personally seen connection pool exhaustion cause these types of errors, especially under heavy load or when pooling configurations are inadequate.

Let me illustrate with code.

**Example 1: EJB Timer Service (Incorrect)**

This example shows a potential issue with an EJB timer accessing the entity manager without proper transaction management.

```java
import javax.ejb.*;
import javax.persistence.*;

@Stateless
public class MyTimerBean {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;

    @Schedule(hour = "*", minute = "*", second = "*/10", persistent = false)
    public void myTimerMethod() {
         // Problematic: This is outside a transaction.
        try {
           MyEntity myEntity = em.find(MyEntity.class, 1);
           if (myEntity != null) {
              // ... perform actions
              System.out.println("Entity found " + myEntity.getId());
           }
        } catch(Exception e) {
           System.err.println("Error in timer: " + e.getMessage());
           e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this snippet, the EJB Timer’s `myTimerMethod` attempts to use the injected entity manager without explicit transaction management provided by the container. The correct way is to use `@TransactionAttribute` or similar annotations, which we demonstrate in example 2.

**Example 2: EJB Timer Service (Corrected)**

Here's the improved version with proper transaction demarcation.

```java
import javax.ejb.*;
import javax.persistence.*;
import javax.transaction.Transactional;


@Stateless
public class MyTimerBean {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;


    @Schedule(hour = "*", minute = "*", second = "*/10", persistent = false)
    @Transactional(Transactional.TxType.REQUIRED)
    public void myTimerMethod() {
        try {
            MyEntity myEntity = em.find(MyEntity.class, 1);
            if (myEntity != null) {
                 // ... perform actions
                 System.out.println("Entity found " + myEntity.getId());
            }
        } catch(Exception e) {
          System.err.println("Error in timer: " + e.getMessage());
           e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

The `@Transactional(Transactional.TxType.REQUIRED)` annotation ensures that the method execution occurs within a transaction boundary managed by the container, making the entity manager safe to use. I've seen such annotations save countless headaches during maintenance periods. It’s critical to understand that container-managed entity managers must be used within their appropriate context.

**Example 3: Poorly Configured Singleton Bean**

Now let’s consider a singleton bean improperly interacting with the entity manager:

```java
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.ejb.*;
import javax.persistence.*;

@Singleton
@Startup
public class ConfigLoader {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;

    @PostConstruct
    public void init(){
         // Problematic: This is called during startup outside request scope
        try{
           MyConfig config = em.find(MyConfig.class, 1); // Potential issue
            System.out.println("Config: " + config.getValue());
        } catch(Exception e) {
           System.err.println("Error during init: " + e.getMessage());
           e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This code demonstrates a singleton that tries to access the entity manager during application startup, which typically happens outside of any request context, leading to the problem we're discussing. The fix here involves deferring the entity manager access until a proper context is established. Usually, a good solution is to move the load logic into an EJB and expose an interface that can be called later on, once a valid context has been established.

To further investigate these types of issues, I recommend looking into several resources. The *Java Persistence API, Volume 2: Advanced Techniques and Best Practices* by Mike Keith and Merrick Schincariol is an invaluable book for understanding the finer points of JPA and transaction management. For transaction management specifics, I'd also recommend reviewing the *EJB Specification* (available on the Oracle website) and focusing on sections related to container-managed transactions and resource injection. Additionally, in-depth documentation for your specific application server (Glassfish, JBoss EAP, etc.) will be useful for data source and connection pool troubleshooting.

In summary, the "this web container has not yet been started" message, when coupled with a hanging entity manager, points towards a combination of lifecycle management and transactional boundary issues. By ensuring that entity manager operations occur within properly demarcated transaction contexts, especially for non-request-based methods, and carefully reviewing data source configurations, we can avoid these frustrating situations and have our persistence layer operating as it should. These are, from my experience, the critical areas to scrutinize when troubleshooting.
