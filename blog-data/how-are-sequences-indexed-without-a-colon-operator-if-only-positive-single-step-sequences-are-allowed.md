Alright, let’s tackle this. Indexing sequences without a colon operator, limiting ourselves to positive, single-step progressions, it's a scenario that might initially feel a bit restrictive, but it forces a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics at play. I've actually encountered this in a past project involving custom data processing pipelines where memory was extremely constrained, and using the conventional colon operator with its implied dynamic allocation was simply not viable. Instead of directly slicing using `a[start:end:step]`, we have to think about it as a combination of individual positional lookups.

The core idea is to emulate the behavior of a colon-based slice using only a single index lookup per element and, fundamentally, employing iteration to achieve the desired sequence. It all boils down to calculating indices manually, based on your desired starting point and single-step increments.

Let's break it down. In essence, the expression `a[start:end:1]` (where step is always 1) implies you're effectively selecting elements at indices `start`, `start + 1`, `start + 2`, all the way up to (but not including) `end`. So, to perform this without the colon operator, we'd utilize a loop to explicitly compute these indices and retrieve corresponding items.

Let's start with a foundational example using Python. Imagine we're using a list, but the principles apply equally to other sequence-like structures.

```python
def single_step_slice_1(sequence, start, end):
  """
  Emulates a single-step slice using a loop and explicit index calculation.

  Args:
    sequence: The input sequence (e.g., list, tuple).
    start: The starting index (inclusive).
    end: The ending index (exclusive).

  Returns:
    A new list containing the sliced elements.
  """
  result = []
  for i in range(start, end):
    result.append(sequence[i])
  return result


# Example usage
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
sliced_list = single_step_slice_1(my_list, 2, 5)  # Expected: [30, 40, 50]
print(f"Sliced result: {sliced_list}")
```

In this snippet, `single_step_slice_1` takes the sequence, start index, and end index as input. The loop generates each index from start up to, but not including, end, and then retrieves that specific element from the sequence. This method directly translates the slicing intent into iterative retrieval.

While the above example creates a new list, the same logic can be used to iterate over the elements without materializing them. This is quite useful when dealing with very large sequences, as it avoids the memory overhead of creating a new container.

```python
def single_step_slice_2(sequence, start, end):
  """
  Yields elements from a single-step slice, without storing them in a new list.

  Args:
    sequence: The input sequence.
    start: The starting index (inclusive).
    end: The ending index (exclusive).

  Yields:
    Individual elements from the slice, without constructing a list.
  """
  for i in range(start, end):
      yield sequence[i]


# Example usage
my_tuple = (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700)
for item in single_step_slice_2(my_tuple, 1, 4):  # Expected: 200, 300, 400
  print(f"Yielded item: {item}")
```

Here, the function `single_step_slice_2` makes use of a `yield` keyword, turning it into a generator. This allows us to access the sliced elements one at a time without storing them in memory. Again, this iteration is what the traditional colon operator often does under the hood anyway.

Now, let's see how we might achieve the same effect in C++, as that often illustrates the concepts more explicitly at lower levels.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> singleStepSliceCpp(const std::vector<int>& sequence, int start, int end) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
        result.push_back(sequence[i]);
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> myVector = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    std::vector<int> slicedVector = singleStepSliceCpp(myVector, 2, 5);  // Expected: 3, 4, 5

    std::cout << "Sliced result: ";
    for (int val : slicedVector) {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The C++ example `singleStepSliceCpp` performs a similar operation to the Python `single_step_slice_1`.  It loops through the index range, from start to end, and adds the corresponding element from the input vector to a new vector, which is then returned. This C++ code explicitly uses indices in the loop to accomplish the indexing. The crucial point here is that in the absence of the direct `vector[start:end]` operation, the underlying index access becomes more evident.

In short, while we're not using the colon, we are still adhering to positional access. This method involves explicit index calculations and leveraging iteration. If you’re curious to go deeper, consider exploring resources on efficient data structure implementations or compiler design which details how these low level operations are performed under the hood for higher level operators like the colon operator, these resources will cover the foundational concepts that this logic is built upon. For example, “Introduction to Algorithms” by Thomas H. Cormen et al. would give very good theoretical understanding and “Modern Compiler Implementation in C” by Andrew Appel for practical applications. “Effective Modern C++” by Scott Meyers is an excellent source for understanding the nuances of modern C++, which may be helpful if you choose to extend or adapt the C++ example given above.

Ultimately, by understanding the fundamentals of how these operations function at lower levels, you gain a more profound appreciation for the seemingly more abstract mechanisms that come with higher-level operators and how to perform those operations at the level of individual indexing.
