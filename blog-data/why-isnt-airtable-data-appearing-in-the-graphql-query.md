Let's dissect this. In my experience, specifically back when I was building that inventory management system for a local retail chain, we encountered this exact issue. Airtable, with its user-friendly interface, was our go-to for data storage, and we were using GraphQL as our API layer. The initial setup seemed straightforward, but when the GraphQL queries consistently returned empty datasets or threw errors indicating absent fields, the debugging process began. It turned out, predictably, to be a multi-faceted issue.

One of the most frequent culprits is the way Airtable structures data and how that translates, or sometimes doesn’t, into a GraphQL schema. Airtable's 'base' is essentially a database with tables, each table having fields (columns). When connecting through an API, especially with GraphQL, it's vital to remember that the field names, their casing, and their type mappings are incredibly sensitive. I’ve seen cases where a field named “ProductName” in Airtable was expected as "product_name" in the GraphQL query, or even "productName" due to schema auto-generation attempting different naming conventions. Even subtle variations can cause data to disappear from the query result. This mismatch often stems from automatic schema generation tools not accurately reflecting Airtable’s exact naming conventions or data type specifics. This leads to a situation where the resolvers can't locate the intended field, and null values or empty arrays result.

The second common error source relates to the intricacies of Airtable’s API permissions and the associated rate limits. Airtable employs a per-base API key, and this key needs to possess sufficient access to the underlying data. It's not unusual, particularly in larger teams, to encounter configurations where the API key in use doesn’t have 'read' permissions for the specific table or base. If your query is attempting to fetch data from a protected resource, you’ll get empty results or errors like a 401 (Unauthorized) or a 403 (Forbidden). Furthermore, Airtable has relatively strict rate limits, and exceeding them, especially during development, can lead to temporary blocks, resulting in delayed or nonexistent data within your GraphQL queries. Proper caching and optimized queries become extremely crucial to avoid hitting the limits. Back in my project, we experienced this with a series of very frequent query executions that tripped the rate limits and took us a bit to diagnose.

Third, and quite often overlooked, are the subtle issues with GraphQL schema definitions themselves. If you're using a GraphQL server that relies on automatically generating schema from your Airtable connection, it can sometimes misinterpret data types, leading to issues. For example, a formula field in Airtable may be dynamically typed and may not consistently map to a scalar type in GraphQL. Complex linked record fields (i.e. Airtable relationships) require special handling within your GraphQL resolvers; without that proper handling, the fields will appear as empty in GraphQL responses, or even lead to errors if not properly accounted for.

To illustrate these points, let me share some snippets:

**Snippet 1: Basic Type Mismatch**

Let’s assume an Airtable table named “Products” with a field called “ProductName” of type ‘text’. A GraphQL schema might incorrectly define it as a different case.

Airtable Data:
```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "recABC123",
      "fields": {
        "ProductName": "Laptop"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Incorrect GraphQL Schema:
```graphql
type Product {
  productName: String
}
```

Correct GraphQL Schema:
```graphql
type Product {
  ProductName: String
}
```

GraphQL Query (Will Fail):
```graphql
query {
  products {
     productName
  }
}
```
GraphQL Query (Will Succeed):
```graphql
query {
  products {
     ProductName
  }
}
```

In this case, the difference between ‘ProductName’ and ‘productName’ prevents the resolver from fetching data correctly.

**Snippet 2: API Permission Issue**

Assuming you are using node.js with axios and the ‘airtable’ library, here's how an API permission issue manifests:

```javascript
// Correct API key
const airtable = require('airtable');
const base = new airtable({ apiKey: 'YOUR_CORRECT_API_KEY' }).base('YOUR_BASE_ID');

// This should work if correct API_KEY is used with read permissions.
base('Products').select().firstPage((err, records) => {
    if (err) { console.error('Error fetching data:', err); return; }
  console.log(records);
});

// Incorrect API key or key without read permission results in error
const restrictedKey = 'INCORRECT_OR_RESTRICTED_API_KEY';
const restrictedBase = new airtable({ apiKey: restrictedKey }).base('YOUR_BASE_ID');

restrictedBase('Products').select().firstPage((err, records) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error: Unauthorized or restricted permissions", err); //This will likely print an error
    return;
  }
  console.log("Data:", records); // This may not log anything or log an empty array
});

```

This example demonstrates how a missing or incorrect api key leads to data retrieval failures. The error object will usually contain a ‘401’ or ‘403’ status error code.

**Snippet 3: Complex Field Handling**

If your 'Products' table has a linked record to another table (say, 'Categories'), here's how your GraphQL resolver might handle it:

Airtable Data:
```json
// Products table record with linked record to "Categories" table
{
    "id": "recXyz789",
    "fields":{
        "ProductName": "Tablet",
        "Category": ["recCatABC"] //Linked record to category "Electronics"
    }
}

// Categories table record
{
    "id": "recCatABC",
    "fields":{
        "CategoryName": "Electronics"
    }
}
```

GraphQL Schema:
```graphql
type Product {
  ProductName: String
  Category: Category
}

type Category {
  CategoryName: String
}
```
GraphQL Resolvers:

```javascript
// This uses Node.js with an 'airtable' connection.
const resolvers = {
  Product: {
    Category: async (parent) => {
        const linkedCategoryId = parent.fields.Category[0];  // Extract the linked id
        if (!linkedCategoryId) return null;

      const categoryRecord = await base('Categories').find(linkedCategoryId); // Query to fetch linked category data
      return {CategoryName: categoryRecord.fields.CategoryName}
    },
  },
};
```

Without this resolver specifically handling the linked record, the 'Category' field would either be missing, or just return the id of the linked record. This highlights the necessity to appropriately handle more complex field types.

To address the core issue – why isn't Airtable data appearing in a GraphQL query – I always recommend a meticulous debugging approach that involves validating schema definitions, ensuring that your resolver logic appropriately handles the various Airtable field types, checking api access, and being mindful of the rate limiting. Always consult the official Airtable API documentation, and the GraphQL specification; I found "GraphQL in Action" by Manning Publications to be a fantastic resource when I was getting to grips with graphql. As for data modeling and API design in general, “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” by Martin Kleppmann is absolutely foundational. Pay close attention to those seemingly insignificant details in configurations, and you will often discover the reason behind the missing data. Remember that consistent logging and testing are pivotal. Ultimately, systematic troubleshooting is key to overcoming these kinds of technical challenges.
