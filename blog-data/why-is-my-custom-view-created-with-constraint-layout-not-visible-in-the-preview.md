,  It’s a situation I’ve seen countless times, and it usually boils down to a few core issues when your custom view, built with `ConstraintLayout`, decides to play hide-and-seek in the preview. Having personally debugged this more than I'd like to remember, I can tell you it rarely points to a fundamental flaw in your logic, but more commonly to how layout previews are rendered and interpreted.

The preview in Android Studio, while immensely helpful, isn’t a perfect representation of the runtime environment. It operates under slightly different constraints and assumptions, leading to these frustrating moments where everything seems correctly configured yet doesn't appear. We need to look beyond the obvious. The core problem isn't that the preview is broken, but that your view is missing the necessary context to render itself within that confined environment. Let's unpack the likely suspects.

One frequent culprit is the absence of explicit layout constraints within your custom view’s logic. While `ConstraintLayout` offers flexibility, a lack of definitive rules about how your view should position itself within its parent container can confuse the preview. Remember, the preview uses a simplified rendering mechanism, often relying heavily on explicit positioning and sizing information derived from your layout XML and, crucial here, your view’s custom implementation.

For instance, I once had a custom graph view that didn't show up. The `onMeasure` method was designed to calculate sizes based on dynamic data, which was only available at runtime. The preview, lacking that data, had no basis to determine the view's dimensions, so it essentially rendered an empty space. To remedy this, I needed to add explicit sizing constraints that at least provided a default size for the view within the layout XML. This ensured that the preview at least had a footprint for the view.

Let's demonstrate this with some hypothetical code examples. Suppose you have a custom view called `CustomGraphView`:

```java
//Example 1: CustomGraphView without sufficient constraints
public class CustomGraphView extends View {

    //... constructors and other necessary methods

    @Override
    protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
      // Here we rely on runtime data to determine size, causing preview issues.
      setMeasuredDimension(calculateDesiredWidth(), calculateDesiredHeight());
    }

    private int calculateDesiredWidth(){
        //Implementation that uses some data loaded at runtime
        return 200; //Placeholder. In reality relies on runtime data
    }

    private int calculateDesiredHeight(){
       //Implementation that uses some data loaded at runtime
        return 150; //Placeholder. In reality relies on runtime data
    }

    //... other overrides for draw etc.
}
```

And in your layout xml:

```xml
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <com.example.myapp.CustomGraphView
        android:id="@+id/customGraphView"
        android:layout_width="0dp"
        android:layout_height="0dp"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"/>
</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

Here, despite the constraint layout defining the view boundaries via the 'match_parent' attribute and constraints to all parent edges, our `CustomGraphView` won’t show up in preview. The issue lies in its `onMeasure` method. It attempts to compute its size based on runtime data which is unavailable to the preview.

A quick fix involves ensuring the view has a default size if such data is missing. This might require adding default sizing within `onMeasure`, or directly setting minimum width/height in the view's constructor, or even, in many cases, using hardcoded values in the layout XML when we explicitly want a specific size for the view.

```java
//Example 2: CustomGraphView with Default constraints.
public class CustomGraphView extends View {

    public CustomGraphView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs){
        super(context, attrs);
        setMinimumHeight(100);
        setMinimumWidth(100);
    }
    //... constructors and other necessary methods

    @Override
    protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
       int desiredWidth = calculateDesiredWidth();
       int desiredHeight = calculateDesiredHeight();

       if(desiredWidth == 0) {
          desiredWidth = 150;
       }

        if(desiredHeight == 0) {
          desiredHeight = 100;
       }
        setMeasuredDimension(desiredWidth, desiredHeight);
    }

    private int calculateDesiredWidth(){
        //Implementation that uses some data loaded at runtime
        return 0; //Placeholder returns zero when data not available.
    }

    private int calculateDesiredHeight(){
       //Implementation that uses some data loaded at runtime
        return 0; //Placeholder returns zero when data not available.
    }

    //... other overrides for draw etc.
}
```

And the layout XML remains the same. Now the view will have default dimensions even when there is no data, this would render in the preview.

Another common problem I've seen revolves around how custom attributes are handled. If your custom view relies on custom attributes defined in `attrs.xml`, and those attributes are vital for rendering (like colors, sizes, or text), the preview might stumble if the layout does not provide default values or if your view doesn’t appropriately default those values in the constructor when the attributes aren't specified in the layout.

Consider a situation with a custom button-like view named `CustomButton`, where a color attribute is crucial:

```java
//Example 3: CustomButton with custom attribute but no fallback.

public class CustomButton extends View {
  private int buttonColor = Color.BLUE;

   public CustomButton(Context context, AttributeSet attrs){
     super(context, attrs);
     TypedArray a = context.getTheme().obtainStyledAttributes(
        attrs,
        R.styleable.CustomButton,
        0, 0);

       try {
        buttonColor = a.getColor(R.styleable.CustomButton_buttonColor, Color.BLUE);
       }
       finally {
           a.recycle();
       }

   }
   //... Constructors and methods
   @Override
    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas){
        Paint paint = new Paint();
        paint.setColor(buttonColor);
        canvas.drawRect(0,0,getWidth(),getHeight(), paint);

   }

}
```

In your `attrs.xml`:
```xml
<resources>
    <declare-styleable name="CustomButton">
        <attr name="buttonColor" format="color"/>
    </declare-styleable>
</resources>

```
And in the layout:

```xml
<com.example.myapp.CustomButton
   android:id="@+id/customButton"
   android:layout_width="wrap_content"
   android:layout_height="wrap_content"
   app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
   app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />
```

Here, if you forget to define the `buttonColor` attribute within the XML, the preview may show nothing or a default view because the `getColor` method fetches the attribute color or a default (in this case blue). However, if the default is not explicitly set the color can default to transparent. Now consider if you define the attribute in xml like so:
```xml
<com.example.myapp.CustomButton
    android:id="@+id/customButton"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:buttonColor="@color/my_color"
    app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />
```
The view now works in preview because a concrete colour is set via the XML attribute. If you are still having issues, it’s crucial to thoroughly inspect your `onMeasure` and `onDraw` methods, ensuring that no critical dependencies are overlooked by the preview's renderer. This includes any external dependencies on context-specific objects or values that might not be initialized or accessible in the preview context.

To delve deeper into the intricacies of custom view creation and layout rendering, I recommend resources such as “Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide” by Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart, and Brian Hardy. This book provides comprehensive coverage of view rendering and layout best practices. Also, the official Android documentation on custom views (developer.android.com) offers vital, practical guidance on implementing views properly, which can significantly reduce such headaches. I'd also suggest exploring articles from Romain Guy, especially older pieces on layout and rendering as the fundamentals are still very relevant. Understanding the intricacies of how Android layouts and views are created and rendered at lower levels is extremely helpful.
In summary, your custom view not appearing is rarely a mistake, but rather an indication that some context or default behaviour is missing. By focusing on providing sufficient context and constraints to your custom view you should resolve your issue.
