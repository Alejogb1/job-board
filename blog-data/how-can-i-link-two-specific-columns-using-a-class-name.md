Alright, let's tackle this. It's a fairly common scenario, linking column data based on a shared class, and I've seen it pop up in various forms over my career. Typically, it stems from situations where you're working with dynamically generated tables or tabular data within a web application, or perhaps even data manipulation within a scripting environment where traditional relational joins are not feasible. What we are essentially aiming for is a functional relationship based on the presence of a particular class instead of a conventional database foreign key.

The challenge, as I've discovered through several less-than-ideal attempts, is not simply about *finding* elements with the same class, but establishing a coherent association, a mapping between two *specific* columns, and doing so efficiently. This involves a bit more than just selector-based manipulations. We need a clear strategy to tie the relevant pieces together.

From what I've seen, the core issue often arises when you have distinct table structures or data sources that lack explicit linking identifiers. For instance, I once worked on a legacy e-commerce platform that utilized a very old and rather... *unique* way of storing product attributes. The table layouts were haphazard, and rather than normalizing properly, product information was scattered across different tables and linked using a combination of id-related and class-related tags within the html rendering system, which was less than ideal to say the least. The html template might represent product names in one column with class 'product-name' and related attributes, such as price, in another with class 'product-price', all dynamically added from an arbitrary collection of data, but crucially, *with a shared index implicit in the html table structure*.

The solution typically involves a combination of DOM manipulation (if working in a browser environment) and a structured approach to handling the data, ideally creating some form of dictionary for linking rows by their shared classes. We can't rely on ids, of course, since the problem explicitly avoids that. Therefore, we utilize the implied order within the html to establish the relationship, rather than explicit keys. This can be achieved by using selector-based techniques, but careful iteration is critical. It’s worth mentioning that while using CSS classes this way *works*, it’s not ideal for many reasons. Specifically, relying on CSS classes for data association creates an unintentional dependency on the presentation layer of your application, which can cause serious problems down the line. However, within the context of this problem, it’s a constraint we have to deal with.

Let me give you three different working code examples to illustrate. I’ll use Javascript examples since that’s where I’ve most frequently encountered this type of problem, but similar logic can be easily applied in other programming contexts.

**Example 1: Simple Table Linking Using `querySelectorAll` and Index**

This first example tackles the scenario where you have a single html table. We assume that both the ‘product-name’ class and the ‘product-price’ class will exist at the *same* ordinal position in each row of the table.

```javascript
function linkColumnsByIndex(tableId, nameClass, priceClass) {
    const table = document.getElementById(tableId);
    if (!table) return {};

    const nameElements = table.querySelectorAll('.' + nameClass);
    const priceElements = table.querySelectorAll('.' + priceClass);

    if (nameElements.length !== priceElements.length) {
        console.warn("Mismatch in element counts; cannot establish valid links.");
        return {};
    }

    const linkedData = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < nameElements.length; i++) {
      linkedData[nameElements[i].textContent.trim()] = priceElements[i].textContent.trim();
    }
    return linkedData;
}


// Example Usage (assuming a table with id "myTable" exists)
/*
<table id="myTable">
    <tr>
        <td class="product-name">Product A</td>
        <td class="product-price">$10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="product-name">Product B</td>
        <td class="product-price">$20</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="product-name">Product C</td>
        <td class="product-price">$30</td>
    </tr>
</table>
*/

const linkedProducts = linkColumnsByIndex("myTable", "product-name", "product-price");
console.log(linkedProducts);  // Output: { 'Product A': '$10', 'Product B': '$20', 'Product C': '$30' }
```

This function locates all the elements having the specified classes within a specified table element and pairs them up based on index, storing the name and price within a dictionary using the product name as a key. The *crucial* assumption here is that the *same* row index represents the same entity across classes.

**Example 2: Linking With Multiple Tables, Same Structure**

In this version, imagine that the same structure is repeated across different tables, but you need to consolidate it. We will now use an array for each table rather than an object, given that our keys may be duplicated between tables. We also add error checking to handle cases where data is missing.

```javascript
function linkColumnsAcrossTables(tableIds, nameClass, priceClass) {
    const allLinkedData = [];

    for (const tableId of tableIds) {
      const table = document.getElementById(tableId);
      if (!table) {
          console.warn(`Table with id ${tableId} not found. Skipping.`);
          continue; // Move to the next table
      }

      const nameElements = table.querySelectorAll('.' + nameClass);
      const priceElements = table.querySelectorAll('.' + priceClass);


      if (nameElements.length === 0 || priceElements.length === 0 || nameElements.length !== priceElements.length) {
        console.warn(`Mismatch in element counts or no matching elements found in table ${tableId}. Skipping.`);
        continue;
      }

        const linkedData = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < nameElements.length; i++) {
          const name = nameElements[i].textContent.trim();
          const price = priceElements[i].textContent.trim();
          linkedData.push({ name: name, price: price });
        }

      allLinkedData.push(...linkedData);
    }
  return allLinkedData;
}

// Example Usage (assuming tables with ids "table1", "table2", and "table3" exist with similar structures)
/*
<table id="table1">
    <tr>
        <td class="product-name">Product A</td>
        <td class="product-price">$10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="product-name">Product B</td>
        <td class="product-price">$20</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<table id="table2">
    <tr>
        <td class="product-name">Product C</td>
        <td class="product-price">$30</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td class="product-name">Product A</td>
        <td class="product-price">$100</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<table id="table3">
    <tr>
        <td class="product-name">Product D</td>
        <td class="product-price">$40</td>
    </tr>
</table>
*/

const linkedProductsMultiTable = linkColumnsAcrossTables(["table1", "table2", "table3"], "product-name", "product-price");
console.log(linkedProductsMultiTable); // Output:  [ { name: 'Product A', price: '$10' }, { name: 'Product B', price: '$20' }, { name: 'Product C', price: '$30' }, { name: 'Product A', price: '$100' }, { name: 'Product D', price: '$40' } ]
```

This example expands upon the first example by iterating over a list of table ids and processing each table. Each table's linked information is added to a cumulative array. This provides data consolidation across multiple, similarly structured tables, which was a common requirement in the past.

**Example 3: Handling Complex Structures with a Custom Attribute**

Sometimes the relationship is not as clean as simple ordinal pairing. Here, we assume that the elements contain a common ‘data-ref’ attribute that establishes the connection and remove the dependency on the table structure itself.

```javascript
function linkColumnsByAttribute(containerId, nameClass, priceClass, attribute) {
    const container = document.getElementById(containerId);
    if (!container) return {};

    const nameElements = container.querySelectorAll('.' + nameClass);
    const priceElements = container.querySelectorAll('.' + priceClass);
    const linkedData = {};

    for(const nameElement of nameElements)
      {
        const ref = nameElement.getAttribute(attribute);
          if(ref){
            for (const priceElement of priceElements)
              {
                if(priceElement.getAttribute(attribute) === ref)
                {
                  linkedData[nameElement.textContent.trim()] = priceElement.textContent.trim();
                  break; // Found it, no need to keep searching for this 'name' entry
                }
              }
        }
      }
  return linkedData;
}


// Example Usage (assuming a container with id "dataContainer" exists)
/*
<div id="dataContainer">
 <div class="product-name" data-ref="prod1">Product A</div><div class="product-price" data-ref="prod1">$10</div>
 <div class="product-name" data-ref="prod2">Product B</div><div class="product-price" data-ref="prod2">$20</div>
 <div class="product-name" data-ref="prod3">Product C</div><div class="product-price" data-ref="prod3">$30</div>
</div>
*/

const linkedProductsAttribute = linkColumnsByAttribute("dataContainer", "product-name", "product-price", 'data-ref');
console.log(linkedProductsAttribute);  // Output: { 'Product A': '$10', 'Product B': '$20', 'Product C': '$30' }
```

This example is the most robust and scalable of the three. Instead of relying on index based ordering of the elements, we instead link elements through a common attribute. Note how we break from the inner loop when a matching element is found and thus avoid unintended pairings.

For anyone who wishes to deepen their knowledge of DOM manipulation and general web development, I would recommend the "JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development" by Jon Duckett. It is an excellent starting point and will give you the necessary foundations. If you are looking to delve deeper into JavaScript specifically, "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke is an invaluable resource, especially for its more in-depth analysis of language mechanics. For a deeper discussion on data structure and algorithm optimization, particularly how to properly use dictionaries (or hash-maps) within JavaScript, "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen is essential reading.

Remember, that although using CSS classes for data linking *works* in a pinch, it’s best avoided in favor of a well-structured data approach where relationships are stored as relational keys, not implicit assumptions. If you find yourself in such a situation repeatedly, it’s likely worthwhile to redesign your architecture or your data storage practices.
