Alright, let's tackle this. You're dealing with multi-class accuracy in Keras, which, while seemingly straightforward, has nuances that can trip you up if you're not careful. I've personally debugged this scenario more times than I care to remember, often after some perfectly fine-looking code was reporting bizarre accuracy scores. It's not that the framework is faulty; it's more about understanding *what* Keras is calculating, and how that aligns with your specific problem.

The core challenge arises from the fact that "accuracy" isn't a singular, universally applicable concept, especially when you move beyond binary classification. In multi-class problems, we need to be precise about what we mean by a "correct" prediction.

The primary method Keras uses for calculating multi-class accuracy during training and evaluation is based on the *categorical accuracy* metric. This metric calculates the proportion of instances where the model’s *argmax* prediction aligns with the *one-hot encoded* target. In other words, it checks if the class with the highest predicted probability matches the true class. This approach works flawlessly if your target labels are one-hot encoded, and Keras handles that for you automatically when the loss function is configured for categorical targets.

Now, here's where you can run into trouble. If your target labels are not one-hot encoded but are instead integer class labels, Keras will still try to calculate accuracy using this *categorical* approach. This results in incorrect accuracy measures as Keras will expect probabilities for each class, not integer labels. This is a frequent source of confusion. You will need to convert those integer labels to one-hot encoding via `tensorflow.keras.utils.to_categorical()` or `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`.

Another important point to consider is how `metrics` are defined. If you provide the accuracy metric (e.g., `metrics=['accuracy']`), Keras internally will select the correct accuracy metric based on the defined loss function. If you are using `categorical_crossentropy` for your loss, categorical accuracy will be used. If `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` is used for your loss, Keras will select `sparse_categorical_accuracy`. But it's worth explicitly specifying `tf.keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy()` or `tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy()` for clarity and control, to ensure there is no confusion of what the training process is doing.

Let me illustrate this with some code examples. In the first one, I will deliberately use categorical accuracy incorrectly with integer encoded data:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate integer-encoded multi-class data
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1])
y_pred = np.array([[0.8, 0.1, 0.1],
                  [0.2, 0.7, 0.1],
                  [0.1, 0.2, 0.7],
                  [0.9, 0.05, 0.05],
                  [0.3, 0.6, 0.1]]) # Probabilities

# This is incorrect! Will result in wrong accuracy as `y_true` is not one-hot
metric = tf.keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy()
metric.update_state(y_true, y_pred)
result = metric.result()
print(f"Incorrect categorical accuracy: {result.numpy()}")
```

In this example, I deliberately pass integer labels for `y_true`, but the accuracy metric interprets these as if they were one-hot encoded. This will result in an incorrect result for the accuracy. The output accuracy is not meaningful in this context.

Here is a corrected example of a standard use case with one-hot encoded data:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate one-hot encoded multi-class data
y_true = np.array([[1, 0, 0],
                   [0, 1, 0],
                   [0, 0, 1],
                   [1, 0, 0],
                   [0, 1, 0]])
y_pred = np.array([[0.8, 0.1, 0.1],
                  [0.2, 0.7, 0.1],
                  [0.1, 0.2, 0.7],
                  [0.9, 0.05, 0.05],
                  [0.3, 0.6, 0.1]])

# Use CategoricalAccuracy when the data is one-hot
metric = tf.keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy()
metric.update_state(y_true, y_pred)
result = metric.result()
print(f"Correct Categorical Accuracy: {result.numpy()}")
```

Here, `y_true` is represented in one-hot encoded format, and `CategoricalAccuracy` metric is utilized. This will produce the correct accuracy for these inputs.

Finally, let's see an example of using `SparseCategoricalAccuracy` correctly with integer labels:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate integer-encoded multi-class data
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1])
y_pred = np.array([[0.8, 0.1, 0.1],
                  [0.2, 0.7, 0.1],
                  [0.1, 0.2, 0.7],
                  [0.9, 0.05, 0.05],
                  [0.3, 0.6, 0.1]])

# Use SparseCategoricalAccuracy when the data is integer-encoded
metric = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy()
metric.update_state(y_true, y_pred)
result = metric.result()
print(f"Correct Sparse Categorical Accuracy: {result.numpy()}")
```

In this case, the target labels `y_true` are integer-encoded, and `SparseCategoricalAccuracy` is correctly applied, and this provides the appropriate accuracy calculation.

It's crucial to select the right metric depending on your label encoding scheme. As a rule of thumb, if your target variables are represented as integer class labels, then use `SparseCategoricalAccuracy`, and when your data is one-hot encoded, use `CategoricalAccuracy`.

To deepen your understanding, I'd highly recommend exploring "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. It's a comprehensive text covering the fundamentals of deep learning. Specifically, the chapters on classification metrics, loss functions, and neural network training mechanics will be highly relevant here. Furthermore, the official TensorFlow documentation on metrics, particularly those related to classification, is an invaluable resource. Reading these materials will further solidify your understanding of how accuracy is measured and applied in machine learning and give you a much better understanding of the different use cases for each metric type. There are some good tutorials on the Keras website too. Additionally, the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron provides a practical guide and explanations to deep learning and will help you solidify your practical understanding.

Ultimately, the key to correct multi-class accuracy in Keras, as with most things in software, is meticulous attention to detail. Understanding exactly what your data and the functions you're using are expecting will save you from many hours of debugging, and that is what I have learned the hard way from experience with these types of issues. I hope this overview helps clarify things for you. Let me know if there are any other aspects you'd like to discuss.
