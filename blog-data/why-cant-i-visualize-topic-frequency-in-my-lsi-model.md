, let’s tackle this. It’s not uncommon to hit roadblocks visualizing topic frequencies, especially when working with Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) models. I recall a project several years ago where we were attempting to classify a massive corpus of customer support tickets, and I ran into precisely this issue. We had LSI humming along, reducing the dimensionality beautifully, but visualizing *how* frequently each topic appeared across the documents proved surprisingly challenging. The core problem, as I experienced it then and often see now, stems from the fundamental nature of LSI and its output.

LSI, at its heart, isn’t directly about 'topics' in the way one might intuitively understand them, like a bag-of-words model where each topic has associated words. Instead, it's about capturing the underlying semantic structure of a corpus by reducing it to a lower-dimensional space of latent concepts. These concepts, which we loosely call topics, aren't necessarily tied to human-understandable themes or explicit frequencies in a direct manner. The model's output gives us document-term matrices transformed into a document-concept matrix, and the concept-term matrix. The 'strength' of a concept in a document is represented by a value; however, this value doesn’t directly tell us the overall *frequency* of that concept across all documents in a way that you’d readily plot in a bar graph, for instance. This is crucial: the numerical values are not topic *counts*; rather, they are the *contribution* of each concept to that document's representation in the transformed vector space.

The key difference lies in how LSI and other topic modeling techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach topic interpretation. LDA, unlike LSI, directly models topic distributions and word probabilities explicitly, making topic frequency far easier to compute and visualize directly across the corpus. With LDA, you have explicit distributions for topic-word associations and document-topic associations. This makes the sum of topic occurrences across the document collection readily available.

In LSI, the "topic strength" isn't a simple count; it's a projection onto the latent semantic space. To visualize this, let’s get into practical approaches.

The first, and most straightforward method, involves looking at the *singular values* produced by the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step within LSI. The singular values give you an idea of the importance or variance captured by each latent concept or 'topic'. Higher singular values signify more important concepts, contributing more significantly to the overall data structure. They're a start but aren't direct frequencies.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example text data
documents = [
    "This is a document about cats.",
    "Another document about dogs and cats.",
    "I like dogs very much.",
    "The cat is sleeping.",
    "This dog is barking loudly.",
]

# Vectorize using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

# Apply TruncatedSVD (LSI)
n_components = 3
svd = TruncatedSVD(n_components=n_components, random_state=42)
svd.fit(tfidf_matrix)

# Visualize Singular Values
singular_values = svd.singular_values_
plt.bar(range(len(singular_values)), singular_values)
plt.xlabel("Latent Concept")
plt.ylabel("Singular Value")
plt.title("Singular Values of Latent Concepts")
plt.show()
```

This snippet shows how you can obtain the singular values after doing an LSI reduction, and then plot them, allowing you to visualize the relative importance of each concept. It is not showing a topic frequency per se, but gives context to each concepts importance.

The second approach builds on this. It involves using the SVD components themselves to analyze how strong each ‘topic’ is per document, and from that, derive an approximate frequency across the corpus. It’s crucial to remember we are still not dealing with true topic counts, but rather aggregated strength based on contribution.

```python
#Continuing from previous snippet...

# Transform documents into latent space
document_representation = svd.transform(tfidf_matrix)

# Calculate the sum of each concept's importance across all documents
concept_strength_sum = np.sum(np.abs(document_representation), axis=0)

# Plot the summed strength of the concepts
plt.bar(range(len(concept_strength_sum)), concept_strength_sum)
plt.xlabel("Latent Concept")
plt.ylabel("Summed Concept Strength")
plt.title("Summed Concept Strength Across Documents")
plt.show()
```

Here, we are calculating the absolute value of the projection of documents into the latent space and summing those values. This gives an *indication* of how much each concept contributes across the documents. Notice we use `abs` which deals with negative values which may stem from latent dimension calculations. Remember, these aren't frequencies; they are aggregates of contributions to document representation.

Finally, for a deeper understanding, you can examine the *concept-term* matrix (or `svd.components_`) more closely. This matrix tells you how much each term contributes to each concept, so you can start to infer the words most characteristic of that concept. Although this doesn’t visualize topic frequency, seeing the main terms help to understand what the ‘topic’ is.

```python
#Continuing from previous snippet...

# Get the term-concept matrix
concept_term_matrix = svd.components_
feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

#Function to display top terms per concept
def display_top_terms(concept_term_matrix, feature_names, n_terms=5):
    for i, concept in enumerate(concept_term_matrix):
        top_terms_indices = np.argsort(np.abs(concept))[-n_terms:]
        top_terms = [feature_names[index] for index in top_terms_indices]
        print(f"Concept {i}: {', '.join(top_terms)}")


# Display top terms for each concept
display_top_terms(concept_term_matrix, feature_names)
```

This third snippet helps you examine what the topics mean by displaying the highest contributing terms. It doesn’t visualize frequency, but provides invaluable context when trying to interpret your models outputs.

These three approaches, while not providing a direct "topic frequency" in the same way as LDA, give several useful views of your LSI model results.

For a more profound grasp, I’d highly recommend exploring these resources:

*   **"Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing" by Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Schütze**: This is the standard text in the field, giving a very thorough explanation of LSI and related topic modelling techniques. The math is explained very well and it provides the needed information to better understand the theory underpinning LSI.

*   **"Information Retrieval: Implementing and Evaluating Search Engines" by Stefan Büttcher, Charles L. A. Clarke, and Gordon V. Cormack**: This book provides a practical guide to implementing and evaluating different information retrieval techniques, including LSI. It’s very good at linking the theory to its practical uses, which is key to a deep understanding.

*   **"Latent Semantic Analysis" by Thomas K. Landauer, Peter W. Foltz, and Darrell Laham**: While a research paper, this is the foundational paper on LSI, giving a detailed introduction to the mathematics behind it and their initial findings and experimental results.

In short, LSI's latent space is not about direct, countable topics in the same way as a topic model like LDA. So what may initially seem like an error or visualization failure, is actually an inherent characteristic of the way this model derives its concepts. We need to adjust how we approach the visualization and interpretation of results and understand, as I found in my past project, that the insights you can gain, although different than initially imagined, can still be very powerful. The techniques above are a good starting point for understanding.
