Okay, let’s dive into this. Instead of beginning with a definition, perhaps it’s best to start by contextualizing why you might be encountering this specific challenge. I've been there—a project involving a custom graphical user interface with interactive elements, which is where the desire to intertwine `paintEvent` and `mousePressEvent` logic can become surprisingly appealing. It sounds straightforward, but directly invoking `mousePressEvent` within `paintEvent` is a path fraught with potential issues, mainly because it’s a fundamental misuse of the event handling system in PyQt.

The core principle to grasp here is that `paintEvent` is for… well, painting. It's triggered by the operating system whenever a widget needs to be redrawn—either when it’s initially displayed, when it's resized, or when it's covered by another window and revealed again. Crucially, `paintEvent` should *not* contain logic that mutates the state of your application or responds directly to user input; it should purely reflect the state of the application at that given point in time. Conversely, `mousePressEvent` is an event handler designed specifically to deal with mouse clicks. It allows you to perform actions based on a click event, including updating application state.

Trying to call `mousePressEvent` inside `paintEvent` introduces an unhealthy coupling between painting and input handling. It’s akin to trying to control a car’s steering by adjusting its paint job—it simply doesn't work that way, and it's going to create more problems than it solves. The system is based on a distinct separation of concerns: painting is a read-only operation dependent on the current state, and mouse input updates that state. If you were to actually attempt calling `mousePressEvent` directly within `paintEvent`, you'd likely encounter logical loops, unexpected behavior, or outright crashes, primarily because you are likely attempting to re-trigger events that are currently in the process of being handled.

Instead of circumventing the event loop, what you should aim to achieve is a clear separation of logic. The way to handle this correctly is to allow `mousePressEvent` to modify your application’s *state*, and then, upon receiving that event, trigger a repaint via `widget.update()` or `widget.repaint()`. This ensures your `paintEvent` will redraw the widget using the *new* state.

Let me illustrate with some examples. Let's say you have a situation where clicking on a drawn rectangle should change its color. The incorrect approach might involve trying to check for the click location within `paintEvent`, which is what you are hinting at with using an if/else block, which will not work:

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget, QApplication
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPainter, QColor
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt, QRect

class IncorrectWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.rect_color = QColor(Qt.red)
        self.rect = QRect(50, 50, 100, 100)

    def paintEvent(self, event):
        painter = QPainter(self)
        painter.fillRect(self.rect, self.rect_color)
        # Incorrect: Trying to handle the click inside paintEvent!
        # if self.rect.contains(event.x(), event.y()): # event is NOT valid
        #    self.rect_color = QColor(Qt.blue)
        #    self.update()


    def mousePressEvent(self, event): # This is the proper place to handle this type of functionality
        if self.rect.contains(event.pos()):
            self.rect_color = QColor(Qt.blue)
            self.update()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication([])
    window = IncorrectWidget()
    window.show()
    app.exec_()
```
In the code above, you will observe that the `mousePressEvent` handles the update of `rect_color` based on if a click was located within the boundaries of the defined `rect`. Then, that is followed by a call to `self.update()`, which will trigger a repaint, which will in turn then be rendered according to the updated properties within `paintEvent`. The commented section shows a naive (and incorrect) attempt to call mousePressEvent logic inside paintEvent. This is why `mousePressEvent` does not get triggered. Also, the 'event' argument inside `paintEvent` does *not* have the relevant x and y mouse coordinates.

Here's how to properly decouple the state modification and painting steps. The logic for handling the mouse click to change the rectangle's color, along with calling `self.update()`, is handled within `mousePressEvent`. Then the painting will occur during the next `paintEvent`:

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget, QApplication
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPainter, QColor
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt, QRect

class CorrectWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.rect_color = QColor(Qt.red)
        self.rect = QRect(50, 50, 100, 100)

    def paintEvent(self, event):
        painter = QPainter(self)
        painter.fillRect(self.rect, self.rect_color)

    def mousePressEvent(self, event):
        if self.rect.contains(event.pos()):
            self.rect_color = QColor(Qt.blue)
            self.update()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication([])
    window = CorrectWidget()
    window.show()
    app.exec_()
```

This example correctly uses the proper methods and shows the correct approach. First the application's *state* is updated within the mouse press event handler, and then the widget is told to repaint to reflect the new state.

Here’s a more intricate example involving multiple rectangles that each toggle between colors on a click, demonstrating the core concept of state management.

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget, QApplication
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPainter, QColor
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt, QRect

class MultiRectWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.rects = [
            {'rect': QRect(50, 50, 80, 80), 'color': QColor(Qt.red)},
            {'rect': QRect(150, 50, 80, 80), 'color': QColor(Qt.green)},
            {'rect': QRect(250, 50, 80, 80), 'color': QColor(Qt.blue)}
            ]

    def paintEvent(self, event):
        painter = QPainter(self)
        for rect_data in self.rects:
            painter.fillRect(rect_data['rect'], rect_data['color'])

    def mousePressEvent(self, event):
         for rect_data in self.rects:
            if rect_data['rect'].contains(event.pos()):
                if rect_data['color'] == QColor(Qt.red):
                     rect_data['color'] = QColor(Qt.yellow)
                elif rect_data['color'] == QColor(Qt.yellow):
                     rect_data['color'] = QColor(Qt.blue)
                else:
                     rect_data['color'] = QColor(Qt.red)
                self.update()
                break # Exit the loop after finding a hit

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication([])
    window = MultiRectWidget()
    window.show()
    app.exec_()
```

In this third example, we have multiple rectangles being rendered in `paintEvent`. The `mousePressEvent` iterates through each rectangle to determine if the click occurred within its bounds. This allows for independent state changes of each rectangle based on the mouse click.

For further reading, I strongly suggest consulting the Qt documentation—specifically, the sections on the event loop, paint events, and mouse events. “C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4” by Jasmin Blanchette and Mark Summerfield, while covering Qt4, remains an excellent resource for understanding core Qt concepts applicable to PyQt. Another great resource would be “Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt: The Definitive Guide to PyQt Programming” by Mark Summerfield. Additionally, I would recommend checking out the source code for the PyQt examples, which are usually located in your PyQt installation's examples folder, for more elaborate use cases.

In summary, calling `mousePressEvent` within `paintEvent` is not the proper way to handle user interaction in PyQt. The correct approach is to keep `paintEvent` as a rendering method that reacts to changes in your widget’s state. User interactions, such as a `mousePressEvent`, modify this state and then, via `update()` or `repaint()`, initiate a re-rendering of the GUI. This approach ensures your PyQt application operates reliably and predictably.
