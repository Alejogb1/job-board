Okay, let's talk about non-reproducible Optuna searches. I've seen this particular problem crop up more times than I care to count, often causing significant headaches and wasted computation time, especially in larger-scale model development. It’s frustrating, I get it. The expectation is that if you set up the same experiment twice with the same parameters, you should get identical results. With Optuna, this isn't always the case out of the box. There are several key reasons why this can happen, and it’s usually a combination of factors rather than one single culprit. Let’s break it down.

Firstly, and probably the most common source of variability, is the use of random sampling within the objective function and during the search process itself. Optuna, by default, relies on pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), which are deterministic for a given seed. However, if you're using external libraries that also use randomness (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn) *and you haven’t explicitly set their seeds*, you're introducing uncontrolled stochasticity into the evaluation of your objective function. This means that even if Optuna is behaving deterministically, your model's performance evaluation will vary across runs, directly affecting the search path it takes, leading to different "optimal" hyperparameters.

Another less frequently considered aspect is the order of trials, particularly if you're using an asynchronous parallel search strategy. If you're using different execution environments or distributing your workload, slight variations in the scheduling or completion times of trials can impact the intermediate results and the path taken by the search algorithms. Optuna itself doesn’t guarantee identical trial execution orders in such scenarios, meaning the internal state might differ slightly between runs, and this can compound to generate variations in the final best parameters. It is important to remember that while these variations might be minor, they can introduce different 'best' options at each step of the search, creating a different final choice.

Furthermore, remember that how Optuna stores the trial results can sometimes influence reproducibility. For example, if you rely on in-memory storage and your script ends unexpectedly, data from that trial may not be correctly saved and recovered. When restarting a trial or retrieving results, these inconsistencies can affect the search’s continuity. Using file-based storage for a production setting is always recommended, although that does not directly affect reproducibility if set up correctly, it can indirectly affect it if an implementation relies on in-memory.

Let’s illustrate this with some code examples. The first, and the one which trips many people up, is neglecting seeding in all our tools. Consider a simple training loop that uses scikit-learn alongside optuna:

```python
import optuna
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

def objective(trial):
    n_estimators = trial.suggest_int('n_estimators', 10, 100)
    max_depth = trial.suggest_int('max_depth', 2, 10)
    min_samples_split = trial.suggest_int('min_samples_split', 2, 10)
    min_samples_leaf = trial.suggest_int('min_samples_leaf', 1, 5)

    # Example data - replace with your real dataset
    X = np.random.rand(1000, 20)
    y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    model = RandomForestClassifier(
        n_estimators=n_estimators,
        max_depth=max_depth,
        min_samples_split=min_samples_split,
        min_samples_leaf=min_samples_leaf
    )
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    return accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)


def run_study(seed):
    study = optuna.create_study(direction='maximize')
    study.optimize(objective, n_trials=10)
    return study.best_params

if __name__ == "__main__":
    best_params_1 = run_study(42)
    best_params_2 = run_study(42)

    print(f"First run: {best_params_1}")
    print(f"Second run: {best_params_2}")
```

Run this several times, you will often see different results between 'best\_params\_1' and 'best\_params\_2'. This is because while Optuna has a PRNG, `scikit-learn` does as well, and we are not setting that one. The fix is to provide a seed to both `numpy` *and* the `RandomForestClassifier` as shown below:

```python
import optuna
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np
import random

def objective(trial):
    n_estimators = trial.suggest_int('n_estimators', 10, 100)
    max_depth = trial.suggest_int('max_depth', 2, 10)
    min_samples_split = trial.suggest_int('min_samples_split', 2, 10)
    min_samples_leaf = trial.suggest_int('min_samples_leaf', 1, 5)
    seed = 42 # same seed in every invocation

    # Example data - replace with your real dataset
    np.random.seed(seed)
    X = np.random.rand(1000, 20)
    y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=seed) # scikit learn needs a seed

    model = RandomForestClassifier(
        n_estimators=n_estimators,
        max_depth=max_depth,
        min_samples_split=min_samples_split,
        min_samples_leaf=min_samples_leaf,
        random_state=seed # seed to scikit learn
    )
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    return accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)


def run_study(seed):
    study = optuna.create_study(direction='maximize', seed=seed) # and optuna
    study.optimize(objective, n_trials=10)
    return study.best_params

if __name__ == "__main__":
    best_params_1 = run_study(42)
    best_params_2 = run_study(42)

    print(f"First run: {best_params_1}")
    print(f"Second run: {best_params_2}")
```

Now, `best_params_1` and `best_params_2` will be identical, even if you run it multiple times. The key change was incorporating seeds into the random elements of the evaluation function. Always make sure that all components that are using randomness are seeded, including, but not limited to, libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which would require you to also set the seed there, and also to the `random` standard python library too, if using that.

Finally, here is an example of a file-based storage solution that can provide extra security if you are having issues with in-memory:

```python
import optuna
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import random
import os

def objective(trial):
    c = trial.suggest_float('c', 0.001, 1.0)
    seed = 42
    np.random.seed(seed)

    X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
    y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=seed)

    model = LogisticRegression(C=c, random_state=seed, solver='liblinear')
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    return accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)


def run_study(storage_file, seed):
    storage_url = f"sqlite:///{storage_file}"
    study = optuna.create_study(direction="maximize", study_name="lr_study", storage=storage_url, load_if_exists=True, seed=seed)
    study.optimize(objective, n_trials=20)
    return study.best_params


if __name__ == '__main__':
    storage_file = "study.db"
    best_params_1 = run_study(storage_file, 42)
    best_params_2 = run_study(storage_file, 42)

    print(f"First run: {best_params_1}")
    print(f"Second run: {best_params_2}")

    os.remove(storage_file) # clean up afterwards
```

Here, we use an SQLite file database. You can also use other backends like Postgres, MySQL, etc., depending on your needs. This approach guarantees that if the training is interrupted, upon restarting, the previous trials will be retrieved and continue the optimization from where it left off. Note that *all parameters must be the same between executions* for this to behave as expected. This is a robust strategy to maintain reproducibility and also to save computation time if for instance a single run is interrupted midway.

For deeper understanding, I'd recommend delving into the 'Randomized algorithms' chapter of *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen et al. It gives a strong foundation on the topic of pseudo-random number generation and how randomness impacts algorithms. For a more practical approach to hyperparameter tuning, I suggest *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by Géron, specifically the section on hyperparameter tuning, which provides excellent real-world guidance on how to do this effectively and reproducibly. Finally, the Optuna documentation itself has a section on reproducibility, which is the most specific guide.

In summary, non-reproducible hyperparameter searches with Optuna are usually due to a failure to control all sources of randomness or unexpected trial execution differences. By consistently seeding the underlying libraries that use randomness, and by ensuring your infrastructure and storage are robust, you can achieve consistent, repeatable results, which is absolutely crucial for reproducible machine learning.
