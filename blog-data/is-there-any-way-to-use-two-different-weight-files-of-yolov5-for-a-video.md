Okay, let's talk about using two different yolov5 weight files for a video. It's not a straightforward "plug-and-play" situation, but it’s definitely achievable with a bit of considered coding. I remember facing a similar challenge a few years back during a project involving multi-stage object detection for a robotics application. We needed to first broadly identify areas of interest and then refine the detection within those areas using a model with a different specialization. It wasn't precisely two *different* yolo models, but the principle of switching models mid-stream is highly applicable.

Essentially, yolov5 doesn't intrinsically support swapping weight files *mid-inference* on a frame-by-frame basis. The inference process assumes a single loaded model and its associated weights. What you need to do is design a workflow that allows you to load different models at the correct times, processing the video sequentially by frames or batches. This means controlling which model is active for each specific part of the video.

The core issue revolves around how the inference pipeline handles loaded weights. Typically, you load the model with weights at the start of the script. To use multiple sets of weights, you’d need to manage their loading and swapping programmatically. You’re not trying to use two models *simultaneously* on the same frame, but rather *sequentially*, one after another, or perhaps conditionally based on some detection criteria.

Let’s break down the conceptual process and then get into some code examples. You would:

1.  **Load both models:** Initially, load each yolov5 model with its specific weight file into memory. This typically involves using the yolov5 library, creating `torch` model objects, and loading corresponding pre-trained weights.

2.  **Frame-by-Frame Processing:** Read each frame of your input video.

3.  **Model Selection Logic:** Implement the logic to determine which model to use for the current frame. This could be based on a simple time-based switch, a trigger from the first model’s output (e.g., “If the first model detects a ‘car’, use the second model specializing in ‘car parts’"), or any custom criteria.

4.  **Inference:** Perform inference using the *selected* model on the current frame.

5.  **Output Management:** Store and process the results, appropriately labeling which detections come from which model.

6. **Loop and Save:** Continue the process with next frames until the whole video is processed. Save the video with the processed frames.

Here’s a basic example that implements a time-based switch between models, focusing on the core concept rather than full video handling. Assume `model_a` and `model_b` represent your two yolov5 models and that they are pre-loaded outside this snippet:

```python
import torch
import cv2
import time
# Assuming 'model_a' and 'model_b' are already loaded models as in the yolov5 notebook

def process_frame_time_based(frame, model_a, model_b, time_switch):
    current_time = time.time()
    if current_time % (time_switch * 2) < time_switch:
        results = model_a(frame)
        model_name = "model_a"
    else:
        results = model_b(frame)
        model_name = "model_b"

    return results, model_name

if __name__ == '__main__':

    #load two sample models

    #model_a =  torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s', pretrained=True) # Load model A
    #model_b = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s', pretrained=True) # load model B
    # these will be the same model, in a real scenario they will be different

    #open video
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture("video.mp4") #replace with your video
    if not cap.isOpened():
      print ("Cannot open the video")
      exit()
    width = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
    height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
    fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
    fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
    out = cv2.VideoWriter('processed_video.mp4',fourcc, fps, (width,height))

    time_switch_interval = 5 #seconds
    while(True):
      ret, frame = cap.read()

      if not ret:
        break
      results, model_name = process_frame_time_based(frame, model_a, model_b, time_switch_interval)
      # Results are processed as in the basic yolov5 implementation, i.e, for example:
      #results.xyxy[0] contain the bounding boxes, you can draw those boxes in frame, with a label of the name of the model
      #frame =  plot_bboxes(results, frame, model_name) # assuming a plot function exists
      #then append the processed frame to the output video
      out.write(frame)

    # release everything when job is finished
    cap.release()
    out.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

The `process_frame_time_based` function shows how to swap models based on a simple timer, with the `time_switch` variable determining how frequently the model changes. The main loop reads the video frames, processes them with the appropriate model and saves the frames to the output video. You can expand on this basic example and implement more complex selection criteria. Note that some operations are commented out as they would imply a broader implementation of the `yolov5` library. This example focuses on model loading and swapping within the context of a video processing loop.

Here's another more involved example, using detection results from the first model to inform which model to use next. We'll assume that `model_a` is a general object detector and `model_b` is a specialized detector that will only be used if `model_a` detects a specific class (let's say class 0, or a person):

```python
import torch
import cv2

def process_frame_conditional(frame, model_a, model_b, target_class):
    results_a = model_a(frame)
    detections_a = results_a.xyxy[0]

    if len(detections_a) > 0:
        for det in detections_a:
           if int(det[5]) == target_class: #if a person was detected
                results = model_b(frame)
                return results, "model_b"
    #if no person detected or not other condition reached
    results = results_a
    return results, "model_a"

if __name__ == '__main__':

    #load two sample models
    #model_a =  torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s', pretrained=True) # Load model A
    #model_b = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s', pretrained=True) # load model B
    # these will be the same model, in a real scenario they will be different

    #open video
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture("video.mp4") #replace with your video
    if not cap.isOpened():
      print ("Cannot open the video")
      exit()
    width = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
    height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
    fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
    fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
    out = cv2.VideoWriter('processed_video.mp4',fourcc, fps, (width,height))

    target_class = 0  #class corresponding to person
    while(True):
      ret, frame = cap.read()

      if not ret:
        break
      results, model_name = process_frame_conditional(frame, model_a, model_b, target_class)
      # Results are processed as in the basic yolov5 implementation, i.e, for example:
      #results.xyxy[0] contain the bounding boxes, you can draw those boxes in frame, with a label of the name of the model
      #frame =  plot_bboxes(results, frame, model_name) # assuming a plot function exists
      #then append the processed frame to the output video
      out.write(frame)

    # release everything when job is finished
    cap.release()
    out.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

In this revised approach, `process_frame_conditional` first uses `model_a` to perform a primary detection and then examines the results. If it detects a "person" (class 0), it runs the same frame against `model_b`. Otherwise, it returns the results from `model_a`, and the loop behaves as before with the `out.write(frame)` function. You could tailor this logic based on the application.

For a more advanced example consider this example, using `torch.no_grad()`. It's important to manage how tensors are processed during inference, preventing any gradients to accumulate, which is not necessary in inference. This code illustrates the explicit `with torch.no_grad():` block to prevent this and how to manually swap models:

```python
import torch
import cv2
import time

def process_frame_manual_switch(frame, model_a, model_b, switch_point):

  if time.time() < switch_point:
      with torch.no_grad():
          results = model_a(frame)
          model_name = "model_a"
  else:
      with torch.no_grad():
          results = model_b(frame)
          model_name = "model_b"

  return results, model_name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    #load two sample models
    #model_a =  torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s', pretrained=True) # Load model A
    #model_b = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s', pretrained=True) # load model B
    # these will be the same model, in a real scenario they will be different
    #open video
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture("video.mp4") #replace with your video
    if not cap.isOpened():
      print ("Cannot open the video")
      exit()
    width = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
    height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
    fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
    fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
    out = cv2.VideoWriter('processed_video.mp4',fourcc, fps, (width,height))

    switch_time = time.time() + 10 #switch after 10 seconds
    while(True):
      ret, frame = cap.read()

      if not ret:
        break
      results, model_name = process_frame_manual_switch(frame, model_a, model_b, switch_time)
      # Results are processed as in the basic yolov5 implementation, i.e, for example:
      #results.xyxy[0] contain the bounding boxes, you can draw those boxes in frame, with a label of the name of the model
      #frame =  plot_bboxes(results, frame, model_name) # assuming a plot function exists
      #then append the processed frame to the output video
      out.write(frame)

    # release everything when job is finished
    cap.release()
    out.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
In this instance, the code ensures that no gradients are accumulated by utilizing the `torch.no_grad()` context manager within the `process_frame_manual_switch` function. The models are swapped after 10 seconds of video processing. This is a good practice to explicitly control tensor processing during the inference stage.

For further study, I'd recommend delving into the official PyTorch documentation, particularly around model loading and inference. The original yolov5 repository on GitHub provides excellent examples and a solid understanding of how the inference loop works. A great text to dive deeper into this is "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann which covers many aspects of practical deep learning. This approach allows for a robust management of different models within a video processing pipeline.
