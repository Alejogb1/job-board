, let’s tackle this. I’ve seen this particular issue crop up more often than one might expect, and usually, it's not just one thing but a constellation of potential culprits preventing you from viewing those crucial Airflow task instance details. Trust me, tracking down why you can't see those logs or details has been a recurring theme in my past projects, and each time it's a bit of a puzzle to solve.

The core problem lies in the fact that Airflow, while powerful, relies on several interconnected components working harmoniously. When one of these falters, access to task instance information, which is essentially the record of your DAG's execution, can be compromised. Let's break down some of the common reasons, based on my experience.

First, and perhaps most frequently, it's the scheduler's interaction (or lack thereof) with the database. Airflow heavily relies on its metadata database—be it PostgreSQL, MySQL, or another supported system—to store all information about DAGs, task instances, and their execution status. If the scheduler cannot communicate properly with this database, it won't be able to update the task instance states or record the logs. This can stem from a variety of issues, such as incorrect database connection strings in your `airflow.cfg` file, insufficient database permissions for the Airflow user, or even network connectivity problems between the scheduler and the database server. I recall one instance where a simple password change on the database side, not reflected in the `airflow.cfg`, caused a cascade of issues, including inaccessible task instance logs.

Another critical area is the web server's ability to retrieve and display data. If the webserver isn’t functioning correctly, or if it cannot connect to the metadata database itself, then the information won’t display in the UI, regardless of whether the scheduler is happily executing tasks. The webserver configuration, specifically the connection to the metadata database in `webserver_config.py`, is something I’ve had to double-check countless times. It's surprising how often a simple typo there can derail the whole UI experience.

Beyond these fundamental components, let's consider the executor. Airflow’s executor is the component that runs the tasks. If your executor is having problems, such as a lack of resources in the case of a KubernetesExecutor, or a stalled or disconnected Celery worker, the task instances might execute, but without properly updating the database. I've encountered scenarios using Celery where the worker processes had crashed without reporting the failure correctly and this left tasks in a limbo state, where they seemed to run but not complete, consequently, the logs were absent or incomplete, because the worker could not push them correctly.

Now, let's move into some more concrete areas. Here are some example snippets that illustrate potential issues and how they can affect viewing task instance details, along with how to troubleshoot:

**Snippet 1: Database Connection Issues**

```python
# Example airflow.cfg (Relevant portion)
[core]
sql_alchemy_conn = postgresql+psycopg2://airflow_user:incorrect_password@localhost/airflow_db

# In a real scenario, ensure the password and other details are correct
```

In this scenario, the incorrect password will cause the scheduler (and webserver) to be unable to connect to the database. This leads to a lack of recorded task details, as it's impossible to update the task state. To debug this, ensure your database configurations are correct, including the username, password, hostname, port, and database name. The `sql_alchemy_conn` string must match the database configuration. I would also suggest verifying the database user has the necessary permissions. Also it's worth checking the logs on the scheduler to see if any errors are reported, for example, connection refused errors or user authentication issues.

**Snippet 2: Webserver Configuration Error**

```python
# Example webserver_config.py (Relevant portion)

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql+psycopg2://airflow_user:correct_password@localhost/airflow_db'
# Note, this can be different than the sql_alchemy_conn in airflow.cfg
# if you choose to do so, but both must be correct for webserver to function properly
```

Here, the webserver configuration may have a different connection string than the one in `airflow.cfg`, which can lead to situations where the scheduler works fine (as far as it can) but the webserver cannot load the data. In my experience, it's always best practice to check both files to make sure they're correct and aligned (or have correctly configured differences). This can often be easily overlooked if you update one file and not the other. Check your webserver logs for connection errors, they will usually pinpoint the issue in this case.

**Snippet 3: Executor Issues (Celery Example)**

```python
#Example Task definition in a DAG
def my_task():
    print("Starting Task")
    time.sleep(10)
    # Intentionally causing an exception
    raise ValueError("This is an intentional error to demonstrate an issue")
    print("Ending Task")
    
# Example usage in a dag
with DAG(
        dag_id="example_task_error",
        schedule=None,
        start_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 1),
        catchup=False,
) as dag:
    task = PythonOperator(task_id="my_task_instance", python_callable=my_task)
```

When an error happens within a task, especially in more complicated environments using a Celery executor, the task might fail but not update the status correctly if, for instance, the Celery worker crashes while executing the function or cannot push logs back, leading to empty log pages or uninformative error reports. Look into the Celery worker logs for any traces or failures around the time of the task run. Specifically check for errors related to pushing logs or sending status updates to the Airflow scheduler. It is also useful to monitor the Celery queues to ensure messages are being processed in a timely manner and that the queues are not backlogged.

Beyond these, there are other less frequent factors. For example, if you're using a remote logging setup, make sure the logging configurations in your `airflow.cfg` and relevant plugins are correct. Incorrect permissions on log directories can also be a silent killer, preventing the webserver from accessing the files. Also note, in some cases, browsers cache old versions of the UI page, this may give the impression there are no task details while in fact they are present, in this case, try clearing the browser cache.

To really deepen your understanding here, I would highly recommend a few resources. For a solid grasp of database interactions within Airflow, I would suggest you read the official Airflow documentation extensively, specifically the sections concerning database configuration and the use of SQLAlchemy. Also, the book 'Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow' by Bas P. van den Berg offers a lot of insights into the inner workings of Airflow and its many components. For more in-depth insights into managing airflow on kubernetes, check the book "Kubernetes Patterns: Reusable Elements for Building Cloud-Native Applications," by Bilgin Ibryam and Roland Huß. For Celery specifically, the official Celery documentation is the most authoritative resource for understanding worker behavior and configuration.

In summary, the inability to view Airflow task instance details is rarely a single point of failure. It's usually a confluence of issues related to database connectivity, webserver configurations, executor problems, or logging configurations. Careful review of logs, configuration files, and understanding of the individual Airflow component's interactions is the key to effective troubleshooting. Over the years, I've learned that methodical, step-by-step debugging, along with consistent attention to detail, is the only way to keep a robust Airflow environment operational and debug these sorts of issues effectively.
