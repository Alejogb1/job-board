it looks like you're running into a pretty common pitfall when working with tensorflow, especially when you're dealing with graph structures, and you're getting that `valueerror: tensor tensor("input_ids:0", shape=(?, 60), dtype=int32) is not an element of this graph`. let's break down what's likely happening and how to fix it, based on what i’ve experienced.

the core issue is that tensorflow operates using computational graphs. think of them like blueprints for your calculations. you define the operations, and tensorflow then executes them. this error arises when a tensor, which is essentially a multi-dimensional array that tensorflow uses for its calculations, is trying to be used within a graph it doesn't belong to.

i remember once, i was building a complex nlp model, and i kept hitting this error. i was pulling my hair out because i had a model that seemed to work perfectly, but i was getting this exact same error when trying to use it in a different part of my code. what i eventually figured out, after way too much time, was that i was unintentionally creating multiple tensorflow graphs. it's easy to do if you're not being careful, especially in jupyter notebooks or similar environments.

here's the deal: tensorflow's default behavior is to use a default graph if you don't explicitly specify one. but if you're defining models or tensors in different functions or separate scripts, it's possible they are inadvertently being placed into different graph instances.  if you then try to use a tensor created in one graph inside a different graph, tensorflow throws that valueerror you're seeing.

to be very specific to your problem, your error message states that the tensor named `input_ids:0` with a shape `(?, 60)` and `dtype=int32` isn't part of the graph in which you are trying to use it. this tensor likely came from another graph than the one you are currently working on, or it’s not connected to the graph which you intend to use it with.

the `input_ids` makes me think that you are using some type of nlp model, which makes it more likely you are inadvertently using separate sessions of computation. it's a common issue when you’re using pre-trained models or when working with complex data pipelines.

let me give you the most common solutions from what i remember from banging my head against the wall.

**solution 1: using explicit graph contexts**

the most reliable approach to avoid this is to explicitly specify which graph you're working with, especially when loading models, creating tensors or using different sections of your code that should be part of the same graph. you do this using the `with` statement and `tf.graph`. it looks like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# assume you have a model defined elsewhere
# and it expects an input named 'input_ids'

def build_model(graph):
    with graph.as_default():
        input_ids = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=(None, 60), name="input_ids")
        # example of building a simple model
        embedding_matrix = tf.get_variable("embedding_matrix", shape=[100,10])
        embeddings = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embedding_matrix,input_ids)
        # ... the rest of your model here.
        # placeholder for prediction result or similar
        output = tf.layers.dense(inputs=embeddings,units=10)
        predictions = tf.argmax(output,axis=1)
        return input_ids, predictions

def run_model(input_data,graph,input_ids,predictions):
    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
        # feed the input data here
        feed_dict = {input_ids: input_data}
        prediction_values = sess.run(predictions, feed_dict=feed_dict)
        return prediction_values


# create a new graph
my_graph = tf.Graph()

# build model using the graph
input_tensor, prediction_tensor = build_model(my_graph)
# example input data to use for prediction
example_input_data = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]]

# run the model
predictions = run_model(example_input_data,my_graph,input_tensor,prediction_tensor)

# use your predictions
print (predictions)
```

in this first example, every single tensorflow operation is created inside the context of our `my_graph`. this includes the `placeholder` for the input, and the rest of the model itself. we also explicitly specify the graph when we run the session using `tf.compat.v1.session(graph=my_graph)`. this makes sure all the operations and tensors are tied to the same graph which prevents the error.

**solution 2: avoiding multiple sessions or graphs in notebooks**

if you are in jupyter or colab, be very careful with running cells out of order and reusing tensorflow variables. the way cells work in jupyter might lead to creating multiple default graphs without you knowing it.

make sure you run cells from top to bottom always and try to load your entire model inside the same cell or if that is not possible make sure that each cell that uses the model or graphs refers to the graph explicitly with the `with graph.as_default()` in solution 1.

as a second example of this scenario, lets assume that you want to load a model from checkpoint and the loading functions are in a separate cell.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# assume you have a model defined elsewhere and saved to a checkpoint

def load_model_from_checkpoint(graph,checkpoint_path):
    with graph.as_default():
        # some function that loads the model
        # here we emulate a load with some placeholder tensors
        input_ids = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=(None, 60), name="input_ids")
        embedding_matrix = tf.get_variable("embedding_matrix", shape=[100,10])
        embeddings = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embedding_matrix,input_ids)
        output = tf.layers.dense(inputs=embeddings,units=10)
        predictions = tf.argmax(output,axis=1)
        saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver()
        with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
          saver.restore(sess, checkpoint_path)
          return input_ids, predictions

# create a new graph
my_graph = tf.Graph()

# this checkpoint was created somewhere else and it has the model weights
checkpoint_path = "./my_checkpoint"

# load the model into the new graph
input_tensor, prediction_tensor = load_model_from_checkpoint(my_graph,checkpoint_path)

```

and another cell to execute the prediction:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# we need my_graph, input_tensor, prediction_tensor from the previous cell

def run_model(input_data,graph,input_ids,predictions):
    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
        # feed the input data here
        feed_dict = {input_ids: input_data}
        prediction_values = sess.run(predictions, feed_dict=feed_dict)
        return prediction_values

# example input data to use for prediction
example_input_data = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]]

# run the model
predictions = run_model(example_input_data,my_graph,input_tensor,prediction_tensor)

# use your predictions
print(predictions)
```

this solution will make sure that the graph that we are loading the model from is the same graph we are using for prediction. because all the operations and tensors are inside the same `my_graph`.

**solution 3: creating the graph, session and tensors in the same scope.**

sometimes the above solutions are not enough and you still can end up with this kind of errors. make sure that all tensorflow operations and session are created in the same scope. sometimes creating the session inside a function might cause issues if the tensors are not part of the graph defined or loaded in the function.

for example, lets say we are creating a simple classifier function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_model():
    graph = tf.Graph()
    with graph.as_default():
        input_ids = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=(None, 60), name="input_ids")
        embedding_matrix = tf.get_variable("embedding_matrix", shape=[100,10])
        embeddings = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embedding_matrix,input_ids)
        output = tf.layers.dense(inputs=embeddings,units=10)
        predictions = tf.argmax(output,axis=1)
        session = tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph)
        session.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
        return session, input_ids, predictions,graph

def classify(session, input_ids, predictions, input_data):
   feed_dict = {input_ids: input_data}
   prediction_values = session.run(predictions, feed_dict=feed_dict)
   return prediction_values

# example input data to use for prediction
example_input_data = np.random.randint(0, 100, size=(1, 60))

session,input_tensor,prediction_tensor,graph = create_model()

predictions = classify(session, input_tensor, prediction_tensor, example_input_data)

print(predictions)
```

here we define everything (graph,session,tensors) in the same scope of our function `create_model` and pass everything around including session to our function `classify` that performs the prediction. the function `create_model` returns session and the tensors so we can use them later in another place of our code. make sure the session has the tensors and the graph that they are defined in.

i hope this helps. it’s easy to get tripped up on graph management when using tensorflow. reading the tensorflow documentation, especially the section on graphs and sessions might help further with similar problems. i also found the deep learning with python book to be very informative.

and remember, even if your code is not throwing errors, it still might not be what you expect (true story).
