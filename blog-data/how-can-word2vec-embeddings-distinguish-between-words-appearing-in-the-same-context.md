Alright, let’s talk word2vec and its sometimes-misunderstood ability to differentiate words that seemingly share the same context. It’s a common point of confusion, especially when you’re first getting your hands dirty with natural language processing. I've seen this trip up quite a few junior engineers, and even some seasoned pros initially. I remember a project back at my previous company, where we were building a sentiment analysis tool, and the embeddings we generated were giving us some weird results until we really understood this nuance.

The core idea of word2vec, whether you're using the continuous bag of words (cbow) or the skip-gram model, is that words appearing in similar contexts will have similar vector representations. This "similarity" is measured using cosine similarity, among other metrics. So, logically, you might think that words always used together would have identical vectors, but that's not how it shakes out. Instead, word2vec learns *subtle* differences within seemingly shared contexts. It's about capturing the distribution of words within those contexts, not just the presence of co-occurring terms.

The key here is the training objective. Consider the skip-gram model: it aims to predict surrounding words given a central word. The model is iteratively adjusted through backpropagation on the training data. This process doesn’t just look at *if* words appear together, it pays close attention to *which* words are more probable to occur in the vicinity of the central word.

For example, consider two sentences: "The cat sat on the mat," and "A dog lay on the floor." Both “cat” and “dog” appear within the context of an animal-on-a-surface setting (and with “on the” as part of that context). However, the model will learn that "cat" is more likely to be associated with words like “sat”, “mat”, and maybe "purr", whilst "dog" is closer to "lay", "floor", and potentially "bark”. This probability of co-occurrence is crucial. The nuanced differences in these probabilities will result in separate embeddings, even though both appear in a seemingly similar context. It's akin to a subtle fingerprint in the co-occurrence patterns.

The negative sampling technique (used within both skip-gram and cbow) also plays a significant role. Negative samples introduce contrast; words that *don't* appear in the context are used during training, forcing the model to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant words. This is not about encoding absolute truth, but rather about encoding *probability* of association based on the input data.

Let's illustrate with some Python code using the gensim library, a very handy tool for such explorations:

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

nltk.download('punkt') # only required on first run


sentences = [
    "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    "a cat sleeps quietly on the soft mat",
    "the large dog barks loudly at the mailman",
    "a small bird sings sweetly in the tree",
    "the cat likes to play with a ball of yarn"
]

tokenized_sentences = [word_tokenize(sentence.lower()) for sentence in sentences]

model = Word2Vec(sentences=tokenized_sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, sg=1, negative=5)

print(f"Similarity between 'cat' and 'dog': {model.wv.similarity('cat', 'dog')}")
print(f"Similarity between 'cat' and 'mat': {model.wv.similarity('cat', 'mat')}")
print(f"Similarity between 'dog' and 'barks': {model.wv.similarity('dog', 'barks')}")
```

In this example, 'cat' and 'dog' will have a lower similarity score than 'cat' and 'mat' or 'dog' and 'barks' because they tend to exist within slightly different semantic fields despite sharing the same general sentence structure with other words. The probabilities of which words tend to accompany “cat” vs. “dog” during training drives this difference.

Now, let's add a few more sentences to make the point even more salient:

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

nltk.download('punkt') # only required on first run


sentences = [
    "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    "a cat sleeps quietly on the soft mat",
    "the large dog barks loudly at the mailman",
    "a small bird sings sweetly in the tree",
    "the cat likes to play with a ball of yarn",
    "the dog chased the ball in the park",
    "the fluffy cat enjoyed the sunny day",
    "a loyal dog greeted me at the door",
    "the cat purred happily on the couch"
]


tokenized_sentences = [word_tokenize(sentence.lower()) for sentence in sentences]

model = Word2Vec(sentences=tokenized_sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, sg=1, negative=5)

print(f"Similarity between 'cat' and 'dog': {model.wv.similarity('cat', 'dog')}")
print(f"Similarity between 'cat' and 'mat': {model.wv.similarity('cat', 'mat')}")
print(f"Similarity between 'dog' and 'barks': {model.wv.similarity('dog', 'barks')}")
print(f"Similarity between 'cat' and 'purred': {model.wv.similarity('cat', 'purred')}")
print(f"Similarity between 'dog' and 'chased': {model.wv.similarity('dog', 'chased')}")


```
With the added sentences, the separation between the semantic contexts becomes more pronounced. ‘Cat’ is now more associated with actions like ‘purred’, and ‘dog’ with actions like ‘chased’ in terms of their surrounding words even though both appear in sentences using similar syntax.

Finally, consider this slightly different setup using the cbow model:

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

nltk.download('punkt') # only required on first run


sentences = [
    "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    "a cat sleeps quietly on the soft mat",
    "the large dog barks loudly at the mailman",
    "a small bird sings sweetly in the tree",
    "the cat likes to play with a ball of yarn",
    "the dog chased the ball in the park",
    "the fluffy cat enjoyed the sunny day",
    "a loyal dog greeted me at the door",
    "the cat purred happily on the couch"
]

tokenized_sentences = [word_tokenize(sentence.lower()) for sentence in sentences]

model = Word2Vec(sentences=tokenized_sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, sg=0, negative=5) # cbow model

print(f"Similarity between 'cat' and 'dog': {model.wv.similarity('cat', 'dog')}")
print(f"Similarity between 'cat' and 'mat': {model.wv.similarity('cat', 'mat')}")
print(f"Similarity between 'dog' and 'barks': {model.wv.similarity('dog', 'barks')}")
print(f"Similarity between 'cat' and 'purred': {model.wv.similarity('cat', 'purred')}")
print(f"Similarity between 'dog' and 'chased': {model.wv.similarity('dog', 'chased')}")

```

Here, we’ve switched to the cbow model (sg=0). While the precise similarities might differ slightly from the skip-gram examples, the core point remains: the model is still effectively distinguishing between 'cat' and 'dog' based on the contextual words in which they frequently occur, not simply their presence within the same general sentences.

Now, if you want to delve deeper, I recommend checking out *Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality* by Mikolov et al. (2013) - a foundational paper that will give you a better understanding of how they train word2vec models, and the specifics of the skip-gram and negative sampling approaches. For a broader understanding of NLP, *Speech and Language Processing* by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin is a great reference. Lastly, for a more formal approach to these vector spaces, look into *Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing* by Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Schütze; they dedicate a chapter to distributional semantics.

So, to summarize, word2vec is not just about the presence of words within the same context; it’s about their *statistical distribution* within that context. The probabilities of specific word co-occurrences, combined with negative sampling techniques, allow word2vec to effectively differentiate between terms that may seemingly appear in the same general vicinity in a text corpus. This differentiation, based on the subtle but significant differences in these statistical distributions, leads to meaningful vector representations that capture the nuances of natural language. It's a sophisticated model when you delve into its internals, and understanding these aspects is critical to getting the most out of it.
