Let’s tackle this one. I’ve spent a considerable portion of my career knee-deep in GIS data and, believe me, sourcing reliable geospatial environmental, terrain, and topographic classifications can feel like navigating a labyrinth. It’s not as straightforward as a quick google search; you need a methodical approach. Let’s break this down into the key areas I've encountered, and discuss where to find what, backed up with some practical code examples using widely adopted libraries.

First off, let's clarify what we mean by these classifications, because the terminology can blur. *Environmental classifications* often refer to land cover types (forest, grassland, urban), ecosystem types (temperate rainforest, boreal forest), or sometimes even more specific habitat delineations. *Terrain classifications* deal with the physical characteristics of the land surface— slope, aspect, curvature, and the like. Finally, *topographic classifications* usually concern elevation data, contours, and derived products such as shaded relief maps. These categories, while distinct, frequently overlap in practice.

Now, where do you actually get this stuff? The answer, unsurprisingly, depends on the type of classification and the geographic scale you're targeting.

For broad-scale, global datasets, freely available resources are the way to go. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is an absolute powerhouse here. Their Earth Explorer platform (earth explorer.usgs.gov, for those who prefer not to just take my word on it - though I've avoided linking) is a treasure trove. Here you’ll find datasets like the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) for the US and, for global coverage, the Global Land Cover (GLC) products developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) within the Copernicus programme.

The key here, as I learned painfully early on in my career, is understanding the data formats and how to ingest them efficiently. These datasets often come as raster files (e.g., GeoTIFF, IMG) which can be computationally expensive if not handled well. Let's look at an example of how to load a GeoTIFF using the `rasterio` library in Python:

```python
import rasterio
import numpy as np

def load_raster_data(filepath):
    try:
        with rasterio.open(filepath) as src:
            array = src.read(1)  # Read band 1 data
            profile = src.profile
            return array, profile
    except rasterio.RasterioIOError as e:
        print(f"Error loading raster: {e}")
        return None, None

# Example Usage:
filepath = "path/to/your/raster.tif"  # Replace with your actual path
raster_array, raster_profile = load_raster_data(filepath)

if raster_array is not None:
    print("Raster data loaded successfully.")
    print(f"Shape of raster: {raster_array.shape}")
    # Now you can perform operations on the raster_array.
    # e.g., calculate statistics, reclassify etc.
    print(f"Data type: {raster_array.dtype}")
    print(f"Profile: {raster_profile}")
else:
    print("Raster loading failed.")
```

This simple snippet illustrates the basic principle: you read the raster data, often as a numpy array, and the accompanying profile data gives you necessary metadata such as the geographic coordinates and the resolution. Always, *always* validate your coordinate reference systems. Mismatched projections will lead to absolutely nonsensical results.

Now, for terrain classifications like slope, aspect, and curvature, you typically need a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as a starting point. Again, the USGS (along with other national mapping agencies) provides such datasets at varying resolutions. SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data is an older, but still widely used, source for global DEMs. More recent and higher-resolution DEMs can also be found from sources like the ArcticDEM project or the TanDEM-X mission. Remember, your choice of DEM should align with the granularity needed for your classification – using a 30-meter resolution DEM to classify fine-scale micro-terrain changes is simply not the correct approach.

Once you have your DEM, libraries like `rasterio` and `numpy` can be combined to perform terrain analysis. Here's an example showing how to calculate slope using `numpy` with the raster data, though this would typically be handled more efficiently within a GIS environment like QGIS or ArcGIS:

```python
import rasterio
import numpy as np

def calculate_slope(dem_array, cell_size):
    """Calculates slope from a digital elevation model using numpy."""
    rows, cols = dem_array.shape
    slope_array = np.zeros_like(dem_array, dtype=float)

    for r in range(1, rows - 1):
        for c in range(1, cols - 1):
            dz_dx = ((dem_array[r, c+1] - dem_array[r, c-1]) / (2 * cell_size))
            dz_dy = ((dem_array[r+1, c] - dem_array[r-1, c]) / (2 * cell_size))
            slope_array[r, c] = np.arctan(np.sqrt(dz_dx**2 + dz_dy**2))
    return slope_array

# Example Usage (assuming raster_array and raster_profile from above):
if raster_array is not None:
    cell_size = raster_profile['transform'][0] # Assuming square cells
    slope_array = calculate_slope(raster_array, cell_size)
    print("Slope calculated.")
    print(f"Shape of slope raster: {slope_array.shape}")
else:
    print("DEM data is not available for slope calculation.")
```

This snippet calculates slope in radians. In practice, you'd usually convert to degrees. Additionally, remember that edge effects are not handled, and more sophisticated gradient calculations with better edge handling is required for rigorous analysis, and is implemented in most GIS softwares.

For more specific topographic classification involving contour generation or shaded relief mapping, most GIS software packages (like QGIS, ArcGIS) and even some programming libraries like GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) provide built-in tools that are optimized for these operations. Doing these operations directly in Python with numpy can become significantly more cumbersome. GDAL can be readily accessed through Python with the `osgeo` library, and we can generate shaded relief directly, this implementation, however, will still depend on having a pre-existing DEM:

```python
from osgeo import gdal
import numpy as np

def calculate_shaded_relief(dem_path, azimuth=315, altitude=45):
    """Calculates a shaded relief image from a DEM using GDAL."""
    try:
        dem_dataset = gdal.Open(dem_path)
        if dem_dataset is None:
            print(f"Error: Could not open DEM: {dem_path}")
            return None

        dem_band = dem_dataset.GetRasterBand(1)
        dem_array = dem_band.ReadAsArray()
        if dem_array is None:
            print(f"Error: Could not read raster band.")
            return None

        # Calculate shaded relief
        shaded_relief_array = gdal.DEMProcessing("", dem_dataset, 'hillshade', format='MEM',
                                 zFactor=1, azimuth=azimuth, altitude=altitude)

        if shaded_relief_array is None:
            print("Error processing shaded relief.")
            return None
        else:
            return shaded_relief_array.ReadAsArray()

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None
    finally:
        if dem_dataset:
            dem_dataset = None # Release memory

# Example Usage:
dem_path = "path/to/your/dem.tif" # Replace with your DEM
shaded_relief = calculate_shaded_relief(dem_path)
if shaded_relief is not None:
    print("Shaded relief calculated successfully.")
    print(f"Shape of shaded relief: {shaded_relief.shape}")
else:
    print("Shaded relief generation failed.")

```

For specialized environmental classifications, such as those pertaining to specific ecosystems or habitats, you may need to delve into peer-reviewed literature and more niche datasets. Look for publications and resources from institutions like the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), or relevant governmental or academic studies for your area of interest. Datasets accompanying such studies will frequently be published via open science initiatives, and often form the backbone of many global and regional level studies.

In short, sourcing geospatial classifications isn't a one-size-fits-all task. It requires careful consideration of the scale of your analysis, the data formats involved, and a robust understanding of the specific methodologies behind the datasets themselves. The code snippets here are just starting points; real-world application usually requires more sophisticated pipelines and domain knowledge. If you are looking to dive deeper, I’d strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the following resources: the *Handbook of Geographic Information Science* by Wilson and Fotheringham for a foundational understanding of GIS concepts, and the documentation of `rasterio`, `numpy`, and `GDAL/osgeo` as those libraries form the workhorse of processing many forms of remote sensing data. I'd also suggest spending some time with the documentation of whatever global data source you plan on working with, to fully grasp their caveats and limitations. Getting this right will save you from numerous headaches further down the line.
