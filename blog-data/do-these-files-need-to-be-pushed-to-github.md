Let’s tackle this question directly, because the devil, as they say, is often in the details. The immediate answer, “do these files need to be pushed to github?” is, of course, context dependent. I’ve seen teams, and I’ve been part of a few, where this was a constant point of contention, sometimes leading to bloated repositories and unnecessary churn. So, instead of a simple yes or no, let’s examine the factors at play and build a framework for deciding. Over my years, I've developed a few heuristics that consistently keep things manageable.

Firstly, ask yourself: what is the purpose of version control? Fundamentally, it's to track changes to code, enabling collaboration, experimentation, and rollback capabilities. Github, being a common platform, extends this to also facilitate code sharing, review, and deployment pipelines. So, when deciding if a file needs to go into git, we must evaluate if it fits these purposes.

The first and most obvious category is source code. If it’s part of your application’s logic, absolutely yes. This includes your primary application files, scripts, tests, and any associated configuration files necessary for running the code in different environments. Let’s solidify this with a code snippet that's about a simple python configuration parser.

```python
import yaml

def load_config(filepath):
    """Loads configuration from a YAML file."""
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
            config = yaml.safe_load(file)
        return config
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: Configuration file not found at {filepath}")
        return None
    except yaml.YAMLError as exc:
        print(f"Error parsing YAML: {exc}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    config = load_config("config.yaml")
    if config:
        print(f"Database host: {config['database']['host']}")
        print(f"Port: {config['server']['port']}")
```

The `load_config` function itself, alongside any files it depends on (like `config.yaml`), should be version controlled. The configuration, which is a yaml or similar config file, is crucial for replicating the environment the code runs on, and thus must be versioned. If you make changes to the config, those changes should be tracked too.

However, not all configuration goes into version control. Files that are environment-specific and may contain sensitive data, such as API keys or database passwords, should not be committed. Instead, use environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution. I learned this the hard way, when a team mate pushed a test config to a public repo, which contained a development database password; it got compromised, and we had to spend quite a bit of time cleaning that up and revoking keys. I never made that mistake again. Instead, I would opt for configurations like this, using environment variables:

```python
import os
import psycopg2

def connect_db():
    """Connects to a PostgreSQL database using environment variables."""
    try:
        db_host = os.environ['DB_HOST']
        db_name = os.environ['DB_NAME']
        db_user = os.environ['DB_USER']
        db_password = os.environ['DB_PASSWORD']
        conn = psycopg2.connect(host=db_host, database=db_name, user=db_user, password=db_password)
        return conn
    except KeyError as e:
        print(f"Error: Environment variable {e} not set.")
        return None
    except psycopg2.Error as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to database: {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    connection = connect_db()
    if connection:
        print("Successfully connected to the database.")
        connection.close()
```

Here, you will see that the sensitive information is sourced from environment variables and isn't committed in the source code itself. This type of setup should be documented, and, of course, the `connect_db` file should be pushed to the repo so that the process of establishing a connection is visible.

Next, consider generated files. Should these be in git? Generally, no. Things like compiled binaries, build artifacts, or dependency caches should be excluded. These can be recreated from source, and committing them just leads to bloated repositories and version control issues. You might want to look at the git documentation for `.gitignore` configuration. Also, explore tools like make or poetry that automate this. Here is an example of a python script that generates a data file, that should absolutely be excluded from source control.

```python
import json

def generate_data(num_entries, output_file):
    """Generates a JSON data file."""
    data = []
    for i in range(num_entries):
        data.append({"id": i, "value": f"Data point {i}"})
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  generate_data(100, "data.json")
  print ("data.json was generated, and should be excluded from version control")
```

`data.json` would be an obvious exclusion in this case. While the source file should be version controlled, it is generally a good idea to ensure that generated content is not tracked. The goal is that any developer should be able to regenerate the data.

As a rule, the decision about if a file belongs in git should come from this question: if I deleted this file, would it stop someone from building and running the project from scratch? If the answer is yes, you should track it. if the answer is no, you probably shouldn't. Always think in terms of reproducibility. A good guideline is to track text-based files (code, configuration, markdown docs) and avoid committing binary files (images, compiled artifacts, large datasets). Some exceptions do apply. Large data files, especially those needed for training AI models, may sometimes be versioned using git-lfs (large file storage), but this needs to be implemented carefully and only when absolutely necessary.

I’ve found that consistently applying these principles helps to maintain a clean and efficient git workflow. It's not about blindly following rules, but understanding the underlying reasons for them. This promotes a better environment and makes it easier for both the team and me to collaborate and maintain the project.

Finally, when setting up your `.gitignore`, I strongly suggest starting with a template specific to your technology stack, as generated by something like `gitignore.io`. For example, a Python `.gitignore` will include `*.pyc`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, and more. There is no need to constantly recreate that configuration every time a new project is started. These are standard and should be adopted right away.

To deepen your understanding, I'd recommend exploring the following resources: "Pro Git" by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, which provides an exhaustive guide to all aspects of Git. Also, the documentation on GitHub itself is a fantastic resource. For a deeper dive on dependency management and configuration, look at the documentation for Poetry (for Python) or similar tools in your preferred language; they often contain excellent information about the best practices. Finally, and more broadly, "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin is an outstanding resource that, although not specifically about version control, offers a lot of guidance about maintainable code, which is intimately tied to how we manage code using git. In conclusion, keep asking the fundamental questions behind the best practices. They will not only keep your repository clean, but make your development process much more enjoyable and efficient.
