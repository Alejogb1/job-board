Alright, let's tackle this. Panic situations with PostgreSQL and gorm's migrator, especially v2, aren't exactly a picnic, but they often stem from a predictable set of causes. I've certainly had my share of late-night debugging sessions because of this particular issue back in my days leading the data infrastructure team at [fictional company name]. It usually boils down to a misalignment between your code's expectations and the database's reality, specifically concerning schema definitions.

The heart of the problem, in my experience, is often related to how gorm's automigration works. While wonderfully convenient, automigration inherently relies on reflection and assumptions about the database schema. When these assumptions fail, you see that dreaded panic. We’re not talking about a silent failure here, gorm quite literally screams, which is at least helpful. Three scenarios particularly stick out from my experience, and I’ll provide code snippets to illustrate them.

Firstly, schema discrepancies between your gorm model definitions and the actual database schema are a classic source of these panics. You've defined a field in your go struct, let's say an `int`, but your database might have it as `text`, or even something less obvious like a `bigint`. This mismatch leads to issues during gorm's schema comparison process, as it cannot map your model onto an incompatible database column. Let’s consider a simple example. Suppose your database had a `users` table, where `age` is a `text` type.

```go
package main

import (
	"gorm.io/driver/postgres"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
    "log"
)

type User struct {
    gorm.Model
    Name string
    Age int
}

func main() {
    dsn := "user=testuser password=testpassword dbname=testdb host=localhost port=5432 sslmode=disable"
    db, err := gorm.Open(postgres.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to connect to database: %v", err)
    }
    err = db.AutoMigrate(&User{})
	if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Migration Failed: %v", err)
    }
}
```

In this example, assuming your database's `users` table has `age` as a string type, gorm will panic upon `AutoMigrate`, because it can't reconcile your int age definition with the existing schema. You’ll get a cascade of errors in gorm’s output because the type mapping process is fundamentally failing. The fix here is simple: adjust your go struct definition or your database schema to match exactly. Use database introspection tools or gorm’s own logging to pinpoint the precise column and data type that cause the issue.

Secondly, and this one caused a very frustrating Friday for my team, is the issue of complex data types, especially ones involving JSON or arrays, that have been defined in the database but not represented precisely in your model using gorm-supported types. For instance, PostgreSQL's `JSONB` type, while easily stored, requires specific attention when interacting with gorm. If you attempt to use a simple string or struct as a representation for a jsonb column, gorm’s automigration will likely fail. Consider this code, assuming you’ve a `settings` column that is defined in postgres as `jsonb`:

```go
package main

import (
	"gorm.io/driver/postgres"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"gorm.io/datatypes"
    "log"
)

type Config struct {
    gorm.Model
    Setting datatypes.JSON
}


func main() {
    dsn := "user=testuser password=testpassword dbname=testdb host=localhost port=5432 sslmode=disable"
    db, err := gorm.Open(postgres.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to connect to database: %v", err)
    }
    err = db.AutoMigrate(&Config{})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Migration Failed: %v", err)
    }
}
```

Here, if the 'setting' column existed as a string, or perhaps an incomplete datatypes.JSONB, but your Go struct used only `datatypes.JSON`, the migrator would panic as it attempted to establish column compatibility. The correct fix here is to be explicit in your go code about types like `datatypes.JSON` or `datatypes.JSONB`. In the above example, the use of `datatypes.JSON` provides a generic way to store JSON data. Alternatively, to be more specific you can use `datatypes.JSONB`. Remember that gorm tries to be smart, but it relies on explicit guidance when dealing with the more nuanced types offered by databases like PostgreSQL.

Lastly, and this was my personal nemesis when we were first adopting gorm v2, was inconsistent naming conventions, especially with composite keys or foreign key relationships. If your foreign key name or any field name in your gorm struct doesn’t precisely match what’s expected in the database, or if you have manually made changes to tables before running automigration, you might run into a panic, particularly when dealing with relation migrations. Let’s look at a simplified example, assuming you've previously established a relation and then refactor column names but did not update your go structs.

```go
package main

import (
	"gorm.io/driver/postgres"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
    "log"
)

type Order struct {
    gorm.Model
	UserID  uint `gorm:"foreignKey:CustomerRef"`
	Customer Customer `gorm:"references:ID"`
    Amount float64
}

type Customer struct {
	gorm.Model
    Name string
}

func main() {
    dsn := "user=testuser password=testpassword dbname=testdb host=localhost port=5432 sslmode=disable"
    db, err := gorm.Open(postgres.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to connect to database: %v", err)
    }
    err = db.AutoMigrate(&Order{},&Customer{})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Migration Failed: %v", err)
    }
}
```

Here, if your foreign key relationship in the database already exists but the name in the database does not match 'CustomerRef' gorm may panic, especially during table creation or alteration. Likewise, if you had renamed the `customer_id` to something different in the database, you need to explicitly tell gorm how they match using gorm tags such as `foreignKey` and `references`, which helps in correctly identifying related tables. The error messages given by gorm when dealing with foreign key mis-match are particularly cryptic and take some time to decode.

To diagnose and fix these situations, I recommend a few approaches. First, examine the gorm debug logs closely— they are immensely helpful in revealing exactly where the miscommunication is happening. Also, be very meticulous about your model definition. Double and triple-check field types, tags, and name consistency, comparing your structs directly against your database schema. Lastly, I’d recommend reviewing ‘Database Design for Mere Mortals’ by Michael J. Hernandez and John L. Viescas for a solid foundation in database schema design principles to avoid these type of issues. Also, the official PostgreSQL documentation, particularly the section on data types, is essential knowledge for any developer working with Postgres. Understanding the underlying database is fundamental to ensuring the smooth operation of any ORM. Additionally, the official gorm documentation is crucial, paying specific attention to the ‘Migration’ section, which has evolved substantially since gorm v1.

In conclusion, while frustrating, gorm's migration panics are almost always the result of subtle discrepancies in type declarations, column naming, or handling complex database types. By carefully aligning your go structs with your database schema, being explicit in type definitions, and leveraging gorm’s logging mechanisms, you can prevent these panics from occurring, leading to more robust and reliable applications.
