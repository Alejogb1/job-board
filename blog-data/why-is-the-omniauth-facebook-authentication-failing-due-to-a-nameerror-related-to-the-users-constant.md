Alright, let's tackle this omniauth Facebook authentication issue. I've seen this particular `NameError` cropping up more often than one might expect, especially in projects that have evolved a fair bit over time. It’s frustrating, I get it. Usually, this type of error – a `NameError` indicating an uninitialized constant `Users` – points towards a fundamental issue in how your application is set up to handle models or dependencies in relation to the omniauth callback. Let's get into the specifics.

The core problem here isn't really about the omniauth-facebook gem itself, at least not directly. What’s happening is your omniauth callback – the code that gets executed after a user successfully authenticates with Facebook – is trying to access a `Users` constant before it's been properly defined or before it's accessible in the scope it's being called from. Think of it like trying to use a variable before you've actually declared it. In most Rails applications, this constant typically maps to your `User` model, but the critical part is that this mapping might not be working or available when omniauth's callback is processed.

My experience with this usually falls into a few categories, which we can break down. The most common ones involve:

1.  **Incorrect Load Order/Initialization:** Rails application loading is not linear. There's a whole dance that happens with initializers, model loading, and middleware execution. Sometimes, the omniauth middleware or controller action is executed before the required model (the `User` model usually) has been fully loaded. This is especially prevalent when employing eager loading or more nuanced configurations within config/environments/*.rb.

2.  **Namespacing Issues:** If your user model isn’t at the toplevel of your project (e.g. `Models::User` instead of `User`), or if you have a complicated namespace strategy, that can often cause this problem. Your omniauth strategy may be looking in the wrong place, or your callback may be assuming a toplevel user constant, and when it doesn't find a model named User directly, you get that error.

3.  **Custom Omniauth Configurations:** If you've customized your omniauth configuration, especially the callback controller or the specific omniauth strategy, that customization might be assuming some specifics about your application structure that are incorrect. That can very easily break the convention that it needs.

Let’s look at some code examples, starting with a rather standard setup that *might* be where you're seeing the issue (or a variation of it) – these are not the cause, but where the issue likely materializes. Let’s imagine a typical controller action handling the callback, and the underlying model.

**Example 1: Typical, But Problematic Controller Code**

```ruby
# app/controllers/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb
class OmniauthCallbacksController < Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
  def facebook
    @user = User.from_omniauth(request.env["omniauth.auth"])
    if @user.persisted?
      sign_in_and_redirect @user, event: :authentication
      set_flash_message(:notice, :success, kind: "Facebook") if is_navigational_format?
    else
      session["devise.facebook_data"] = request.env["omniauth.auth"].except(:extra)
      redirect_to new_user_registration_url
    end
  end
end
```

In this case, the `User.from_omniauth` method is where the issue will manifest – if User isn’t loaded, or it's not what it’s expecting. The `User` constant would trigger the `NameError`. The model itself might look something like this:

**Example 2: A Possible User Model**

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable,
         :omniauthable, omniauth_providers: %i[facebook]

  def self.from_omniauth(auth)
    where(provider: auth.provider, uid: auth.uid).first_or_create do |user|
      user.email = auth.info.email
      user.password = Devise.friendly_token[0, 20]
      user.name = auth.info.name
      # Further user data setting here
    end
  end
end
```

Again, nothing is necessarily *wrong* in these two code snippets. However, the environment, order in which files are loaded and initialized, etc., can lead to the error.

Now, how do we actually fix this? The most common fix is ensuring proper model loading. Let’s see an example where we would explicitly load the model.

**Example 3: Explicitly Loading the Model**

```ruby
# config/initializers/omniauth.rb
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :facebook, ENV['FACEBOOK_APP_ID'], ENV['FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET'],
           scope: 'email', info_fields: 'email, name'
end

# app/controllers/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb
class OmniauthCallbacksController < Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
  before_action :load_user_model

  def facebook
    @user = User.from_omniauth(request.env["omniauth.auth"])
    if @user.persisted?
      sign_in_and_redirect @user, event: :authentication
      set_flash_message(:notice, :success, kind: "Facebook") if is_navigational_format?
    else
      session["devise.facebook_data"] = request.env["omniauth.auth"].except(:extra)
      redirect_to new_user_registration_url
    end
  end

  private

  def load_user_model
    require_dependency 'app/models/user.rb' #Explicitly loads the User model
  end
end
```

In this example, `require_dependency` will explicitly load `app/models/user.rb` during the `before_action`. I do prefer this approach and found it the most robust in my experience. Note that in most cases, explicit loading should not be needed. However, specific cases, such as with Rails engines or more complex architecture setups, can justify this fix.

**Recommendations and Further Reading**

To really understand the intricacies of Rails' initialization, I highly recommend reading the official Rails documentation on the application loading process, particularly the section about "initializers and boot process." Also, diving into "Rails engines" can be helpful to understand more complex dependency loading. The book *Crafting Rails Applications* by José Valim also dedicates a significant portion to understanding the lifecycle of Rails application and how each part interacts with each other, making it an excellent learning resource. It might also be beneficial to examine the source code of the Devise gem itself – as it's a common dependency here – to gain further insight into how it handles callbacks.

**Concluding Thoughts**

The `NameError` related to the `Users` constant is typically not an issue with the omniauth gems themselves. It is usually a consequence of misconfigured or not completely understood application loading order or potential namespacing problems. By carefully evaluating your configuration and understanding when and how dependencies are loaded within your application, you should be able to resolve this particular error effectively. As always, testing is the key to spotting these types of problems early on and ensuring a smoother development process. Remember to check not only your direct code but the environment in which it runs.
