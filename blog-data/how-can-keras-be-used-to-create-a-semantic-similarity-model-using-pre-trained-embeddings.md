Alright, let's unpack this. Semantic similarity modelling with Keras, using pre-trained embeddings—it’s a challenge I've tackled more than a few times in past projects, specifically when we were trying to build a custom document similarity engine for an internal knowledge base a few years back. It's a powerful technique, and I think I can offer some clear, practical guidance on how to approach it.

The core idea is to represent words or sentences as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where the relative positions of those vectors indicate their semantic relatedness. Pre-trained embeddings—think word2vec, GloVe, or fastText—provide the initial coordinates for these vectors, allowing us to leverage massive amounts of pre-existing language data without starting from scratch. Keras, with its clean api, is perfect for gluing all this together.

Now, the first step is deciding on the embedding you want to use and how you plan to load it into Keras. There are two common approaches: you can freeze the pre-trained embeddings, treating them as fixed inputs, or you can allow the model to fine-tune them during training. Freezing is faster and suitable when you don't have a massive dataset, while fine-tuning generally yields better results if you do, at the cost of longer training times and risk of overfitting. I’ve used both in the past, and each has its place, depending on the specific requirements.

Let’s dive into an example using a frozen embedding layer. This scenario is very typical for transfer learning: leveraging the knowledge captured in a large pre-trained model for a smaller, specialized task. Here's how we could structure it in Keras:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Assume we have a dictionary 'word_index' mapping words to integers
# and a matrix 'embedding_matrix' containing the pre-trained embeddings.
# This loading is dependent on where your embeddings are stored.

def create_embedding_layer(vocab_size, embedding_dim, embedding_matrix):
    embedding_layer = layers.Embedding(
        vocab_size,
        embedding_dim,
        embeddings_initializer=keras.initializers.Constant(embedding_matrix),
        trainable=False, # Crucial for freezing the layer.
        mask_zero=True # For dealing with variable length input
    )
    return embedding_layer

# Lets just make up some values for the example
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 100
embedding_matrix = np.random.rand(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

embedding_layer = create_embedding_layer(vocab_size, embedding_dim, embedding_matrix)


def build_similarity_model(embedding_layer, lstm_units=128, dense_units=64):
    input_a = keras.Input(shape=(None,)) # For sequence of indices for text A
    input_b = keras.Input(shape=(None,)) # For sequence of indices for text B

    embedding_a = embedding_layer(input_a)
    embedding_b = embedding_layer(input_b)


    lstm_a = layers.LSTM(lstm_units)(embedding_a)
    lstm_b = layers.LSTM(lstm_units)(embedding_b)

    # Now use a custom layer that computes the cosine similarity
    similarity_vector = layers.Lambda(lambda tensors: tf.keras.metrics.cosine_similarity(tensors[0], tensors[1]))([lstm_a,lstm_b])


    model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=similarity_vector)
    return model

model = build_similarity_model(embedding_layer)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['cosine_similarity'])

model.summary()
```

In this snippet, `create_embedding_layer` constructs our pre-trained embedding layer, and crucially, it’s configured to be non-trainable using `trainable=False`. This preserves the pre-trained semantic relationships encoded in the embeddings. Then `build_similarity_model` accepts this layer, takes two text inputs, encodes these using LSTMs, and computes a cosine similarity between these vector representations. We utilize MSE loss since we want to try to learn to predict a score between -1 and 1.

Next, if we did have a large training set we could fine-tune these embeddings. The primary change would be altering `trainable = False` to `trainable = True` in the `create_embedding_layer` function. Let's modify the above code snippet to illustrate this:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Assume we have a dictionary 'word_index' mapping words to integers
# and a matrix 'embedding_matrix' containing the pre-trained embeddings.
# This loading is dependent on where your embeddings are stored.

def create_embedding_layer_trainable(vocab_size, embedding_dim, embedding_matrix):
    embedding_layer = layers.Embedding(
        vocab_size,
        embedding_dim,
        embeddings_initializer=keras.initializers.Constant(embedding_matrix),
        trainable=True,  # The only change is here
        mask_zero = True
    )
    return embedding_layer

# Lets just make up some values for the example
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 100
embedding_matrix = np.random.rand(vocab_size, embedding_dim)


embedding_layer = create_embedding_layer_trainable(vocab_size, embedding_dim, embedding_matrix)



def build_similarity_model(embedding_layer, lstm_units=128, dense_units=64):
    input_a = keras.Input(shape=(None,)) # For sequence of indices for text A
    input_b = keras.Input(shape=(None,)) # For sequence of indices for text B

    embedding_a = embedding_layer(input_a)
    embedding_b = embedding_layer(input_b)

    lstm_a = layers.LSTM(lstm_units)(embedding_a)
    lstm_b = layers.LSTM(lstm_units)(embedding_b)


    similarity_vector = layers.Lambda(lambda tensors: tf.keras.metrics.cosine_similarity(tensors[0], tensors[1]))([lstm_a,lstm_b])

    model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=similarity_vector)
    return model


model = build_similarity_model(embedding_layer)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['cosine_similarity'])
model.summary()
```

The crucial difference in this second example is that the embedding layer is trainable (`trainable=True`), which allows the model to adjust the embedding vectors during training, which allows for finer control over semantics but does need a greater number of data points.

And lastly, a simpler example using average pooling which works as a quick baseline:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Assume we have a dictionary 'word_index' mapping words to integers
# and a matrix 'embedding_matrix' containing the pre-trained embeddings.
# This loading is dependent on where your embeddings are stored.

def create_embedding_layer(vocab_size, embedding_dim, embedding_matrix):
    embedding_layer = layers.Embedding(
        vocab_size,
        embedding_dim,
        embeddings_initializer=keras.initializers.Constant(embedding_matrix),
        trainable=False,
        mask_zero=True
    )
    return embedding_layer

# Lets just make up some values for the example
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 100
embedding_matrix = np.random.rand(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

embedding_layer = create_embedding_layer(vocab_size, embedding_dim, embedding_matrix)


def build_similarity_model_avg(embedding_layer):
    input_a = keras.Input(shape=(None,))
    input_b = keras.Input(shape=(None,))

    embedding_a = embedding_layer(input_a)
    embedding_b = embedding_layer(input_b)

    avg_a = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(embedding_a)
    avg_b = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(embedding_b)


    similarity_vector = layers.Lambda(lambda tensors: tf.keras.metrics.cosine_similarity(tensors[0], tensors[1]))([avg_a,avg_b])


    model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=similarity_vector)
    return model


model = build_similarity_model_avg(embedding_layer)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['cosine_similarity'])
model.summary()
```

In this final example, instead of using LSTMs, we use GlobalAveragePooling, which essentially averages the embeddings in our sequence together, which results in a sentence embedding that can be directly compared with cosine similarity.

The choice of model architecture depends heavily on your specific requirements. For document similarity, particularly with longer passages, a more advanced recurrent or transformer-based model like the ones shown can be necessary to capture context and long-range dependencies. For shorter phrases or sentences, using a simple pooling method as shown above could suffice and be much faster to compute.

As for resources, I'd suggest checking out "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet, the creator of Keras. It offers solid explanations of embeddings and recurrent neural networks. Also, the original papers on word2vec ("Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" by Mikolov et al.) and GloVe ("GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation" by Pennington et al.) are good to have in your back pocket when trying to decide between embedding types. For a more in-depth theoretical background, consider studying the chapter on distributed representations in "Speech and Language Processing" by Jurafsky and Martin. And of course, the official Keras documentation always has a wealth of information as well.

Semantic similarity modeling is not an exact science. Experimenting with different pre-trained embedding models, architectures, and training hyperparameters is necessary to find the best solution for your specific use case. That's been my experience, at least, and I hope it helps guide your own journey with Keras.
