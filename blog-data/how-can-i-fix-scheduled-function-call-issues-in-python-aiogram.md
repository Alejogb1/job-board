, let's talk about those pesky scheduled function call issues you're encountering with aiogram in Python. I've certainly been down that rabbit hole a few times myself, and it's usually a combination of things that can trip you up. Often, it's not an aiogram-specific problem, but rather a misunderstanding of how asynchronous programming, the event loop, and task scheduling intertwine within the framework. Let’s unpack it.

First, it's vital to recognize that aiogram is built upon `asyncio`, and that everything within it revolves around the event loop. When you’re setting up scheduled tasks, you aren’t directly telling Python to execute code at a specific time; instead, you're requesting the event loop to do so. If this loop is blocked or not handled properly, your scheduled function calls will seem erratic, delayed, or might not even execute at all. I remember once troubleshooting a very frustrating situation where database updates were scheduled using `asyncio.sleep` and a regular `while True` loop— needless to say, the entire bot was essentially a single-threaded mess, and the schedules were all over the place. The problem? The sleep was blocking, and the bot became unresponsive.

So, how do we move beyond the initial hurdles? The core principle is to avoid blocking the event loop. Instead of using blocking mechanisms like `time.sleep` or long, synchronous operations, we want asynchronous approaches. aiogram’s `asyncio`-based ecosystem and the scheduler provided by libraries such as `apscheduler` are our best friends here.

Let’s start with a simple case using the built-in `asyncio.create_task`. This is typically enough for basic, recurring schedules, and it’s worth mentioning because you might encounter solutions using this approach. However, be warned: as your bot grows and schedules become more complex, relying on pure `asyncio` becomes error-prone and less maintainable. This is where other libraries like `apscheduler` tend to provide a more robust solution.

Here's an example, demonstrating how to achieve a rudimentary scheduled call, understanding its limitations:

```python
import asyncio
from aiogram import Bot, Dispatcher, types
from aiogram.types import Message

# Your bot token
TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"

bot = Bot(token=TOKEN)
dp = Dispatcher(bot)

async def scheduled_task(chat_id):
    await bot.send_message(chat_id, "This is a scheduled message!")

async def setup_schedule(chat_id):
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(10) # schedule every 10 seconds
        asyncio.create_task(scheduled_task(chat_id))

@dp.message_handler(commands=['start'])
async def start_handler(message: Message):
    asyncio.create_task(setup_schedule(message.chat.id)) # initiate schedule for chat
    await message.answer("Schedule initiated for this chat.")

async def main():
    await dp.start_polling(bot)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, when you send `/start`, it spawns a task which executes `scheduled_task` every 10 seconds. The problem? If `scheduled_task` takes longer than 10 seconds or encounters any errors, this setup can easily get out of control. Additionally, there's no easy way to manage or stop this schedule. It's simply a repeating loop. We need a better scheduler.

Now, let's move on to `apscheduler`, a far more feature-rich solution. It provides different scheduler types, storage options, and configuration methods, making it easier to manage scheduled calls.

Here's an example using `apscheduler`:

```python
from aiogram import Bot, Dispatcher, types
from aiogram.types import Message
from apscheduler.schedulers.asyncio import AsyncIOScheduler

# Your bot token
TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"

bot = Bot(token=TOKEN)
dp = Dispatcher(bot)
scheduler = AsyncIOScheduler()

async def scheduled_task(chat_id):
    await bot.send_message(chat_id, "This is a scheduled message from apscheduler!")

@dp.message_handler(commands=['start'])
async def start_handler(message: Message):
    scheduler.add_job(scheduled_task, 'interval', seconds=10, args=[message.chat.id])
    await message.answer("Schedule initiated with apscheduler for this chat.")

async def main():
    scheduler.start()
    await dp.start_polling(bot)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```
Here, we use `AsyncIOScheduler` and add a job that executes `scheduled_task` every 10 seconds. The beauty of this approach is that apscheduler takes care of managing the schedule, handling cases where the task might take a longer time to execute. It prevents overlapping execution and allows for more complex schedules using triggers. You could, for example, schedule tasks to run only on certain days of the week, or at specific times.

Finally, an essential point to address when using `apscheduler` with aiogram, and a point I've seen people struggle with frequently, is how to manage your tasks effectively. What if you want to add a scheduled job to run only once? Or if a certain event should cause a job to be added, removed, or changed dynamically?

Here's an example combining both dynamic scheduling and one-off tasks:

```python
from aiogram import Bot, Dispatcher, types
from aiogram.types import Message
from apscheduler.schedulers.asyncio import AsyncIOScheduler
import asyncio

# Your bot token
TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"

bot = Bot(token=TOKEN)
dp = Dispatcher(bot)
scheduler = AsyncIOScheduler()

async def scheduled_task(chat_id):
    await bot.send_message(chat_id, "This is a scheduled message from apscheduler!")

async def one_off_task(chat_id):
    await bot.send_message(chat_id, "This message only appears once!")

@dp.message_handler(commands=['start'])
async def start_handler(message: Message):
    scheduler.add_job(scheduled_task, 'interval', seconds=10, args=[message.chat.id], id='recurring_task')
    await message.answer("Schedule initiated with apscheduler for this chat.")

@dp.message_handler(commands=['once'])
async def once_handler(message: Message):
   scheduler.add_job(one_off_task, args=[message.chat.id])
   await message.answer("One-off task scheduled.")

@dp.message_handler(commands=['stop'])
async def stop_handler(message: Message):
    if scheduler.get_job('recurring_task'):
        scheduler.remove_job('recurring_task')
        await message.answer("Recurring task stopped.")
    else:
        await message.answer("No recurring task to stop.")


async def main():
    scheduler.start()
    await dp.start_polling(bot)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, we are using the `id` parameter of the add_job function. This identifier makes it easy to retrieve and stop scheduled tasks using the `get_job()` and `remove_job()` methods. Moreover, we added a command `/once` that demonstrates the simplicity of one-off tasks in `apscheduler`. This shows the versatility of a proper scheduler.

To delve deeper, I'd suggest starting with the official `asyncio` documentation to understand how event loops function. Then, focus on reading the `apscheduler` documentation in detail. Additionally, the book "Concurrent Programming in Python" by David Beazley would be invaluable for developing a solid grasp of asynchronous programming. This will help you diagnose the subtle nuances of concurrency and understand how scheduling mechanisms work under the hood. And always, always remember to avoid blocking the event loop. That's the cardinal rule when working with aiogram. Hopefully, this overview provides a solid foundation for tackling those scheduled task issues. Good luck!
