Okay I see this InvalidArgumentException view layouts app not found in Laravel 8 with Livewire 2 situation a classic pain point I've definitely tangled with this beast before it's always something seemingly simple that trips you up

So here's the deal the error message itself `InvalidArgumentException view layouts app not found` it's pretty self explanatory right Laravel is basically screaming it can't find the `app` layout view that you're trying to use especially when Livewire comes into the picture it gets a little trickier sometimes since Livewire renders parts of your UI dynamically and that has a little to say about where it searches for your layouts

I recall a time back in like 2021 when I was migrating a project from Laravel 7 to 8 with Livewire I thought everything was smooth sailing you know like the documentation seemed crystal clear no problems in the horizon until I hit this exact error I was pulling my hair out trying to figure out where that damn `app.blade.php` was hiding eventually it turns out I had a rookie mistake in my `AppServiceProvider` it was a really hard facepalm moment to be honest

So let’s breakdown common culprits for this thing and what to do about it

**1 View Paths Config Is Misconfigured**

First thing we gotta check is your view paths Make sure your configuration files are pointing to the right directories where your blade layouts are sitting In `config/view.php` you have an array named paths check that shit this array tells Laravel where to look for views and if that setting is messed up then you're gonna be in trouble

```php
// config/view.php
'paths' => [
    resource_path('views'),
],
```

Simple right so basically in your application if you have a structure like this

```text
resources/
├── views/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── app.blade.php
│   └── components/
│       └── example.blade.php

```

Then the example above should be sufficient and works out of the box if however you got something else like

```text
resources/
└── blade_templates/
    ├── layouts/
    │   └── app.blade.php
    └── components/
        └── example.blade.php
```

then you need to update the `paths` configuration this way

```php
// config/view.php
'paths' => [
    resource_path('blade_templates'),
],
```
or even you can also add multiple paths like this and Laravel will prioritize in the order they are set

```php
// config/view.php
'paths' => [
    resource_path('blade_templates'),
    resource_path('views'),
],
```
**2 Livewire Layout Is Incorrect**
Now Livewire is a bit opinionated about where it looks for its layout in `app/Http/Livewire/YourComponent.php` you might need to specify the layout explicitly if it is not in the default folder specified in `config/view.php` or use a custom template

```php
// app/Http/Livewire/YourComponent.php
use Livewire\Component;

class YourComponent extends Component
{
    public function render()
    {
       return view('livewire.your-component')->layout('layouts.app');
    }
}
```

This line `.layout('layouts.app')` ensures that your Livewire view gets wrapped with your `app.blade.php` layout. If you are using a custom layout like mentioned before using `blade_templates` instead of `views` then it needs to reflect in your Livewire components also

```php
// app/Http/Livewire/YourComponent.php
use Livewire\Component;

class YourComponent extends Component
{
    public function render()
    {
       return view('livewire.your-component')->layout('layouts.app');
    }
}
```

Again if it is located in `blade_templates` then it must be `->layout('layouts.app')` even if you configured it in `config/view.php` this layout declaration is relative to the folder structure specified in `config/view.php` so `layouts.app` refers to `blade_templates/layouts/app.blade.php` or `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` depending on your config

**3 Blade Template Cache**
Sometimes Laravel caches view files or things go wrong with the cache you know the usual `artisan cache:clear` is your friend

```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

Try running these commands these commands clears the view cache and it might solve the issue if the cached file was messed up.

**4 Your App.Blade.php Is Missing**
This is another classic and obvious one double-check if the app.blade.php layout file exists in your resources/views/layouts or whatever directory you have specified in your view path if that file is not there then you will get the error its a pretty easy check so do it

**5 Check your AppServiceProvider**

Also in `AppServiceProvider.php` in the `boot()` method make sure you don't have some weird view composer configurations that mess with layout locations if it's a brand new application you probably haven't tweaked this file but still is a good practice to verify it I once spent two hours debugging an error because of a silly composer that got lost in translation it was a rough day I swear

**6 You Are Using a Layout in a wrong place**
This one is tricky sometimes you might be trying to use layout directive inside the template that is included in your layout template or even worse using the `layout` function call in your livewire template inside other livewire component this is a big no no and should not be done ever

**Example Scenario**

Let's say you have an `app.blade.php` in `resources/views/layouts` and it looks something like this

```blade
// resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ mix('css/app.css')}}">
    @livewireStyles
</head>
<body>
    {{ $slot }}
    @livewireScripts
</body>
</html>

```
and your Livewire Component is like this

```php
// app/Http/Livewire/ExampleComponent.php
use Livewire\Component;

class ExampleComponent extends Component
{
    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.example-component')->layout('layouts.app');
    }
}
```
and the corresponding `livewire/example-component.blade.php`
```blade
// resources/views/livewire/example-component.blade.php
<div>
    Hello world
</div>
```
This setup should work out of the box just fine assuming everything is well configured in `config/view.php` but if you happen to do something like

```blade
// resources/views/livewire/example-component.blade.php
<x-layouts.app>
    <div>
        Hello world
    </div>
</x-layouts.app>
```
or

```blade
// resources/views/livewire/example-component.blade.php
<div>
    @extends('layouts.app')
    Hello world
</div>
```
then you would be in trouble the same goes for something like

```php
// app/Http/Livewire/ExampleComponent.php
use Livewire\Component;

class ExampleComponent extends Component
{
    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.example-component')->layout('layouts.app');
    }
}
```

```blade
// resources/views/livewire/example-component.blade.php
<div>
   @layout('layouts.app')
    Hello world
</div>
```

You can use `x-layouts.app` component but this is more a component based layout approach so in this case you would have to create a `app.blade.php` component not a layout file and this approach is not the common use case for layouts but if you are not careful you might mistake this for the layout directive

Also if you are using Laravel components like `x-alert` you should not specify layouts inside of it since components are like little reusable UI parts and also since Laravel 8 introduced anonymous components you should not specify the layout inside them.

**Recommendations and Extra Reading**

To understand this better I recommend diving deeper into the core concepts. Start with Laravel documentation obviously it's your bible it has everything you need to know it also covers Livewire and the blade templating system. Also consider reading books like "Laravel Up & Running" by Matt Stauffer or "Refactoring Laravel" by Adam Wathan they cover a lot of ground and you'll find useful techniques not just on layouts but on the entire Laravel ecosystem. Also its a good idea to look into the source code of the `Illuminate/View` and `Livewire` packages to understand how things are working under the hood but dont do this unless you are really confident with debugging and php development since it can get really complicated.

**Debugging Tip**

If none of these work start by debugging step by step. A good old fashioned `dd()` is your friend always remember the rule of thumb "debug what you see not what you think" this rule has saved me countless hours of banging my head on the keyboard the idea is to debug by following the trace and seeing the data output.

I hope it helps you with your specific problem with `InvalidArgumentException` I know it can be a headache when you least expect it so just keep debugging you will find it eventually we all have been there. And remember to take a break from the computer now and then even the best developers need some fresh air you know to let our brains do their magic behind the scenes.

Oh and a quick joke just because why not: Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
