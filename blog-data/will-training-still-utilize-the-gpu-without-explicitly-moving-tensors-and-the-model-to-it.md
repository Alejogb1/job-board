, let's tackle this one. I've seen this particular issue rear its head more than a few times, and it always seems to trip up those new to deep learning. The short answer is: no, training generally won't *actively* utilize the GPU if you haven’t explicitly moved both your tensors (the data) and your model onto it, but the system might seem like it is, leading to confusion. There's a crucial distinction between *detecting* the presence of a GPU and *actually using it* for computation. The system might recognize that a CUDA-capable device is available, but that recognition alone won’t offload processing.

Let’s unpack this a bit further. The core problem stems from how deep learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow manage computational devices. These libraries typically operate on the principle of explicit device placement. That is, if you don’t tell the system to put something on the GPU, it defaults to using the CPU. This is a safety mechanism to ensure the code runs even on machines without a dedicated GPU. It's also a deliberate choice for those scenarios where certain computations are better suited for the CPU anyway.

Now, what might make it seem like the GPU is doing something even when you haven’t explicitly moved things? Often it's because certain preparatory steps might involve the GPU. For instance, during the initialization of your deep learning framework or during the loading of certain libraries that link with CUDA, the GPU's presence is verified, and initialization routines are pushed there. These routines are often just setup tasks, and they consume a negligible amount of GPU resources. What you’re most likely observing is this: a brief flicker of activity on the GPU monitoring tool, leading one to conclude that the actual training process is utilizing the GPU, when the real data crunching is still happening on the CPU. This is often confirmed by a significant increase in CPU load while GPU usage remains minimal or almost none.

The lack of explicit movement leads to incredibly slow training times. CPU calculations, especially for the matrix multiplications inherent in deep learning, are considerably slower than their GPU counterparts. Further, because data often needs to be copied back and forth from the CPU to the GPU (if a small part of the process *does* end up happening on the GPU due to implicit framework behaviors, such as tensor creation), there are also significant communication overheads. This means a system can seem to be “working,” but in reality it’s working inefficiently and most processing is happening on the CPU.

To illustrate, let’s consider some code snippets. The following examples are based on PyTorch because of its readability and common usage but the core principles are the same for all major deep learning frameworks.

**Example 1: CPU Execution**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
data = torch.randn(100, 10)
labels = torch.randn(100, 2)

for epoch in range(5):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(data)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

In this code, we create a simple linear model and some random data. As written, all computations will be performed on the CPU because we have not specified any device. If you were to use a GPU monitoring tool like `nvidia-smi` while running this code, you’d see very little activity despite the fact that the system has a GPU available. This is because `data`, `labels`, and the `model` are all allocated on the CPU by default.

**Example 2: Explicit GPU Usage (Correct)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Check for CUDA availability
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = SimpleModel().to(device) # Move model to GPU
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

data = torch.randn(100, 10).to(device) # Move data to GPU
labels = torch.randn(100, 2).to(device) # Move labels to GPU

for epoch in range(5):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(data)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Here, the crucial addition is the use of `device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")` to identify the device. Then, we send both the model and the training data to this device using `.to(device)`. With these changes, the majority of the calculations will happen on the GPU, resulting in a significantly faster training process, and you'll now see the GPU metrics showing activity on your monitoring tools.

**Example 3: Incorrect attempt at GPU usage**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Check for CUDA availability
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = SimpleModel().to(device) # Model is moved
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

data = torch.randn(100, 10) # Data still on CPU
labels = torch.randn(100, 2) # Labels still on CPU

for epoch in range(5):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(data) # Error - data is on CPU, model is on GPU
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels) # Error - labels are on CPU, loss function expects GPU
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This final example highlights the consequence of not moving all data to the GPU. You’ll likely encounter a runtime error in the forward propagation or loss calculation. The exact error messages might vary, but they'll center on data residing on different devices which is not allowed.

To summarize: if you intend to harness the power of a GPU for deep learning, you must explicitly allocate both the model *and* the tensors containing the data to that device. Merely having a GPU installed and recognized by the software isn't enough, and you'll mostly end up wasting resources with the computation happening on the CPU or causing errors with mismatched tensor devices. This requirement isn't arbitrary, it's how the underlying hardware is accessed and managed by the libraries we use.

For further reading on the topic, I highly suggest reviewing the official PyTorch and TensorFlow documentation pertaining to device allocation and GPU usage. Furthermore, “Deep Learning with Python” by François Chollet provides an excellent theoretical foundation, while “Programming Massively Parallel Processors” by David B. Kirk and Wen-mei W. Hwu offers a deep dive into the architecture of GPUs and how they're utilized for parallel computation. These resources will give you a robust understanding of the underlying principles of device usage, moving beyond the "does it work" to "why it works."
