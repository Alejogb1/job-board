 I've definitely been down this path before, particularly on a project where we needed to send out daily reports generated from complex database queries. The challenge with `wp_mail()` within a cron job, as you've hinted at, often stems from managing the dynamically changing data that should be included in the email's body, subject, or even recipient list. It’s not a case of simply plugging in static variables. We need a strategy to collect that data before the email is dispatched, and to ensure the context for that data is correct within the cron's environment.

The core problem lies in the fact that cron jobs execute independently of the typical WordPress request lifecycle. This means that variables, global state, and other information that might be readily accessible during a typical page load are not automatically available during cron execution. It’s essentially a separate process running with a bare minimum of WordPress initialization.

First off, let's clarify what "dynamic data" could encompass. It might be anything from query results, user details, calculated values based on the current date, or even data pulled from an external api. The key here is that this data is not predetermined at the time the cron schedule is defined. Therefore, we have to fetch or calculate the necessary information *within the context of the cron job*.

One common approach is to build the email content using standard php string manipulation and/or templating techniques, incorporating the dynamic data into the email before `wp_mail()` is called. This usually involves three core stages: fetching/calculating the data, formatting this data, and then passing it into `wp_mail()`.

Here’s an example illustrating this process, along with some of the gotchas:

```php
<?php
// This function is intended to be called from a WordPress cron job.

function my_daily_report_email() {
    // 1. Fetching Dynamic Data:
    global $wpdb; // access the WordPress database object safely.

    $yesterday = date('Y-m-d', strtotime('-1 day')); // Calculate yesterday's date.

    $query = $wpdb->prepare(
        "SELECT COUNT(*) AS user_count
         FROM {$wpdb->users}
         WHERE user_registered >= %s AND user_registered < %s",
        $yesterday . " 00:00:00",
        date('Y-m-d', strtotime('+1 day', strtotime($yesterday))). " 00:00:00"
    );
    $results = $wpdb->get_results($query);

    if (empty($results) || $results[0]->user_count === null) {
        $user_count = 0;
    } else {
        $user_count = $results[0]->user_count;
    }


    // 2. Formatting the Email Content:
    $subject = "Daily User Registration Report for " . $yesterday;
    $message = "Number of new users registered yesterday: " . $user_count . "\n\n";
    $message .= "This report was automatically generated.";


    // 3. Sending the Email using wp_mail():
    $to = 'admin@example.com';
    $headers = array('Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8');

    $mail_sent = wp_mail( $to, $subject, $message, $headers );

    if($mail_sent) {
        error_log("Daily report email successfully sent to: ".$to);
    } else {
       error_log("Error sending daily report email to: ".$to);
    }


}

// Hook this function to your cron schedule using wp_schedule_event(), for example.

// Example of how to hook to a cron event. This example assumes the cron event is already scheduled,
// For scheduling, please consult the wordpress developer documentation for 'wp_schedule_event' and 'wp_next_scheduled'
add_action( 'my_daily_report_event', 'my_daily_report_email' );
```

In this snippet, we are fetching the count of new users registered yesterday, formatting the output and then using the standard `wp_mail()` function. Notice the use of `$wpdb->prepare()` to prevent sql injection – always a good practice. We also check for empty results from the database query. This basic example shows the flow of collecting, formatting and then using the dynamically calculated data within the email sent by the cron job.

A slightly more advanced case may involve formatting the email as html. In such scenarios you may want to consider the following approach:

```php
<?php
function my_fancy_report_email() {
    global $wpdb;

    // Dynamic Data (similar to previous example, simplified here).
    $yesterday = date('Y-m-d', strtotime('-1 day'));
    $query = $wpdb->prepare("SELECT COUNT(*) AS user_count FROM {$wpdb->users} WHERE user_registered >= %s AND user_registered < %s",
    $yesterday . " 00:00:00",
    date('Y-m-d', strtotime('+1 day', strtotime($yesterday))). " 00:00:00");

    $results = $wpdb->get_results($query);
    $user_count = (empty($results) || $results[0]->user_count === null) ? 0 : $results[0]->user_count;

    // Generate HTML-formatted content
    $subject = "HTML Report for " . $yesterday;
    $message = '<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>' . $subject . '</title></head><body>';
    $message .= '<h1>Daily User Report</h1>';
    $message .= '<p>Number of new users registered on ' . $yesterday . ': <strong>' . $user_count . '</strong></p>';
    $message .= '<p><em>This report was automatically generated.</em></p>';
    $message .= '</body></html>';


    // Send email with HTML content
    $to = 'admin@example.com';
    $headers = array('Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8');
    $mail_sent = wp_mail( $to, $subject, $message, $headers );

    if($mail_sent) {
        error_log("Fancy report email successfully sent to: ".$to);
    } else {
       error_log("Error sending fancy report email to: ".$to);
    }
}


add_action( 'my_fancy_report_event', 'my_fancy_report_email' );
```

Notice the change in the header of the mail. We are now sending it as text/html instead of text/plain, enabling us to use basic html formatting. This allows for more complex styling and layout, but do keep in mind to keep the email html as clean as possible.

Finally, a more complex use case may include dynamically generating a table of data to include in the email. In this case, the code would look something like the following:

```php
<?php
function my_detailed_user_report() {
    global $wpdb;

    $yesterday = date('Y-m-d', strtotime('-1 day'));

    $query = $wpdb->prepare("SELECT user_login, user_email, user_registered
                            FROM {$wpdb->users}
                            WHERE user_registered >= %s AND user_registered < %s",
                            $yesterday . " 00:00:00",
                            date('Y-m-d', strtotime('+1 day', strtotime($yesterday))). " 00:00:00");

    $users = $wpdb->get_results($query);


    $subject = "Detailed User Report for " . $yesterday;
     $message = '<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>' . $subject . '</title><style>table { border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; } th, td { border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: left; } th { background-color: #f2f2f2; }</style></head><body>';
    $message .= '<h1>Daily User Registration Details</h1>';

    if (!empty($users)){
         $message .= '<table><thead><tr><th>Username</th><th>Email</th><th>Registration Date</th></tr></thead><tbody>';
            foreach ($users as $user) {
                $message .= "<tr><td>{$user->user_login}</td><td>{$user->user_email}</td><td>{$user->user_registered}</td></tr>";
        }
        $message .= '</tbody></table>';
    } else {
        $message .= '<p>No new users registered yesterday.</p>';
    }


    $message .= '<p><em>This report was automatically generated.</em></p>';
    $message .= '</body></html>';

     $to = 'admin@example.com';
    $headers = array('Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8');
    $mail_sent = wp_mail( $to, $subject, $message, $headers );

     if($mail_sent) {
         error_log("Detailed report email successfully sent to: ".$to);
     } else {
        error_log("Error sending detailed report email to: ".$to);
    }


}

add_action( 'my_detailed_report_event', 'my_detailed_user_report' );
```
Here, the key difference is the generation of a complete html table, including table formatting, from the dynamic dataset. We are looping through the database results to create the rows of the table, and the email recipient gets a structured view of the dataset.

For a deeper understanding of the concepts at play, I recommend focusing on solid texts on cron job management and WordPress internals. Look into "Understanding Linux Process Management and Scheduling" by Jim Mauro, which covers the cron fundamentals independent of WordPress. For wordpress specifics, examine "Professional WordPress" by Brad Williams and David Damstra to comprehend how WordPress hooks and its core functionalities are structured. The official WordPress Codex documentation for `wp_mail()` is also crucial to comprehend its limitations and required parameters. Finally, for working with HTML emails, W3C resources on HTML table structures and basic email client compatibility are invaluable.

The general approach of gathering data within the cron function and then using that to populate the email remains consistent. The level of complexity in the data or the formatting may vary, but the fundamental principle of collecting dynamic data and passing that into `wp_mail()` remains the same. Remember, proper error handling is vital, so always include checks for your database queries and `wp_mail`'s return value. This will help you troubleshoot and maintain your code.
