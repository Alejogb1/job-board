Alright, let's tackle this one. I recall a particularly tricky project back in '18 where we were fine-tuning a ResNet for a custom image classification task, and we ran into *exactly* this issue with resizing. It's not as straightforward as simply scaling images up or down. There’s a delicate interplay between input resolution, receptive field, and the inherent structure of convolutional networks, especially the skip connections of ResNets. When we resize, we’re essentially altering the information density and the spatial relationships the network has learned. This directly impacts performance, sometimes in surprisingly non-linear ways.

Let's break down why. Firstly, consider the convolutional layers themselves. They are designed to extract features at specific scales. Reducing an input image’s size dramatically compresses these feature scales, making the filters less effective. Imagine a filter designed to detect, say, a circular object of a certain size; if you shrink the image, that circle becomes much smaller, potentially to the point where the filter doesn't recognize it anymore. Conversely, significantly enlarging the image can lead to a loss of fine-grained details that are crucial for distinguishing certain classes.

Secondly, and this is crucial with ResNets, are the skip connections. The identity shortcut mappings that define the architecture work best when spatial alignments are kept relatively consistent. Drastic resizing can create mismatches between the feature maps, affecting the effectiveness of the skip connections that facilitate gradient flow and prevent vanishing gradient issues. While ResNet’s identity mappings are intended to preserve feature maps across blocks, resizing disrupts the spatial continuity and reduces these layers' optimal function.

For CIFAR-10, you are dealing with a relatively small input size to begin with (32x32). Resizing down would, in most cases, lead to disastrous results because you are destroying crucial information. However, resizing up, while it can initially improve performance due to a richer visual space, eventually reaches a point where over-interpolation or lack of genuine information hinders learning. The network, especially at the earlier convolutional stages, doesn't gain actual new details, just a smoothed and upscaled version of the originals, which can confuse it.

Now, let’s get to some code examples, using PyTorch as requested. Here’s a simplified setup to highlight the effects of different resizing options:

```python
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision.models import resnet18

# Setting up device, preferably cuda if available
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Original CIFAR-10 dataset using 32x32
transform_original = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
])

trainset_original = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform_original)
trainloader_original = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset_original, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
testset_original = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform_original)
testloader_original = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset_original, batch_size=64, shuffle=False)

# Resize transform for upscaling
transform_upscaled = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(size=64),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
])

trainset_upscaled = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform_upscaled)
trainloader_upscaled = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset_upscaled, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
testset_upscaled = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform_upscaled)
testloader_upscaled = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset_upscaled, batch_size=64, shuffle=False)


# ResNet model and setting optimizer
model_original = resnet18(pretrained=False, num_classes=10).to(device)
optimizer_original = optim.Adam(model_original.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()


# ResNet model and setting optimizer for upscaled dataset
model_upscaled = resnet18(pretrained=False, num_classes=10).to(device)
optimizer_upscaled = optim.Adam(model_upscaled.parameters(), lr=0.001)

def train_and_evaluate(model, train_loader, test_loader, optimizer, criterion, epochs=5):

  for epoch in range(epochs):
      model.train() # switch to training mode
      running_loss = 0.0
      for i, data in enumerate(train_loader, 0):
          inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)
          optimizer.zero_grad()
          outputs = model(inputs)
          loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
          loss.backward()
          optimizer.step()
          running_loss += loss.item()

      print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Training Loss: {running_loss/len(train_loader)}')

      model.eval() # switch to evaluation mode
      correct = 0
      total = 0
      with torch.no_grad():
          for data in test_loader:
              images, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)
              outputs = model(images)
              _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
              total += labels.size(0)
              correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

      print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Test Accuracy: {100 * correct / total} %')
  return model

# Training and evaluating models
print("Training Original Size Model:")
model_original = train_and_evaluate(model_original, trainloader_original, testloader_original, optimizer_original, criterion)
print("\nTraining Upscaled Size Model:")
model_upscaled = train_and_evaluate(model_upscaled, trainloader_upscaled, testloader_upscaled, optimizer_upscaled, criterion)
```

This code showcases training two ResNet models: one on the original 32x32 CIFAR-10 images and the other on upscaled 64x64 images. After running this, you will generally see that the upscaled images can achieve a better accuracy than original images. The specific improvement however varies on the specific hyperparameters and number of epochs, it is advised to increase epochs to observe the difference.

Now, while *upscaling* can provide a richer input, sometimes you need more robust data augmentation strategies. Using a technique called 'random resizing and cropping' during training gives the network a better chance at learning scale invariance.

Here’s how it would look in PyTorch:

```python
transform_random = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(size=32, scale=(0.8, 1.0), ratio=(0.75, 1.33)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
])


trainset_random = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform_random)
trainloader_random = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset_random, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
testset_original = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform_original)
testloader_original = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset_original, batch_size=64, shuffle=False)

model_random = resnet18(pretrained=False, num_classes=10).to(device)
optimizer_random = optim.Adam(model_random.parameters(), lr=0.001)

print("\nTraining With Random Resized Crop Model:")
model_random = train_and_evaluate(model_random, trainloader_random, testloader_original, optimizer_random, criterion)
```

Here, we introduced a `RandomResizedCrop`. The network is trained with randomly cropped and resized images of sizes ranging from 25.6 by 25.6 to 32 by 32, to avoid overfitting to any particular spatial arrangement. `scale` and `ratio` parameters are adjusted as needed. This random resize and crop transformation can significantly improve the robustness of your trained model.

Finally, let's consider a technique related to transfer learning, where you are not changing the input size to the pretrained model, but instead, using the pretrained weights to learn your classification task. In this case, the first convolutional layers of the network are trained on much bigger images such as ImageNet's input size 224 by 224. These filters are designed to identify complex structures which are more general and can work for lower resolution images. This approach is shown in the following code:

```python
# Model and optimizer with Pretrained weights
model_pretrained = resnet18(pretrained=True, num_classes=10).to(device)
# Freeze the layers to prevent over-training
for param in model_pretrained.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
# Add a new fully connected layer to the classifier.
num_ftrs = model_pretrained.fc.in_features
model_pretrained.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 10).to(device)
# Train only the new layers
optimizer_pretrained = optim.Adam(model_pretrained.fc.parameters(), lr=0.001)


print("\nTraining with Pretrained Model and frozen layers:")
model_pretrained = train_and_evaluate(model_pretrained, trainloader_original, testloader_original, optimizer_pretrained, criterion)
```

This example demonstrates the power of transfer learning using a pretrained resnet, and the performance often improves by significant amount, compared to random initialized weights in the original resnet shown previously, the reason being that the filters at early convolutional layer are trained to perform better.

In conclusion, resizing profoundly affects ResNet performance due to its impact on feature scales, filter effectiveness, spatial alignments, and skip connection utility. Simple upsampling or downsampling usually comes with trade offs. Data augmentation like random resizing and transfer learning can provide significant improvement. For anyone looking to delve deeper, I would recommend reviewing the original ResNet paper by He et al. ("Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition") which explains the architecture of ResNet in detailed manner, and also a deep dive into how convolutional filters actually work in "Image Processing for Computer Graphics and Vision" by Forsyth and Ponce. These resources provide a fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanics that impact these results.
