Alright, let’s tackle this. I’ve spent a fair bit of time on image analysis, particularly with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and this question about segmented versus whole image training brings back memories of a challenging project from my days at a biomedical imaging firm. We were working on cell morphology analysis, and the choice of training data format made a substantial difference. So, let’s unpack this from a practical standpoint.

The short answer is, yes, training a CNN with segmented images *can* yield significantly different accuracy and loss compared to training with whole images. However, the ‘significantly different’ part isn't a guarantee and depends heavily on the specifics of your task, the data, and the network architecture. The underlying reason is tied to how the network learns features and what it perceives as relevant.

When you train with whole images, the CNN learns to extract features from the entire visual field. This includes not only the region of interest but also the background and other contextual elements. The network must discern which parts of the image are important for the classification or regression task at hand. It’s a more holistic view and can, in some cases, lead to a model that generalizes better if your input data is likely to have varying backgrounds in real-world deployments. However, there's also a drawback: the network might be learning features based on the background rather than the actual target object, especially if there's a strong correlation between background and class labels (a common issue we faced).

Segmented images, on the other hand, present a focused view. By isolating the objects or regions of interest, we are effectively directing the network’s attention. This can lead to a model that is more accurate for detecting that specific feature, because the convolutional filters focus exclusively on the object. However, there are nuances. The network, when given a segmented image, doesn’t need to learn to differentiate the foreground from background; this is already taken care of. This reduction in complexity can lead to faster convergence during training and, potentially, higher accuracy, especially in complex scenarios where object location within the original image might vary considerably. One significant drawback with this method is that the model might lose sensitivity to context, which sometimes is crucial in classification.

Let’s illustrate with a few code examples to clarify the differences in practice using a simple scenario: classifying different types of fruit using keras (tensorflow backend). For brevity, I’ll provide just the essential training snippets.

**Example 1: Training with Whole Images**

This setup assumes you have a directory with subdirectories for each fruit type, containing whole images of fruit against varied backgrounds.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Image dimensions and batch size
img_height = 128
img_width = 128
batch_size = 32

# Data generator for whole images
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, validation_split=0.2)

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'path/to/whole_images_dataset',
    target_size=(img_height, img_width),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical',
    subset='training'
)

validation_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'path/to/whole_images_dataset',
    target_size=(img_height, img_width),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical',
    subset='validation'
)


# Simple CNN model
model_whole = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(img_height, img_width, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='relu'), # Adjust 10 to the number of classes
    Dense(train_generator.num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model_whole.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])


# Train the model
model_whole.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=train_generator.samples // batch_size,
    epochs=10, # Number of epochs
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    validation_steps=validation_generator.samples // batch_size
)

```

**Example 2: Training with Segmented Images**

This example assumes you have a directory structure where segmented fruit images are isolated (e.g., each fruit type has images with just the fruit on a transparent or uniform background).

```python
# Modified ImageDataGenerator for segmented images
train_datagen_segmented = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, validation_split=0.2)

train_generator_segmented = train_datagen_segmented.flow_from_directory(
    'path/to/segmented_images_dataset',
    target_size=(img_height, img_width),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical',
    subset='training'
)

validation_generator_segmented = train_datagen_segmented.flow_from_directory(
    'path/to/segmented_images_dataset',
    target_size=(img_height, img_width),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical',
     subset='validation'
)

# Same model architecture as the 'whole' model
model_segmented = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(img_height, img_width, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='relu'), # Adjust 10 to the number of classes
    Dense(train_generator_segmented.num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model_segmented.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])


# Train the model
model_segmented.fit(
    train_generator_segmented,
    steps_per_epoch=train_generator_segmented.samples // batch_size,
    epochs=10, # Number of epochs
    validation_data=validation_generator_segmented,
    validation_steps=validation_generator_segmented.samples // batch_size
)
```

**Example 3: Combined Approach (Pre-training then fine-tuning)**
Sometimes, the best approach is to use a hybrid method. Here, we initially train on segmented images to learn essential object-centric features, and then we fine-tune on the whole images. This can give you the best of both worlds, as it allows the model to first focus on the target object and then learn the context as well.

```python
# First, train on segmented images using the 'model_segmented' training loop as above.

# After training model_segmented, prepare for fine-tuning by re-training part of the network
# on whole images
for layer in model_segmented.layers[:-1]: # Freeze all layers except the final dense layers
    layer.trainable = False

# Now compile and retrain model_segmented with whole data
model_segmented.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_segmented.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=train_generator.samples // batch_size,
    epochs=5, # Adjust the number of epochs
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    validation_steps=validation_generator.samples // batch_size
)
```
I must emphasize that what you observe in practice will vary depending on the dataset, the task complexity and training parameters. I've observed cases where segmented images provided significant boost in accuracy while in other situations, training with whole images was better. It's crucial to evaluate the performance for your specific dataset using both approaches.

For more in-depth understanding of these concepts, I recommend examining the work of Ronneberger et al. on U-Net architecture for biomedical image segmentation; they explored similar ideas of using fully convolutional networks with carefully segmented data. Also, delve into "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville; it provides an excellent theoretical foundation for these methods. A paper worth reviewing is “ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks” by Krizhevsky et al., which explains the impact of data pre-processing and dataset quality on performance, even using whole images, emphasizing how crucial pre-processing is when working with neural networks. These resources should offer a stronger theoretical understanding of why these differences exist and help you make informed decisions in your projects.
