Alright, let's tackle this one. I recall a particularly challenging project back in 2014 where we were building a tablet-based interactive kiosk for a museum exhibit, and the client insisted on a more 'mouse-like' interaction than typical touch gestures allowed. The limitations of standard Android touch events for finer manipulation really became apparent then. So yes, a virtual cursor, or something mimicking that functionality, is absolutely achievable in an Adobe AIR Android application, though it requires a bit of work outside of AIR’s built-in features.

The crux of it lies in carefully intercepting touch events and then visually representing a cursor that mirrors those events, applying an offset, if needed, for better precision. Standard touch events in AIR report only contact points. We need to use those to drive the movement of a visual element, our ‘cursor,’ and then handle how that cursor's location triggers actions. It's essentially about simulating a mouse interaction over a touch interface. This also involved consideration of edge cases, such as multi-touch scenarios and fast gesture tracking. It's far more complex than simply capturing touch coordinates.

Here’s how I've approached this in the past and how I'd tackle it today. Essentially, you're looking at two main components: cursor visualization and event handling/dispatch.

* **Cursor Visualization:** This is conceptually the easier part. We need an object, usually a sprite or a similar display object, that will represent the cursor. This object needs to be positioned on the screen based on touch inputs. The display object can be anything from a simple circle to a more complex, icon-like graphic.

* **Event Handling:** This is where it gets more intricate. We need to intercept the `TouchEvent.TOUCH_MOVE` events (or potentially `TOUCH_BEGIN`, `TOUCH_END` if click-like behaviour is required) and, upon each movement, update the cursor's coordinates. This also requires careful consideration of touch smoothing, the ability to differentiate from multi-touch situations, and handling how the cursor's new location is translated into interactions with the rest of your application’s UI. Essentially you are re-dispatching your own "cursor" related events to the UI.

Let’s look at some code examples. These are in ActionScript 3, typical for AIR applications.

**Example 1: Simple Cursor Movement**

This snippet demonstrates the basic principle of moving a cursor display object with touch events.

```actionscript
package {
	import flash.display.Sprite;
	import flash.events.TouchEvent;

	public class CursorExample extends Sprite {

		private var cursor:Sprite;

		public function CursorExample() {
			cursor = new Sprite();
			cursor.graphics.beginFill(0xFF0000);
			cursor.graphics.drawCircle(0,0, 10);
			cursor.graphics.endFill();
			addChild(cursor);

			addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_MOVE, touchMoveHandler);
		}

		private function touchMoveHandler(event:TouchEvent):void {
			cursor.x = event.stageX;
			cursor.y = event.stageY;
		}
	}
}
```

In this example, a simple red circle serves as the cursor. Every time the user moves their finger on the screen, the `touchMoveHandler` is called. The cursor’s position is updated using `event.stageX` and `event.stageY`, representing the global coordinates of the touch point. Note, this very example would not account for multiple touch points or require more complex mouse emulation, it solely provides a basis for tracking movement.

**Example 2: Basic Event Dispatching**

This example shows how to re-dispatch a custom event based on cursor movement, enabling UI elements to react to the cursor's position:

```actionscript
package {
    import flash.display.Sprite;
	import flash.events.Event;
    import flash.events.TouchEvent;
    import flash.events.EventDispatcher;

    public class CursorDispatcher extends EventDispatcher {

        private var cursor:Sprite;

        public function CursorDispatcher() {
			super();

            cursor = new Sprite();
            cursor.graphics.beginFill(0x0000FF);
            cursor.graphics.drawCircle(0,0, 10);
            cursor.graphics.endFill();
            addChild(cursor);


			stage.addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_MOVE, touchMoveHandler);

        }

        private function touchMoveHandler(event:TouchEvent):void
        {
			cursor.x = event.stageX;
            cursor.y = event.stageY;

			dispatchEvent(new CursorEvent(CursorEvent.CURSOR_MOVE, cursor.x, cursor.y));
        }
    }
}

import flash.events.Event;

class CursorEvent extends Event {
	public static const CURSOR_MOVE:String = "cursorMove";
	public var cursorX:Number;
    public var cursorY:Number;

	public function CursorEvent(type:String, x:Number, y:Number, bubbles:Boolean = false, cancelable:Boolean = false) {
		super(type, bubbles, cancelable);
		this.cursorX = x;
        this.cursorY = y;
	}
}
```

Here, a `CursorEvent` is dispatched from the CursorDispatcher class upon each cursor movement. Listeners in other parts of your application can then act based on that event data. It's the beginning of enabling a custom cursor interaction model. Note the introduction of the `EventDispatcher`, which allows other objects to listen to cursor movement, and the custom `CursorEvent` class which allows for packaging both x and y coordinates when being dispatched.

**Example 3: Touch Smoothing and Multi-Touch Avoidance**

This example introduces touch smoothing and basic multi-touch avoidance, often critical for effective emulation:

```actionscript
package {
	import flash.display.Sprite;
	import flash.events.TouchEvent;
	import flash.events.Event;

	public class SmoothedCursor extends Sprite {

		private var cursor:Sprite;
		private var lastX:Number;
		private var lastY:Number;
		private var smoothingFactor:Number = 0.2;
		private var activeTouchId:int = -1;


		public function SmoothedCursor() {
			cursor = new Sprite();
			cursor.graphics.beginFill(0x00FF00);
			cursor.graphics.drawRect(-10,-10,20,20);
			cursor.graphics.endFill();
			addChild(cursor);

			addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_BEGIN, touchBeginHandler);
			addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_MOVE, touchMoveHandler);
			addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_END, touchEndHandler);

		}
	
		private function touchBeginHandler(event:TouchEvent):void {
			if (activeTouchId == -1) { // ignore multi touch if active
				activeTouchId = event.touchPointID;
				lastX = event.stageX;
				lastY = event.stageY;
				cursor.x = lastX;
				cursor.y = lastY;
			}
		}

		private function touchMoveHandler(event:TouchEvent):void {
			if (event.touchPointID == activeTouchId) {
				var targetX:Number = event.stageX;
				var targetY:Number = event.stageY;

				lastX += (targetX - lastX) * smoothingFactor;
				lastY += (targetY - lastY) * smoothingFactor;

				cursor.x = lastX;
				cursor.y = lastY;

				dispatchEvent(new CursorEvent(CursorEvent.CURSOR_MOVE, cursor.x, cursor.y));
			}
		}

		private function touchEndHandler(event:TouchEvent):void {
			if (event.touchPointID == activeTouchId) {
				activeTouchId = -1;
			}
		}

	}
}
import flash.events.Event;

class CursorEvent extends Event {
	public static const CURSOR_MOVE:String = "cursorMove";
	public var cursorX:Number;
    public var cursorY:Number;

	public function CursorEvent(type:String, x:Number, y:Number, bubbles:Boolean = false, cancelable:Boolean = false) {
		super(type, bubbles, cancelable);
		this.cursorX = x;
        this.cursorY = y;
	}
}
```

In this example, a smoothing factor is applied, and multi-touch is avoided by focusing on a single touch id until it is released. The cursor moves with an eased or dampened approach as it catches up to the touch coordinates. The concept of easing is applied here and makes the cursor feel less choppy. The activeTouchId ensures we are only tracking a single touch. We also re-dispatch the `CursorEvent` as in the previous example. Note: This is not full multi-touch handling; it handles single touch and ignores subsequent touch events for the cursor.

For deeper theoretical understanding and advanced techniques, you should explore resources on *Computational Geometry* specifically related to touch input interpretation, such as "Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications" by Mark de Berg et al., or the more practical "Programming Android" by Zigurd Mednieks et al., which goes into the basics of touch handling on Android. Additionally, research into smoothing algorithms and touch prediction methods can help refine these concepts further. The AIR documentation, while not entirely detailed about these concepts, will be essential in regards to the specifics of working with the Actionscript 3 APIs. Specifically, explore the documentation surrounding the `flash.events.TouchEvent` class and its associated constants.

In summary, a virtual cursor implementation in AIR for Android is absolutely achievable with a careful blend of touch event interception, display object manipulation, and custom event dispatch. There are numerous ways of expanding upon this basic concept, and your specific application needs will dictate how complex or simple you'll want the solution to be. These examples should provide a solid foundation for building your own more robust implementation.
