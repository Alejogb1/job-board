Let's tackle this. I’ve definitely seen that particular "container not known" error with buildah more times than I’d care to recall. It often surfaces when your build process, for whatever reason, doesn't quite track the containers it's spinning up internally, and it’s usually a symptom, not the root cause. This typically happens when buildah loses its grip on the intermediate container layers, specifically during a `buildah run` operation, or when the container ID or name reference you’re using in your script is not the one buildah expects at that specific moment. The frustrating part is that the error itself is a bit of a black box; it doesn’t precisely tell you *why* the container isn't known, just that it *isn't*.

Essentially, buildah maintains an internal state of all containers it has created and is currently managing. When you use `buildah run`, you’re essentially creating a temporary container based on the current image, performing commands inside that container, and then committing those changes back to a new image layer. If buildah's internal record keeping goes awry, either due to a script error, a previous failure, or even an environmental issue, this can cause the infamous “container not known” error to rear its ugly head.

Over the years, i've found that systematic debugging and a clear understanding of how buildah manages its containers are absolutely crucial to avoid and resolve these scenarios. It’s rare that it’s a genuine ‘bug’ in buildah itself; usually, it’s a logical error within the scripting or build process. So, let's explore some common scenarios and how to handle them.

**Scenario 1: Container Identifier Misuse**

One of the most common culprits is misusing or misunderstanding the container identifier, especially when scripts interact with the container being built multiple times. Buildah uses names (or automatically generated IDs, if no name is specified) to identify the containers. If you try to interact with a container that’s no longer available – possibly because of an accidental `buildah rm` (removal), or because a previous build stage failed and you tried to refer to a container from the previous failed run – you’ll get the “container not known” error.

Consider this simplified (and problematic) example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

image_name="my_app_image"
container_name="my_temp_container"

buildah from alpine:latest my_image
buildah run --name $container_name my_image sh -c "touch /testfile"

# Hypothetical failure at this stage
# buildah rm $container_name # Oops! let's remove our container

buildah run --name $container_name my_image sh -c "ls /testfile" # This will fail
buildah commit my_image $image_name

buildah rm $container_name
```

In this case, we are *explicitly* removing the container, but it also can be removed when a command fails due to a syntax issue, incorrect command arguments or other issues. Let’s fix that, shall we? The correct way is to make sure you're always referencing the correct current container and to avoid reusing the same name across separate steps.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

image_name="my_app_image"

buildah from alpine:latest my_image
container_id=$(buildah run --name my_temp_container my_image sh -c "touch /testfile" && buildah commit my_image my_temp_image | awk '{print $1}')

buildah run my_temp_image sh -c "ls /testfile"
buildah commit my_temp_image $image_name
buildah rm my_temp_container

```
*Note: I've replaced the named container with a `buildah commit` that then creates an image `my_temp_image` instead. By using the commit command we're ensuring we are creating a new image layer which is then used in the following run.*

This example uses commit to get a new image, meaning that the `buildah rm $container_name` call doesn't affect the rest of the operations, and we do not try to operate on a container that may not exist.
*Note also: It's a good practice to use a random or unique name for each container or image if the same script is run multiple times, which can be generated using, for example, `$RANDOM` or a timestamp.*

**Scenario 2: Incorrect Layer Management**

Another common area where issues arise is around how buildah manages layers. Each `buildah run` or `buildah commit` typically generates a new image layer. If the container ID used in a subsequent `buildah run` call is related to a different layer – an older, or sometimes removed one - that’s not the immediate parent of the image you’re attempting to operate on, buildah will understandably complain with “container not known”. You've to make sure you're working with the image or container you think you are, and that each operation is building off the previous step's output. This is why `buildah commit` and making a new image each step might be more convenient for some workflows that are prone to these types of issues.

Let's illustrate with another problematic example using an image name and forgetting that we need to work with the correct output from the previous command:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
image_name="my_app_image"

buildah from alpine:latest my_image

buildah run --name my_container my_image sh -c "echo 'Initial setup' > /setup.txt"
buildah commit my_container my_intermediate_image

buildah run --name my_container my_image sh -c "cat /setup.txt" # This will fail

buildah commit my_container $image_name
buildah rm my_container

```

Here, the second `buildah run` refers to the *original* image `my_image`, not the image generated by the previous step, causing a failure. We need to target the generated image, so let's make that fix:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
image_name="my_app_image"

buildah from alpine:latest my_image

buildah run --name my_container my_image sh -c "echo 'Initial setup' > /setup.txt"
intermediate_image=$(buildah commit my_container my_intermediate_image | awk '{print $1}')

buildah run --name my_new_container "$intermediate_image" sh -c "cat /setup.txt"

buildah commit my_new_container $image_name
buildah rm my_container my_new_container
buildah rmi my_intermediate_image
```

In the corrected script, we create the `my_intermediate_image`, and then use that image as the base for the new container named `my_new_container`. We then perform the commit operation, and remove all the intermediate containers and images.

**Scenario 3: Errors during the Run Command**

Sometimes the “container not known” error arises because of an unexpected exit or error *within* the `buildah run` command execution itself, particularly with complex shell commands or lengthy processing. When an operation inside the container fails due to errors in the command itself, the container might not be committed correctly, and buildah might not register it properly. When buildah does not commit, it effectively does a `buildah rm` to clean up, which, on a subsequent call can lead to the 'container not known' error.

Let’s have a look:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
image_name="my_app_image"

buildah from alpine:latest my_image

buildah run --name my_container my_image sh -c "apt update && apt install -y some_non_existent_package" #This will fail
buildah commit my_container my_image
```

In this case, the apt install will fail, and the error message will be output. But it can be easy to miss this as it doesn’t directly indicate the “container not known” issue, or not have the container named to a new temporary image. However, on subsequent runs of the same script, you might have issues as the `my_container` container is no longer around.

To correct this, always ensure that you're checking the exit codes of your shell commands inside `buildah run`, and use appropriate error handling. While a direct fix for the immediate error is beyond the scope of this response, ensure that your command exits correctly, and that the container state is as expected by building a new intermediate image instead of continuing with a previously used container name.

**Best Practices and Resources**

To really delve deeper, I highly recommend the following:

1.  **The official `buildah` documentation:** It’s the best starting point. While the man pages can be a bit dry, the upstream documentation has excellent, updated examples and explanations of the concepts.
2.  **"Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes" by Adrian Mouat:** This book, though focused on Docker, provides valuable insights into container fundamentals, image layering and overall container philosophy that transfers very well to buildah, helping you better understand the underpinnings of what’s happening.
3.  **"Linux Kernel Development" by Robert Love:** For a truly deep understanding of the low level workings of containers, while not directly related to `buildah` internals, understanding how Linux kernels work with namespaces and cgroups is invaluable when working with any containerization system.
4.  **Open Container Initiative (OCI) Specification:** While dense, understanding how container images work at the specification level is incredibly useful. While you may not need this most of the time, having a deep understanding of these is essential when debugging complex issues.

In my experience, tackling this particular issue boils down to meticulous planning of your build stages, clear naming conventions, careful tracking of container IDs, and solid error handling. While it’s annoying when it pops up, the “container not known” error is generally a fantastic debugging tool, forcing you to think about the specific steps that are occurring under the hood and the way you’re managing your images and containers within the buildah context. Keep an eye on the exit codes, layer structure, and make sure you’re always working with the containers and images you expect to work with, and this error should become far less frequent.
