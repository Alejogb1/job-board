Okay, let's tackle this. I’ve seen this exact scenario play out a few times, and it usually stems from a combination of timing, network configurations within docker, and how your application context is managed within the integration testing framework. Let’s dissect the problem step-by-step.

From my experience, the heart of the matter often lies in the network bridge created by Docker and how your tests interact with it. When you use testcontainers, it essentially spins up containers in their isolated docker networks. These networks aren’t inherently aware of each other. This means that your application's test container, which usually runs your spring boot app or similar, needs explicit instruction on how to connect to the postgres container launched by testcontainers.

The simplest, and perhaps most common, mistake is using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` within your application configuration files or connection strings to connect to the database. While this works perfectly fine when running outside docker, within a dockerized test environment, `localhost` within your application container refers to *its own* localhost, not the host machine, and definitely not the docker network of the postgres container. The postgres container operates on its isolated network, which makes direct `localhost` access impossible.

The second factor, often intertwined with the first, relates to the way spring boot and kafka listeners operate. A KafkaListener typically starts processing messages as soon as the application context is ready. However, your postgres container may not be fully initialized and available when your KafkaListener kicks in. This is particularly true if you haven’t properly managed container dependencies and start-up sequences within your test setup. If the listener tries to connect to the database before it’s reachable, you get connection refused errors, a common symptom of this problem.

Finally, your network configuration within testcontainers can also be an issue, but this is usually more apparent. Sometimes, misconfigured or explicitly named docker networks can cause subtle connectivity issues if your containers aren't on the same docker network, especially if you aren't utilizing explicit network configuration in your setup.

Let's illustrate these concepts with a bit of code.

**Snippet 1: The Incorrect Approach (Using `localhost`)**

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceProperties;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource;

import javax.sql.DataSource;

@Configuration
public class DatabaseConfig {

    @Value("${spring.datasource.url}")
    private String url;

    @Value("${spring.datasource.username}")
    private String username;

    @Value("${spring.datasource.password}")
    private String password;

    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource(DataSourceProperties properties) {
        DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();
        dataSource.setDriverClassName(properties.getDriverClassName());
        // This is the problem, this refers to the container's local host
        dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/testdb");
        dataSource.setUsername("testuser");
        dataSource.setPassword("testpass");
        return dataSource;
    }
}
```
This snippet shows a naive configuration. Directly using `localhost` won't work within a docker network.

**Snippet 2: The Correct Approach (Using Testcontainer host network)**
```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceProperties;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource;
import org.testcontainers.containers.PostgreSQLContainer;

import javax.sql.DataSource;

@Configuration
public class DatabaseConfig {

    @Value("${spring.datasource.url}")
    private String url;

    @Value("${spring.datasource.username}")
    private String username;

    @Value("${spring.datasource.password}")
    private String password;
    
    private static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>("postgres:15.3")
            .withDatabaseName("testdb")
            .withUsername("testuser")
            .withPassword("testpass");
    static {
        postgres.start();
    }
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource(DataSourceProperties properties) {
        DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();
        dataSource.setDriverClassName(properties.getDriverClassName());
        dataSource.setUrl(postgres.getJdbcUrl());
        dataSource.setUsername(postgres.getUsername());
        dataSource.setPassword(postgres.getPassword());
        return dataSource;
    }
}
```
Here, we use the `getJdbcUrl()` method from the `PostgreSQLContainer` to get the appropriate connection URL. This method returns an address on the docker network, directly addressable by other containers in the same network or utilizing docker's networking features. This helps containers connect to each other on the correct internal addresses.

**Snippet 3: Addressing KafkaListener Start-Up Timing**

```java
import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean;
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

@Component
public class MyKafkaListener {
    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext context;
    private AtomicBoolean isInitialized = new AtomicBoolean(false);
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
         isInitialized.set(true);
    }

    @KafkaListener(topics = "my-test-topic")
    public void listen(String message) {
        if(!isInitialized.get()){
            return;
        }
        // Proceed to access repository
    }
}

```
This example shows how to control the listener from executing until application context is fully initialized to avoid attempting to execute a database operation before the connection can be established. You may add further checks to verify the db connection is established before beginning consumption.

In practical test scenarios, you often use annotations in conjunction with testcontainer classes to start both the application container and the database container simultaneously and also set the system properties to pass in the database connection dynamically. This allows the test code to be completely unaware of the actual host and ports used for the containers. For example:

```java
@Testcontainers
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
public class MyIntegrationTest {
    @Container
    private static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>("postgres:15.3")
            .withDatabaseName("testdb")
            .withUsername("testuser")
            .withPassword("testpass");
    @DynamicPropertySource
    static void setDatasourceProperties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) {
        registry.add("spring.datasource.url", postgres::getJdbcUrl);
        registry.add("spring.datasource.username", postgres::getUsername);
        registry.add("spring.datasource.password", postgres::getPassword);
    }
    @Autowired
    private MyKafkaListener listener;
    @Test
    public void testKafkaListener(){
        //your test code here
        //this listener will only execute after application context has fully initialized
        //and database access is available.

    }
}

```

This structure with `@Testcontainers`, `@Container`, and `@DynamicPropertySource` lets spring boot inject the actual database parameters dynamically and at runtime when containers are initialized using the test framework. This avoids using hardcoded localhost addresses and manages dependencies between the two containers gracefully.

To deepen your understanding, I strongly suggest exploring "Test-Driven Development: By Example" by Kent Beck for principles on structuring tests. Also, familiarize yourself with "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch for best practices in Java development, which includes strategies for managing dependencies. The Testcontainers documentation is also invaluable for detailed information on how to manage container dependencies and network configurations correctly. Look for the documentation on `Network` object and the `withNetwork()` functionality.

In summary, the core reason why your repository might fail to connect to postgres in integration tests with testcontainers and KafkaListener often boils down to incorrect database connection settings and timing issues. Remember, the 'localhost' issue is the single most common root cause. By correctly using dynamic property injection and managing container initialization and listener execution, you can get your tests running smoothly and reliably.
