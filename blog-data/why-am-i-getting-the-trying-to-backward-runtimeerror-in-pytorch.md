Alright, let’s tackle this 'Trying to backward' RuntimeError in PyTorch. It’s a classic, and I’ve certainly seen it enough times to have a pretty solid understanding of its typical causes and solutions. Let me break it down from my experience, and then we'll get into some concrete code.

Essentially, this error arises when you attempt to compute gradients for a tensor that's not part of the computational graph, or has already had its computational graph detached or destroyed. Think of the computational graph as a directed acyclic graph tracking operations on tensors. During backpropagation (the `.backward()` call), pytorch traverses this graph backwards to compute gradients for all the tensors that require them. If a tensor isn't in this graph, or if the path back to it has been severed, the process breaks down and you get that dreaded 'Trying to backward' error.

My initial exposure to this error was back when I was working on a complex generative adversarial network (gan) project. We were optimizing both the generator and discriminator networks, and for a brief moment, I had inadvertently detached a tensor needed for backprop in the discriminator, using a `.detach()` method in the wrong place, which caused an absolute cascade of these errors during training. It was a head-scratcher until I methodically traced back through the tensor manipulations. It taught me a lot about the importance of explicitly understanding the graph and how your tensor operations affect it.

There are a few primary culprits for this specific error. The most common one, in my experience, involves improper use of `.detach()`, `.no_grad()`, or in-place tensor manipulations. Here’s why:

*   **`.detach()`:** Calling `.detach()` on a tensor creates a new tensor that shares the underlying data, but it’s explicitly *removed* from the computational graph. Any subsequent operations involving this detached tensor will not contribute to gradients. If you then try to call `.backward()` on a loss computed using this detached tensor, you're in for a runtime error.

*   **`torch.no_grad()`:** This context manager, when used, tells pytorch not to track operations or build a computational graph. If you compute a loss within a `with torch.no_grad():` block, it won't have a graph associated with it, and any subsequent `.backward()` on it will trigger the error. It’s often used for inference or evaluation but not during training when gradient calculation is essential.

*   **In-place operations:** Operations such as `tensor.add_(value)` or `tensor[index] = value` modify the original tensor directly. While convenient, they can sometimes create issues with the graph, as the history of the tensor is effectively overwritten, which means that the backwards pass will fail if these operations are relied on for gradients. Using their non in-place counterparts, like `tensor = tensor + value`, creates a new tensor with an associated history.

Now, let's illustrate with code. Here's example one, showcasing the detached tensor issue:

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 3
z = y.detach() # detached from the graph
loss = z**2
try:
    loss.backward() # this line causes the error
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Caught RuntimeError: {e}")

print("Continuing")
```

In the above snippet, `z` is explicitly detached. When we compute the `loss` using `z` and try to call `loss.backward()`, pytorch complains because there is no path backwards from the loss to `x`. This is a common mistake, particularly when manipulating intermediate results in a multi-stage pipeline.

Let's move on to example two, addressing the `torch.no_grad()` issue:

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 3
with torch.no_grad():
    z = y * 2 #no grad computed here
loss = z**2 #loss computed without a graph
try:
    loss.backward()
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Caught RuntimeError: {e}")
print("Continuing")
```

Here, the tensor `z` is created within the scope of `torch.no_grad()`. Therefore, it lacks a computational graph. This means we can’t backprop through the loss calculated from this tensor. The error highlights the restriction imposed by `torch.no_grad()`, meant to conserve memory and processing power when backpropagation is not needed.

Finally, let's examine a case involving an in-place operation:

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 3
y.add_(1)  #in-place operation
loss = y**2
try:
    loss.backward()
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Caught RuntimeError: {e}")

print("Continuing")
```

In this example, we modify `y` using an in-place operation (`add_`), effectively discarding its original history in the graph. When you compute the `loss` and attempt to call backward, the graph has been modified in a manner that the backpropagation process cannot continue back to `x`. This demonstrates how subtle in-place changes can lead to this error.

As for resolving these issues, several practices have proven effective throughout my development career:

1.  **Careful `detach()` usage:** Ensure you’re only detaching tensors when you truly intend to, usually for things like evaluating pre-trained models or performing visualization. If you're unsure if you need to detach, I would err on the side of not detaching.
2.  **`torch.no_grad()` awareness:** Utilize `torch.no_grad()` only for inference or operations that absolutely don’t require gradient tracking. Double-check your training loops carefully to avoid unintended consequences with this context manager.
3.  **Avoid in-place operations during gradient computation:** Where possible, use the non-in-place counterparts of tensor operations when computing losses or intermediate values in a neural network. This ensures that the graph is maintained correctly for backpropagation.
4.  **Debugging with print statements:** When you encounter the error, I found that printing tensors at each step with their `.requires_grad` property can very quickly point out where the graph is being broken.
5.  **Graph visualization (advanced):** For more complex situations, you might find tools like `torchviz` helpful for visualizing the computational graph to pinpoint where a tensor is being disconnected. While it's more of a learning tool than a practical one for large models, it can greatly aid in gaining a better understanding.

For deepening your understanding, I recommend the official PyTorch documentation, especially the sections on autograd and tensor operations. Additionally, “Deep Learning with PyTorch” by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann is a good source for comprehensive insights. Furthermore, research papers such as the original "Automatic Differentiation in Machine Learning: A Survey" by Griewank and Walther can give you a foundational perspective on autograd mechanics. And "Efficient Backprop" by Yann LeCun (along with his other papers) can offer a more theoretical understanding of the backpropagation process itself. These resources provide a solid foundation for navigating the intricacies of PyTorch's autograd and prevent you from getting tripped up by this error.

In essence, the 'Trying to backward' error typically indicates an issue with how the computational graph has been manipulated, often stemming from improper uses of `.detach()`, `torch.no_grad()`, or in-place tensor modifications. Identifying the specific point where the graph is being broken is essential for rectifying the issue and ensuring that backpropagation works correctly.
