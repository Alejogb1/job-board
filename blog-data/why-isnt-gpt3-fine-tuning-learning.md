Let's unpack this. Having spent a fair amount of time wrestling with similar issues during a large language model (llm) deployment project a couple of years back, I can offer some practical insights into why fine-tuning, particularly with models like gpt-3, might not always yield the expected results. It’s not usually a single, easily-diagnosed issue, but rather a confluence of factors that can collectively hinder the learning process.

One of the common pitfalls, in my experience, stems from insufficient or inappropriate data. We often think throwing a mass of information at a model will magically make it smarter. That’s rarely the case. What I saw quite often was a mismatch between the fine-tuning dataset and the desired outcome. For instance, if you're aiming for gpt-3 to generate summaries of technical documents in a specific field, a generic dataset of news articles or social media posts simply won't cut it. The model may, at best, produce superficial or semantically incoherent results; at worst, it could exhibit what we call ‘catastrophic forgetting’, losing some of the general linguistic knowledge it initially possessed. Essentially, the model learns to mimic the *structure* of the training data, but not necessarily the underlying *meaning* or task specificity.

To illustrate this, consider a scenario where we have two datasets. The first, `dataset_1`, contains a set of examples intended to make the model generate technical explanations, while the second, `dataset_2`, has conversational data. Here’s how such datasets might be structured in a simplistic python example, using the format typically used for fine-tuning:

```python
dataset_1 = [
    {"prompt": "Explain the concept of backpropagation in neural networks.", "completion": "Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used to train artificial neural networks. It calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network's weights, allowing for adjustments to minimize errors."},
    {"prompt": "Describe the function of an activation function in a deep learning model.", "completion": "Activation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks, enabling them to learn complex relationships in data. Without them, neural networks would essentially be linear regression models."}
]

dataset_2 = [
    {"prompt": "How was your day?", "completion": "My day was fine, thank you for asking."},
    {"prompt": "What's the weather like?", "completion": "I'm sorry, I don't have access to real-time weather information."}
]

```

Now, if you haphazardly combine these datasets, the model is not going to learn to generate good technical explanations, nor is it going to be a very helpful conversational partner. The prompt-completion pairs need to be congruent with the specific task. This is the crux of effective fine-tuning.

Another significant issue is the learning rate and hyperparameter configuration. The default settings provided by many APIs might not be optimal for your specific task and dataset. I’ve seen cases where using a learning rate that's too high leads to instability in the training process – the model’s loss starts bouncing around rather than steadily decreasing. It may then plateau or even diverge. On the other hand, a learning rate that is too low can result in frustratingly slow learning, leading to the feeling that the model simply isn’t improving at all. Finding the “sweet spot” usually requires experimentation.

Here’s a hypothetical code representation of how a library's default fine-tuning settings might look, and how they can be overridden. It’s not specific to any library but serves to illustrate the concept:

```python
class FineTuningSettings:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.001, batch_size=32, epochs=3):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.epochs = epochs

    def update_setting(self, setting_name, new_value):
      setattr(self,setting_name,new_value)

# Default settings (hypothetical)
default_settings = FineTuningSettings()
print(f"Default learning rate: {default_settings.learning_rate}")

# Custom settings – a higher learning rate and a smaller batch size
custom_settings = FineTuningSettings(learning_rate=0.0001, batch_size=16,epochs=5)
print(f"Custom learning rate: {custom_settings.learning_rate}")


# Updating a setting
custom_settings.update_setting('epochs', 10)
print(f"Updated custom epoch count: {custom_settings.epochs}")

```

This highlights the need for the developer to understand that these configurations need adjustments based on experimental observations, instead of depending on generic settings. A higher learning rate and a larger batch size may be adequate for a smaller dataset, but on a larger dataset with more diverse prompt-completion pairs, the batch size might need to be smaller and the learning rate needs to be reduced, to avoid oscillations in the model's parameters during training.

Finally, and this is perhaps the most subtle point, is the inherent limitation of the fine-tuning approach itself. Fine-tuning takes a pre-trained model and nudges it in a particular direction. It’s not a training-from-scratch scenario. The extent to which the model can learn is constrained by its initial architecture and the pre-training data. If the task fundamentally requires concepts or relationships not present in the pre-trained model's knowledge base, fine-tuning may not bridge that gap effectively. To illustrate this, let's assume we want to fine-tune the model to perform a very specific task such as calculating integrals of certain equations. The model, by virtue of its training on natural language might be unable to learn this mathematical skill, regardless of the dataset used for fine-tuning.

This is better illustrated with an example where an llm is fine-tuned on a list of programming questions, but the task requires it to learn how to generate complex code that includes loops and conditionals.

```python
programming_questions_dataset = [
    {"prompt": "Write a function to print the first 10 integers.", "completion": "Here's a function that does that:\n\n```python\ndef print_integers():\n  for i in range(10):\n    print(i)\nprint_integers()```"},
    {"prompt": "Create a function to add two numbers.", "completion": "```python\ndef add(a, b):\n  return a + b\n```"}
    ]

```

While the model can mimic the generation of such functions, it might not be able to independently generate a function that loops based on some external factor or does complex conditional operations, unless it was sufficiently trained to do so. This is a limitation of the fine-tuning process itself.

In summary, the reasons for apparent "non-learning" during fine-tuning are multifaceted. Insufficiently specific training data, poorly configured hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size, and the inherent limitations of the fine-tuning process itself are all factors that can negatively affect the process. To improve performance, one must prioritize high-quality, relevant datasets, carefully tuning hyperparameters through experimentation, and having a clear understanding of the fundamental limitations of the fine-tuning method.

For anyone looking to go deeper, I would recommend exploring “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. It provides the necessary mathematical and theoretical foundation. Additionally, the original gpt-3 paper, “Language Models are Few-Shot Learners” is a helpful resource to understand the general model's capabilities and limitations. Furthermore, research papers on ‘transfer learning’ and ‘catastrophic forgetting’ offer useful insights into the challenges associated with fine-tuning large models. Remember, it's not always about the "firepower" of the model, but how well we prepare the ground for it to learn effectively.
