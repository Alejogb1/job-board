Alright,  I remember vividly wrestling with this exact issue back in my early days building a custom image processing pipeline for a geospatial analysis project. We had a massive directory of aerial photographs, all in .jpeg format, and the initial script just stubbornly refused to acknowledge their existence. The frustration was palpable, but it ultimately led to a deeper understanding of the common pitfalls in file handling, specifically when dealing with variations in file extensions and operating system nuances. Let me break down the common reasons your code might be experiencing this and then we can delve into some practical code examples to illustrate the points.

The first, and arguably most frequent, culprit is simple case sensitivity. Many operating systems, particularly those based on Unix-like kernels (Linux, macOS), treat file extensions with different capitalization as distinct files. So, `image.jpeg` is not the same as `image.JPEG` or `image.Jpg`. My personal experience has shown that it’s not uncommon to receive or generate files with mixed casing, especially when dealing with data from diverse sources. When your code is explicitly looking for '.jpeg', but encounters '.JPEG' or '.JPG', it simply won’t find those images. This is a common oversight and often requires a quick check against the source files to verify the exact extension casing.

Another frequent reason relates to how files are handled by the operating system’s file system and the programming environment you're using. When specifying file paths in your code, it is crucial to understand whether your system uses forward slashes ( `/` ) or backslashes ( `\` ) for directory separators. For instance, Windows uses backslashes while Unix-based systems use forward slashes. An inconsistency here can cause path resolution to fail. Also, if the file is relative to the directory the script is running from, the working directory needs to be considered. Sometimes, the current working directory isn't exactly where you believe your script is looking. I had a junior colleague get bogged down by this for a few hours once. It turned out his script was launched from a different location than the directory the images were located in.

Finally, hidden files or variations in file extensions can also cause issues. While a file may visually appear as `image.jpeg`, operating systems can tack on hidden attributes or extra characters which your file handling logic might not account for. This isn’t as frequent, but it can happen, especially when dealing with legacy files or external file systems. Sometimes it involves encoding issues, though it's less of an issue with the jpeg format directly and more with other text-based file formats like csv or json that could be mixed with image files in the target directory.

Let's move on to some code examples to demonstrate how to tackle these problems practically. I’ll use Python for the examples as it's highly versatile and fairly ubiquitous in data science and general automation.

**Example 1: Case-Insensitive Matching and Path Handling**

This snippet shows how to search for '.jpeg' images with different casings and proper path construction.

```python
import os

def find_jpeg_images(directory):
    jpeg_files = []
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.lower().endswith(('.jpeg', '.jpg')):
            full_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
            jpeg_files.append(full_path)
    return jpeg_files

# Example usage:
image_dir = "path/to/your/image/directory"  # Replace with your actual path
found_images = find_jpeg_images(image_dir)

if found_images:
    print("Found JPEG images:")
    for image in found_images:
        print(image)
else:
    print("No JPEG images found in the directory.")
```

Here, `os.listdir()` retrieves all the files and directories within the specified path. The `.lower()` function converts the filename to lowercase ensuring that the extension check is case-insensitive. We check for both `.jpeg` and `.jpg` because `.jpg` is also a standard extension for JPEG images. The use of `os.path.join()` ensures correct path construction, regardless of the operating system.

**Example 2: Explicit Path Specification and Current Working Directory Awareness**

This example demonstrates how to explicitly check the current working directory and verify that files are being found.

```python
import os

def find_jpeg_with_full_path(file_path):
    if os.path.isfile(file_path):
        if file_path.lower().endswith(('.jpeg', '.jpg')):
            return file_path
    return None

# Example Usage
target_file = "image.JPEG"
current_directory = os.getcwd()
full_path = os.path.join(current_directory, target_file)
print(f"Current working directory: {current_directory}")

if find_jpeg_with_full_path(full_path):
    print(f"Found image at : {full_path}")
else:
    print(f"Couldn't find image at: {full_path}")
```

This example uses the `os.getcwd()` to determine the current working directory of the Python script. It takes a fully resolved path to check if a specific file exists and has the expected case-insensitive extension. This function is useful for debugging scenarios where a relative path isn’t being resolved as intended and shows explicit path construction.

**Example 3: Filtering by File Type using a library like `glob`**

This example shows using the `glob` library as an alternative method to identify image files, which allows pattern matching.

```python
import glob
import os

def find_jpeg_images_glob(directory):
    pattern = os.path.join(directory, "*.{jpeg,jpg,JPEG,JPG}")
    jpeg_files = glob.glob(pattern)
    return jpeg_files

# Example usage:
image_dir = "path/to/your/image/directory" # Replace this with the real path
found_images = find_jpeg_images_glob(image_dir)

if found_images:
    print("Found JPEG images using glob:")
    for image in found_images:
        print(image)
else:
    print("No JPEG images found in the directory using glob.")

```

Here, `glob.glob()` uses a Unix-style pattern matching syntax, allowing us to find all files matching the pattern with various file extension casing. This method offers a more direct approach when dealing with filename pattern matching and is often more succinct than manually iterating through the file system if this is all that is needed.

For more in-depth study, I'd recommend exploring the official Python documentation on the `os` and `glob` modules. Also, the classic "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" by W. Richard Stevens is a fantastic resource for understanding how operating systems manage file systems. Another invaluable resource is the "File System Implementation" section in "Operating System Concepts" by Abraham Silberschatz, which provides a broader theoretical overview of file systems.

In summary, when you're having trouble finding your .jpeg images, it's almost always related to casing issues, pathing issues, or the current working directory. Through the methods outlined above, you can diagnose and resolve those problems effectively. Remember, being precise with path and filename handling is key to smooth software operation. Good luck and happy coding!
